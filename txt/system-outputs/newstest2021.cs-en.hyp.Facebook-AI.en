Novák helped Trabzonspor to second place, Škoda also hit the target
Defender Filip Novák helped Trabzonspor to the vice-championship title with a goal in the last round of the Turkish football league.
His side won 2-1 at Kayserispor to keep third-placed Besiktas at bay.
After his transfer from Slavia in January, striker Milan Škoda scored his tenth goal for Rizespor, which saved itself even though it lost 1:3 to Fenerbahce.
Novák confirmed his excellent productivity for a defender with his seventh goal in this league season.
In the 63rd minute, the goalkeeper of Kayserispor just launched a fierce shot and the Czech footballer hit the ball into the net from an angle.
The home side managed to equalise with five minutes to go, but Trabzonspor snatched victory in the sixth minute of stoppage time when they successfully completed a four-on-one break.
Škoda in the beginning of the second half of the match with Fenerbahce equalized after a solo at 1:1.
Although Rizespor did not hold the tie for a long time, it did not have to regret it, because thanks to the results of its rivals, it remained three points above the relegation zone.
The competition will end with a Sunday duel of the champion Basaksehir on the Kasimpasa pitch.
The well-hidden Cave of the Hermit in the woods near Nový Bor was in fact not habitable
In the north of Bohemia, in the foothills of the Lusatian Mountains, not far from Nový Bor in Českolipsko, in the forests through which the Count's Road ran, there are several sandstone rock formations.
Both natural and artificially created.
And we will go after the man-made one.
The place is called the Cave of the Hermit.
In reality, however, no hermit ever lived here and the cave served as a shelter, or more precisely a shelter chamber, probably for grain.
The cave is carved into the side of a rocky promontory and is accessible by stairs from above.
At the same time, it is practically invisible until the last moment.
It is only revealed by the narrow steps leading to a kind of rock gallery, from where you first enter the rock.
Although the chamber appears to be a considerable distance from human habitation, at the time of its construction there may have been fields on the plateau, where there is now forest.
"The fact that the building does not have a window and there is no fireplace in the traditional place clearly proves that no hermit could ever survive the winter here," explains historian Kamil Podroužek from the Faculty of Arts of Jan Evangelista Purkyně in Ústí nad Labem.
The one-room building has only a stone bench at the back, which is probably used for storing containers.
"I see it as a chamber for storing some food or products from the field," adds Kamil Podroužek.
Tool marks can be seen on the walls of the cave.
Breaking off the sandstone with a pickaxe was quite simple and quick for the initiated.
It was enough to make appropriate use of the joints and gradually break off the sandstone.
According to the length of the track left by the pickaxe and the method of cutting in general, it is possible to determine the period of formation of the cave.
According to the historian, it is probably the end of the 18th century.
The cave is freely accessible and, judging by the mess that appears in it, someone occasionally sleeps there these days.
If you approach the cave from above from one of the forest paths and you are interested in the stream flowing under the cave and the nearby count's path, then you will definitely find the path down.
And on the way out of the forest, you may still be captivated by the nearby Raven Rocks.
Jockey Minařík is in an induced coma after a heavy fall in Germany
"Filip is now in the best of hands.
The institute is equipped for such cases, and fortunately we have a part of our family in Hanover.
This makes the situation much easier for me and also the care of my daughter Finja," news server Jezdci.cz quoted Minařík's wife Katja as saying.
"Everyone is doing their best, Filip now needs time to recover.
There is no point in making any predictions.
Anyone who has ever encountered the issue of head trauma and patients in artificial sleep knows that the situation can change.
Filip is a great fighter.
We all have to be patient now and give him time," said the wife of the 45-year-old jockey.
The star Frankie Dettori, who won the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes for the seventh time at Ascot on Saturday, equalling the legend of Lester Piggott, also called for financial support for the injured Minarik on Twitter.
As of today, almost 70 thousand euros have been raised on the Gofundme server.
The goal is 100 thousand euros (2.6 million crowns).
The video assistant referee took away four goals from Sassuolo, they lost 0:2
The Sassuolo players got the ball into the opponent's goal four times in Saturday's match in Naples, but in the end they had to accept a 2-0 defeat.
Neither of their goals was disallowed for offside by the referee after consulting the video.
According to the Italian media, this is a record adversity of the technology, so many interventions have never been thwarted by VAR to one team.
"VAR was tougher on Sassuolo than roadside radar and punished them like no team has ever been punished before.
The new technology breaks records," wrote Gazzetta dello Sport in a commentary.
"A festival of disallowed goals by Sassuolo.
Never before has VAR been so strict on one team," added the Corriere dello Sport.
Napoli took the lead in the 8th minute on Saturday, but after half an hour of play it seemed that Sassuolo had equalized.
However, Filip Djuricic's goal was disallowed for offside after the intervention of the video assistant referee.
For the same reason, Djuricic's next shot, as well as those of Francesco Caputo and Domenico Berardi, were also ruled out.
On the other hand, the home team added one more goal.
Electric vehicles are reporting a new record.
The highest number of recharges in history in the Czech Republic
"The growth was driven both by a 30 percent increase in the number of stations in our network and the trend of more frequent charging at public stations, as well as by the accelerated development of registrations of new e-cars," said Tomáš Chmelík, Head of the Clean Technologies Department at ČEZ.
Other major players, such as PRE and E.ON, the electric car manufacturer Tesla, as well as the supermarkets Billa and Lidl, are also claiming their share of the market.
The operators of conventional petrol stations are represented by the company MOL.
But it does not yet have the numbers.
"We started building our network for electromobility only last year," explained company spokeswoman Jana Jusková.
However, the editorial staff of Deník exclusively obtained data from all 216 electric stands operated by ČEZ.
They show that drivers took an average of 13.5 kWh from the stations.
This corresponds to a range of around one hundred kilometres for a smaller electric car.
Leaving aside minor drawdowns of up to 1 kWh, the average charging time is two and a half hours.
The vast majority of refueling then took place in the free tariff.
If motorists had already paid for the subscription, their typical spend was around 330 crowns.
Electromobility is particularly popular in the capital.
All five of ČEZ's busiest charging stations are located in Prague, and their popularity eclipses that of entire regional cities.
Olomouc is the leader among the regions.
On the other hand, there is the least interest in remote stations in the border area, for example in Bohumín or Prachatice, which often remain unused throughout the day.
More than four thousand electric cars are currently registered in the Czech Republic.
In the first half of this year alone, 1274 new e-cars were added.
In an extensive poll by the daily "Czechs on the Move," eight percent of readers said they were considering buying an electric car for their family.
However, only a third of respondents know where to find the nearest charging station in their area.
Not only for better water retention.
Environmental activists protested in Prague
According to the organizers, the steps taken so far by the government in terms of protecting and restoring the Czech landscape and addressing the climate crisis are insufficient, and the speakers called on the state to take a more vigorous approach.
The event, called The Last Drop, was attended by representatives of large organisations such as the Rainbow Movement, Greenpeace and the Green Party, as well as smaller local associations.
"For example, we have people who have been speaking out against the expansion of the Turów mine for a long time, there are people who are speaking out against the extraction of gravel at Uherské Ostroh, there are people who are speaking out against the construction of senseless dams," said Marika Volfová on behalf of the organizers.
She said that the main demands of the protesters are the creation of a plan for water retention in the landscape, a radical change in agricultural policy and the system of subsidies towards the promotion of sustainable agriculture and the fastest possible transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.
"The government is supposed to defend the interests of the people, not a ruthless and devastating business," she said.
A stand with a petition calling on the representatives of the Czech state to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and restore the Czech soil and landscape was placed on the Lesser Town Square.
The people present were equipped with banners with slogans such as "The end of the rape depression" or "Less coal, more newts."
Jan Škoda from the association For Water for People, which is protesting against the plan to mine gravel in the Hodonín region, has come to Prague from southern Moravia.
"It threatens the source of drinking water for 140,000 people," he said.
He added that boreholes represent the fifth most abundant source of drinking water in the Czech Republic.
According to him, the planned extraction of gravel is located only about 500 meters from the wells and, according to assessments, it is certain that the quality of the water will be compromised.
Vojtěch Veselý came from the village of Valeč in the Karlovy Vary region to represent the so-called agroecological farmers.
He drew attention to the advantages of small farms that do not chase yields and profits and supply the population directly on the spot.
"Small agro-ecological farms are able to feed the entire population in a completely normal way, on top of which they do not cause such damage to the appearance of the countryside and the environment," he said.
Three killed as plane crashes into house in Germany
Three people died and two others were injured today when an ultralight aircraft crashed into an apartment building in western Germany.
This was reported by the local rescue services, according to which two crew members and one resident of the house are probably among the dead.
The plane crashed on the roof of a building in the town of Wesel in North Rhine-Westphalia.
The attic apartment, which was one of five residential units in the building, subsequently caught fire.
Firefighters have already managed to bring the flames under control.
The deputy chief of the local fire brigade, Robert Meyboom, said that both crew members of the aircraft had apparently died.
The third victim is a woman who lived in the house, according to police.
The Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ) newspaper, citing the mayor of Wesel, reported that the woman was a single mother whose two-year-old daughter was rescued from the apartment with minor injuries.
An emergency parachute was found in the vicinity of the accident, which probably served as a brake during landing.
Police are working on the assumption that it came from the crashed plane.
There was room for two people in the aircraft.
The plane took off from the airport in the nearby town of Marl.
The Rheinische Post newspaper, citing eyewitnesses, reported that the plane had collided with a hot air balloon before crashing.
However, this information has not yet been confirmed.
WAZ, citing other witnesses, wrote that the plane broke up in the air before hitting the ground.
On Saturday, Česká spořitelna erroneously charged some card payments twice.
It has already corrected the error
Česká spořitelna erroneously charged its clients twice for some card payments on Saturday afternoon.
According to the bank's spokesman, Lukas Kropik, the problem could have affected thousands of transactions.
The savings bank has already rectified the error and returned the money to the clients.
The savings bank noticed problems with the double charging of card payments on Saturday afternoon.
"Yesterday (Saturday) night, we updated the system and all these duplicate payments were immediately returned to the clients.
At the moment everything is working without any problems," said Kropík on Sunday afternoon.
A spokesman for the bank does not know the exact number of clients to whom the bank deducted money from card payments twice; according to his estimate, there were fewer than a thousand transactions.
The savings bank is investigating the causes of the problems.
"It could have been a combination of several factors," Kropík said.
Česká spořitelna is the largest bank in the Czech Republic in terms of the number of clients.
At the end of March, it had 4.6 million.
The owner of the savings bank is the Austrian financial group Erste Group Bank, which is a key player in the banking market of Central and Eastern Europe.
Vojtěch will present a system of three emergency levels against the coronavirus on Monday
"They will be graded according to the strength of community spread at the regional level.
We are working on it together with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics," Vojtěch told Czech Television.
It will be a so-called traffic light, individual regions will be marked with green, orange or red according to the risk of coronavirus.
The minister added that he would discuss the classification of individual regions with epidemiologists.
He admitted that currently only the Moravian-Silesian Region would have an orange color and Prague would be close to it.
The map will also include individual measures for regional hygiene stations, hospitals, social facilities and employers.
"We want to solve this at the level of the regions, because the situation there is not uniform," Vojtěch said.
The Water Sprite and Caroline
When the water sprite Jonáš and the miller's daughter Karolínka fall in love with each other, it is not easy at all.
Jonas is prevented from falling in love by his father, the grumpy water sprite Hastrbuch, while Caroline has no idea that her beloved Jonas is not human.
Fortunately, there is a young man, Libor, who will do everything in his power to protect the whole village, and especially Karolína, from the villain of Vodnice.
What does it matter if he schemes and lies?
Especially if he can get Karolína to reject Jonáš in favour of him, the valiant Libor.
Soon it becomes clear to everyone in the village who is to blame for the drowning of the night watchman Konvička, the spoiled flour, the fire in the mill and other villainy.
The angry villagers organize a hunt for the water sprite, and on top of that an implacable water sprite curse falls on Jonah's head.
And now, Konvička's little soul, advise Karolína!
How to soften old Hastrbuch, to convince the neighbors of Jonah's innocence, to find Jonah and free him from the spell?
The fairy tale was filmed in September 2010 in the Czech Television studios and on location at the Brzina pond, in Obděnice in the Sedlčany region and in the beautiful surroundings of the historic mill in Hoslovice.

The course of the disease of the majority is mild, only three percent of those infected have to go to the hospital
Either a milder form of the coronavirus is spreading through the Czech Republic, or our summer dose of sunshine has significantly improved our immunity.
Infectious disease wards in hospitals are half-empty, even though the number of infected people is on the rise.
"The situation today and in April is completely different and this is mainly due to the number of people hospitalized," confirms the Minister of Health Adam Vojtěch.
It is worth recalling that on April 11, when the first wave of the epidemic peaked in our country, everyone wore masks, the army carried out the sampling, the republic was closed and the Czechs consumed disinfectant for a year in advance.
In spite of this, ten people died every day.
Now the daily increases in the number of infections are higher, but at most two people die every day with covid-19.
Karviná still has the highest number of infected people per capita, and Jihlava already has similar numbers due to an outbreak in the local Alzheimer's centre, where there are already 57 infected people - 40 clients and 17 employees.
Another home for the elderly was closed by sanitary inspectors in Černožice in Hradec Králové.
The disease was confirmed by tests on one of the nurses.
"We are tracing, we have restricted movement, we have all the hygienic measures," says the director of the retirement home, Martin Scháněl.
According to him, none of the clients of the home have symptoms of the disease so far.
The hygienists will begin to carry out comprehensive testing tomorrow and will then decide on further measures.
Hospitals are also responding to the increased number of infected people.
The Institute of Oncology in Brno today launched an automatic camera system at the entrance, which detects whether people are wearing a mask when they enter.
The record is reported by the South Bohemian hygienists, who have recorded twenty-five cases of coronavirus - most of them are foreign employees of the Prachatice company.
A total of 131 people were infected on Saturday - half of the number on Friday - but fewer tests are carried out at the weekend.
Debutant to champion!
Van den Bergh completes fairytale, sweeps aside Anderson
The big surprise of the tournament, Dimitri van den Bergh, also showed an excellent performance against the player who won the second most prestigious event in the PDC in 2018.
The beginning of the match was evenly balanced on both sides, the turning point came at 8:7 for the Belgian darts player.
Van den Bergh took the break with a 13-dart leg and had the upper hand from then on.
He literally crushed his opponent with his game and the significantly more experienced "Flying Scotsman" had a hard time getting to the doubles.
The way the "Dream Maker" had him in the palm of his hand is evidenced by the fact that the distracted Anderson played his first maximum only in the 24th leg.
On top of that, the young Belgian handled the high checkouts perfectly.
The last time he lost was in the eleventh leg, but under unfavorable conditions he "caught a big fish" and closed 170.
At the end of the match, Anderson was visibly frustrated.
Rather, he just threw the darts and his opponent, who was going for the triumph, behaved in an absolutely masterful manner.
Van den Bergh converted the first of three match darts and lived up to his name - he wrote his big dream.
Winning the trophy named after Phil Taylor is all the more valuable for the Belgian darts player as it is his first major win.
It remains true that the last player who managed to beat van den Bergh is Karel Sedláček.
Charges dropped in Nantes cathedral fire, man confesses
The Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul in the heart of Nantes caught fire last Saturday, severely damaging the original 16th century stained glass windows and destroying the organ.
Investigators investigated the suspicion of arson due to the fact that the fire advanced through the temple from three different places.
At the same time, the police found no signs at the entrances that anyone had forced their way into the cathedral.
The accused is a volunteer with the local diocese, a 39-year-old Rwandan refugee.
Police arrested him shortly after the fire, but then released him without pursuing criminal charges.
Now the prosecutor's office has reported that, on the basis of new evidence, the man was arrested again on Saturday, confessed and is facing charges of arson.
If found guilty, he faces up to ten years in prison and a hefty fine.
According to his lawyer, the man regrets the act and has decided to fully cooperate with the investigators, Le Monde wrote.
Vojtěch: On Monday we will present a "traffic light" for epidemiological measures
The new system is intended to fulfil the role of a pandemic plan, the absence of which has led to criticism of the government and the Ministry of Health.
"The levels will be according to the strength of community spread," the minister explained.
He added that at present, for example, the Moravian-Silesian Region or Prague would reach the middle, orange level.
The system is designed as a regional one, because the situation in individual regions varies significantly, he added.
The ministry worked with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (IHIS) on the system.
According to the minister, specific measures will be linked to the individual levels, whether it is the obligation to wear masks or the organization of special departments in hospitals.
Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) called for the creation of an epidemiological plan in the Prima Partie television programme, according to which people should have clear information about what measures they can expect if the epidemiological situation worsens.
The daily increase in confirmed cases in the Czech Republic has been growing in recent days, although the number of people hospitalized remains low.
Vojtěch commented that nothing major was happening and that it was not appropriate to talk about declaring a state of emergency or reconvening the crisis management team.
In view of the growing number of infected people, the government has reintroduced the obligation to wear masks at indoor events of more than 100 people throughout the Czech Republic from Saturday.
From Monday, the capacity of these events will be limited to 500 people, now it is 1000 people.
The government's approach, where it was not clear until the last minute what measures and when they would come into force or when they would be announced, was criticised.
"I think that in a situation that is quite tense, the main actors should, on the contrary, create a sense of security and, on the contrary, straighten out the confusion," Senator Marek Hilšer said in Questions.
The measures can already vary according to the region, for example, in Prague from Sunday it is mandatory to wear masks even in non-residential medical facilities, for example in pharmacies or in doctor's waiting rooms.
The obligation to wear masks when visiting health and social care facilities or pharmacies has also been introduced in the Liberec and Ústí regions since Friday.
In the Vysočina region in the Jihlava region, it has been necessary to wear masks in indoor public spaces, on public transport and in healthcare facilities since 14 July.
On the other hand, anti-epidemic measures have been relaxed in the Moravian-Silesian Region, as well as in the Central Bohemian Region in the Kutná Hora region.
At the beginning of June, the Czech government also approved the so-called traffic light for Europe, which distinguishes the level of risk of infection in individual European countries and accordingly adjusts the rules applicable to entry into the Czech Republic from these countries.
For countries with a low and medium risk, the authorities have not required Czech citizens to test negative for the coronavirus since 15 June or have not ordered quarantine instead.
These are mandatory for the return of Czechs from high-risk countries.
At the moment, all EU member states are now in the low risk category.
The techno party in the Benešov region continues.
Playing at a third of its capacity, it was due to finish at noon
Hlaváčkova Lhota (Benešov region) The techno party at Hlaváčkova Lhota in the Benešov region continues on Sunday evening.
A third of the original 12 music systems are still playing.
According to the evening estimates of the police, about 500 people remain here after 20:00, the original rough estimates spoke of three hundred, in the morning there were 900, said police spokeswoman Lucie Nováková.
Originally, the techno party was supposed to end at noon on Sunday, at which time some of the music systems did indeed go silent.
"Some have already left and others are preparing to leave.
Part of the musical production is still ongoing.
We expect that the music systems will gradually be disconnected and dismantled," Nováková said.
"Police officers are still consistently checking departing visitors in order to prevent drivers under the influence of alcohol or addictive substances from driving.
Drivers have the option of taking a precautionary breath test before setting off," she added.
Dozens of riot police officers are supervising the event, foreign police, traffic police and riot police are on the scene, and dog handlers with service dogs are also on standby.
"During the course of today, police officers checked 470 people moving around the venue of the event and 485 vehicles, 270 drivers were subjected to a breath test, of which six got behind the wheel under the influence of alcohol," Nováková said.
A total of 95 drivers were tested by the police for the presence of narcotic and psychotropic substances, of which one was positive.
Officers also dealt with 14 traffic offences.
At the request of the participants of the techno party, the police carried out 300 preventive breath tests and four preventive tests for the presence of narcotic and psychotropic substances.
About 2,000 people were at the event on Saturday morning.
If the number of participants did not decrease, the police would intervene there.
This was said by the Minister of the Interior Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) in the Prima Partie television programme.
However, the number of participants fell below 1,000, so the police assessed that there was no need for intervention, nor was it requested by the sanitary station or the Ministry of Health.
Czech Television (CT) reported on Sunday that the techno parties had spread to surrounding properties whose owners did not agree to their use for the techno parties.
It is possible that the owners of the surrounding land will demand compensation for damages.
The techno fans arrived at the meadow near Hlavackova Lhota on Friday evening.
The police initially guarded a meadow in Blažim in the Benešov region on Friday, where the techno party was held last year.
Blažim is located about 30 kilometers from Hlavackova Lhota, where the technicians finally arrived.
According to Nováková, no one came to Blažim.
Viper bite: Little girl ends up in hospital!
"The first case this year was recorded in the region of Zeleznorud.
A girl, born in 2010, was bitten on the leg by an adder there, and her parents took her to the local rescue service base themselves," regional spokeswoman for the emergency medical service, Mária Svobodová, told the daily, adding that the child was then taken to a hospital in Klatovy.
The adder is the only venomous snake in the Czech Republic and it is in the Bohemian Forest that these animals are found in higher numbers, so it is good to be careful when walking.
However, there is no great danger from these animals.
The chance that the viper will bite you is not very high, it is afraid of itself during normal contact.
And if she has the space to do so, she likes to crawl away with a loud hiss.
It will only attack if it feels very threatened - for example, if you accidentally step on it.
However, even its bite is not a tragedy, its venom is very effective against small mammals, but it does not kill people.
This can only happen if a person has a particularly weakened organism or suffers from an allergy.
The risk of danger is therefore primarily for children, the elderly and allergy sufferers.
"After being bitten, a person often feels nauseous, sweats, has an elevated temperature, thirst, abdominal pain and diarrhea, and in weakened individuals and especially allergy sufferers, anaphylactic shock can occur," Miriam Gredová from the Klatovy Hospital described for Deník.
The man threatened to throw the infant out of the window.
He poured wine and threw dishes at the policewoman
After 11 p.m., an intervention unit entered the apartment and detained the man.
The infants were immediately taken into the care of medical staff, regional police spokeswoman Markéta Janovská said in a press release.
The man did not want to cooperate with the police, he threw dishes, knives at the police negotiator or poured wine on her from the window.
He amplified his threats several times during the negotiations by leaning out of the window with the child in his arms.
On one occasion he even climbed onto the window sill himself, where he staggered.
Police are continuing to investigate the man.
He does not want to disclose any further information yet.
Stosur opts for daughter over tennis season
Australian tennis player Samantha Stosur will not take part in the season affected by the coronavirus this year.
The 36-year-old 2011 US Open champion, who became a mother in June, does not want to end her career just yet.
She plans to return to the courts next year and believes that thanks to her family and daughter, she will enjoy tennis even more than before.
Stosur announced on social media two weeks ago that her partner Liz Astling had given birth to a daughter, Genevieve, in mid-June.
"I'm going to stay at home, spend time with my family, be there for all the little milestones that our Evie will experience over the next six months and just enjoy it," the former world number one in doubles said on the website of the Australian federation.
The WTA Tour will resume its season, which has been suspended since March, on August 3 with a clay tournament in Palermo.
Sapa market: Raid reveals meat, fish and eggs of unknown origin
"One of the vehicles entering the premises was transporting 1,320 pieces of quail eggs of unknown origin, and in unsuitable conditions.
These eggs will also be disposed of at the rendering plant," the State Veterinary Administration said.
During the inspection of the stall with live fish, it was found that the seller did not have documents on the origin of the goods and was not registered for the sale of live fish.
The market has long been considered problematic from a veterinary point of view.
For example, last autumn, veterinarians discovered an illegal food store, which contained almost half a ton of unmarked food without documents of origin.
It was not possible to determine the expiration date for most of them, and some of the products had expired and were spoiled.
In the case of five kilograms of cuttlefish, the expiration date was exceeded by three years.
Last May, veterinarians and police officers seized 80 kilograms of food without proof of origin in the market area, including dried fish, squid and frozen ducks, some of which were moldy.
Putin calls Zelensky before start of ceasefire in Donbass, Kremlin criticizes planned elections
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke on the phone with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky about the situation in Donbass, where a new ceasefire is due to come into effect at midnight.
According to a Kremlin statement, Putin, among other things, criticized the decision of the Ukrainian parliament to hold local elections; Kiev reported that Zelensky called for the release of detained Ukrainians.
A new ceasefire was agreed on Wednesday evening by negotiators from Ukraine and Russia with the support of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
The ceasefire is to begin after midnight on Monday night, is to be "complete and general" and is to pave the way for the fulfilment of other provisions of the peace agreements.
Putin told Zelensky in an interview that the decision of the Ukrainian parliament to hold local elections contradicts the Minsk peace agreement and threatens the prospects for settling the conflict in eastern Ukraine.
Last week, the Ukrainian parliament decided that the upcoming local elections would not be held in the territories controlled by pro-Russian rebels.
The Minsk agreement envisages that Kiev will regain control of the border of the Ukrainian territories occupied by separatists with Russia after granting broad autonomy to these regions and holding local elections there.
According to the Unian agency, Zelensky's office said that the two statesmen agreed on the benefits of the upcoming ceasefire in Donbass and on the need to carry out other measures to promote peace in the region, such as demining the areas of fighting or withdrawing part of the troops from the front.
Zelensky also called on Putin to release Ukrainians detained in the east of Ukraine, in the occupied Crimean peninsula and in Russia itself.
The Minsk agreement has helped to stop the fighting, but people continue to die on both sides of the front line in occasional gun battles and artillery attacks.
The conflict in Donbass has claimed more than 14,000 lives since the spring of 2014.
Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of providing military support to the separatists, which Moscow denies.
Zelensky has made ending the war in Donbass a priority, but so far there has been no major breakthrough in the negotiations.
Rykl is the unexpected champion in the decathlon, Novotná has dominated the heptathlon
Dolezal, the defender of the last two titles, did not finish the 400m at the end of Saturday's program, and Kopecký did not jump the pole vault on Sunday.
The decathlon was dominated for a long time by Latvian representative Reinis Kregers, who is preparing in the group of coach Josef Karas, but he withdrew after the discus.
Rykl had two bronze medals from the outdoor championship of the Czech Republic so far, this time he was the only decathlete who got over the seven-thousand mark.
Other medals behind him were won by Vilém Stráský and Petr Urbánek.
After the competition, Rykl mentioned the absence of Adam Sebastian Helcelet and Jiří Sýkora.
"It's a pity that the boys weren't here and Kope didn't start, because then the results would have looked completely different.
But the title tastes very good, I especially appreciate the fact that I got a personal best by 30 centimeters in the distance.
Then I was pleased with the pole and the most disappointing was probably the discus, where I was below average," he acknowledged on the union's Facebook page.
On the first day of the heptathlon, Kateřina Cachová won by more than a hundred points, even though she was suffering from an injured ankle on her springboard leg.
In the long-distance sector, however, she recorded only 570 cm, did not throw the javelin 40 meters and did not enter the final eight hundred meters.
Novotná collected 5878 points and won by 241 points ahead of Kateřina Dvořáková.
She was particularly successful in the long jump, with 631 cm being the best Czech performance of the year.
"I really wanted it to be around 630.
Yesterday my calf started to pull, but I am very glad that I did not feel it at all and that it did not limit me at all," Novotná said on the union's Facebook page.
Bio LPG has arrived in the Czech Republic, promising an environmentally friendly operation
Liquefied petroleum gas, or LPG for short, is a very well-known alternative fuel in the Czech Republic.
It is particularly popular for its fundamentally lower price compared to petrol or diesel, given the significantly lower excise duty, but its benefit is also in the lower CO2 emissions per kilometre travelled.
Like petrol and diesel, it also has its environmentally friendly variant - "bio LPG."
However, it is quite new - it first appeared on the European market two years ago and, according to a press release from the Czech LPG Association, it arrived in the Czech Republic a few days ago.
"These days we have received the first fifteen tonnes of bio LPG, which will be mixed with conventional fossil LPG and distributed to our filling stations," the association quotes Jiří Karlík from Primagas as saying.
Bio LPG, however, cannot be taken as bioethanol or biodiesel.
According to the association, it is chemically identical to the classic petroleum LPG that many motorists are currently filling their cars with.
Therefore, it is also possible to mix both versions at will.
"The only difference compared to conventional LPG is the method of production," says Ivan Indráček, chairman of the association, about bio LPG.
This is also one of the great advantages of bio LPG compared to other alternative fuels.
It is easy to transport and store, and the distribution infrastructure is also quite good, compared to hydrogen or electricity, for example.
Currently, this gas is obtained as a by-product of the production of bioethanol from food scraps and sugar cane.
In the future, it should also be produced in a targeted manner, for example from cellulosic biomass, i.e. from wood waste.
In contrast, conventional petroleum LPG is produced partly as a by-product of oil refining and partly by separation during the extraction of natural gas.
As a result, depending on the production technology and the source, running a car on bio LPG is 40-70% more environmentally friendly in terms of carbon footprint than running on petroleum LPG and up to 90% compared to diesel.
However, it is not about CO2 emissions from the car's exhaust, but about the ecology of fuel production, i.e. the so-called "well-to-tank" part.
Petrochemical companies Eni, Total and Neste are currently among the largest producers of bio LPG.
According to a recent update of the National Action Plan for Clean Mobility (NAP CM), Unipetrol is also exploring the possibility of production at its Litvínov refinery.
According to the association's estimates, there are about 170 thousand LPG vehicles in the Czech Republic; the Ministry of the Environment states a slightly higher number, about 200 thousand, in the NAP ČM.
According to statistics from the Ministry of Transport, almost 6 thousand conversions of cars to LPG were carried out last year alone.
It is possible to refuel with LPG in the Czech Republic at about 950 stations of various operators.
Vojtěch revised the number of infected, the number fell by 1775 cases
Czech Health Minister Adam Vojtěch (for ANO) has ordered the ministry to revise the number of people infected with the coronavirus.
The new statistics were published by the Ministry of Health on its website on Sunday.
The number of cases fell from 5,254 on Saturday to 3,479 on Sunday afternoon, a decrease of 1,775 cases.
At present, there are 3422 patients in the Czech Republic.
"The jump in the number of people cured is due to the revision of data, which health officials have not been able to update recently," said the head of health statistics, Jaroslav Dušek.
By Sunday afternoon, 15,212 people in the Czech Republic had been infected with the coronavirus, 11,419 had recovered and 371 had unfortunately succumbed to the Covid-19 disease.
Mobile polling units or postal voting.
A political scientist and a sociologist looked for options for the time of the pandemic
According to Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior Jan Hamáček (ČSSD), a change in the law is needed to allow people in quarantine due to the coronavirus to vote in the October regional and senate elections.
Parliament could debate it in August or September on a fast-track basis.
He said this on Sunday in the Prima TV game show.
On Tuesday, he wants to discuss possible solutions with representatives of parliamentary parties at the ministry.
"Whatever we do, it will have to mean a change in the electoral law," Hamáček said.
On Wednesday, the Senate called on the government to find a solution within the framework of the applicable legal rules.
However, the minister said that it will be necessary to amend the provisions of the law, according to which people in quarantine due to their health condition cannot vote.
The ban on voting should remain in place, for example, for patients with open tuberculosis.
Daniel Prokop said on the OVM programme that the possibility of postal voting has been postponed since 2004.
Even the current bill, which is in the Chamber of Deputies, then provides for its introduction for voting abroad, but not in the Czech Republic.
At the same time, Prokop considers the concerns of ANO or ČSSD (because, according to experience from abroad, it would rather play into the hands of other types of parties) about the postal vote to be overestimated.
Personally, he is against the possibility of electronic voting, where there is a significant possibility of abuse.
Michal Klíma said that it is now necessary to devise ad hoc mechanisms (elections) that could be carried out this year and with the least possible health risk.
He considers the main thing to be to be ready for 2021, when parliamentary elections are to be held in the Czech Republic.
He considers the correspondence option (whether only abroad or also in the Czech Republic) to be one of the functional methods.
They see the aforementioned electoral units or the possibility of proxy voting within the family as the next step.
He added that there is an opportunity to learn how similar situations - "elections in the time of coronavirus" - were dealt with in Croatia, Poland or France.
Various types of elections in 67 countries around the world have already been postponed this year due to the spread of the coronavirus.
Protests in Buhari: Pig's ears thrown by demonstrators at government building
Participants in a demonstration against Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov and his cabinet have thrown pigs' ears at the government building.
It was the latest in a series of protests against the "mafia style of governance" that have been taking place in Sofia and other cities for almost three weeks.
Organizers are planning a nationwide blockade on Wednesday, the DPA news agency reported.
Today's protest, which took place for the 18th day in a row, had a weaker turnout than the previous one, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.
About 300 people had gathered by 8 p.m., and some streets had to be closed to traffic.
Demonstrators in front of the government building staged a theatrical scene in which they symbolically locked up Prime Minister Borissov and Prosecutor General Ivan Geshev in a prison cell in connection with the arrest of two advisers to President Rumen Radev, who is a strong political opponent of the Prime Minister.
The resignation of both is one of the basic demands of the protesters.
They also demanded the cancellation of the announced health care reform and an end to corruption in construction on the Black Sea coast.
Protest organizer Nikolai Hadzhigenov said on public radio today that a "peak of escalation" is being prepared for Wednesday in the form of a "nationwide demonstration in Sofia and blockades throughout the country."
He reiterated the demand for the resignation of Borisov and his government, as well as the calling of early elections.
The regular ones should take place in March 2021.
Borisov has previously stated that he does not intend to resign.
He justified this, among other things, by the need to lead Bulgaria through the covid-19 pandemic and the resulting economic crisis.
On Friday, however, he replaced five members of his government team, although the concession did not appease the demonstrators.
Earlier this week, Borisov's government survived a vote of confidence in parliament.
Bologna coach Mihajlovic does not want any more games without spectators
Bologna football coach Sinisa Mihajlovic has had enough of Italian league matches without spectators.
The Serbian coach hopes that the fans will return to the stadiums from the new season.
"What we are doing here at the moment is not football.
I am fed up with games without spectators.
It is a sexless football, it does not bring me any emotion, any joy.
The games are worse than the training.
It's terrible to play like that and I think I'm not the only one who thinks so," said Mihajlovic ahead of today's game against Lecce.
After the coronavirus break, the Serie A matches follow in quick succession, and although they are played in the evening, their players are exposed to the heat.
"We play every three days in terrible heat.
In such conditions you can't even tell how the teams are doing.
I just want this season to end.
These measures had to be taken in order to finish the competition, but I hope that the fans will be back from September," said the coach, who has also managed Fiorentina and AC Milan in the past.
For Mihajlovic, this season is also unusual because he missed four months on the bench due to treatment for leukemia.
"Despite my illness, the suspension of the league and everything else, we managed to take our team to the next level.
We want to continue to grow and to do that we need the players to be mentally stronger," he said.
We have become the target of a cyber attack by foreign states, says Iran
Since the end of June, fires and explosions have been reported from a number of Iranian military, industrial and nuclear facilities, as well as oil refineries, power plants, factories and businesses.
Some Iranian officials have said that cyber sabotage may have caused the fire that broke out this month at the underground nuclear facility in Natanz.
The cause of a number of other incidents has not yet been explained.
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi told reporters, according to Iranian media, that the Islamic Republic's infrastructure faces "thousands of cyber attacks" on a daily basis.
He added that this is not a new phenomenon and that most of them will be repelled.
In recent months, according to Mousavi, several large-scale cyber attacks have been recorded, which, according to analyses, were carried out by "certain governments and groups."
However, he did not provide further details about the possible perpetrators, according to Reuters.
Mousavi also added that fires in forests, refineries and other places are frequent in the summer.
An article by Iran's state-run IRNA news agency this month suggested that Iran's enemies, such as Israel and the United States, may have been behind the recent incidents.
However, none of these countries were directly accused of specific attacks in the article.
Iran and the United States broke off diplomatic relations shortly after the 1979 revolution, when Iranian militant students stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.
Long-strained relations between the two countries escalated in 2018 after Washington withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers and imposed sanctions on Iran that have had a harsh impact on its economy.
Another major escalation came this year after the US military killed Iranian General Qasem Soleimani and Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis on January 3.
Iran then fired a number of missiles at bases in Iraq, where the Americans operate, on 8 January.
It was only later that the US admitted that dozens of American soldiers had been injured.
Israel considers Iran to be its arch-enemy, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a leading opponent of the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran.
According to the Israeli prime minister, Iran is trying to develop an atomic bomb, which Iran denies.
Car manufacturer TPCA has extended its production shutdown, now until 25 May
The Cologne-based car manufacturer Toyota Peugeot Citroën Automobile (TPCA) has once again extended its production shutdown due to the coronavirus.
The production lines are expected to restart on the morning of Monday 25 May.
The launch will be accompanied by dozens of hygienic measures, said Tomáš Paroubek, a spokesman for the car manufacturer.
Production has been halted since the evening of 18 March due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Originally, the company intended to resume it on Monday, May 18.
According to Paroubek, the reason for the extension of the shutdown is the closed borders and closed dealerships, so there is no one to sell cars.
According to Paroubek, the company will be producing at 100 percent from the start, i.e. in two shifts.
The company's key markets, such as Italy, the United Kingdom and Spain, have been affected by the coronavirus.
Mayor Michael Kašpar (Change for Kolín) said that the shutdown of production at TPCA does not affect life in the city.
"At the beginning it was noticeable, the city was empty.
But gradually the streets are filling up, especially now since Monday, when things have eased up a lot.
So the city is full," said Kaspar.
According to him, there are no complications with the foreign workers who stayed in the residential hotels.
"In these two months, we have hardly had to deal with any problems," said Kašpar.
For example, Škoda Auto in Mladá Boleslav, which also suspended production due to the coronavirus crisis, resumed production on Monday 27 April at all three of its production plants in the Czech Republic.
None of the plants are operating at 100 percent capacity.
The resumption of production at Škoda was accompanied by more than 80 hygiene measures.
In the night from Monday to Tuesday, the third, i.e. night shift, took place in Mladá Boleslav and Kvasiny for the first time after the resumption of production.
TPCA currently employs around 2,500 people and the company is one of the largest exporters in the Czech Republic and also an employer in the Kolín region.
Cancer killed the bride shortly after the wedding: She left a note to her family
Gemma Sisson had been battling cancer for more than two years, and just when it seemed she had beaten it, the disease struck again.
The 39-year-old, who loved bodybuilding, eventually ended up in a hospice bed, where she was still able to marry the love of her life.
Unfortunately, she succumbed to the disease.
A few hours after her death, a shocking message appeared on her Facebook account for those closest to her.
Gemma Sisson, from Leeds, England, loved bodybuilding.
With her boyfriend Ricky Moore, with whom she lived for more than 16 years, they traveled to competitions held all over the world.
The 39-year-old woman played sports and lived a healthy life, but was diagnosed with cancer in April 2018.
Gemma began gruelling treatment, radiotherapy, in the hope that she would recover.
After months of treatment, it seemed that Gemma had beaten the cancer, but in August 2019, the cancer returned and this time it attacked her spine.
According to the British newspaper the Daily Mirror, the bodybuilder and personal trainer underwent a ten-hour operation on her spine and then began drastic treatment again.
But it was all in vain.
Earlier this year, on her 39th birthday, doctors told her she had a few months to live.
In April, the pretty blonde finally decided to join a hospice in Leeds, where she was constantly visited by her family, who even arranged a wedding for her with her love Ricky.
The marriage lasted two months.
The last time Ricky took Gemma to a restaurant was on their two-month anniversary.
Four days later, Gemma died in his arms.
Just a few hours after her death, a post Gema had written for her family appeared on her social media account.
"If this has been published, it means that I have finally died after weeks of fighting for too long.
Although I will be heartbroken to leave my loved ones behind, I will be so glad to be rid of what this terrible disease has done to me.
I can't thank Ricky enough for being by my side the whole time and giving me an enormous amount of love and support during that terrible time," she wrote on the social network, adding that the pain and suffering had finally stopped and she had found peace.
"I am also grateful for all the support I have received from all my followers on the social network," she wrote, adding that everyone should appreciate their life and live it to the fullest.
Art vending machines sell a sweat dating site, a mushroom amulet and a memory game
For a hundred crowns, a passer-by will get a pocket-sized work by mostly novice Czech artists.
They create pictures and other work directly for artmat, so they know in advance that they have to fit into a size of 8.5 by 5.5 centimeters.
Each piece is numbered and signed.
"In the package there is always a curatorial text about the artist and then the work itself," said Petra Widžová, the curator of the project.
Artmat works with the principle of chance.
The buyer can thus be surprised by what kind of work of art he will get.
Currently, he can become the new owner of the fantastic illustrations by Alexandra Štoplová or the mini-views by Tereza Bonaventura, which can also be sent.
The artist Punx 23, in cooperation with Dora Dutková, has prepared a memory game connected with a walk through Prague.
The cards need to be paired with house signs.
Ilona Polanski has created a collection of tattoos for Artmat.
Marie Ladrová and Juliána Chomová sell pocket packs of spirituality: the first of the artists offers a protective amulet made of tinder and fortune-telling cards, the second a series of illustrations based on her comic strip Spiritistky.
Salaries in the health sector will increase by a maximum of five percent next year.
According to Vojtěch, a larger increase is unrealistic
Salaries in the health sector could increase by a maximum of five percent next year, said the Minister of Health Adam Vojtěch (for ANO) in the Questions of Václav Moravec on Czech Television.
He considers the union's demand for an increase of up to 15 percent to be unrealistic.
He also said that the state should try to be self-sufficient in providing protective equipment.
According to him, the hospitals now have their supplies.
"I think that the increase (in salaries) can be somewhere up to five percent," the minister said.
According to him, it is necessary to reflect on the current situation, where the coronavirus pandemic and government regulations against its spread have affected the collection of insurance premiums since March.
The income of the insurance companies fell at that time.
"I think an increase of 15 percent is unrealistic at the moment," Vojtěch said.
The average monthly earnings of a doctor in acute inpatient care, according to data from the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (IHIS), will probably reach 88,312 crowns this year, and 47,498 crowns for nurses.
The difference between the salary of nurses in state hospitals and the salary of other founders will be up to seven thousand crowns.
The IHIS data also shows that the decline in the number of nurses in hospitals has stopped.
The average wage in the Czech Republic was 34,125 crowns in 2019, according to data from the Czech Statistical Office.
Trade union representatives said in June that they would demand a minimum increase of ten percent for 2021, ideally 15 percent.
They criticise the long-term significant difference between the earnings of doctors and nurses in state hospitals, which have to follow salary scales, and contractual wages in city, regional or private hospitals.
For this reason, they also demand that the salary scales for health care workers should be uniform.
For nurses this year, the difference will be up to seven thousand crowns a month.
In the case of doctors, for example, wages grew faster than salaries last year.
According to the President of the Czech Dental Chamber, Roman Šmukler, trade unionists should be aware of the current situation in the country.
Due to the impact of the COVID epidemic, the Chamber of Deputies recently approved an increase in this year's state budget deficit to a record 500 billion crowns, of which 1.75 billion is to go to the remuneration of health workers in hospitals and social services.
According to Smukler, the Council of Health Care Providers does not agree with the across-the-board increase in salaries next year.
According to him, the remuneration should be decided by the hospitals and health care facilities themselves and the extra money should go to them through the reimbursement decree.
Vojtěch also said that hospitals currently have enough protective equipment.
The chairman of the State Material Reserves Administration (SSHR), Pavel Švagr, said this week that the administration does not currently own a single piece of protective medical equipment.
He is waiting for the tenders to be completed.
According to Vojtěch, suppliers around the world are now able to deliver goods better than in March, when they were bought out.
According to him, the state should also try to be as self-sufficient as possible and buy from Czech companies.
Scrubbing smart quarantine could be taken over by soldiers.
We are ready, they say
"The smart quarantine is working, of course there is room for improvement.
We are going to discuss it with the army this evening.
The army is working perfectly and the question is whether they should run the whole thing again," the prime minister said on Sunday in his Facebook show "Ciao people."
According to him, it is not possible to sufficiently connect IT systems and sanitary stations, which gradually have to switch to more modern methods of operation.
According to the prime minister, there were problems in the Moravian-Silesian region, which is one of the current hot spots of the epidemic.
Defence Ministry spokesman Jan Pejsek told the Czech News Agency that he had no information about Sunday's meeting and that the government should discuss the matter on Monday.
According to him, the army is ready for this step.
The smart quarantine project was taken over by the Ministry of Health on 25 May.
Until then, the smart quarantine was led by a 90-member central management team set up under the army as an advisory body to the government, which was led by the former deputy minister Roman Prymula.
Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (Czech Social Democratic Party - ČSSD) criticized the controversial project on Sunday.
He also suggested that it could be taken over by the army again.
The government commissioner for IT and digitalisation, Vladimír Dzurilla, who is in charge of the project, has also previously admitted shortcomings in the project.
"The system is working, but it is still a work in progress.
For twenty years it was created independently and unsystematically, now we are trying to unify it in a few months.
It cannot be done at a gallop.
People are adapting to the new systems as they go along, the poor hygienists are adapting to the new systems as they go along, and they are actually catching the mistakes," he said.
Ostrava Mayor Macura won't run for re-election because he doesn't want to "make a fool of himself in politics"
The current mayor of Ostrava, Tomáš Macura (ANO), will not be a candidate in the next local elections.
The reason for this is an effort "not to fool around in politics," he told news server Respekt.cz.
Macura, who is also a member of the board of the ANO movement, has been mayor of Ostrava since November 2014.
In the local elections in 2018, the candidate of the ANO movement led by him won almost a third of the votes in Ostrava.
Macura originally wanted to be in office for only four years.
"I told myself that I would last one term and with my business experience I would be able to turn everything around and get it back on its feet," he told Respekt.
He added that he had to some extent allowed himself to be persuaded to run for a second term.
"But for me it is the maximum.
I don't want to fool around in politics," added Macura, who described himself in the interview as a heavy introvert who is not comfortable with frequent contact with people.
According to Respekt, there has been speculation for some time about Macur's possible end in the ANO movement.
The server recalls that Macura has criticized the ANO movement several times, for example for its alliance with the SPD movement or for supporting Miloš Zeman in the presidential elections.
He was one of the few ANO personalities to support Zeman's opponent, Jiří Drahoš, in the election.
Macura does not plan to leave the ANO movement, which he joined in 2017.
"As long as I have the feeling that I can make a difference in the movement, that it is not a completely futile struggle and that no one is interfering with me, I have no immediate motive to quit," he told Respekt.
Macura, 56, graduated from the University of Economics in Prague.
Before becoming the mayor of Ostrava in 2014, Macura worked, among other things, as the director of the pharmaceutical company Walmark.
He also sat on the boards of other companies.
Uber will return to Brno offering transport services
The company Uber, which offers transportation services, will return to Brno at the end of July.
This is the result of a change in the law, Brno City Councillor for Transport Petr Kratochvíl (ODS) said in a press statement on Thursday.
Taxi drivers protested against Uber in Brno, pointing out that Uber does not meet the conditions, such as the designation as a taxi or a taximeter.
However, a change in the law has changed the conditions for the operation of regular taxis and alternative ones since July.
Kratochvíl has had several meetings with representatives of Uber in recent weeks.
"Based on these, the company decided to return to Brno with its services at the end of July this year.
The move is the result of a change in the law that allows the company to operate legally.
The city has been made aware of this change and we believe that the company will operate its services within the given limits," Kratochvíl said.
Uber has operated in Brno in the past.
Taxi drivers protested against it because the vehicles were not marked as taxis or because they did not have a taximeter.
The court issued a preliminary injunction that banned Uber from operating in the city.
Brno originally supported taxi drivers, but at the end of last year, Mayor Markéta Vaňková (ODS) said that the city would like to take steps to make Uber work in Brno.
According to later court decisions, Uber was allowed to operate in Brno, but the company did not take advantage of this.
It will now return following a change in the law.
Since July, in addition to classic taxis with a lamp and a taximeter, it has been easier to operate a transport service ordered and paid for exclusively via mobile applications.
A too exuberant celebration in Brno: a flying chair landed a meter away from a person on the sidewalk
An office chair flew out of the fourth floor of a block of flats in Brno on Saturday evening and landed about a metre from the pavement.
A pedestrian was walking behind him at the time and immediately called the police.
Immediately after arriving at the address in the western part of the city, the patrol noticed an open window, under which a chair was still lying and next to it several cans and cigarette butts.
"The noise coming from the room on the fourth floor indicated that there was a rather noisy party going on inside.
The officers went up the corridor to the apartment and asked the three young men present, aged between 26 and 29, for an explanation," said Jakub Ghanem, a spokesman for the officers.
Babiš to discuss demand for Rafaj's dismissal with ČSSD
On Monday, Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO) plans to discuss with the coalition Social Democrats the demand for a proposal to dismiss the head of the Antimonopoly Office (ÚOHS), Petr Rafaj.
Non-profit organizations called for the dismissal of Rafaj at a meeting of the government's anti-corruption council, as did the Ústí Region.
The Social Democrats say that a change at the head of the office is in order.
According to information from the Czech News Agency, Rafaj was not invited to the Office of the Government on Monday.
His second mandate will end in the middle of next year; according to the law, he cannot be appointed for a third time.
His dismissal is within the competence of President Milos Zeman.
In addition to the call of non-profit organizations, the Prime Minister also received a letter with a similar request from the Ústí nad Labem region.
The reason is said to be, among other things, Rafaj's recent cases.
Last week, the prime minister refused to comment on the request, saying that he would familiarize himself with the materials and that the government parties would take "some position" on it.
He also said that he had not yet discussed the challenges with the president and that he did not have a meeting scheduled with him in the near future.
According to the statement of the OPC, there is no reason for an appeal because Rafaj has not been charged with anything.
Servers IHNED.cz and Aktuálně.cz wrote in the past week that the police are interested in Rafaj's meetings with Governor Jiří Čunek.
The meetings were connected, among other things, with the decision on the competition for the project of a controversial new hospital in Zlín for eight billion, which Čunek is pushing hard.
Čunek admitted to the meetings, according to which they discussed his "Senate activities."
Rafaj says the same thing.
The council of the Ústí nad Labem region called on the government to dismiss Rafaje at the end of June.
It also calls for a reform of the decision-making mechanisms of the authority.
According to Deputy Governor for Transport Jaroslav Komínek, the decision-making of the Office for the Protection of Competition regarding public contracts is not transparent and has signs of arbitrariness.
Last March, the police intervened at the antimonopoly office because of a tender for toll collection.
In June this year, news server Aktuálně.cz drew attention to the fact that Rafaj was using flats registered in the name of the company of influential ČSSD backroom player Alexander Čuba.
However, the deposit of 3.5 million for the apartment in Brno was paid from Rafaj's account.
Rafaj has been the chairman of the Office for the Protection of Competition since 9 July 2009. The president appointed the former Social Democrat MP for a second term in June 2015.
In less than a year, Rafajov's second six-year mandate will expire.
The law on the anti-monopoly office states that the president can dismiss the head of the office on the proposal of the government.
He can only be dismissed if he does not perform his duties for more than six months, or if he seriously undermines the dignity of his office or the independence and impartiality of the office.
In the Blansko library, employees were collapsing from the heat.
Air conditioning will help
The new technology will cost 740 thousand and will be in operation in the second half of August.
"For me, this is good news.
My three children and I regularly go to the library in the centre of Blansko.
In the warm months, however, it was practically impossible to stay there.
It was very hot and the air was bad.
The ventilation did not help.
That is why I am happy about the air conditioning," said one of the Blansko readers, Petr Novotný.
According to the director of the library, Lukáš Dlapa, the temperature in the building often rose to over thirty degrees.
The south wall of the building is glazed and acts as a greenhouse on sunny days.
"In addition, thanks to the curvature of the building, the sun shines into it for a large part of the day.
At the same time, it is a big problem to ventilate the individual departments, because the windows have to be closed overnight for safety reasons.
It is often already thirty degrees in the library in the morning," said Dlapa.
The worst situation was in the study and reading room on the third floor.
And on the floor above are the exhibition rooms and the director's office.
There was also an unpleasant climate in the children's ward, which is located under the roof of the building.
"It has happened several times that librarians have collapsed at work and ended up on sick leave.
The problem also occurred regularly in the cultural room at lectures, which are attended by dozens of people.
After a few minutes it was no longer possible to breathe there," said Dlapa.
Originally, representatives of the city wanted to install air conditioning in all areas of the library this year.
In the end, there will only be three circuits out of five.
"Due to limited funding, only the most problematic areas will have air conditioning.
Study and reading room on the third floor.
There is also a cultural room and a children's department on the floor above," said Jiří Svoboda from the investment department in Blansko.
He added that in the first phase, the workers had already installed air conditioning and modified the electrical installation in the aforementioned premises last autumn.
For approximately 360 thousand crowns.
The Blansko Municipal Library has almost three thousand registered readers.
Of these, about 900 are under the age of 15.
The backbone of Chicago has been driven out by the coronavirus.
Crawford gets back in the game
Not every infected athlete comes out with the truth.
Especially when it comes to players from the NHL, which is as silent as the grave about the health of players and does not publish anything at all.
Crawford was one of the few to step out of line.
The 35-year-old native of Montreal was only present at the first training session and has been absent from the lineup since then.
"I would like to inform you all that I have tested positive for Covid-19 and as a result I have been confined to my home for the past two weeks," he said, revealing the reason for his absence.
Fans no longer have to worry about his health.
Crawford is ready to take on the full load again.
"It's amazing to be back.
I will do everything I can to get in shape as soon as possible," he added.
The experienced goalie has won two Stanley Cups with Chicago and has been an integral part of the crease for the tenth season in a row.
The Blackhawks will play a preseason game against St. Louis before facing Edmonton in the preliminary round.
Thousands protest in Israel against prime minister
Thousands of Israelis have protested in several parts of the country against unemployment, corruption and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's handling of the coronavirus crisis.
The demonstrations took place, among others, in front of Netanyahu's private villa in the city of Caesarea, near his official residence and in a park in Tel Aviv.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, protests have been taking place regularly for several weeks.
The protesters are demanding Netanyahu's resignation over his trial on corruption and fraud charges, as well as the government's handling of the coronavirus outbreak.
"Bibi, go home," one protester wrote on his banner, referring to Netanyahu's popular nickname, according to the Associated Press.
"Everyone can see that the emperor has lost his clothes," read another.
Netanyahu, 70, is the first Israeli prime minister to be tried while in office.
He is accused in three cases of corruption, fraud and breach of trust.
He denies all the accusations and calls them a witch hunt.
According to local media, the trial could last up to three years, with more than 300 witnesses being called.
The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has been confirmed in nearly 60,500 people in Israel, which has a population of about nine million.
Some 455 people have died in connection with the outbreak.
The Israeli government introduced quarantine measures in March, which have helped to reduce the daily increases in infections.
However, after the gradual easing of restrictions from the end of April, the number of infected people began to grow significantly again, especially at the end of June.
Netanyahu's critics say the government has not done enough to help, for example, business owners affected by the quarantine measures.
The protesters are also bothered by the fact that the government sometimes issues contradictory instructions as part of the fight against the coronavirus.
The driver crashed the car into a tree and died.
The body had to be cut out of the wreck by firefighters
The tragic accident happened around 11 p.m. near Neveklov on a narrow county road leading from the Slapy Dam.
The driver apparently flew down into the forest at considerable speed and smashed the car into a tree.
He died at the scene.
The body had to be extricated from the wreckage by firefighters, who also cut off the roof.
Police are investigating the circumstances of the crash.
They have ordered an autopsy, which should clarify, among other things, whether the man was driving under the influence of alcohol or any other addictive substance.
No more waste and churning out one collection after another.
Pietro Filipi cancels discounts and bets on sustainability
The Czech clothing brand Pietro Filipi wants to focus on sustainability and is embarking on this with a fundamental change in strategy.
It is doing away with discounts and no longer wants to churn out one collection after another.
The fact that the fashion industry is one of the biggest polluters of the environment is nothing new.
Billions of pieces of clothing end up in incinerators and landfills every year.
However, the view of slow fashion, an often despised approach to dressing, has been changing quite rapidly in recent years.
Pietro Filipi sold about half of the goods at full price.
The other half, which was sold thanks to discounts, will not be bought so easily.
The company does not want to churn out one collection after another and at the end of each season discount the products below their production price.
In addition, according to the owner Michal Mička, the times of new and old collections and blindly following rapidly changing fashion trends are over.
"Most retailers already count on discounts when purchasing goods, so a much higher margin is included in the full price.
So it is actually a bit of a scam," says the owner of Pietro Filipi, Michal Mička.
In addition, the company wants to support local business with its approach.
"Each of our products is made from carefully selected quality fabrics and designed by local designers.
We put emphasis on the fact that a large part of our collection consists of so-called basic pieces - i.e. clothing that is timeless and out of season.
Globally, the segment of premium brands is characterized by the absence of any discounts, the price of the product simply corresponds to its quality and there is no need for a discount," adds Mička.
Giant graffiti features RAF airman Kurt Taussig
"The assignment was to create something for the anniversary of the end of the war.
And I remembered our fighter pilot who fought in the ranks of the British Royal Air Force in the Second World War.
The city administration liked the design," said Vacek, who completed his work after two weeks of intensive work.
He used around 300 litres of paint and 50 spray cans.
Kurt Taussig was born in 1923 in Teplice-Šanov.
He left the city when he was 15.
During the war, because of his Jewish origin, the Nazis took him to an internment camp, where he was held for several weeks.
However, he and his brother managed to avoid the concentration camp thanks to the organization of Nicholas Winton.
In 1939, Taussig made his way to Great Britain, where he voluntarily joined the Royal Air Force (RAF), and later underwent pilot training in the African Southern Rhodesia and Palestine.
He took part in combat operations at the beginning of 1945.
After the Velvet Revolution, he visited the Czech Republic several times, as well as his native Teplice, which granted him honorary citizenship.
Forty-six-year-old Kamil Vacek, whom people in the field of street graphic art know by the nickname Camo, has been working with spray cans on the streets of Teplice for more than 20 years.
He started with graffiti on areas that were set aside for this purpose by the then mayor Jaroslav Kubera (ODS).
Storm Hanna makes landfall on Texas coast
Hurricane Hanna made landfall on the southwest coast of the US state of Texas on Saturday afternoon local time (before midnight CEST last night).
It made landfall on Padre Island, Texas, about 15 miles north of Port Mansfield, and weakened to a tropical storm as it moved over land.
According to meteorologists, however, it still poses a great danger to the inhabitants of coastal areas.
It brought with it strong winds and intense rainfall; along with local flooding, according to the AP, there are reports of power outages and various material damage, including damaged boats.
On Saturday, Texas Governor Greg Abbott declared a state of natural disaster for 32 counties in southwest Texas and advised people to voluntarily evacuate.
The strongest warning was given to people in the coastal strip between Port Mansfield and Mesquite Bay, but in total the element is to affect an area of almost 500 kilometers before gradually moving over northeastern Mexico.
"Although Hanna is now a tropical storm, heavy rain and wind, storm surge, dangerous surf and isolated tornadoes could still pose a threat," the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) warned.
This morning local time (afternoon CEST), the storm was moving in the area of the US-Mexico border and was accompanied by winds of 85 kilometers per hour.
Hanna became the first hurricane of this year's Atlantic hurricane season on Saturday.
Over the Gulf of Mexico, it was accompanied by winds of up to 145 kilometers per hour, but as it moved towards the mainland, it gradually weakened to 112 kilometers per hour, which again excluded Hanna from the category of hurricanes.
The authorities urged local residents to wait out the storm at home and not to forget the hygiene measures associated with the prevention of the spread of the coronavirus.
Texas is one of the US states hardest hit by the covid-19 pandemic.
Given the existing security measures and the need to keep distances, possible evacuations are also a big challenge.
Makeshift shelters have been opened in hotels, schools and gyms.
In Hidalgo County, Texas, one of the buildings has also been set up as a shelter for evacuees who have tested positive for the coronavirus or have been exposed in other ways.
Local authorities have urged all evacuees to take masks and disinfectant gels with them to the shelter if possible.
"This is far from over.
We're expecting catastrophic flooding," the AP quoted Chris Birchfield, who works for the National Weather Service (NWS) in Brownsville, as saying.
Forecasts say that in some places up to 300 millimeters of rain could fall in just a few hours, in some cases almost 500 millimeters, which, together with the rise in sea level, could flood a number of coastal settlements.
Zeman to confer the rank of general on Colonel Lipka
President Miloš Zeman will confer the rank of general on Colonel Pavel Lipka on Wednesday.
This is stated in the overview of expected events of the Ministry of Defence.
The reason for the award of the rank of brigadier general is Lipka's appointment in August to the post of deputy commander of the Alliance's Multinational Division Northeast in Poland.
Lipka still serves as the deputy commander of the ground forces of the Czech Army.
The promotion to Zeman was proposed by the government at the end of June.
From the beginning of August, Lipka will replace Brigadier General Karel Rehka in the position of Deputy Commander of the Multinational Division Northeast in Elblag, Poland, which commands the units of the Alliance's forward presence in Poland and the Baltics.
Řehka became director of the National Cyber and Information Security Agency (NCISA) in March.
The government proposed to the president that Lipka be given the rank of brigadier general.
According to the law on professional soldiers, a higher rank may be conferred on a soldier for the duration of the performance of an elected office or for the duration of the performance of a service task that requires the conferral of a higher rank.
The rank of general corresponds to the post of deputy commander of an alliance division.
A soldier to whom a rank has been conferred has the same rights and obligations as if he had been appointed to that rank.
However, he is not entitled to a salary adjustment that would correspond to the given rank.
The conferral of a rank lasts until the reason for which it was granted ceases to exist.
"Colonel Lipka demonstrates a high level of professional readiness and is a role model for his subordinates.
He plays a significant role in fulfilling the tasks of the armed forces of the Czech Republic, including cooperation with foreign partners and ensuring the participation of the army in foreign operations," the Ministry of Defence said in June about the proposal for promotion.
Wednesday's promotion ceremony will take place at 12:30 at Prague Castle and will be attended by Defence Minister Lubomír Metnar and Chief of the General Staff Aleš Opata.
EU countries have coronavirus standards for aviation
European Union countries have agreed on common hygiene standards for air travel to help limit the spread of the new coronavirus.
This was announced by the German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer.
Among the agreed standards is keeping a distance or wearing masks on the plane and at the airport, but middle seats on planes will not have to remain unoccupied.
This was reported by Reuters.
"I am glad that my colleagues have accepted the German proposal for Europe and that we have been able to agree on these uniform standards," said Scheuer at the European Aviation Conference.
The German transport ministry then added that the agreement had been concluded by officials and that it still had to be formally approved by ministers.
The agreed measures include the requirement to cover the mouth and nose for passengers from the age of six, to observe the recommended distance during security checks and check-in at the airport.
Fresh air must also be guaranteed on board and all information must be available in several languages.
Airlines will also be able to fill middle seats.
The common rules agreed by officials meet at least some of the airlines' demands.
The different standards were causing confusion.
A temperature record was set in the Arctic Svalbard, where it was almost 22 degrees
"A 41-year-old record has been broken in Longyearbyen," the Norwegian Meteorological Institute said on Twitter.
In the early evening, the temperature there rose to 21.7 degrees Celsius, beating the record set in 1979 by 0.4 degrees, he added.
Longyearbyen, with a population of around 2,000, is the largest town in Svalbard and is located about 1,300 kilometres from the North Pole.
Svalbard is warming faster than almost any other place on Earth.
This highlights the dangers posed by the warming of other parts of the Arctic - from Alaska to Siberia, according to a report last year by the Norwegian Centre for Climate Studies.
According to him, the average temperature in Svalbard has risen by three to five degrees since the 1970s.
It could rise by as much as ten degrees by 2100 if greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere are not reduced.
The rise in temperature may result in the melting of the permafrost in Svalbard, which will threaten the stability of many buildings, roads or airports and may also cause more avalanches and landslides.
The warming of the climate also threatens Arctic fauna, such as polar bears and seals, which depend on the ice cover of the ocean.
Britons returning from Spain face mandatory two-week quarantine
The British Cabinet also urged citizens to avoid all non-essential travel to mainland Spain due to the risk of the spread of the covid-19 disease.
The Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands are therefore not mentioned, but even after returning from them, people have to be isolated for two weeks.
The new rules come into force at midnight.
"The protection of public health is our absolute priority.
We have taken this decision in order to prevent the possible spread of the virus in the UK," the British Foreign Office said in a statement.
"We have always made it clear that if the need arises, we will immediately remove a country from the safe list," she added.
As noted by the British newspaper Metro, the latest announcement will affect the travel plans of thousands of Britons.
Spain is one of the most popular holiday destinations.
Among other things, Britons are concerned about whether they will be paid sick leave if they have to go into isolation for 14 days after returning from their holidays.
Neil Hunter from Sittingbourne, for example, had booked a 10-day holiday to Lanzarote, due to depart on Tuesday.
The trip has been booked since December.
"We were going to go as a family, my wife Amanda and my daughter Bethany, but to be honest I don't know what's going to happen after this announcement.
I work as a train driver and I don't think my employer will agree to me being quarantined for two weeks when I return from holiday," the Metro newspaper quoted Hunter as saying.
In relation to Spain, there are fears that the country is at the beginning of a second wave of the epidemic.
Over the past two days, there have been more than 900 new infections every 24 hours.
Authorities in some areas are already tightening coronavirus measures, for example Catalonia is trying to restrict all nightlife and prevent people from gathering in large numbers.
The Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs has recently warned of an increased risk of infection in Catalonia, Aragon, the Basque Country and the Madrid region.
The government will discuss the model of purchasing electricity from Dukovany
On Monday, the government will discuss the model for the purchase of electricity from the planned new unit of the Dukovany Nuclear Power Plant.
The bill assumes that if the purchase price is higher than the price of electricity on the market, the difference will be paid by all consumers through tariffs.
In the second case, when the purchase price is lower than the market price, the impact on consumers will be the opposite.
Power electricity is an unregulated part of the final price of electricity for consumers.
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry Karel Havlíček (for ANO) and the energy company ČEZ have previously stated that the more likely option is that people will save money on electricity thanks to the construction.
Analysts, on the other hand, point out that the long-term outlook for electricity prices on the markets is always uncertain, which has been demonstrated several times in the past.
The plan has already been criticised by environmental organisations.
"The purchase price can be either below the market price of electricity or above it.
Thus, the final impact at the time of applicability of the rule can be both negative and positive.
The impact will be distributed among customers according to the size of the circuit breaker - with lower consumption or according to the consumption of electricity - with higher consumption of electricity," the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MIT) said in the documentation for the material.
Havlíček said in May that he expected the wholesale price of electricity to rise and that people on the Dukovany construction site would make money.
Otherwise, the impact will be in the tens of crowns per year per family, which, according to him, is far less than people pay annually in electricity bills to support the so-called supported sources.
He has previously estimated that the purchase price could be between 50 and 60 euros (about 1320 to 1600 CZK) per megawatt hour (MWh).
The submitted material does not contain any proposal for the amount, it is to be included in the purchase agreement.
The price of electricity on the Prague Energy Exchange for 2021, for which traders are now stocking up the most, is currently around 45 euros (about 1190 CZK) per MWh.
"Given the difference between the purchase price and the market price of electricity in the amount of ten euros, the surcharge for an average household with a consumption of 3.3 MWh per year - can correspond to a four-member household, standardly equipped with electrical appliances including an electric hob and oven, but which does not use electricity for heating and hot water - could amount to less than 100 CZK / year," the MIT wrote in the documents for the government.
"We are living in extremely turbulent times.
The coronavirus pandemic has shown us how vulnerable the global economy is.
For this reason, I consider the long-term prediction of market prices to be an explicitly speculative matter," Tomáš Voltr, executive director of the Energy Financial Group investment group, previously told the Czech News Agency.
The proposed law envisages that the purchase would be carried out by the Ministry of Industry and Trade, or a legal entity owned by the state authorized by it, at a predetermined price.
The contract between the investor and the state, guaranteeing the conditions for the purchase of electricity, would be concluded for a minimum of 30 years, with a possible extension of ten years, even repeated, but no longer than until the end of the operation of low-carbon production.
The proposal defines a low-carbon power plant as a power plant with a nuclear reactor connected to the electricity grid with an installed capacity of a minimum electrical output of 100 megawatts (MW) after 2030.
Havlíček previously said that the new Dukovany unit should have a capacity of 1,200 MW and produce nine terawatt hours of electricity per year, which would correspond to one tenth of the expected Czech consumption.
The unit should be put into operation in 2036.
The financing model for the new Dukovany block was approved by the government on Monday.
The facility should be financed by the state without interest during construction, while a two-percent interest rate is expected during operation.
The opposition does not agree with the financing model, it is also bothered by the possibility that Dukovany would be built by Russian or Chinese companies.
The state should participate in the construction of 70 percent.
The rest should be paid by ČEZ, which will also cover all possible additional costs.
The CEO of ČEZ, Daniel Beneš, told the Czech News Agency in May that the expected sum for the construction of the block in current prices is about six billion euros (approximately 162 billion crowns).
The contracts between the state and CEZ for the construction of the new Dukovany unit will be signed on Tuesday.
The Ministry of Regional Development has withdrawn the material on the promotion of tourism in the media for two billion
The material, according to which the Ministry for Regional Development (MRD) planned to spend two billion crowns on advertising holidays in the Czech Republic in the media, on the Internet and on billboards, has been withdrawn by the authority from the comment procedure.
Minister Klára Dostálová (for ANO) told SeznamZprávy.cz that the material is still being worked on.
The server Zdopravy.cz drew attention to the document in eKlep (the electronic library of the legislative process) on Friday.
The ministry justified the plan by the drop in tourism due to the coronavirus.
During the coronavirus crisis, the media also experienced a drop in revenue.
The proposal has drawn criticism from the opposition and representatives of the tourism industry.
According to the proposal, which can now be viewed on the hlidacstatu.cz website, the Ministry of Regional Development planned to give money through the state agency for the promotion of tourism, CzechTourism, for advertising on television, radio, in the press, on the Internet, on billboards and on surfaces at railway stations.
The largest share of the money, 700 million crowns, would go to television.
The majority would go to the private TV stations Nova and Prima.
The printed dailies and weeklies would receive 400 million and the same share would be given by the Ministry of Regional Development for PR articles, advertising banners and videos on websites.
Radio stations would receive 350 million for the media campaign, most of which would again go to private stations.
The remaining 150 million would be used for outdoor advertising on billboards, LED screens and surfaces at railway stations or in the metro.
The campaign to promote tourism in the Czech Republic was to begin in mid-August and last for a year.
"The material is still being worked on, it is definitely not yet in a form that should be presented," Dostálová told SeznamZprávy without giving further details.
The material was criticized by the opposition, according to the head of TOP 09, Markéta Pekarová Adamová, the media from the trust funds of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO) would benefit from the advertising.
"I firmly believe that this blatant contempt will backfire at the polls in the fall," she wrote on Twitter.
Dostálová denies that this is really about helping the media affected by the crisis.
"It could be a coincidence, I don't know anything about the support of the media," she told Deník N on Friday.
According to her, the budget of two billion is indicative.
"Of course, we are still calculating it, it could be less or more.
It is a working material," she added.
A media campaign to promote domestic tourism does not make sense for the Let's Save Tourism initiative.
"We want two billion for companies in the tourism industry, not an unnecessary advertising campaign," said the chairman of the initiative, Tomáš Barčík, on Sunday.
If the two billion crowns are in the state budget, they should be directed to companies, not to the media, the initiative writes in an open letter to the government.
The broth of life, the cock of beers and death as a blade of grass
The third album is also posthumous, entitled And Death Is a Blade of Grass by the Brno poet, tireless organiser of cultural activities and publisher Jaroslav Erik Frič, who also passed away a year ago, on 24 May.
It is the fifth item in Frič's discography, and as with the previous titles, the main emphasis here is on Frič's poetry, of which he himself is an excellent interpreter.
Frič, born in 1949, was, of course, influenced by the American beat generation, but he channeled this inspiration through his own, uniquely presented experiences and also through very intimate expressions of faith.
However, he was far from any agitation, when he spoke or wrote about faith, about God, it was always very intimate, non-aggressive, completely tolerant.
Bohuslav Reynek comes to mind in this context (in contrast to Jan Zahradníček, for example), the masters will forgive.
Frič's album offers recordings of the author's reading from 2006, as well as performances with musicians who have always accompanied him very sensitively, whether it was the cellist Josef Klíč or Honza Bartoň and Vítězslav Holata.
I will help myself - with pleasure - with the words of the Ostrava poet Petr Hruška about Frič's long poetic compositions.
"They were filled with a proud and never-ending bitterness," writes Hruška, "over the state of our world threatened with extinction.
A world that is sinking more and more into a stupor of consumerist vanity and greed, moving further and further away from what its soul was made of - the mystery of faith, humility and human closeness.
They echoed the longing of one who knows that the values for which he was created are of little interest to anyone, but who also knows that they cannot be abandoned just because of a general lack of interest.
The poems were a reminder that one may have to lose everything dear, but it is not unimportant how one loses it.
Whether he sells out to the general decline, skeptically resigns, fearfully shuts up, or remains until the last moment in a calm and proud insistence on what he believes and what he loves."
Paroubek is not my adviser, says Hamáček
The former prime minister and chairman of the Czech Social Democratic Party Jiří Paroubek is not a paid adviser to the Social Democrats.
The chairman of the party and Minister of the Interior Jan Hamáček only communicates with him and reads his opinions and articles.
Hamáček said this today on the Prima Partie television show.
The news server SeznamZprávy.cz reported on Friday that Paroubek was to be Hamáček's adviser.
"From time to time we write a text message, he sometimes sends me some material and I read it," Hamáček said today.
He added, however, that this is not an official and paid cooperation.
According to him, the CSSD does not have the resources to waste them on such purposes.
"The fact that I sometimes read his opinion, there are a lot of people like that," he said.
In a subsequent discussion with ODS MP Jana Černochová, the minister said that many ODS members still "openly listen to the opinions of Václav Klaus."
According to him, it is all right, because he is an experienced politician and a former party chairman, which is also the case with Paroubek.
He called the fact that the media is making an issue out of it a sign of this year's cucumber season.
The server SeznamZprávy.cz wrote on Friday that Paroubek is fulfilling the role of Hamáček's unofficial consultant.
He also wrote that the former chairman of the local cell, Petr Benda, who is associated with Paroubek and served as deputy chairman of his LEV 21 party, is heading for the fourth place on the party's candidate list in the Ústí nad Labem region.
Hamáček said today that he would not comment on the composition of the list of candidates until it had been completed and approved.
Duplantis is miles ahead, it's a kick in the ass, laments the Swede's challenger
It is the 22-year-old American pole vaulter who has the ambition and potential to be among the most serious competitors of the new ruler.
He already knows what it's like to beat Duplantis, who is two years younger; he beat him at the NCAA meeting last year.
"We had a battle the year before, when he won and I was second, and then we switched.
In both cases, it was a very good fight," describes Nilsen, who secured the victory with a performance of 5.95 meters.
But Duplantis has shot up since then and is currently alone at the top of the pole vaulting world.
At just 20 years of age, he became a world record holder, breaking the bar of 6.17 metres in Torun on 8 February this year, and adding another centimetre in Glasgow a week later.
"He was already jumping six meters at the age of 18 when he finished high school," recalls his peer Nilsen for the World Athletics website.
"It was clear that once he matured from a boy into a man, all his potential and talent would be multiplied tenfold.
Twenty years old is a pretty good age to jump a world record," he said.
Although Nilsen's list of achievements is considerably thinner than that boasted by Duplantis, the American has similar goals.
So far, he has hinted at his potential at NCAA competitions, which he has regularly won. In February of this year, he improved his indoor personal best to 5.93 m at one of them. Last August, he won a gold medal at the Pan American Games in Lima, and in 2017 he made it to the American team for the World Championships, where he finished 13th.
The next milestone for him is to taste the Diamond League for the first time.
"Definitely my priority is to get on the professional circuit and race as much as I can in the Diamond League because that's where you can make a name for yourself," he realises.
"If you can succeed at this level, there is no doubt that you can do the same at events like the Olympic Games, the World Championships or the Pan American Games."
Due to the pandemic, however, these top holidays are being postponed, which gives Nilsen and the other pole vaulters time to improve.
But will it be enough to catch Duplantis, who can easily turn the race below the five rings into a mere battle for silver?
"Everyone is trying to catch up with him, but I don't think it will be possible in the near future," Nilsen said.
"This kid has been jumping for 16 years and he's miles ahead of everyone else in training."
And before Tokyo 2021 begins, he will want to increase it even more.
The woman spent hundreds of thousands from the disability pension of her disabled son.
She is awaiting trial
The money that the 33-year-old man receives from the state as a disability pension is primarily intended to improve his quality of life.
The woman faces up to eight years in prison for embezzlement.
Due to his poor health, the court deprived the sick man of his legal capacity and appointed his mother as his guardian, who was to manage his son's money, among other things.
"From mid-November 2013 to January of this year, the woman used part of the funds from her son's disability pension for her own needs, depriving him of 440,000 crowns," said police spokesperson Dana Ladmanová, adding that the accused woman was aggravated by the fact that, as a guardian, she had a special duty to defend the interests of the victim.
According to the court's instructions, the woman did set up an account for her son, but she had his pension sent to her account.
"After paying the costs associated with her son's stay in a medical facility and paying for the necessary medications, she used the remaining funds to purchase a vehicle, electrical appliances and to run the household," the indictment says.
The woman admitted that she could not use her son's money for her own needs.
However, she defended herself by saying that she used them to help pay for family expenses.
"We had problems using our income to keep the household running.
We have never bought anything above standard.
It was always for things my son would approve of buying.
I thought of it as family money.
I had no idea that I was committing a crime," the woman explained to the police.
She promised to return the money to her son.
North America has been inhabited for 30,000 years, scientists say after finding tools
The finds from the Chiquihuite cave in the Mexican state of Zacatecas include 1,930 limestone tools, including fine blades that could have been used to cut meat and pointed objects that could have served as spear points or lances.
The researchers found that the oldest of the tools date back to 33,000 to 31,000 years ago.
"There are only a few products of this age.
But they are there," said archaeologist Ciprian Ardelean of the University of Zacatecas and lead author of one of two studies on the subject published in the journal Nature.
The youngest instruments are 12,500 years old.
According to experts, people have inhabited the Chiquihuite cave, located at a high altitude, for as long as 20,000 years.
Until now, the generally accepted theory was that the first representatives of the Homo sapiens species crossed the land bridge from the area of today's Russia to Alaska about 13,500 years ago.
Archaeological evidence, including unique spear points used to kill mammoths and other prehistoric animals, has shown that this Clovis culture subsequently spread across much of North America.
In recent decades, however, cracks have appeared in this model, with the discovery of several ancient settlements that were two to three thousand years older.
The second study, published in the journal Nature, reports on 42 different sites across North America that show evidence of human presence on the continent between 26,000 and 19,000 years ago.
Scientists believe that a small number of people may have arrived on the North American mainland earlier than previously thought.
Some may have made it to America by boat.
"It is clear that humans were in the Americas long before the development of the so-called Clovis culture," anthropologist Ruth Gruhn of the University of Alberta in Canada said of the new findings.
So far, the interest in air tickets is in line with the optimistic scenario, say sellers.
Prices are also gradually coming down
Sales of airline tickets in the Czech Republic are growing every week.
Compared to last summer, the interest is still about half, but the demand is growing by up to 20 percent every week.
According to dealers, the development after the crisis thus fulfils the most optimistic scenarios.
Ticket prices are gradually coming down as well.
According to sellers, southern European countries are among the most sought-after destinations.
According to data from Kiwi.com, Spain, Italy and Greece are in the lead.
The portal Letuška.cz sells the most flights to the Croatian city of Split.
Of the other countries, the United Kingdom is the most sought after, but it has always been one of the busiest destinations.
The average price of airline tickets is also falling.
At the Letuška.cz portal, it was around 6,250 crowns in the middle of the month, down by 3,000 crowns year on year.
This is mainly due to an increase in demand for European destinations, which now account for about 85 percent of sales.
However, the prices to some European destinations are also falling, for example to Spain or Italy they have fallen by about a fifth in recent weeks.
The crisis has also affected the behaviour of customers, who are now buying tickets much less in advance than before, because they are worried about the further development of the coronavirus situation.
According to earlier information from Kiwi.com, the time to purchase a ticket before departure has decreased by about ten days year-on-year.
"This confirms the future trend, when people will order tickets much less in advance, they will require more flexibility, less risk," said Michal Šindelář, vice president for products at Kiwi.com.
Currently, the average booking time before departure is 21 days.
Along with the growth in sales, the number of renewed air routes from the Czech Republic is also increasing.
Prague Airport currently operates regular flights to more than 60 destinations.
This is approximately half the number of destinations compared to last year's summer season.
The grand finale is tonight!
Watch the darts battle live on Nova Sport
The second most prestigious tournament within the PDC organization has reached the grand final.
It will feature the experienced 49-year-old Scottish darts player Gary Anderson and the surprise of the tournament, the 26-year-old Belgian Dimitri van den Bergh.
Gary Anderson knocked out Justin Pip in the first round, then ran into his neighbor in the table rankings.
However, he also managed to deal with James Wade and in the quarter-finals he had a good fight with Simon Whitlock, who had previously sent home the world number one.
The "Flying Scotsman" came close in the semi-finals when he faced Michale Smith.
At the last minute, however, he escaped the gravedigger's shovel, dominated in overtime and, after a score of 18:16, won a place in the final of the tournament, which he had already won in 2018, when he defeated Mensur Suljovic 21:19 in an amazing battle.
The biggest surprise of the World Matchplay is Dimitri van den Bergh.
The Belgian talent is enjoying the tournament and perhaps the knowledge that he has nothing to lose has helped him to play on an absolutely fantastic wave.
The 26-year-old darts player first surprisingly knocked out world number six Nathan Aspinall, in a dramatic battle they also pushed Joe Cullen and in the quarter-finals, after a sharp start, he also defeated Adrian Lewis.
The big test was the semi-final.
Glen Durrant showed his strength right at the beginning, but the calmly playing Belgian then gained a lead with an excellent series, which he then held more or less without any problems until the end.
Van den Bergh showed his strength in high scoring, which he countered with occasional uncertainty on doubles.
Coronavirus cases have increased at least since the beginning of the week, the number of tests has decreased
Since the beginning of March, when the new coronavirus was first discovered in the Czech Republic, 15,212 people have been proven to have been infected with it.
Almost 9,600 of them have already been cured, 368 patients have died.
A total of 5,254 people are currently ill.
This is according to data on the website of the Ministry of Health.
The daily number of newly confirmed cases has exceeded two hundred for four consecutive days this week.
The maximum was 281 cases on Friday.
There were 235 positive tests on Thursday, 246 the day before and 206 on Tuesday.
On the first working day of this week, 169 more people were infected.
A total of 9,590 people have recovered from COVID-19 in the Czech Republic, or 63 percent of all those infected so far.
Most had a mild form of the disease.
According to the latest data from the Ministry of Health, there are 151 people with coronavirus in the hospital, the condition of 19 of them is assessed by doctors as serious.
There are several outbreaks of the Covid-19 disease in the Czech Republic.
Karviná still has the highest number of people infected in the last seven days per 100,000 inhabitants, with almost 59.
It is followed by the district of Jihlava with 56 and Frýdek-Místek with 36 infected per 100 thousand inhabitants in the last week.
Due to the increased number of infected people, new measures against the spread of the coronavirus have been in force in the Czech Republic since Saturday.
People must wear masks at indoor mass events of more than 100 people, these are cultural and sporting events, but also weddings and funerals inside buildings.
From Monday, the capacity of these events will be reduced from the current one thousand people to half.
In the world, the number of people who have been proven to be infected with the new coronavirus has already exceeded 16 million.
This was stated by the American Johns Hopkins University, which is monitoring the development of the pandemic globally.
According to this source, the number of victims who have died from Covid-19 is close to 645,000.
The latest million infections were added to the statistics in just three days; the 15 million mark fell on 22 July.
The largest contribution to the rapid increase in the number of cases in recent days has been made by the United States, which has already registered more than 4.1 million infected, Brazil with 2.4 million and India, where, according to the authorities, almost 1.4 million people have been infected.
The number of infected people is now increasing at a record pace.
The World Health Organization reported this week that there were more than 284,000 new cases worldwide from Thursday to Friday, the highest daily total since the pandemic began.
This development can be attributed to the fact that the spread of the infection is at its peak in populous countries such as the USA, Brazil and India, but according to Reuters, the number of new cases has been growing in almost 40 countries around the world in the past week.
This applies to countries such as Australia, Japan, Bolivia, Sudan, Bulgaria, Belgium and Israel.
The infection has already appeared in almost all countries of the world, and the first case was officially announced by the DPRK today.
The air in homes is up to five times worse than the air outside.
Air fresheners and deodorants are bad for your health
Health is threatened not only by poor air quality in outdoor areas, but also at home.
This was pointed out by an Israeli expert on human health, Carol Abraham, quoted by The Jerusalem Post.
According to Abraham, who was responsible for the creation of the Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection, it is necessary to focus on pollutants in homes right now, when many people spend more time working from home.
Abraham mentioned research by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), according to which the quality of indoor air is up to five times worse than outdoor air.
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 3.8 million people die prematurely each year due to poor air quality in their homes.
"Due to the coronavirus epidemic, which has forced and continues to force many to work from home, people have to spend more hours in their homes than before, so it's time to focus on the quality of air in homes," Abraham said.
In Israel, according to her, almost no one is concerned with the quality of "domestic air."
The things that people normally come into contact with - paints, air fresheners, disinfectants, deodorants or pesticides - can be dangerous.
"Even the clothes that we regularly take to the dry cleaners emit poisonous gas," Abrahamová said.
According to her, children, elderly members of the household and people with respiratory problems are most at risk.
Even otherwise healthy individuals can begin to suffer from problems such as headaches, fainting, irritation of the nasal passages, nosebleeds, vomiting or skin allergies.
Long-term exposure to unhealthy substances can damage internal organs and the central nervous system.
However, not all pollutants come from objects inside the home, the source can also be the material from which the houses are built.
Václav Havel quiz: How long did he spend in prison and what made him write Charter 77
Fuenlabrada lost the chance to advance to the top Spanish football league due to the coronavirus infection in the team.
The management of the competition cancelled the originally postponed duel of the last round of the second league, in which the team could secure participation in the playoffs.
Fuenlabrada reported another 12 infected people on Saturday, bringing the total number of positive tests for covid-19 at the club to 28.
Monday's match against La Coruna, in which Fuenlabrada needed only a point to qualify for the playoffs, was postponed due to an infection in the team.
The management of the competition said today that the duel against La Coruna was definitively called off due to force majeure due to the fact that it was no longer possible to play.
Fuenlabrada has accepted the decision.
La Coruña, on the other hand, is up in arms about the match not being played.
In the end, given the results of their rivals, even a victory over Fuenlabrada would not have been enough to save them, but they consider it unfair that the last round did not take place according to the usual complete in a single date.
The management of the former elite Spanish club is threatening to go to court over its relegation to the third league.
The top two teams in the table, Huesca and Cadiz, are assured of a place among the elite.
Zaragoza, Almeria, Girona and Elche will compete for the remaining third place in the playoffs.
Karel Gott did not like Václav Havel?!
The daughter of Dominic revealed it
"My father didn't like him for many years," Gott's eldest daughter Dominika revealed to Aha!, adding that the Master couldn't remember Havel's name and whenever he was mentioned, Karel was always annoyed.
It's hard to say what they did to each other, but according to Dominika, the dispute began sometime in the mid-1990s.
"My father said in an article after the revolution that he had it easier than he did.
That Havel could write in a drawer during the dark times, but if he resisted in any way, his career would be over," says Gottová.
But then he adds that in the end, the Czech giants did find a way to each other.
"I know that Havel could not have heard the word until he was in his sixties.
But then the president congratulated him with a letter on his birthday, and suddenly my father's relationship with him began to change," Dominika recalls.
Indeed, ten years later, Gott even invited the then former president to celebrate his seventieth birthday at the Ambassador Hotel on Wenceslas Square.
"And that was the beginning of a new era in their relationship, because my father then regularly invited Mr. Havel to his home in Bertramka," added the blonde, whose father died last October.
Slavík was also said to be sorry that he never received a state decoration from Václav Havel.
However, he finally received it in 2009, even though it was already in the hands of his successor in office, Václav Klaus (79).
He will receive another honour in memoriam, as the current president Miloš Zeman (75) is to award him the Order of the White Lion and thus honour his memory.
Heat wave threatens the Czech Republic from Tuesday, meteorologists warn of wildfires
The meteorologists' warning of high temperatures is valid for Tuesday afternoon for the whole of Bohemia, with the exception of the Karlovy Vary region, as well as for southern and central Moravia.
"Exceptionally, temperatures may exceed 34 degrees Celsius, especially in Central Bohemia," they say.
People are advised to follow a drinking regime in the heat and to limit physical activity in the midday and afternoon hours.
Due to the warm weather with a minimum of rainfall, there will be a risk of fires from Tuesday morning.
Windy weather could contribute to their rapid spread.
The warning of meteorologists about the risk of fires applies to Central Bohemia, including Prague, Liberec, Ústí nad Labem, Karlovy Vary and Plzeň regions.
The fire warning will remain in effect until further notice.
"We do not expect significant rainfall, which would mitigate the danger, in the northwest and west of Bohemia until at least the end of the week," says the CHMI.
Prague City Hall responded to the meteorologists' warning with a ban on lighting fires in high-risk areas, which is due to come into force on Tuesday.
People in the capital will not be allowed to light open fires in parks, gardens or forests, for example, up to a distance of 50 metres from the edge of the forest cover.
Smoking and the use of pyrotechnics are also prohibited in these areas.
The measure will be in effect until further notice, Prague City Hall spokesman Vít Hofman said.
