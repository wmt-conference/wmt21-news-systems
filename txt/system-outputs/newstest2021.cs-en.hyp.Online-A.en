Novak helped Trabzonspor to second place, skoda also hit
Defender Filip Novák helped Trabzonspor to the title of vice-champion with a goal in the last round of the Turkish Football League.
His team won 2–1 at Kayserispor and held on for a third Besiktas.
Striker Milan Škoda scored his 10th goal for Rizespor after a January transfer from Slavia, which was saved despite falling 1-3 at Fenerbahce.
Novak confirmed his excellent productivity with his seventh goal of the season.
In the 63rd minute, kayserispor's goalkeeper just fired a fierce shot and the Czech footballer hit the ball into the net from an angle.
The home side equalised five minutes before the end, but Trabzonspor pulled away the victory in the sixth minute of the set-up when they successfully finished with a four-on-one.
Skoda levelled the match with Fenerbahce at the start of the second half after a 1-1 scoreless play.
Rizespor could not hold the tie for long, but he did not have to be sorry, as the results of his opponents left him three points above the relegation zone.
The competition will conclude with Sunday's duel between the championship-winning Basaksehir on the Kasimpasa course.
The well-hidden Hermit's Cave in the woods near New Bor was not really habitable
In the north of Bohemia in the foothode of the Lusa mountains, near Nový Bor in the Czech Republic, in the forests through which the Count's Path led, there are several sandstone rock formations.
Natural and man-made.
And we're going to go after that human hand created.
The place is called the Hermit's Cave.
In fact, no hermit ever live here, and the cave served as a shelter, or rather a storage room for grain.
The cave is carved from the side into a rock promonta and accessible by stairs from above.
But you can't really see until the last minute.
It is revealed by the narrow stairs leading to a kind of rock gallery, from where it is only just entering the rock.
Although the chamber seems to be far from human dwellings, at the time of its creation there may have been a field on the plateau, where there is now a forest.
"The fact that the building does not have a window and a fireplace is located in a traditional place clearly proves that no hermit could ever survive the winter here," explains historian Kamil Podroužek from the Faculty of Arts of Jan Evangelista Purkyně in Usti nad Labem.
The single-space building has only a stone bench at the back, apparently used to store containers.
"I see it as a storage chamber for some food or products from the field," adds Kamil Podroužek.
On the walls of the cave there are traces of tools.
Breaking sandstone with a canine was quite simple and quick for insiders.
It was enough to use the joints appropriately and gradually break off the sandstone.
Depending on the length of the canine trace and the method of mowing in general, the period of formation of the cave can be determined in a framework.
According to the historian, this is probably the end of the 18th century.
The cave is freely accessible and, according to the mess that appears in it, someone sometimes sleeps there.
If you approach the cave from above from one of the forest paths and are interested in a running stream under the cave and the nearby count's path, you will surely find the trail down as well.
And on the way out of the forest, you may still be captivated by the nearby Raven Rocks.
Jockey Minařík is in an induced coma after a heavy fall in Germany
"Philip is in the best hands right now.
The institute is set up for similar cases, plus we have a family in Hanover.
This greatly eases my situation and also my care for my daughter Finja," the server quoted Jezdci.cz's wife Katja as saying.
"Everyone's doing their best, Philip needs time to recover.
There's no point in making any predictions.
Anyone who has ever encountered the issue of head and induced trauma knows that the situation can change.
Philip is a great warrior.
We all have to be patient now and give him time," said the 45-year-old jockey's wife.
Star frankie dettori, who won the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes for the seventh time at Ascot on Saturday, also called for financial support for the injured Minařík, equalling legend Lester Piggott.
Nearly €70,000 has been raised on Gofundme to date.
The goal is 100 thousand euros (2.6 million crowns).
Video referee took four goals from Sassuolo players, losing 0-2
Sassuolo's players got the ball into their opponent's goal four times in Saturday's match in Naples, but eventually had to accept a 0-2 defeat.
Neither of their goals was conceded by the referee after consultation with the video due to offside.
According to Italian media, this is a record adversity of technology, so many hits have never been thwarted by var one team.
"Var was stricter on Sassuolo than road radar and punished him like no team has ever been.
New technology is breaking records," gazzetta dello Sport wrote in a commentary.
"Sassuolo's festival of unrecogned goals.
Never before has var been so strict on one team," added Corriere dello Sport.
Napoli took the lead in the 8th minute on Saturday, but after half an hour of play Sassuolo seemed to equalise.
Filip Djuričič's goal, however, was not conceded after the video referee's intervention due to offside.
For the same reason, djuričič's next shot and the hits of Francesco Caputo and Domenico Berardi were not gradually in force.
The home side, on the other hand, added one more goal.
Electric cars are setting a new record.
In the Czech Republic, they recharged the most in history
"Growth was led by a 30% increase in the number of stations in our network and the trend of more frequent charging at public stations, as well as accelerated development of registrations of new e-cars," said Tomáš Chmelík, Head of CEZ's Clean Technology Department.
Other big players, such as PRE and E.ON, electric car manufacturer Tesla, as well as Bill and Lidl supermarkets, are also reporting their share of the market.
The operator of classic petrol stations is represented by MOL.
She doesn't have the numbers yet.
"We started building our electromobility network only last year," explained jana jusková, a company spokeswoman.
However, the Journal's editorial office exclusively obtained data from all 216 electric stands operated by ČEZ.
They show that drivers took an average of 13.5 kWh from stations.
This corresponds to the range of about 100 kilometers of a smaller electric car.
Aside from small pumping up to 1 kWh, the average charge takes two and a half hours.
The vast majority of refuelling was then carried out on a free tariff.
If motorists were already paying for the collection, their typical spend was around CZK 330.
Electromobility is particularly important in the capital.
On the territory of Prague there are all five busiest recharges of ČEZ, which will also eclipse the entire regional cities in their popularity.
Olomouc leads between regions.
On the contrary, the least interest is in secluded stations in the borderlands, for example in Bohumín or Prachatice, which often remain unutilization throughout the day.
More than 4,000 electric cars are currently registered in the Czech Republic.
In the first half of this year alone, 1274 new e-cars were added.
In a large survey by the Daily "Czechs on the Move", eight percent of readers said that they were considering buying an electric car for the family.
However, only a third of respondents know where to look for the nearest charging station in their area.
Not just for better water retention.
Environmental activists protested in Prague
According to the organizers, the government's actions so far in terms of protecting and rectisively resusperating the Czech landscape and dealing with the climate crisis are insufficient, the speakers called on the state to take a more vigorous approach.
The event called The Last Drop was attended by representatives of large organizations such as the Rainbow Movement, Greenpeace and the Green Party, as well as smaller local associations.
"For example, we have people who have been speaking out against the expansion at the Turów mine for a long time, there are people who are opposed to gravel mining near Uherský Ostroh, there are people who are opposed to the construction of meaningless dams," Marika Volfová said on behalf of the organizers.
She said the protesters' main demands were the creation of a plan to retain water in the landscape, a radical change in agricultural policy and subsidy system to promote sustainable agriculture, and a transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources as quickly as possible.
"The government is supposed to defend people's interests, not reckless and devastating business," she said.
A petition was placed on Lesser Town Square calling on representatives of the Czech state to work on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and restoring Czech soil and landscape.
The people present were equipped with banners with passwords such as "End of rapeseed depression" or "Less coal, more canoes".
Jan Škoda from the Association for Water for People came from South Moravia to Prague, protesting against the plan to extract gravel pits in the Hodonín region.
"It threatens the drinking water source for 140,000 people," he said.
He added that the wells represent the fifth most powerful source of drinking water in the Czech Republic.
According to him, the planned gravel mining is only about 500 meters from the wells, and according to the reports, it is certain that the quality of the water will be compromised.
Vojtěch Veselý came from the village of Valeč in Karlovy Vary for the so-called agroecological farmers.
He pointed to the pros of small farms that do not foreay for yield and profit and supply residents on the ground.
"Small agroecological farms are able to feed the entire population normally, and they do not create such destruction in the form of the countryside and the environment," he said.
Three people died when a plane crashed on a house in Germany
Three people died and two others were injured when an ultralight plane crashed into an apartment building in western Germany today.
Local emergency services reported that two crew members and a resident of the house were among the dead.
The plane crashed onto the roof of a building in the town of Wesel in North Rhine-Westphalia.
The attic apartment, which was one of the five apartment units in the house, was subsequently engulfed in fire.
Firefighters have already managed to get the flames under control.
Local Fire Chief Robert Meyboom said both crew members of the aircraft may have died.
The third victim, according to police, is a woman who lived in the house.
The Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ), citing Mayor Wesel, reported that it was a single mother whose two-year-old daughter was rescued from the apartment with minor injuries.
An emergency parachute was found near the accident, apparently serving as a brake on landing.
Police believe it came from a crashed plane.
There was room for two people in the plane.
The machine took off from the airport in the nearby town of Marl.
The Rheinische Post, citing eyewitnesses, reported that the plane collided with a hot air balloon before crashing.
However, this information has not yet been confirmed.
WAZ, citing other witnesses, reported that the aircraft disintegrated in the air before crashing to the ground.
On Saturday, Česká spořitelna erroneously charged some card payments twice.
It has already corrected the error
On Saturday afternoon, Česká spořitelna erroneously charged its clients some card payments twice.
According to the bank spokesman Lukáš Kpík, the problem could have involved thousands of transactions.
The savings bank has already removed the error and returned the money to the clients.
Problems with double billing of card payments were noted by the savings bank on Saturday afternoon.
"Yesterday (Saturday) night we updated the system and immediately refunded all these double payments to clients.
At the moment, everything works without problems," Kropík said on Sunday afternoon.
The exact number of clients to whom the bank deducted money from card payments twice is unknown to the bank spokesman, who estimated that there were fewer than thousands of transactions.
The savings bank is investigating the causes of the problems.
"It could have been a combination of multiple factors," Kropík said.
Česká spořitelna is the largest bank in the Czech Republic according to the number of clients.
At the end of March, it had 4.6 million.
The savings bank is owned by the Austrian financial group Erste Group Bank, which is a key player in the central and eastern European banking market.
Vojtěch will present a system of three coronavirus emergency stages on Monday
"The grades will be at regional level according to the strength of community spread.
We are working on this together with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics," vojtěch said in ČT.
It will be a traffic light, individual regions will be marked with green, orange or red according to the risk of coronavirus.
The Minister added that he would still talk to epidemiologists about the inclusion of individual regions.
He admitted that only the Moravian-Silesian Region would currently have an orange color and Prague would be close to it.
The map will also include individual measures for regional hygiene stations, hospitals, sanitary facilities and employers.
"We want to deal with this at regional level, because the situation in them is not one," vojtěch said.
Waterman and Carolina
When waterman Jonah and the miller's daughter Caroline have a good time, it's not easy for them.
Jonah is prevented from love by his father, the grumpy waterman Hastrbuch, and Caroline has no idea that her dear Jonah is not human.
It's a good thing there's a young Libor who's going to do everything he can to protect the whole village, especially Caroline, from the vodka villain.
What does it matter if he plots and lies?
Especially if he can get Caroline to reject Jonah and prefer him, the valiant Libor.
Before long, everyone in the area knows who is to do with the drowning of the night-time Teapot, spoiled flour, mill fire and other scoundrels.
Angry villagers arrange a waterman hunt, and jonah's head is cursed with an immisable water curse.
Now, Konvička's soul, Caroline!
How to soften old Hastrbuch, convince the neighbors of Jonah's innocence, find Jonah and free him from the curse?
The fairy tale was filmed in September 2010 in ct studios and outdoors near brzina pond, in Obděnice in Sedlčany and in the beautiful environment of the historical mill in Hoslovice.

The course of the disease of the majority is mild, only three percent of those infected have to go to the hospital
Either a milder form of coronavirus is spreading through the Czech Republic, or a summer dose of sunshine has significantly improved our immunity.
Infectious hospital wards are half empty, even as the numbers of those infected are rising.
"The situation today and April is completely different and it is mainly due to the number of hospitalized," confirms Health Minister Adam Vojtěch.
It is worth remembering that on April 11, when the first wave of the epidemic peaked in our country, everyone wore masks, the collections were carried out by the army, the Republic was closed and the Czechs consumed disinfection for a year in advance.
Yet ten people a day were dying.
Now daily increases in the number of infected are higher, but every day with covid-19, no more than two people die.
Karvinsko still has the highest number of infected people per population, jihlava already has similar numbers due to the outbreak at the local Alzheimer's center, where there are already 57 infected - 40 clients and 17 employees.
Another home for the elderly was closed by health inspectors in Černožice in Hradec Králové.
The disease was confirmed by tests on one of the nurses.
"We are tracing, we have reduced movement, we have all the hygiene measures," says Martin Schnal, director of the retirement home.
According to him, none of the clients of the home have symptoms of the disease yet.
Blanket testing will begin tomorrow and then decide on the next measure.
Hospitals are also responding to the increased number of infected.
The Institute of Oncology in Brno today launched an automatic camera system at the entrance, which will know if people are wearing a mask when entering.
The record is reported by South Bohemian health inspectors, who have recorded twenty-five cases of coronavirus - most of them are foreign employees of the prachatice company.
In total, there were 131 infected on Saturday - half the number on Friday - but less is being tested at the weekend.
Debutant champion!
Van den Bergh wrote a fairy tale, Anderson was swept away
Dimitri van den Bergh's big surprise of the tournament also produced an outstanding performance against the player who won the second most prestigious PDC in 2018.
The opening match was tied on both sides, with the break coming at 8-7 for the Belgian dartsman.
Van den Bergh wore a 13-pin Lego goggle and has had the upper hand ever since.
He was literally crushing his opponent with his game, and the much more experienced "Flying Scotsman" was having a hard time getting to the doublings.
The way "Dreammaker" had him in his hand is evidenced by the fact that a dissuased Anderson didn't play his first maximum until The 24th Lego.
Plus, the young Belgian handled a great amount of checkouts.
He last lost in the 11th Leg, but in an unfavorable condition he "caught a big fish" and closed 170.
There was a lot of frustration in Anderson at the end of the game.
Rather, he was throwing away the darts, and his triumphant opponent was absolutely sovereign.
Van den Bergh transformed the first of three match darts and lived up to his name - he wrote his big dream.
Winning the trophy named after Phil Taylor is all the more valuable to the Belgian dartsman because it is his first major won.
The last player to beat Van Den Bergh is Karel Sedláček.
Nantes charged over cathedral fire, man pleads guilty
St. Peter and Paul's Cathedral in the heart of Nantes caught fire last Saturday, severely damaging the original 16th-century sauching windows and destroying the organ.
Suspected arson was investigated by investigators as the fire progressed through the temple from three different locations.
At the same time, the police found no signs of violence at the entrances.
The accused is a volunteer with a local diocese, a 39-year-old Rwandan refugee.
Police arrested him shortly after the fire, but then released him without launching a criminal prosecution.
Now the prosecutor's office has reported that, based on new evidence, the man was arrested again on Saturday, confessed and faces arson charges.
If found guilty, he faces up to 10 years in prison and a hefty fine.
According to his lawyer, the man regretted the crime and decided to cooperate fully with investigators, Le Monde reported.
Vojtěch: On Monday we will introduce a "traffic light" for epidemiological measures
The new system is intended to fulfil the role of a pandemic plan, the absence of which has faced criticism from the government and the Ministry of Health.
"The grades will be based on the strength of community spread," the minister explained.
He added that at present, for example, the Moravian-Silesian Region or Prague would reach a medium, orange grade.
The system is designed as regional because the situation varies significantly from region to region, he added.
On the system, the Ministry cooperated with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (IZIS).
According to the Minister, specific measures will be linked to the individual stages, whether it is the obligation to wear face masks or the organisation of special wards in hospitals.
Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) called for an epidemiological plan on Prima Partie TELEVISION, according to which people should have clear information about what measures they can expect if the epidemiological situation worsens.
The daily increase in confirmed cases in the Czech Republic has increased in recent days, although the number of hospitalized remains low.
Vojtěch commented that nothing fundamental is happening, it is not appropriate to talk about declaring a state of emergency or reconsching a crisis management team.
In view of the growing number of people infected since Saturday throughout the Czech Republic, the government has reintroduced the obligation to wear face masks at indoor events for more than 100 people.
From Monday, the capacity of these events will be limited to 500 people, now it is 1000 people.
The government's move, when it was not clear until the last moment what measures would take effect or when they would be announced, has received criticism.
"I think that in a situation that is quite tense, the main actors should create a sense of security and, on the contrary, straighten out the confusion," Senator Marek Hilšer said in Questions.
Measures may already vary by region, for example, in Prague from Sunday on, the obligation to wear face masks also applies in non-residential medical facilities, i.e. in pharmacies or waiting rooms at the doctor's office.
The obligation to wear face masks when visiting health and social facilities or pharmacies was introduced from Friday also in the Liberec and Usti Regions.
In the Highlands of Jihlava it is necessary to wear face masks in indoor public spaces, public transport and medical facilities from 14 July.
On the contrary, in the Moravian-Silesian Region, anti-eidesemic measures have been relaxed, as in the Central Bohemian Region of Kutnohorsk.
At the beginning of June, the Czech Government also approved the so-called traffic light for Europe, which color-coded the level of risk of infection in individual European countries and adjusts accordingly the rules applicable to entry into the Czech Republic from these countries.
For low- and medium-risk countries, the authorities have not required Czech citizens to test negative for coronavirus or order quarantine instead.
These are mandatory when Czechs return from high-risk countries.
At the moment, all EU Member States are now in the low risk of infection category.
Techno parties in Benešovsk continue.
She's playing at a third capacity, she was supposed to finish at noon.
Hlaváčkova Lhota (Benešovsko) Technoparty near Hlaváčkova Lhota in Benešovsk continues on Sunday evening.
A third of the original 12 music systems still play.
According to the evening estimates of the police, about 500 people remain here after 20:00, initial rough estimates said three hundred, in the morning there were 900, said police spokeswoman Lucie Nováková.
Originally, the techno parties were supposed to end at noon on Sunday, at which time part of the music systems really died down.
"Some have already left, and others are preparing to leave.
Music production is still partially ongoing.
We expect the disconnection and disassembly of music systems to gradually take place," said Nováková.
"Police officers are still strictly checking departing visitors to prevent drivers from driving under the influence of alcohol or addictive substances.
Drivers have the opportunity to undergo a preventive breath test before departure," she added.
The event is supervised by dozens of riot police, foreign police, traffic and riot police are on site, and dog handlers with service dogs are also on standby.
"During the day, police officers checked 470 people moving at the venue and 485 vehicles, 270 drivers were breathalysed, six of them were behind the wheel under the influence of alcohol," Novakova said.
A total of 95 drivers were tested by police for narcotics and psychotropic substances, one of which tested positive.
Police also dealt with 14 traffic offences.
At the request of the technoparty participants, the police carried out 300 preventive breath tests and four preventive tests for the presence of narcotics and psychotropic substances.
About 2,000 people were at the event on Saturday morning.
If the number of participants did not increase, the police would intervene.
Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) said this on prima partie television.
However, the number of participants fell below 1000, so the police assessed that no intervention was needed, nor did the sanitation station or the Ministry of Health ask for it.
Czech Television (ČT) reported on Sunday that the technoparty had extended to the surrounding land, whose owners did not agree to use it for techno parties.
It is possible that the owners of the surrounding land will claim compensation.
Fans of techno arrived at the meadow near Hlaváčka Lhota on Friday evening.
The police originally guarded the meadow in Blažim in Benešovsk, where the techno parties took place last year.
Blažim is located about 30 kilometers from Hlaváčka Lhota, where the technicians eventually actually went.
According to Novak, no one came to Blažim.
The bite of ammest: The little girl ended up in the hospital!
"The first case this year was recorded in Železnorudsk.
The mother-in-law bit a girl in the leg in 2010, who was brought by her parents to the local rescue base," regional spokeswoman for the medical rescue service Mária Svobodová told the Journal, noting that the child was then taken to a hospital in Klatovy.
The name is the only poisonous snake in the Czech Republic, and it is in šumava that these animals are found in higher numbers, so it is good to be careful when walking.
However, there is no great danger from these animals.
The chance of being bitten by a still is not very high, she is afraid of herself in normal contact.
And if she has room to do so, she likes to crawl away with a loud hiss.
It will only attack if it feels very threatened - for example, if you accidentally step on it.
But even biting it is not a tragedy, its poison is very effective against small mammals, but it does not kill people.
This can only happen if a person has a particularly weakened organism or suffers from an allergy.
Therefore, the risk is especially in children, seniors and allergy sufferers.
"A person often feels sick after being bitten, sweats, has an elevated temperature, thirst, abdominal pain and diarrhea, and in weakened individuals and especially allergy sufferers, anaphylactic shock can occur," Miriam Gredová from Klatovy Hospital described to the Journal.
The man threatened to throw the infant out the window.
He poured wine on the policewoman and threw dishes.
After 11:00 p.m., a task force entered the apartment and apprehended the man.
The infant was immediately taken into the care of paramedics, markéta Janovská, spokeswoman for the regional police, said in a press release.
The man refused to cooperate with the officers, throwing dishes, knives or pouring wine over the police negotiator's window.
He amplified his threats several times during the negotiations by leaning out of the window with the child in his arms.
Once he even climbed on the window sill himself, where he staggered.
Police are still investigating the man.
He doesn't want to release any more information yet.
Stosur prefers her daughter to the tennis season
Australian tennis player Samantha Stosur will not be involved in the coronavirus-affected season this year.
But the 36-year-old 2011 US Open champion, who became a mother in June, does not want to end her career yet.
He plans to return to the courts next year and believes his family and daughter will make tennis even more enjoyd than ever.
Stosur announced on social media two weeks ago that her partner Liz Astling had given birth to a daughter, Genevieve, in mid-June.
"I'm going to stay home, spend time with my family, be there for all the little milestones that our Evie is going to have in the next six months and just enjoy it," the former world number one in doubles said on the Australian union's website.
The WTA Tour will resume its interrupted season on August 3 with a clay-court tournament in Palermus.
Sapa Market: Raid reveals meat, fish and eggs of unknown origin
"One of the vehicles entering the premises was transporting 1,320 quail eggs of unknown origin, in unsuitable conditions.
These eggs will also be disposed of in the re-ation plant," stated the State Veterinary Administration.
When inspecting the live fish stand, it was then found that the seller did not have proof of origin and was not registered for the sale of live fish.
The market is considered a problem from a veterinary point of view for a long time.
Last autumn, for example, veterinarians uncovered an illegal grocery store, with nearly half a ton of unmarked food without proof of origin.
Most could not determine the expiration date, some of the products had an expiration date and were spoiled.
For five kilograms of sepia, the expiration date was exceeded by three years.
Last May, veterinarians and police officers seized 80 kilograms of food without proof of origin, including dried fish, sachries and frozen ducks, some of which were moldy.
Putin talks to Zelensky on the phone before ceasefire in Donbass, Kremlin criticizes planned elections
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke by phone with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky about the situation in Donbass, where a new ceasefire is due to take effect from midnight.
Putin criticized, among other things, the Ukrainian Parliament's decision to hold local elections, according to a kremlin statement; Kiev reported that Zelensky had called for the release of detained Ukrainians.
The new ceasefire was agreed on Wednesday evening by the negotiators of Ukraine and Russia, with the support of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
The ceasefire is due to start after midnight on Monday, be "complete and comprehensive" and pave the way for further provisions of peace agreements to be fulfilled.
Putin told Zelensky in an interview that the Ukrainian parliament's decision to hold local elections goes against the Minsk peace agreement and threatens the prospects for a settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine.
Ukraine's parliament decided last week that the upcoming local elections would not take place in territory controlled by pro-Russian rebels.
The Minsk agreement foresees that Kiev will regain control of the border of Ukrainian lands occupied by separatists with Russia after giving these regions broad autonomy and holding local elections there.
According to Unian, Zelensky's office said the two statesmen agreed on the benefits of the upcoming ceasefire in Donbass, as well as on the need to implement other measures to promote peace in the region, such as demining areas of fighting or withdrawing some troops from the front.
Zelensky also called on Putin to release Ukrainians detained in eastern Ukraine, the occupied Crimea peninsula, and Russia itself.
The Minsk agreement has helped to stop the fighting, but people continue to die in occasional gunfights and artillery attacks on both sides of the front.
The conflict in Donbass has left more than 14,000 dead since spring 2014.
Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of military support for the separatists, which Moscow denies.
Zelensky has made ending the war in Donbass his priority, but there has been no major breakthrough in negotiations.
The unexpected champion in the decathlon is Rykl, the sevens were dominated by Novotná
The defending champion of the last two titles Doležal did not finish the 400 at the end of Saturday's program, Kopecký did not jump the foundation in the pole on Sunday.
The decathlon was long dominated by Latvian representative Reinis Kregers, who is preparing in coach Josef Karas' group, but withdrew after the disc.
Rykl has won two bronze medals from the outdoor Czech Republic so far, this time he was the only decathlon champion to cross the 7,000-strong mark.
Other medals behind him were won by Vilém Stráský and Petr Urbánek.
After the competition, Rykl recalled the absence of Both Adam Sebastian Helcelet and Jiří Sýkora.
"It's a shame the boys weren't here and Kope didn't start, because the results would have looked completely different.
But the title tastes very good, I especially appreciate that I put a person 30 centimeters in the distance.
Then I was still pleased with the stick and I was most disappointed with the discus, where I was below average," he acknowledged on the union's Facebook page.
Kateřina Cachová won the first day of the sevens with a more than 100-point advantage, despite suffering from an ankle injury to her rebound leg.
However, she then registered only 570 cm in the distance sector, did not throw a javelin 40 meters and did not enter the final 800 meters.
Novotná scored 5878 points and won by 241 points ahead of Kateřina Dvořáková.
It came out mainly from a distance, 631 cm is the best Czech performance of the year.
"I really wished it was around the 630.
Yesterday my calf started pulling, but I am very glad that I did not feel it at all and that it did not mean me at all," Novotná said on the union Facebook page.
Organic LPG arrives in the Czech Republic, promises eco-friendly operation
Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) is a well-known alternative fuel in the Czech Republic.
It is especially popular for its significantly lower price compared to petrol or diesel, due to the significantly lower excise duty, but its benefit is also in lower CO2 emissions per kilometre travelled.
Like gasoline and diesel, it has its own environmentally friendly option - "organic LPG".
However, it is quite new - it first appeared on the European market two years ago and arrived in the Czech Republic a few days ago, according to a press release from the Czech LPG Association.
"These days we have received the first fifteen tons of organic LPG, which will be distributed in combination with conventional fossil LPG to our pumping stations," the association quotes Jiří Karlík from Primagas as saying.
However, bio LPG cannot be considered bioethanol or biodiesel.
According to the association, it is chemically the same as the classic oil LPG, which many motorists now refuel into their cars.
Therefore, it is also possible to mix both versions freely.
"The only difference from conventional LPG is the method of production," Ivan Indráček, chairman of the association, says of organic LPG.
This also mentions one of the great advantages of organic LPG over other alternative fuels.
It is easy to transport and store, and the distribution infrastructure is also quite good, e.g. compared to hydrogen or electricity.
Currently, this gas is obtained as a by-product in the production of bioethanol from food residues and sugar cane.
In the future, it should also be produced in a targeted way, e.g. from celluluse biomass, i.e. from wood waste.
In contrast, conventional oil LPG is partly produced as a by-product of oil refining, partly by separation in natural gas extraction.
As a result, depending on the production technology and source, the operation of the car on organic LPG is 40-70% more environmentally friendly in terms of carbon footprint than oil LPG operation and up to 90% compared to diesel.
However, it is not about co2 emissions from the exhaust of the car, but about the ecology of fuel production, i.e. the so-called "well-to-tank" part.
Some of the largest producers of organic LPG currently include petrochemical companies Eni, Total and Neste.
According to a recent update of the National Action Plan on Clean Mobility (NAP ČM), Unipetrol is also exploring the possibility of production in its Litvínov refinery.
According to the association's estimates, there are about 170,000 LPG vehicles in the Czech Republic; The Ministry of the Environment lists a slightly higher number in NAP ČM, roughly 200 thousand.
According to statistics from the Ministry of Transport, almost 6,000 lpg-powered car rebuilds were carried out last year alone.
It is possible to refuel LPG in the Czech Republic at about 950 stations of various operators.
Vojtěch revised the number of infected, the number decreased by 1775 cases
Health Minister Adam Vojtěch (for YES) ordered the Ministry to revise the number of people infected with the coronavirus virus.
The new statistics were published on sunday by the Ministry of Health on its website.
The figure fell to 3,479 cases on Sunday afternoon from 5,254 on Saturday, down from 1,775 on Saturday.
There are currently 3422 patients in the Czech Republic.
"Behind the jump in the number of cured is a revision of the data, which health officials have not been able to update recently," said Jaroslav Dušek, head of health statistics.
By Sunday afternoon, 15,212 people in the Czech Republic had contracted coronavirus, 11,419 had recovered and 371 had unfortunately succumbed to Covid-19.
Mobile election units or correspondence.
Political scientist and sociologist were looking for variants for the pandemic
According to Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD), a change in the law is needed in order for people quarantined due to coronavirus to vote in october's regional and senate elections.
Parliament could debate it in August or September under an accelerated regime.
He made the statement on Sunday in The Game of Prima TELEVISION.
On Tuesday, he wants to discuss possible solutions with representatives of parliamentary parties at the Ministry.
"Whatever we do, it will have to mean a change in the electoral law," Hamáček said.
On Wednesday, the Senate called on the government to find a solution under the applicable legal rules.
However, the Minister stated that it would be necessary to amend the provision of the law according to which people quarantined due to health conditions cannot vote.
The voting ban should be maintained, for example, for patients with open tuberculosis.
Daniel Prokop stated on the OVM programme that the possibility of a correspondence election has been postponed since 2004.
Even the current bill, which is in the Chamber of Deputies, provides for its introduction for voting abroad, but not in the Czech Republic.
At the same time, Prokop considers the concerns of ANO or ČSSD (because, according to experience from abroad, it would rather be recorded by other types of parties) from the correspondence election as overestimation.
In person, he is opposed to the possibility of electronic voting, where there is a considerable possibility of abuse.
Michal Klíma said that it is now necessary to devise ad hoc mechanisms (elections) that could be carried out already this year and with as little health risk as possible.
He considers it the main one to be ready for 2021, when parliamentary elections are to take place in the Czech Republic.
He considers correspondence choice (whether abroad or also in the Czech Republic) to be one of the functional methods.
Next, he sees the aforementioned electoral units or the possibility of a proxy vote within the family.
He added that it was possible to learn how similar situations - the coronavirus elections - were handled in Croatia, Poland or France.
Due to the spread of coronavirus, various types of elections in 67 countries around the world have already been postponed this year.
Buharsk protests: Pig ears thrown by protesters at government building
Demonstrators against Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov and his cabinet threw pig ears at the government building.
It was another in a series of protests against the "mafia style of governance" that have been taking place in Sofia and other cities for almost three weeks.
Organizers are planning a nationwide blockade on Wednesday, DPA reported.
Today's protest, which took place for the 18th day in a row, had a weaker turnout than the previous one, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Svoboda.
About 300 people had gathered as of 8 p.m., some streets had to be closed to traffic.
Demonstrators staged a theatrical scene in front of the government building, symbolically locking prime minister Borisov and Attorney General Ivan Geshev in connection with the arrest of two advisers to President Rumen Radev, a strong political opponent of the Prime Minister.
The resignations of both are among the protesters' basic demands.
They also called for the lifting of the announced health reform and an end to corruption in construction on the Black Sea coast.
Protest organizer Nikolai Hadzhigenov said on public radio today that a "peak of escalation" was planned for Wednesday in the form of "a nationwide rally in Sofia and blockades throughout the country."
He reiterated his demand for the resignation of Borisov and his government, as well as the call for early elections.
The regular ones should take place in March 2021.
Borisov has previously stated that he does not intend to resign.
He justified this, inter alia, by the need to implement Bulgaria with the covid-19 pandemic and the resulting economic crisis.
On Friday, however, he replaced five members of his government team, though the concession did not aothe the protesters.
Earlier this week, Borisov's government survived a vote of confidence in parliament.
Bologna coach Mihajlovic no longer wants matches without spectators
Bologna football coach Siniša Mihajlovič has had enough of Italian league matches without spectators.
The Serbian coach hopes that from the new season fans will return to the stadiums.
"What we're running here at the moment is not football.
I'm sick of games without spectators.
It's genderless football, it brings me no emotion, no joy.
These fights are worse than practice.
It's terrible to play like that and I don't think I'm the only one who thinks so," Mihajlovic said before today's match against Lecce.
The coronavirus break is followed by Seed A matches in quick succession, and although they are not played until the evening, their players are exposed to the heat.
"We play every three days in terrible heat.
You can't even tell where the teams are in these conditions.
I want this season to be over.
These measures had to be taken to finish the competition, but I hope that from September the fans will be back," said the coach, who has also led Fiorentina and AC Milan in the past.
For Mihajlovice, this season is also unusual because he missed four months on the bench due to leukemia treatment.
"Despite my illness, the break in the league and everything else, our team has managed to take it to the next level.
We want to keep growing and to do that we need players to be mentally stronger," he said.
We have been the target of a cyberattack by foreign states, iran claims
Since late June, fires and explosions have been reported from a number of Iranian military, industrial and nuclear facilities, as well as oil refineries, power plants, factories and businesses.
Some Iranian officials have said that a fire that broke out this month at the Underground Nuclear Plant in Natanz may have been caused by cyber sabotage.
The cause of a number of other incidents has not yet been explained.
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Musavi told reporters, according to Iranian media, that the Islamic Republic's infrastructure faces "thousands of cyberattacks" daily.
He added that this was not a new phenomenon and that most of them would be repeled.
According to Musaví, several wider cyberattacks have been recorded in recent months, with "certain governments and groups" behind them, according to analyses.
However, he did not give further details about the possible perpetrators, according to Reuters.
Musaví also added that fires in forests, refineries and other places are common in summer.
An article by Iran's state-owned IRNA agency this month said iran's enemies, such as Israel and the US, may have been behind recent incidents.
However, neither of these countries was directly accused of specific attacks in the article.
Iran and the United States severed diplomatic ties shortly after the 1979 revolution, when Iranian militants attacked the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.
Long-strained relations between the two countries sharpened in 2018 after Washington withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers and imposed sanctions on Iran that have a severe impact on its economy.
Another significant escalation came this year after the U.S. military killed Iranian General Kasem Soleymani and Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi Muhandis on January 3.
Iran then fired a number of missiles at bases in Iraq where the Americans operate on January 8.
The US has only recently admitted that dozens of American soldiers have been wounded.
Israel regards Iran as its archenemy, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a major opponent of the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran.
According to the Israeli Prime Minister, Iran is trying to develop an atomic bomb, which Iran denies.
TPCA extends production shutdown, now until May 25
Cologne-made Toyota Peugeot Citroën Automobile (TPCA) has again extended production shutdowns due to coronavirus.
Production lines are expected to restart on Monday, May 25.
Dozens of hygiene measures will accompany the start, said Tomáš Paroubek, a spokesman for the carmaker.
Production has been costing since the evening of March 18 due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Originally, the company intended to renew it on Monday, May 18.
According to Paroubek, the reason for the extension of the shutdown is closed borders and closed dealerships, so there is no one to sell cars.
According to Paroubek, the company will produce 100 percent from the beginning, i.e. for two shifts.
Key markets of the company, such as Italy, the United Kingdom or Spain, are affected by the coronavirus.
Mayor Michael Kašpar (Change for Cologne) said that the production shutdown at TPCA does not affect life in the city.
"You could tell at first, the city was empty.
But gradually the streets are filling up, especially now since Monday, when it got a lot loose.
So the city is full," Kaspar said.
According to him, there are no complications even with foreign workers who have stayed in hostels.
"In those two months, we had almost no problem to solve," Kaspar said.
For example, Škoda Auto in Mladoboleslav, which also ceased production due to the coronavirus crisis, resumed production on Monday, April 27, at all three of its production plants in the Czech Republic.
Neither plant works at 100 percent capacity.
The resumption of production in Skoda was accompanied by more than 80 hygiene measures.
On the night of Monday to Tuesday, the third night shift took place in Mladá Boleslav and Kvasiny for the first time after the resumption of production.
About 2,500 people currently work at TPCA and the company represents one of the largest exporters in the Czech Republic and also an employer in Kolín.
Cancer killed bride shortly after wedding: She left a message for family
Gemma Sisson had been battling insidious cancer for more than two years, and just when she seemed to have beaten the cancer, the disease came back.
The 39-year-old, who loved bodybuilding, ended up in a hospice bed, where she still managed to marry the love of her life.
Unfortunately, she succumbed to the disease.
A few hours after her death, a shocking message appeared on her Facebook account for those closest to her.
Gemma Sisson, originally from Leeds, England, loved bodybuilding.
She and her boyfriend Ricky Moore, with whom she had lived for more than 16 years, toured competitions held around the world.
The 39-year-old played sports and lived healthily, yet she was diagnosed with cancer in April 2018.
Gemma started exhausting treatment, radiotherapy, in the hope of recovering.
After months of treatment, Gemma really seemed to have managed to win over cancer, but in August 2019 the cancer returned and this time attacked her spine.
The bodybuilder and personal trainer underwent 10-hour spinal surgery and then started drastic treatment again, according to the British Daily Mirror.
But everything was in vain.
Earlier this year, on her 39th birthday, doctors told her she had a few months to live.
In April, the handsome blonde finally decided to join a hospice in Leeds, where she was visited by her family, who even arranged a wedding to her love Ricky.
The marriage lasted two months.
Ricky took Gemma to a restaurant for their two-month anniversary.
Four days later, Gemma died in his arms.
Just hours after her death, a post Gema wrote for her family appeared on her social media account.
"If this has been made public, it means that I have finally died after weeks of fighting too long.
Although I will be heartbroken to leave my loved ones behind, I will be so happy to get rid of what this terrible disease has caused me.
I can't thank Ricky enough who's been by my side all along and given me a huge amount of love and support during that terrible time," she wrote on social media, noting that the pain and suffering had finally stopped and she had found peace.
"I am also grateful for all the support I have received from all my followers on social media," she wrote, noting that everyone should appreciate their lives and live them to the fullest.
Art machines sell sweat dating, mushroom amulet and pexeso
For 100 crowns, passersby will get a pocket work of mostly novice Czech artists.
They create images and other creations directly for artmat, so they know in advance that they must fit up to a size of 8.5 to 5.5 centimeters.
Each piece is numbered and signed.
"There is always a curatorial text about the artist and then the work itself," said the project curator Petra Widžová.
Artmat works with the principle of chance.
The buyer can be surprised by what work of art he gets.
At the moment, he can become the new owner of fantastic illustrations by Alexandra Štoplová or mini-perspectives by Tereza Bonaventurová, which can also be sent.
The artist Punx 23, in cooperation with Dora Dutková, prepared a pexeso associated with a walk through Prague.
Cards need to be paired with house signs.
Ilona Polanski created a tattoo collection for Artmat.
Marie Ladrová and Juliána Chomová sell pocket packs of spirituality: the first of the artists offers a protective amulet of boldness and a fortune-teller card, the second series of illustrations based on her comic book Spiritist.
Health-care salaries will rise by no more than five percent next year.
According to Vojtěch, a larger increase is unrealistic
Salaries in the health sector could increase by no more than five percent next year, health minister Adam Vojtěch (for YES) said in Václav Moravec's Questions on Czech TELEVISION.
He considers the union's demand for an increase of up to 15 percent unrealistic.
He also said that the state should strive to be self-sufficient in providing protective equipment.
Hospitals now have their supplies, he says.
"I think the increase (of salaries) may be somewhere up to five percent," the minister said.
According to him, it is necessary to reflect the current situation, when since March the coronavirus pandemic and government regulations against its spread have intervened in the collection of insurance premiums.
Insurance companies' incomes fell at the time.
"I find the 15 percent increase unrealistic at the moment," Vojtěch said.
The average monthly earnings of a doctor in acute inpatient care according to data from the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (IZIS) are likely to reach CZK 88,312 this year, while nurses CZK 47,498.
The difference between the salary of nurses in state hospitals and the salary of other founders will be up to SEVEN THOUSAND CROWNS.
IRS data also show that the decline of nurses in hospitals has stopped.
The average wage in the Czech Republic in 2019 was CZK 34,125, according to data from the Czech Statistical Office.
Trade union representatives said back in June that they would demand a minimum increase of 10 percent, ideally 15 percent, for 2021.
They criticize the long-term significant difference between the earnings of doctors and nurses in state hospitals, which must be governed by pay tables, and contract pay in hospitals of cities, counties or private ones.
They therefore also demand that the pay tables be uniform for health professionals.
For nurses this year, the difference will be up to seven thousand crowns per month.
For example, for doctors, wages grew faster than salaries last year.
According to Roman Šmucler, President of the Czech Dental Chamber, trade unionists should perceive how the state is currently doing.
The House recently approved an increase in this year's state budget deficit to a record CZK 500 billion due to the effects of the covid epidemic, of which CZK 1.75 billion is to go to the remuneration of health professionals in hospitals and social services.
According to Shmucler, the Board of Health Care Providers disagrees with the across-the-board pay increase next year.
According to him, remuneration should be decided by hospitals and health facilities themselves, and the extra money should go to them through the reimbursement decree.
Vojtěch also stated that hospitals currently have enough protective equipment.
Pavel Brother-in-Law, chairman of the State Material Reserves Administration (SSHR), said this week that the administration does not currently have a single protective medical device in its possession.
Pending completion of tenders.
According to Vojtěch, suppliers around the world are now able to deliver goods better than in March, when they were bought out.
According to him, the state should also try to be as self-sufficient as possible and also buy from Czech companies.
The scrubbing smart quarantine could be taken over by soldiers.
We're ready, they say
"Smart quarantine works, there's room for improvement, of course.
We're going to discuss it with the military tonight.
The army works perfectly and the question is whether they should run the whole thing again," the Prime Minister said on his Facebook show Zhou people on Sunday.
According to him, it is not possible to sufficiently connect IT systems and hygiene stations, which gradually have to switch to more modern methods of operation.
According to the Prime Minister, the problems were in the Moravian-Silesian Region, where there are some of the current outbreaks of the epidemic.
Defense Ministry spokesman Jan Pejšek told ČTK that he did not have information about Sunday's meeting and that the government should discuss the matter on Monday.
The army, he says, is ready for this move.
The smart quarantine project was taken over by the Ministry of Health on 25 May.
Until then, the smart quarantine was led by a 90-member central management team set up under the army as an advisory body to the government, led by the former minister's deputy Roman Prymula.
The scrubbing project was criticized on Sunday by Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD).
He, too, suggested that the army might take him back in.
Previously, the government's IT and digitization commissioner Vladimír Dzurilla, who is in charge of it, admitted shortcomings in the project.
"The system is working, but it's still in the works.
For 20 years it was created independently and non-systemically, now we are trying to unify it in a few months.
It's not galloping.
People on the go, poor sanitation people are adapting the new systems on the go and actually making mistakes," he said.
Ostrava Mayor Macura will not run again, because he does not want to "fool around in politics"
The current Mayor of Ostrava, Tomáš Macura (ANO), will not stand in the next municipal elections.
The reason for this is an effort not to "fool around in politics," he told Respekt.cz.
Macura, who is also a member of the ANO presidency, has been mayor of Ostrava since November 2014.
In the 2018 municipal elections, the ANO candidate in Ostrava won almost a third of the vote.
Macura originally wanted to be in office for only four years.
"I thought I'd last one term, and with the business experience, I can turn things around and get it back on its feet," he told Respekt.
He added that he had been persuaded to some extent for a second term.
"But for me, it's the maximum.
I don't want to fool around in politics," added Macura, who in an interview described himself as a heavy introvert who doesn't like frequent contact with people.
According to Respekt, there has been speculation for some time about Macur's possible end in the YES movement.
The server recalls that Macura has criticized the ANO movement several times, for example for its alliance with the SPD movement or for supporting Miloš Zeman in the presidential elections.
As one of the few ANO personalities, he supported Zeman's opponent Jiří Drahoše in the elections.
Macura has no plans to leave the ANO movement he joined in 2017.
"As long as I feel like I can make a change in the movement, that it's not a completely futile fight, and that no one's going to get in my way, I have no immediate motive to quit," he told Respekt.
Macura, 56, graduated from the University of Economics in Prague.
Before becoming Mayor of Ostrava in 2014, Macura served as, among other things, director of the pharmaceutical company Walmark.
He also sat on the bodies of other companies.
Uber returning to Brno offering transport services
Uber, which offers transport services, will return to Brno at the end of July.
This is a consequence of a change in the law, Petr Kratochvíl (ODS), brno's transport councillor, said in a press statement on Thursday.
Taxi drivers protested against Uber in Brno, pointing out that Uber did not meet conditions such as a taxi or taximeter.
However, the conditions for operating regular taxis and alternative taxis have changed since July.
Kratochvíl has had several meetings with Uber representatives in recent weeks.
"Based on them, this company decided to return to Brno at the end of July this year with its services.
This is the result of a change in the law that allows this company to operate legally.
The city has been made aware of this change and we believe that the company will operate its services within the given limits," said Kratochvíl.
Uber has operated in Brno in the past.
Taxi drivers protested against it because of the unmarked vehicles as taxis or missing meters.
The court issued a preliminary order banning Uber from driving in the city.
Brno originally supported taxi drivers, but at the end of last year Mayor Markéta Vaňková (ODS) said that the city would like to take steps to make Uber work in Brno.
According to later court rulings, Uber was able to ride in Brno, but the company did not take advantage of this.
He will now return as a result of a change in the law.
Since July, in addition to classic taxis with a flashlight and taximeter, it is easier to operate a transport service ordered and paid exclusively via mobile applications.
Too exuberant celebration in Brno: a flying chair landed a meter from a man on the pavement
An office chair flew out of the fourth floor of the apartment building in Brno on Saturday evening and landed about a meter from the sidewalk.
A pedestrian was after him at that moment, who immediately called the officers.
Upon arrival at the address in the western part of the city, the patrol noticed an open window, under which a chair was still lying, and several cans and cigarette butts beside it.
"The noise that was being carried from the room on the fourth floor indicated that there was a rather noisy celebration going on inside.
Officers went down the hall to the apartment and asked the three young men present, aged between 26 and 29, for an explanation," said jakub Ghanem, a spokesman for the officers.
Babiš discusses the request to dismiss Rafaj with ČSSD
Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO) plans to discuss with the coalition Social Democrats on Monday a request for the removal of the head of the antitrust office (IOC), Petr Rafaj.
The non-profit organisations called for the dismissal of Rafaj at the meeting of the government's anti-corruption council, as well as the Ústí Region.
The Social Democrats say that an exchange at the head of the office is appropriate.
According to information provided by ČTK, Rafaj was not invited to the Cabinet Office on Monday.
His second mandate expires in the middle of next year, and he cannot be appointed for a third time by law.
His removal is the responsibility of President Miloš Zeman.
In addition to the call of non-profit organizations, the Prime Minister also received a letter with a similar request from the Ústí Region.
The reason is, among other things, the Rafaj cases of recent times.
Last week, the Prime Minister refused to comment on the request, saying he would familiarise himself with the material and that the governing parties would take "some position" on the matter.
He also stated that he had not yet discussed the challenges with the President, and that he had no meeting with him any time soon.
According to the office of the Office of the Office of The Office of Appeal, there is no reason because Rafaj has not been charged with anything.
The IHNED.cz and Aktuálně.cz reported last week that the police were interested in Rafaj's meetings with The Governor Jiří Čunk.
The meetings were linked, among other things, to the decision to compete for the project of the controversial new Zlín hospital for eight billion, which Čunek is pushing hard.
Piggy admitted the meetings, which he said were his "Senate activities" together.
Rafaj speaks similarly.
The Usti Region Council called on the government to remove Rafaj at the end of June.
It also calls for a reform of the Office's decision-making mechanisms.
According to Deputy Governor for Transport Jaroslav Komek, the decision of the Office for Public Procurement is not transparent and has signs of arbitraried character.
Last March, police intervened with the antitrust authority over a toll tender.
In June this year, Aktuálně.cz pointed out that Rafaj was using apartments written on the company of the influential behind-the-scenes player ČSSD Alexander Čuba.
However, a deposit of 3.5 million for an apartment in Brno was paid from Rafaj's account.
Rafaj has been president of the Office for the Protection of Competition since 9 July 2009, and the president appointed the former Social Democrat MP in June 2015 for a second term.
In less than a year, Rafaj's second six-year mandate expires.
The Antitrust Act states that the President may dismiss the President of the Office on a proposal from the Government.
It may be revoked only if it has not held office for more than six months or seriously undermines the dignity of its office or the independence and impartiality of the Office.
In the Blanen library, employees were collapsing in the heat.
Air conditioning will help
The new technology will cost 740,000 and will be operational in the second half of August.
"It's good news for me.
My three children and I go to the library in the center of Blansko regularly.
In the warm months, however, it was practically impossible to endure.
It was very hot and bad air.
Ventilation didn't help.
That's why I'm happy for the air conditioning," said One of Blanen's readers, Petr Novotný.
According to the director of the library Lukáš Dlapa, temperatures in the building often climbed up to thirty degrees.
The southern wall of the building is glazed and acts as a greenhouse on sunny days.
"Moreover, the sun leans into it for much of the day due to the curvature of the building.
At the same time, it is a big problem to ventilate individual departments, because windows must be closed overnight for safety reasons.
We often have 30 degrees in the library since the morning," Dlapa said.
The worst was the study and reading room on the third floor.
And upstairs, there's the exhibition rooms and the principal's room.
The unpleasant climate was also in the children's ward, which is located under the roof of the building.
"Several times it happened that librarians at work were collapsing and ended up incapacitated.
The problem also regularly ate in the cultural room at lectures attended by dozens of people.
After a few minutes, it was impossible to breathe," Dlapa said.
Originally, city representatives wanted to make air conditioning in all areas of the library this year.
In the end, there will be only three circuits out of five.
"Due to limited funding, only the most troublesome spaces will have air conditioning.
Study and reading room on the third floor.
Furthermore, the cultural room and the children's department one floor above," said Jiří Svoboda from the Blaen investment department.
He added that in the first phase, workers had already installed air conditioning in the premises last autumn and modified the wiring.
For approximately 360 thousand crowns.
The Blansko Municipal Library has almost 3,000 registered readers.
Of these, it's about nine hundred to fifteen years old.
Chicago's support drove out the coronavirus.
Crawford returns to the game
Not every one of the infected athletes will come clean.
Especially when it comes to NHL players who keep quiet about players' health like graves and don't post anything at all.
Crawford was one of the few to step out of the lineup.
The 35-year-old Montreal native was only present at the first practice, and has been absent from the lineup ever since.
"I would like to inform you all that I tested positive for Covid-19 and because of that I have spent the last fortnight locked up in my house," he said, revealing the reason for his absence.
Fans don't have to worry about his health anymore.
Crawford is ready to throw himself back into full load.
"It's amazing to be back.
I will do everything I can to get in shape as soon as possible," he added.
The experienced goaltender won two Stanley Cups with Chicago, and is a solid part of the goaltending for the 10th season in a row.
The Blackhawks will face St. Louis in the preseason.
Thousands protest in Israel against pm
Thousands of Israelis in several parts of the country have protested against unemployment, corruption and the way Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu handles the coronavirus crisis.
The rallies took place outside Netanyahu's private villa in Caesarea, near his official residence, and in a park in Tel Aviv, among others.
Protests have been held regularly in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv for several weeks.
Their participants are demanding Netanyahu's resignation because of a process in which he is accused of corruption and fraud, as well as the government's handling of the next wave of the coronavirus epidemic.
"Bibi, go home," one of the protesters wrote on his banner, referring to Netanyahu's well-known nickname, according to AP.
"Everyone can see the Emperor has lost his clothes," read another.
Netanyahu, 70, is israel's first prime minister to be tried in office.
He is charged with three charges of corruption, fraud and abuse of trust.
He denies all the charges, calling them a witch hunt.
According to local media, the trial could take up to three years, with over 300 witnesses called.
The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has been confirmed in Nearly 60,500 people in Israel, which has a population of about nine million.
Some 455 people died as a result of the outbreak.
In March, the Israeli government introduced quarantine measures to help reduce daily increases in the infected.
However, after the gradual easing of restrictions since the end of April, the number of infected began to rise significantly again, especially at the end of June.
Netanyahu's critics argue that the government has not helped enough, for example, sole traders affected by quarantine measures.
Protesters also resent the fact that the government issues sometimes contradictory instructions in the fight against coronavirus.
The driver smashed the car against a tree and died.
The body had to be cut out of the wreckage by firefighters.
The tragic accident happened around 11 p.m. near Neveklov on a narrow district leading from the Slapy Dam.
The driver apparently flew down into the woods at considerable speed and smashed the car against a tree.
He died at the scene.
The body had to be removed from the wreckage by firefighters, among other things, they cut off the roof.
The circumstances of the crash are being investigated by police.
They ordered a forensic autopsy to clarify, among other things, whether the man was driving under the influence of alcohol or other addictive substances.
No more wasting and churning out one collection after another.
Pietro Filipi cancels discounts and bets on sustainability
The Czech clothing brand Pietro Filipi wants to focus on sustainability and is embarking on a fundamental change of strategy.
He cancels discounts and no longer wants to churn out one collection after another.
The fact that the fashion industry is one of the largest environmental polluters is nothing new.
Billions of pieces of clothing end up in incineration and landfills every year.
But the view of slow fashion, often a despised approach to dressing, has changed quite quickly in recent years.
About half of Pietro Filipi's goods were sold at full price.
The other half, which was sold thanks to discounts, will not simply be bought.
The company does not want to churn out one collection after another and at the end of each season make products cheaper below their production price.
Moreover, according to owner Michal Mička, the days of new and old collections and blind follow of rapidly changing fashion trends are gone.
"Most discount retailers already count on discounts when buying goods, so a much higher margin is included in the full price.
So it's actually a bit of a scam," says Pietro Filipi owner Michal Mička.
In addition, the company also wants to support local business with its approach.
"Each of our products is made of carefully selected quality fabrics and designed by local designers.
We emphasize that a large part of our collection is made up of so-called basic pieces - i.e. clothes that are timeless and above-season.
Worldwide, the premium brands segment is typical in the absence of any discounts, the price of the product simply corresponds to its quality and there is no need for a discount," adds Mička.
Giant graffiti features RAF airman Kurt Taussig
"The assignment was to create something to mark the anniversary of the end of the war.
And I remembered our fighter pilot who fought in the Ranks of the British Royal Air Force in World War II.
The city management liked the design," said Vacek, who finished his work after a fortnight of intensive work.
In doing so, he consumed about 300 liters of paint and 50 sprays.
Kurt Taussig was born in 1923 in Teplice-Shanov.
He left town when he was 15 years old.
During the war, because of his Jewish origin, the Nazis took him to an internment camp, where he was held for several weeks.
However, thanks to Nicholas Winton's organization, he and his brother managed to avoid the concentration camp.
In 1939, Taussig entered the UK, where he volunteered to join the Royal Air Force (RAF), and then underwent pilot training in South Rhodesia and Palestine, Africa.
He joined combat operations in early 1945.
After the Velvet Revolution, he visited the Czech Republic several times and his native Teplice, which granted him honorary citizenship.
Kamil Vacek, 46, known by his street graphic art industry as Camo, has been working with spray paint on teplice streets for more than 20 years.
He started with graffiti on areas that were set aside for these purposes by the then Mayor Jaroslav Kubera (ODS).
Storm Hanna hits the Texas coast
Hurricane Hanna made landmack on the southwest coast of the US state of Texas on Saturday afternoon local time (before midnight CEST tonight).
It hit Padre Island, Texas, about 15 miles north of Port Mansfield, and weakened to a tropical storm as it moved over land.
However, according to meteorologists, it poses a great danger to coastal residents.
It brought with it strong winds and intense rainfall; along with local flooding, power outages and various material damage, including damaged ships, are reported, according to AP.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott declared a state of natural disaster for 32 counties in southwest Texas on Saturday and advised people to evacuate voluntary.
The strongest warnings were issued by people from the coastal strip between Port Mansfield and Mesquite Bay, but in total the element is to hit an area of nearly 300 miles before gradually moving over northeastern Mexico.
"Although Hanna is now a tropical storm, heavy rain and wind, rising levels, dangerous surf and isolated tornadoes may pose a threat," the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) warned.
This morning local time (afternoon CEST), the storm was moving in the U.S.-Mexico border area, accompanied by winds of 85 kilometers per hour .
Hanna on Saturday became the first hurricane of this year's atlantic hurricane season.
It was accompanied by winds of up to 145 kilometers per hour over the Gulf of Mexico, but it gradually weakened to 112 kilometers per hour as it made landfall, again knocking Hanna out of the hurricane category.
Authorities urged locals to weather the storm at home, not forgetting the hygiene measures associated with preventing the spread of coronavirus.
Texas is one of the U.S. states most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Given the existing security measures and the need to observe the distances, possible evacuations are also a major challenge.
Makeshift shelters were opened in hotels, schools and gymnasiums.
In Hidalgo County, Texas, one of the buildings was also adapted to shelter evacuees who tested positive for coronavirus or were otherwise exposed to the disease.
Local authorities have urged all evacuees to take masks and disinfectant gels with them to the shelter if possible.
"We're far from over it yet.
We expect catastrophic flooding," ap quoted Chris Birchfield, who works for the National Weather Service (NWS) in Brownsville, as saying.
Forecasters say up to 300 millimetres of rain could fall in some places in a matter of hours, and in some cases nearly 500 millimetres, which, along with rising sea levels, could flood a number of coastal settlements.
Zeman will besten the general rank to Colonel Lipko
On Wednesday, President Miloš Zeman will bestowed the general rank on Colonel Pavel Lipko.
This is based on a review of the expected events of the Ministry of Defence.
The reason for the lending of the rank of brigadier general is the arrival of Lipka in August as deputy commander of the alliance multinational division northeast of Poland.
Lipka still serves as deputy commander of the ground forces of the Czech army.
Zeman's promotion at the end of June was proposed by the government.
Since the beginning of August, Lipka will replace Brigadier General Karel Řehka as deputy commander of the multinational northeast division in Elblag, Poland, which commands the alliance's forward presence in Poland and the Baltics.
Řehka became director of the National Cyber and Information Security Office (NÚKIB) in March.
The government has proposed to the President that he bestowed the rank of brigadier general on Lipko.
Under the Professional Soldiers Act, a higher rank may be bestowed on a soldier for the duration of his elected office or for the duration of the service task required by the assignment of a higher rank.
The position of deputy commander of the alliance division corresponds to the general rank.
A soldier to whom a rank has been bestowed has the same rights and obligations as if he had been appointed to that rank.
However, it is not entitled to a salary adjustment that corresponds to the rank.
The lending of rank lasts until the reason for which it was granted has been granted has been over.
"Colonel Lipka demonstrates high professional readiness and is a role model for subordinates.
It participates significantly in the performance of the tasks of the Armed Forces of the Czech Republic, including cooperation with foreign partners and ensuring the participation of the army in foreign operations," the Ministry of Defence said in June on the proposal for promotion.
Wednesday's promotion will take place at 12:30 p.m. at Prague Castle, attended by Defense Minister Lubomir Metnar and Chief of General Staff Aleš Opata.
EU countries have coronavirus standards for aviation
European Union countries have agreed common hygiene standards for air travel to help limit the spread of the new coronavirus.
This was announced by German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer.
Among the agreed standards is to observe the distance or wear face masks on the plane and at the airport, but the middle seats on the planes will not have to remain unoccupied.
Reuters reported.
"I am glad that my colleagues have adopted the German proposal for Europe and that we have been able to agree on these uniform standards," Scheuer said at the European Aviation Conference.
The German Ministry of Transport then added that the agreement had been concluded by officials and had yet to be formally approved by ministers.
The agreed measures include a requirement to cover the mouth and nose for passengers from the age of six, to observe the recommended distance during security checks and check-in at the airport.
Air must also be provided with sufficient fresh air and all information must be available in several languages.
The airline will also be able to occupy the middle seats.
The common rules agreed by officials meet at least some of the requirements of the airlines.
Different standards caused confusion.
A temperature record has fallen in the Arctic Svalbard, measuring almost 22 degrees
"A 41-year-old record has fallen in Longyearbyen," the Norwegian Meteorological Institute said on Twitter.
In the evening, the temperature there rose to 21.7 degrees Celsius, breaking the 1979 record by 0.4 degrees, he added.
The roughly 2,000-strong Longyearbyen is the largest city in Svalbard, located about 1,300 kilometers from the North Pole.
Svalbard heats up faster than almost any other place on Earth.
This highlights the dangers of warming other parts of the Arctic - from Alaska to Siberia, according to a report last year by the Norwegian Center for Climate Studies.
According to him, the average temperature in Svalbard has risen by three to five degrees since the 1970s.
By 2100, it may rise by as much as ten degrees if greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere are not reduced.
The rise in temperature can result in melting of eternally frozen soil in Svalbard, which threatens the stability of many buildings, roads or airports and can cause more avalanches and landslides.
Climate warming also threatens arctic fauna, such as polar bears and seals, which depend on the ocean's ice cover.
Britons returning from Spain face mandatory two-week quarantine
The British Cabinet also urged citizens to avoid all non-essential travel to mainland Spain because of the risk of covid-19 spreading.
The Canary and Balearic Islands are therefore not mentioned, but even after returning from them, people have to be isolated for two weeks.
The new rules come into force at midnight.
"Protecting public health is our absolute priority.
We have taken this decision to prevent the possible spread of the virus in Britain," British diplomacy said in a statement.
"We have always made it clear that if necessary, we will immediately remove a country from the safe list," she added.
As the British newspaper Metro noted, the latest announcement will hit the travel plans of thousands of Britons.
Spain is a very popular holiday destination.
Britons are concerned, among other things, about whether they will be paid sick leave if they have to end up in isolation for 14 days after returning from holidays.
Neil Hunter from Sittingbourne, for example, booked a 10-day holiday to Lanzarote, and was due to leave on Tuesday.
The tour has been booked since December.
"We were supposed to go the whole family, my wife Amanda and daughter Bethany, but to be honest, after this announcement, I don't know what's going to happen.
I work as an engineer and I don't think my employer will accept that I will be quarantined for two weeks after returning from vacation," Metro quoted Hunter as saying.
In relation to Spain, there are concerns that the country is at the beginning of the second wave of the epidemic.
In the last two days, over 900 new infections have been added in 24 hours.
Authorities are already tightening coronavirus measures in some areas, such as Catalonia, which is trying to limit all nightlife and prevent people from meeting in large numbers.
The Czech Foreign Ministry has recently highlighted the increased risk of infection in Catalonia, Aragon, the Basque Country and the Madrid region.
The model of the purchase of electricity from Dukovan will be discussed by the government
On Monday, the government will discuss the model of electricity purchase from the planned new dukovany nuclear power plant block.
The bill provides that if the feed-in tariff is higher than the price of power electricity on the market, all consumers will pay the difference through tariffs.
In the latter case, where the feed-in price is lower than the market price, the impact on consumers will be reversed.
Power electricity is an unregulated part of the final price of electricity for customers.
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry Karel Havlíček (for YES) and CEZ energy company have previously stated that the more likely option is that people will save on electricity thanks to the construction.
Analysts, on the other hand, point out that the long-term outlook for electricity prices in the markets is always uncertain, as developments have shown several times in the past.
The plan has previously been criticized by environmental organizations.
"The feed-in price may be both below and above the market price for power electricity.
Thus, the final impact at the time of application of the rule can be both negative and positive.
The impact is spread among customers according to the size of the circuit breaker - with lower consumption or electricity consumption - with higher electricity consumption," the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MPO) said in the materials.
Havlíček said in May that he expected the wholesale price of electricity to rise and people at the Dukovan construction site would make money.
Otherwise, the impact will be in the tens of crowns per year per family, which, according to him, is much less than people pay in electricity invoices every year to support so-called supported sources.
He had previously estimated that the feed-in price could be between 50 and 60 euros (about 1,320 to 1,600 CZK) per megawatt hour (MWh).
The submitted material does not contain any draft amount, it is to be included only in the purchase agreement.
The price of electricity on the Prague Energy Exchange for 2021, for which traders now stock up the most, is currently around 45 euros (about 1190 CZK) per MWh.
"With a difference in the feed-in tariff and the market price of 10 euros, the balance of the average household with a consumption of 3.3 MWh per year could be equal to a four-person household, equipped with electrical appliances, including an electric hob and an oven, but which does not use electricity for heating and hot water heating - less than CZK 100/year," the Ministry of Industry and Social Security wrote in its documents.
"We live in extremely turbulent times.
The coronavirus pandemic has shown us how vulnerable the global economy is.
For this reason, I consider the long-term prediction of market prices to be a speculative matter," Tomáš Voltr, Executive Director of the Energy Financial Group, told ČTK earlier.
The proposed law provides that the purchase would be carried out by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security or by a legal entity authorised by the State at a predetermined price.
A contract between the investor and the State guaranteeing the conditions for the purchase of electricity would be concluded for a minimum of 30 years, with a possible extension of ten years, even a repeated, but no longer than until the end of low-carbon production.
It defines the low-carbon production as a nuclear reactor power plant connected to an electricity system with an installed capacity of at least 100 megawatts (MW) after 2030.
Havlíček previously stated that the new Dukovan block should have a capacity of 1200 MW and generate nine terawatt hours of electricity per year, which would correspond to one-tenth of the expected Czech consumption.
The block is expected to be operational in 2036.
The funding model for the new Dukovan bloc was approved by the government on Monday.
The state should finance the installation interest-free during construction, with 2% interest expected during operation.
The opposition disagrees with the funding model, and also resents the possibility of Dukovany being built by Russian or Chinese firms.
The state should be 70 percent involved in the construction.
The rest should be paid by CEZ, which will also cover any additional costs.
CEZ Ceo Daniel Beneš told ČTK in May that the expected amount for the construction of the block at current prices is about six billion euros (approximately CZK 162 billion).
Contracts between the State and CEZ for the construction of the new Dukovan block will be signed on Tuesday.
Ministry of Regional Development withdraws $2 billion of tourism support material in the media
The office withdrew the material according to which the Ministry of Regional Development (MMR) planned to spend CZK 2 billion on advertising on holidays in the Czech Republic in the media, on the Internet and billboards.
Minister Klára Dostálová (for YES) told SeznamZprávy.cz that the material was still being worked on.
The document in eKlep (electronic library of the legislative process) was brought to the attention of the server Zdopravy.cz.
The Ministry justified the plan by the fall in tourism due to the coronavirus.
During the coronavirus crisis, the media also experienced a drop in income.
The proposal drew criticism from the opposition and tourism representatives.
According to the proposal, which is now available on the hlidacstatu.cz website, the MMR planned to give money through the state tourism promotion agency CzechTourism to advertise in televisions, radio, press, the Internet, billboards or areas at railway stations.
The largest share of the money, 700 million crowns, would go to televisions.
Most of it would go to private nova and prima television.
Printed diaries and weekly newspapers would receive 400 million, and the same share would go to MMR for PR articles, advertising banners and videos on websites.
Radio stations would receive $350 million for the media campaign, most of it private stations.
The remaining $150 million would be used for outdoor advertising on billboards, LED screens, and areas on stations or subways.
The campaign to promote tourism in the Czech Republic was supposed to start in mid-August and last for a year.
"The material is still being worked on, it is definitely not yet in the form that should be presented," Dostálová said without giving further details to SeznamNews.
The material was criticized by the opposition, according to top 09 chief Markéta Pekarová Adamová, the media would benefit from the advertising from the trust funds of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (YES).
"I firmly believe that this flamboyant contempt will be a blow to the eyes at the election this fall," she tweeted.
Dostálová rejects that this is in fact aid to the crisis-hit media.
"It could be a coincidence, I don't know anything about media support," she told Daily N on Friday.
According to her, the budget of two billion is indicative.
"Of course, we're still counting it, it could be less or more.
It's work material," she added.
The Save Tourism initiative makes no sense in a media campaign to promote domestic tourism.
"We want two billion for tourism companies, not an unnecessary advertising campaign," the initiative's chairman, Tomáš Barčík, said on Sunday.
If the state budget contains the two billion crowns, they should be directed to companies, not to the media, the initiative writes in an open letter to the government.
Broth of life, beer tap and death like a blade of grass
The third album entitled A Death is a blade of grass by the Brno poet, tireless organizer of cultural activities and publisher Jaroslav Erik Frič, who also left a year ago, on May 24, is posthumous.
In Frič's discography, he is the fifth item and, as with previous titles, the main emphasis here is on Frič's poetry, of which he is an excellent performer himself.
Frič, the class of 1949, was understandably influenced by the American beat generation, but he matched this inspiration through his own, personal experiences and also very in-house expressions of faith.
But he was far from agitating, talking or writing about faith, about God, it was always very intimate, non-aggressive, completely tolerant.
Bohuslav Reynek (in contrast to Jan Zahradníček, for example) comes to mind in this context, the masters will be sorry.
Frič's album offers recordings of authorial reading from 2006, as well as performances with musicians who have always accompanied him very sensitively, whether it was the cellist Josef Klíč or Honza Bartoň and Vítězslav Holata.
I will help - gladly - in the words of the Ostrava poet Petr Hruška about Frič's long poetic compositions.
"They radiated a proud and endless bitterness," Hruška writes, "over the state of our world threatened with extinction.
A world that is increasingly sinking into numb consumer futility and greed is increasingly moving away from what his soul was made of - the secrets of faith, humility, and human proximity.
There was a longing for those who knew that few were interested in the values for which he was created, but who also knew that they could not be reso without them because of their general lack of interest.
The poems reminded us that one may have to lose everything expensive, but it is not irrelevant how one loses it.
If he is sold out of general decline, he will resign sceptically, he will be fearfully silent, or he will remain at the last moment in a calm and proud insistence on what he believes and loves."
Paroubek is not my advisor, hamáček said
Jiří Paroubek, former Prime Minister and President of the ČSSD, is not a paid advisor to social democracy.
Party chairman and Interior Minister Jan Hamáček only communicates with him and reads his opinions and articles.
Hamáček said it today on the tv show Prima Partie.
On Friday, the SeznamZprávy.cz.
"We text from time to time, he sends me some material from time to time, and I read it," Hamáček said today.
He added, however, that this is not official and paid cooperation.
According to him, ČSSD does not have the means to waste it on similar purposes.
"There are so many people like that who read his opinion sometimes," he said.
In a subsequent discussion with ODS MEMBER Jana Černochová, the Minister said that many ODS members still "listen openly to the views of Václav Klaus".
According to him, this is fine, because he is an experienced politician and a former party leader, which is also the case with Paroubek.
He called the fact that the media is making an affair a sign of this year's cucumber season.
The SeznamZprávy.cz on Friday that Paroubek was filling the role of Hamáček's unofficial consultant.
He also wrote that the party's fourth-place candidate in the Ústí region is headed to the former chairman of the local cell, Petr Benda, who is associated with Paroubek and served as vice-chairman of his LEV 21 party.
Hamáček said today that he will not comment on the composition of the candidate until it is ready and approved.
Duplantis has a mile lead, it's a kick in the ass, laments the Swede's challenger
It is the 22-year-old American pole vaulter who has the ambition and potential to be one of the new ruler's most serious competitors.
He already knows what it's like to beat Duplantis, two years younger, and he beat him at an NCAA college meeting last year.
"We had a battle the year before, he won and I was second, then we switched.
In both cases, it was a very good fight," says Nilsen, who secured the victory with a performance of 5.95 meters.
But Duplantis has since soared, and is currently alone in the highest pole vaults.
At the age of just 20, he became a world record holder, breaking the 6.17m mark in Torun on 8 February this year, and adding an inch in Glasgow a week later.
"He was jumping six meters when he was 18 when he graduated from high school," his peer Nilsen recalled for the World Athletics website.
"It was clear that once he went from boy to man, he would multiply all his potential and talent by 100 times.
Twenty years is a pretty good age to set a world record," he says.
Although Nilsen's list of achievements is much thinner than duplantis's, the American sets similar goals.
So far, he has hinted at his options at NCAA events, which he has regularly won, and in February this year he improved his internal personal best to 5.93 m on one of them. He won a gold medal at the Pan American Games in Lima last August, and in 2017 he made it to the U.S. World Championships, where he finished 13th.
The closest milestone for him is to get his first experience of the Diamond League.
"It's definitely my priority to get on the professional circuit and race as much as possible in the Diamond League, because that's where you can make a name for it," he realizes.
"If you can succeed at this level, you can undoubtedly do the same at events such as the Olympic Games, the World Championships or the Pan American Games."
But because of the pandemic, these peak holidays are postponed, giving Nilsen and the other poles time to improve.
But will that be enough to make up for Duplantis, who can easily turn a five-ring race into a mere battle for silver?
"Everyone's trying to catch up with him, but I don't think that's going to be possible anytime soon," Nilsen reflects.
"The kid's been jumping for 16 years, and he's got a mile-long lead over everyone else in practice."
And before Tokyo starts 2021, it will want to increase it further.
A woman spent hundreds of thousands on her disabled son's disability pension.
She's going to court.
The money the 33-year-old receives from the state as an invalidity pension is intended primarily to improve his quality of life.
Embezzlement can sentence a woman to up to eight years in prison.
Due to ill health, the court stripped the sick man of his right and appointed his mother as a guardian to manage his son's money, among other things.
"From mid-November 2013 to January this year, the woman used part of her son's disability pension funds for her needs, depriving him of CZK 440,000," police spokeswoman Dana Ladman said, noting that she made it difficult for the accused woman to have a special duty of care to defend the injured party's interests as a guardian.
The woman set up an account for her son, but had his pension sent to her account.
"After paying for the costs of her son's stay in the medical facility and paying for the necessary medications, she used the remaining funds to buy a vehicle, electrical appliances, and run a household," the indictment states.
That she couldn't use her son's money for her own use, the woman admitted.
But she defended herself by helping them pay for family expenses.
"We've had problems with our incomes to keep the household running.
We've never bought anything above standard.
It was always for things that my son would approve of buying.
I thought it was family money.
I had no idea I was committing a crime," the woman explained to police.
She promised to give the money back to her son.
North America has been inhabited for 30,000 years, scientists say after tools were found
The findings from chiquihuite cave in the Mexican state of Zacatecas include 1,930 limestone tools, including a lysite blade that could be used to cut meat, and pointed objects that could serve as spear or spear tips.
Scientists have found that the oldest of the tools dates from 33,000 to 31,000 years ago.
"There are only a few products of this age.
But they are here," said archaeologist Ciprian Ardelean of the University of Zacatecas and lead author of one of two studies published on the subject in the journal Nature.
The youngest instruments reach the age of 12,500 years.
According to experts, humans have inhabited the Chiquihuite Cave, located at high altitude, for 20,000 years.
The hitherto widely accepted theory was that the first representatives of the species Homo sapiens crossed the mainland bridge from what is now Russia to Alaska some 13,500 years ago.
Archaeological evidence, including unique spear tips used to kill mammoths and other prehistoric animals, showed that this Clovian culture subsequently spread throughout much of North America.
But this model has been cracked in recent decades, when several ancient settlements were discovered that were two to three thousand years older.
A second study, published in the journal Nature, reports on 42 different locations across North America that prove human presence on the continent between 26,000 and 19,000 years ago.
Scientists believe a small number of people may have come to the North American mainland sooner than previously thought.
Some of them could have made it to America by boat.
"It's clear that humans were in America long before the development of the so-called Clovian culture," anthropologist Ruth Gruhn of the University of Alberta, Canada, said of the new findings.
So far, interest in tickets is fulfilling an optimistic scenario, sellers say.
Prices are gradually decreasing
Ticket sales in the Czech Republic are growing every week.
While interest is still roughly half that of last summer, demand is growing by up to 20 percent each week.
According to the sellers, developments after the crisis meet the most optimistic scenarios.
Ticket prices are also gradually decreasing.
According to retailers, the most sought-after destinations are mainly southern European countries.
According to the Kiwi.com, Spain, Italy and Greece lead the way.
Flights to Letuška.cz are the most sold at the portal.
Of the other countries, the UK is the most sought after, but it has always been one of the busiest destinations.
The average price of tickets is also decreasing.
For the portal Letuška.cz, it was around CZK 6250 in the middle of the month, 3000 czk less year-on-year.
This is mainly due to an increase in demand for European destinations, which now account for about 85% of sales.
However, prices to some European places are also falling, for example to Spain or Italy, which have fallen by about a fifth in recent weeks.
The crisis has also affected the behaviour of customers who are now buying tickets much less in advance than before, because they fear further developments in the coronavirus situation.
According to earlier information Kiwi.com, the time of purchase of the ticket before departure decreased by about ten days year-on-year.
"This confirms the future trend where people will order tickets much less in advance, require more flexibility, take less risk," said Michal Šindelář, Vice President of products at Kiwi.com.
Currently, the average booking time before departure is 21 days.
Along with the increase in sales, the number of renewed flights from the Czech Republic is also increasing.
Prague Airport currently operates scheduled flights to more than 60 destinations.
Compared to last summer season, it is about half the destinations.
Grand finale tonight!
Watch the darts battle live on Nova Sport
The second most prestigious tournament within the PDC organization reached the grand finale.
It will feature experienced 49-year-old Scottish darts player Gary Anderson and the surprise of the tournament, 26-year-old Belgian Dimitri van den Bergh.
Gary Anderson knocked out Justin Pip in the first round, then ran into his neighbor in the leaderboard.
However, he also dealt with James Wade and in the quarterfinals he had a good fight with Simon Whitlock, who had previously sent home the world No.1.
The Flying Scotsman had a close call in the semifinals when he faced Michael Smith.
At the last minute, however, he escaped the gravedigger from the shovel, dominated in overtime and after an 18:16 result he earned a place in the final of the tournament, which he had already dominated in 2018, defeating Mensur Suljovič 21:19 in an amazing battle.
World Matchplay's biggest surprise is Dimitri van den Bergh.
The Belgian talent is enjoying the tournament and perhaps knowing he has nothing to lose has helped him to play on an absolutely fantastic wave.
The 26-year-old first surprisingly knocked out world number six Nathan Aspinall, overcame Joe Cullen in a dramatic battle, and beat Adrian Lewis in the quarterfinals after a sharp start.
The big test was the semifinals.
Glen Durrant showed his strength at the start, but the calm Belgian then gained a lead with an excellent series, which he then more or less easily held until the end.
Van den Bergh showed his strength in scoring high, which he used to create occasional uncertainty on doubles.
Coronavirus cases have increased since at least the beginning of the week, the number of tests has decreased
Since the beginning of March, when the new coronavirus was first discovered in the Czech Republic, 15,212 people have been demonstrably infected with it.
Nearly 9,600 of them have already been cured, 368 patients have died.
Currently, 5,254 people are sick.
This is based on data on the Ministry of Health's website.
The daily number of newly confirmed cases this week exceeded two hundred four times in a row.
Friday's high was 281 cases.
On Thursday, 235 tested positive, 246 the day before and 206 on Tuesday.
On the first working day of this week, there were 169 infections.
Covid-19 has already cured 9,590 people in the Czech Republic, or 63 percent of all those infected so far.
For most, the disease was mild.
According to the latest data from the Ministry of Health, there are 151 people with coronavirus in the hospital, 19 of whom are assessed as serious by doctors.
There are several outbreaks of covid-19 in the Czech Republic.
Karvinsko still has the most infections per 100,000 inhabitants in the last seven days, at almost 59.
This is followed by the district of Jihlava with 56 and Frydecko-Mistecko with 36 infected per 100 thousand inhabitants in the last week.
Due to the increased number of infected people, new measures against the spread of coronavirus have been in force in the Czech Republic since Saturday.
People must wear masks at indoor mass events of over 100 people, these are cultural and sporting events, but also weddings and funerals inside buildings.
From Monday, the capacity of these events will be reduced from the current 1,000 people to half.
Worldwide, the number of people who have been demonstrably infected with the new coronavirus has already exceeded 16 million.
This was stated by Johns Hopkins University in the US, which monitors the evolution of the pandemic globally.
According to this source, the number of victims who died with covid-19 is close to 645,000.
The latest million infected were added to the statistics in just three days; the 15 million threshold fell on July 22.
Brazil, with 2.4 million, and India, where authorities say nearly 1.4 million people have become infected, have had the largest share of rapid case growth in recent days.
Infected are now increasing at a record rate.
The World Health Organization reported this week that more than 284,000 new cases were added worldwide from Thursday to Friday, the highest daily balance since the pandemic began.
These developments can be attributed to the fact that the spread of the disease is at its peak in poached countries such as the US, Brazil and India, but according to Reuters, the number of new cases has increased in almost 40 countries around the world in the past week.
This applies, for example, to Australia, Japan, Bolivia, Sudan, Bulgaria, Belgium or Israel.
The disease has already occurred in almost all countries of the world, the first case was officially reported today by the DPRK.
Air in households is up to five times worse than outdoor air.
Air fresheners and deodorants are harmful to health
Health is threatened not only by poor air quality in outdoor areas, but also at home.
This was brought to the attention of The Jerusalem Post, an Israeli human health expert, carol abraham.
According to Abraham, who was instrumental in creating Israel's Ministry of Environmental Protection, household polluties need to be addressed right now, when many people spend more time working from home.
Abraham mentioned research by the US Environment Agency (EPA) that found that home air quality is up to five times worse than outdoor air.
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 3.8 million people die prematurely each year due to poor air quality in their homes.
"Because of the coronavirus epidemic, which has forced many to work from home, people have to spend more hours in their homes than before, so it's time to focus on home air quality," Abraham said.
In Israel, she says, almost no one is interested in the quality of "domestic air."
Dangerous things can be things that a person normally comes into contact with - coatings, air fresheners, disinfectants, deodorants or pesticides.
"Toxic gas is also emitted by clothing that we regularly bring to the dry cleaners," Abraham said.
Children, old household members and people with breathing difficulties are the most at risk, she says.
Otherwise healthy individuals may begin to suffer from problems such as headaches, fainting, irritability of the nastial pathways, nosebleeds, vomiting or skin allergies.
Prolonged exposure to unhealthy substances can damage the internal organs and central nervous system.
However, not all polluties come from objects inside households, the source can also be the material from which the houses are built.
