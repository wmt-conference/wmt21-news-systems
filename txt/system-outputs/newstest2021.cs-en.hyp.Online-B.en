Novák helped Trabzonspora to second place, Škoda also scored
Defender Filip Novák helped the Trabzonspor to score the vice-champion with a goal in the last round of the Turkish Football League.
His team won 2: 1 on the Kayserispor field and kept the third Besiktas behind.
After the January transfer from Slavia, the striker Milan Škoda scored the tenth goal for Rizespor, who escaped, even though he lost 1: 3 on the field of Fenerbahce.
Novák confirmed excellent productivity on the defender with the seventh goal in this league year.
63 minutes into the match, Kayserisporu came through the middle and almost added to his team's lead, but the shot went wide.
The home team managed to equalize five minutes before the end, but Trabzonspor pulled the victory to his side in the sixth minute of the setting, when he successfully finished a four-on-one break.
The damage in the beginning of the second half of the match with Fenerbahce equalized after the solo to 1: 1.
Rizespor did not keep the tie for a long time, but he did not have to regret it, because thanks to the results of the opponents, he remained three points above the descent zone.
The competition will end with Sunday's duel of the champion Basaksehir on the Kasimpasy field.
The well-hidden Hermit's Cave in the forests near Nový Bor was not really habitable
In the north of Bohemia, in the foothills of the Lusatian Mountains, near Nový Bor in the Českolipsko region, in the forests through which the Hraběcí cesta led, several sandstone rock formations are hidden.
Natural and artificial.
And we will go after that human hand created.
The place is called Hermit Cave.
In reality, however, no hermit had ever lived here, and the cave served as a shelter, more precisely a shelter chamber probably for grain.
The cave is carved from the side into a rock watchtower and is accessible by stairs from above.
At the same time, it is practically invisible until the last moment.
It is revealed by narrow stairs leading to a kind of rock gallery, from where you can just enter the rock.
Although the chamber appears to be quite far from human dwellings, at the time of its creation there may have been a field on the plateau where the forest is today.
"The fact that the building does not have a window and even a fireplace located in a traditional place clearly proves that no hermit could ever survive the winter here," explains historian Kamil Podroužek from the Jan Evangelista Purkyně Faculty of Arts in Ústí nad Labem.
The one-room building has only a stone bench at the back, which is probably used for storing containers.
"I see it as a chamber for storing some food or products from the field," adds Kamil Podroužek.
Traces of tools are visible on the walls of the cave.
Breaking the sandstone with a canine was quite simple and fast for the insiders.
It was enough to make good use of the joints and gradually break off the sandstone.
Depending on the length of the canine trail and the method of mowing in general, the period of cave formation can be determined in general.
According to the historian, it is probably the end of the 18th century.
The cave is freely accessible and according to the mess that appears in it, nowadays someone sleeps there from time to time.
If you approach the cave from above from one of the forest paths and you are fascinated by a flowing stream and a nearby count's path under the cave, then you will definitely find a path down as well.
And on the way out of the forest, you may be captivated by the nearby Raven Rocks.
Jockey Minařík is in artificial sleep after a severe fall in Germany
"Philip is in the best of hands now.
The institute is equipped for similar cases, moreover, fortunately we have part of the family in Hanover.
This makes the situation much easier for me and also the care for my daughter Finja, "the Jezdci.cz server quoted Minařík's wife Katja as saying.
"Everyone is doing their best, Filip now needs time to recover.
There is no point in making any predictions.
Anyone who has ever encountered the problem of head trauma and patients in artificial sleep knows that the situation can change.
Philip is a great warrior.
We all have to be patient now and give him time, "said the woman of the 45-year-old jockey.
The star Frankie Dettori, who won the seventh King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes race in Ascot on Saturday on Saturday, also called on the injured Minařík on Twitter, thus equaling the legend of Lester Piggott.
To date, almost 70,000 euros have been collected on the Gofundme server.
The goal is the amount of 100 thousand euros (2.6 million crowns).
The video referee took the Sassuola footballers four goals, losing 0: 2
Although the Sassuola footballers got the ball four times in the opponent's goal in Saturday's match in Naples, in the end they had to accept a 0: 2 defeat.
None of their goals were recognized by the referee after consultation with the video due to offside.
According to the Italian media, this is a record adversity of technology, so many interventions have never been thwarted by VAR to one team.
"VAR was stricter on Sassuolo than road radar and punished him like no team yet.
New technology breaks records, "Gazzetta dello Sport wrote in a commentary.
"Festival of unrecognized goals Sassuola.
VAR has never been so strict with one team, "added Corriere dello Sport.
Naples took the lead on Saturday in the 8th minute, but after half an hour of play, Sassuolo seemed to equalize.
However, Filip Djuričič's goal was not recognized after the intervention of the video referee due to the offside.
For the same reason, Djuričič's other intervention and hits by Francesco Caput and Domenico Berardi gradually did not apply.
The home team, on the other hand, added another goal.
Electric cars set a new record.
In the Czech Republic, they were the most recharged in history
"The growth was driven by both a 30 percent increase in the number of stations in our network and the trend of more frequent charging at public stations, as well as the accelerated development of new e-car registrations," said Tomáš Chmelík, ČEZ's head of clean technology.
Other large players, such as PRE and E.ON, the manufacturer of electric cars Tesla, as well as supermarkets Billa and Lidl, are also applying for their share on the market.
The operator of classic filling stations is represented by the company MOL.
But she doesn't have numbers yet.
"We only started building our network for electromobility last year," explained company spokeswoman Jana Jusková.
However, the Deník editorial staff exclusively obtained data from all 216 electric racks operated by ČEZ.
It follows that the drivers took an average of 13.5 kWh from the stations.
This corresponds to the range of about a hundred kilometers of a smaller electric car.
Leaving aside small pumps up to 1 kWh, the average charging takes two and a half hours.
The vast majority of refueling then took place in a free tariff.
If motorists had already paid for the collection, their typical expenditure was around 330 crowns.
Electromobility pulls mainly in the capital.
On the territory of Prague, there are all five of CEZ's busiest chargers, which, with their popularity, overshadow entire regional cities.
Olomouc then leads between the regions.
On the contrary, the least interest is in remote stations on the border, for example in Bohumín or Prachatice, which often remain unused throughout the day.
More than four thousand electric cars are currently registered in the Czech Republic.
In the first half of this year alone, 1,274 new e-cars were added.
In an extensive poll by the daily "Czechs on the Move", eight percent of readers said they were considering buying an electric car for the family.
However, only a third of respondents know where to look for the nearest charging station in their area.
Not just for better water retention.
Environmental activists protested in Prague
According to the organizers, the current steps of the government in the issues of protection and recovery of the Czech landscape and the solution to the climate crisis are insufficient, the speakers called on the state to take a more drastic approach.
The event called The Last Drop was attended by representatives of large organizations such as the Rainbow Movement, Greenpeace or the Green Party, as well as smaller local associations.
"For example, we have people here who have been opposed to expansion at the Turów mine for a long time, there are people who are opposing gravel mining at Uherský Ostroh, there are people who are opposing the construction of meaningless dams," said Marika Volfová on behalf of the organizers.
She said the main demands of the protesters were the creation of a plan for water retention in the landscape, a drastic change in agricultural policy and a system of subsidies to support sustainable agriculture and the fastest possible transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.
"The government has to defend the interests of the people, not the ruthless and devastating business," she said.
A stand with a petition was placed on Malostranské náměstí calling on the representatives of the Czech state to work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and restore Czech soil and landscape.
The people present were equipped with banners with slogans such as "The end of the rapeseed soup" or "Less coal, more newts".
Jan Škoda from the For Water for People association came to Prague from South Moravia to protest against the plan to extract gravel in the Hodonín region.
"It threatens a source of drinking water for 140,000 people," he said.
He added that wells represent the fifth most abundant source of drinking water in the Czech Republic.
According to him, the planned gravel mining is located only about 500 meters from the wells, and according to assessments, it is certain that the water quality will be endangered.
Vojtěch Veselý came from the village of Valeč in the Karlovy Vary region on behalf of the so-called agroecological farmers.
He pointed out the advantages of small farms, which do not pursue income and profit and supply the inhabitants on the spot.
"Small agroecological farms are able to feed the entire population in a completely normal way, and on top of that they will not do such a ruin on the shape of the countryside and the environment," he said.
Three people died in a plane crash on a house in Germany
Three people died and two others were injured in an ultralight plane crashing into an apartment building in West Germany.
The local rescue services informed about it, according to which there are probably two crew members and one inhabitant of the house among the dead.
The plane crashed on the roof of a building in the town of Wesel in North Rhine-Westphalia.
The attic apartment, which was one of the five residential units in the house, was subsequently engulfed in fire.
Firefighters have already managed to bring the flames under control.
Deputy Commander of the local fire brigade Robert Meyboom said that both members of the plane's crew had probably died.
According to the police, the third victim is a woman who lived in the house.
The daily Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ) wrote, referring to the mayor of Wesel, that she was a single mother whose two-year-old daughter was rescued from the apartment with minor injuries.
An emergency parachute was found near the accident, which apparently served as a landing brake.
The police assume that he comes from a crashed plane.
There was room for two people in the plane.
The machine took off from the airport in the nearby town of Marl.
The Rheinische Post reported, referring to eyewitnesses, that the plane collided with a hot air balloon before crashing.
However, this information has not yet been confirmed.
Referring to other witnesses, WAZ wrote that the plane crashed in the air before hitting the ground.
On Saturday, Česká spořitelna incorrectly charged some card payments twice.
She has already fixed the error
On Saturday afternoon, Česká spořitelna incorrectly charged some card payments to its clients twice.
According to bank spokesman Lukáš Kropík, the problem could have affected thousands of transactions.
The savings bank has already eliminated the error and returned the money to the clients.
The savings bank noted problems with double billing of card payments on Saturday afternoon.
"Last night (Saturday) we updated the system and immediately returned all these duplicate payments to clients.
At the moment, everything works without problems, "said Kropík on Sunday afternoon.
The exact number of clients to whom the bank deducted money from card payments twice is not known to the bank's spokesman, according to his estimate it was lower than thousands of transactions.
The savings bank is investigating the causes of the problems.
"It could have been a combination of several factors," Kropík said.
Česká spořitelna is the largest bank in the Czech Republic in terms of the number of clients.
At the end of March, it had 4.6 million.
The savings bank is owned by the Austrian financial group Erste Group Bank, which is a key player in the banking market of Central and Eastern Europe.
On Monday, Vojtěch will present a system of three emergency levels against coronavirus
"Degrees will be according to the strength of community dissemination at the regional level.
We are working on it together with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics, "Vojtěch told ČT.
It will be a so-called traffic light, individual regions will be marked in green, orange or red according to the risk of coronavirus.
The minister added that he would still talk to epidemiologists about the inclusion of individual regions.
He admitted that currently only the Moravian-Silesian Region would have an orange color and that Prague would be approaching it.
The map will also include individual measures for regional hygiene stations, hospitals, sanitary facilities and employers.
"We want to solve it at the level of regions, because the situation in them is not uniform," said Vojtěch.
Vodník and Karolínka
When the waterman Jonas and the miller's daughter Karolínka peek into each other, it's not easy at all.
Jonas is loved in love by his father, the clumsy waterman Hastrbuch, Karolínka has no idea that her dear Jonas is not human.
There is still a young man Libor, who will do everything to protect the whole village, and especially Karolínka, from the water villain.
What about intriguing and lying?
Especially when she can get Karolínka to reject Jonáš and give preference to him, the brave Libor.
It soon becomes clear to everyone in the village who can blame the drowning of the midnight Teapot, rotten flour, the fire of the mill and other thieves.
Angry villagers organize a hunt for a waterman, and an irreconcilable watery curse falls on Jonas's head.
And now please Konviček's soulmother Karolína!
How to soften old Hastrbuch, convince neighbors of Jonah's innocence, find Jonah, and free him from the curse?

The course of the disease of the majority is mild, only three percent of those infected need to go to the hospital
Either a milder form of coronavirus is spreading through the Czech Republic, or the summer dose of sunshine significantly improved our immunity.
Hospital infection departments are half-empty, although infection numbers are rising.
"The situation today and in April is completely different and it is mainly due to the number of hospitalized," confirms the Minister of Health Adam Vojtěch.
It is worth remembering that on April 11, when the first wave of the epidemic culminated in our country, everyone wore drapes, the army took samples, the republic was closed and the Czechs used up disinfection for a year ahead.
Yet ten people died a day.
Now the daily increases in the number of people infected are higher, but a maximum of two people die every day with covid-19.
The Karviná region still has the highest number of people infected, Jihlava already has similar numbers due to the outbreak in the local Alzheimer's Center, where 57 people are already infected - 40 clients and 17 employees.
Another home for the elderly was closed by a hygienist in Černožice in the Hradec Králové region.
The disease was confirmed by tests at one of the nurses.
"We are tracing, we have restricted movement, we have all the hygienic measures," says Martin Scháněl, director of the retirement home.
According to him, none of the clients of the home yet have symptoms of the disease.
The hygienists will start the area testing tomorrow and then decide on further measures.
Hospitals are also responding to the increased number of infections.
The Institute of Oncology in Brno today launched an automatic camera system at the entrance, which recognizes whether people are wearing a veil at the entrance.
The record is reported by South Bohemian hygienists, who recorded twenty-five cases of coronavirus - most of them are foreign employees of the Prachatice company.
A total of 131 infections were added on Saturday - half of Friday's number - but less is tested at the weekend.
Debutant champion!
Van den Bergh finished the fairy tale, swept Anderson
The big surprise of the tournament, Dimitri van den Bergh, showed an excellent performance even in the duel with the player who won the second most prestigious event in the PDC in 2018.
The start of the match was evenly balanced, the break came at 8: 7 for the Belgian darts.
Van den Bergh took a break with a 13-arrow leg and has been on top ever since.
He literally crushed his opponent with his game and the much more experienced "Flying Cattle" had a hard time getting to the doubles.
The way in which the "Dream Maker" had him in hand is also evidenced by the fact that the thrown Anderson played his first maximum only in the 24th leg.
In addition, the young Belgian handled great high checkouts.
The last time he lost in the eleventh leg, but in an unfavorable condition, he "caught a big fish" and closed 170.
At the end of the match, Anderson was very frustrated.
He just threw the darts and his opponent, who was walking behind the triumph, acted with absolute sovereignty.
Van den Bergh turned the first of three match darts and got his name - he wrote his big dream.
Winning a trophy named after Phil Taylor is all the more valuable for the Belgian arrow dancer because it is his first major won.
It is still true that the last player to beat van den Bergh is Karel Sedláček.
In Nantes charges were made for a fire in the cathedral, the man confessed
The Cathedral of Saint Peter and Paul in the heart of Nantes started burning last Saturday and the fire seriously damaged the original 16th century stained glass windows and destroyed the organ.
Investigators were suspected of arson because the fire was advancing through the temple from three different locations.
At the same time, the police found no signs of anyone entering the cathedral by force at the entrances.
The accused is a volunteer at the local diocese, a 39-year-old Rwandan refugee.
Police arrested him shortly after the fire, but then released him without prosecuting him.
Now, the prosecutor's office has reported that, based on new evidence, the man was arrested again on Saturday, confessed and faced charges of arson.
If found guilty, he faces up to ten years in prison and a large fine.
According to his lawyer, the man regrets the crime and decided to cooperate fully with the investigators, Le Monde wrote.
Vojtěch: On Monday we will present a "traffic light" for epidemiological measures
The new system is to play the role of a pandemic plan, the absence of which is facing criticism from the government and the Ministry of Health.
"The degrees will be according to the strength of community spread," the minister explained.
He added that at present, for example, the Moravian-Silesian Region or Prague would reach a medium, orange level.
The system is designed as regional, because the situation in individual regions differs significantly, he added.
The ministry cooperated on the system with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (ÚZIS).
According to the Minister, specific measures will be linked to the individual levels, whether it is the obligation to wear veils or the organization of special wards in hospitals.
The Minister of the Interior, Jan Hamáček (ČSSD), called for the creation of an epidemiological plan on the Prima Partie television program, according to which people should have clear information about what measures they can expect if the epidemiological situation worsens.
The daily increase in confirmed cases in the Czech Republic has been growing in recent days, although the number of hospitalized remains low.
Vojtěch commented on the fact that nothing fundamental is happening, it is not appropriate to talk about declaring a state of emergency or reconvening the crisis staff.
With regard to the growing number of people infected from Saturday throughout the Czech Republic, the government has again introduced the obligation to wear veils at internal events for more than 100 people.
From Monday, the capacity of these events will be limited to 500 people, now it is 1000 people.
The government's approach, when it was not clear until the last moment what measures and when they will come into force or when they will be announced, has been criticized.
"I think that in a situation that is relatively tense, the main actors should, on the contrary, create a feeling of security and, on the contrary, straighten out the confusion," said Senator Marek Hilšer in Questions.
Measures may already vary by region, for example in Prague, from Sunday onwards, the obligation to wear veils also applies in non-residential medical facilities, such as pharmacies or doctor's waiting rooms.
The obligation to wear veils when visiting medical and social facilities or pharmacies has also been introduced in the Liberec and Ústí nad Labem regions since Friday.
In the Vysočina region in the Jihlava region, it is necessary to wear veils in indoor public spaces, in public transport and in medical facilities from 14 July.
On the contrary, anti-epidemic measures have been relaxed in the Moravian-Silesian Region, as well as in the Central Bohemian Region in the Kutná Hora Region.
At the beginning of June, the Czech government also approved the so-called traffic light for Europe, which differentiates the level of risk of infection in individual European countries and adjusts the rules applicable to entry into the Czech Republic from these countries accordingly.
In countries with low and medium risk, the authorities do not require a negative coronavirus test for Czech citizens from 15 June or order quarantine instead.
These are mandatory when Czechs return from high-risk countries.
At the moment, all EU member states are now in the low risk category.
Techno parties in the Benešov region continue.
She plays at a third of the capacity, she should have finished at noon
Hlaváčkova Lhota (Benešovsko) The techno party near Hlaváčkova Lhota in the Benešov region continues on Sunday evening.
One third of the original 12 music systems still play.
According to evening estimates by the police, about 500 people stay here after 20:00, the original rough estimates spoke of three hundred, there were 900 in the morning, said police spokeswoman Lucie Nováková.
Originally, the techno party was supposed to end at noon on Sunday, at that time some of the music systems had really stopped.
"Some have already left and others are getting ready to leave.
Music production is still partially ongoing.
We expect that music systems will be gradually disconnected and disassembled, "said Nováková.
"Police officers still strictly monitor departing visitors in order to prevent drivers from driving under the influence of alcohol or addictive substances.
Drivers have the opportunity to undergo a preventive breath test before departure, "she added.
Dozens of riot police officers are supervising the event, the foreigner police, traffic and riot police are on site, and handlers with service dogs are also on standby.
"During today, the police checked 470 people moving at the venue and 485 vehicles, 270 drivers were subjected to a breath test, six of which sat behind the wheel under the influence of alcohol," said Nováková.
A total of 95 drivers were tested by police for the presence of narcotics and psychotropic substances, one of which was positive.
Police also dealt with 14 traffic offenses.
At the request of techno party participants, police officers performed 300 preventive breath tests and four preventive tests for the presence of narcotic and psychotropic substances.
There were about 2,000 people at the event on Saturday morning.
If the number of participants did not decrease, the police would intervene there.
This was stated by the Minister of the Interior Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) on the Prima Partie television program.
However, the number of participants dropped below 1,000, so the police assessed that the intervention was not needed, nor did the hygiene station or the Ministry of Health request it.
On Sunday, Czech Television (ČT) stated that the techno parties had extended to the surrounding lands, the owners of which did not agree with their use for techno parties.
It is possible that the owners of the surrounding land will claim damages.
Fans of techno arrived at the meadow near Hlaváčková Lhota on Friday evening.
The police originally guarded the meadow in Blažim in the Benešov region on Friday, where the techno party took place last year.
Blažim is located about 30 kilometers from Hlaváček's Lhota, where the technicians finally got to.
According to Nováková, no one came to Blažim.
Snake bite: The little girl ended up in the hospital!
"The first case this year was recorded in Železnorudsko.
The viper stabbed a girl there, the year 2010, which the parents brought to the local emergency service base themselves, "Mária Svobodová, a regional spokeswoman for the emergency medical service, told Deník, adding that the child was then taken to a hospital in Klatovy.
The viper is the only venomous snake in the Czech Republic, and it is in Šumava that these animals occur in higher numbers, so it is good to be careful when walking.
However, there is no great danger from these animals.
The chance that the viper will bite you is not very high, she is afraid of herself during normal contact.
And if she has room to do so, she likes to crawl away with a loud hiss.
She only attacks if she feels very threatened - for example, if you accidentally step on it.
However, her bite is not a tragedy either, her poison is very effective against small mammals, but it does not kill humans.
This can only happen if a person has a particularly weak organism or suffers from allergies.
The risk is therefore especially for children, the elderly and allergy sufferers.
"After a bite, a person often has a feeling of vomiting, sweating, fever, thirst, abdominal pain and diarrhea, in debilitated individuals and especially allergy sufferers, anaphylactic shock can occur," Miriam Gredová from Klatovy Hospital described for Deník.
The man threatened to throw the baby out the window.
He poured wine after the policewoman and threw dishes
After 23:00, an intervention unit broke into the apartment and detained the man.
Infants were immediately taken into care by paramedics, said Markéta Janovská, a spokeswoman for the regional police, in a press release.
The man did not want to cooperate with the police, he threw dishes, knives or poured wine from the window after the police negotiator.
He intensified his threats several times during the negotiations by leaning out of the window with the child in his arms.
Once he even climbed on the window sill himself, where he staggered.
Police continue to investigate the man.
He does not want to publish more information yet.
Stosurová prefers her daughter to the tennis season
Australian tennis player Samantha Stosur will not intervene in the coronavirus-affected season this year.
The 36-year-old US Open 2011 champion, who became a mother in June, does not want to end her career yet.
He plans to return to the courts next year and believes that thanks to his family and daughter, he will enjoy tennis even more than before.
Two weeks ago, Stosur announced on social media that her partner Liz Astling had given birth to a daughter, Genevieve, in mid-June.
"I will stay at home, spend time with my family, be at all the little milestones that our Evie will experience in the next six months and just enjoy it," said the former world number one in doubles on the Australian Association's website.
The WTA Tour will resume the interrupted season on March 3 with a clay tournament in Palermo.
Sapa Market: A raid revealed meat, fish and eggs of unknown origin
"One of the vehicles entering the area transported 1320 pieces of quail eggs of unknown origin, in addition to unsuitable conditions.
These eggs will also be destroyed in the remediation plant, "said the State Veterinary Administration.
An inspection of the live fish stand revealed that the seller did not have proof of origin and was not registered for the sale of live fish.
The market has been considered problematic from a veterinary point of view for a long time.
For example, last autumn, veterinarians discovered an illegal grocery store in it, with almost half a ton of unlabelled food without proof of origin.
For most, it was not possible to determine the expiration date, some products had reached the expiration date and were spoiled.
For five kilograms of cuttlefish, the shelf life was exceeded by three years.
Last May, veterinarians and police officers detained 80 kilograms of food without proof of origin, including dried fish, squid or frozen ducks, on the market grounds, some of which were moldy.
Putin telephoned Zelensky before the armistice in Donbas, the Kremlin criticizes the planned elections
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke by telephone with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky about the situation in Donbas, where a new ceasefire is to take effect at midnight.
According to the Kremlin's statement, Putin criticized, among other things, the decision of the Ukrainian parliament to hold local elections; Kiev reported that Zelensky called on the release of detained Ukrainians.
Negotiators of Ukraine and Russia, with the support of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), agreed on a new ceasefire on Wednesday evening.
The armistice is due to begin after midnight on Monday night, to be "complete and general" and to pave the way for the fulfillment of other provisions of the peace agreements.
In an interview with Zelensky, Putin said that the decision of the Ukrainian parliament to hold local elections contradicted the Minsk peace agreement and threatened the prospects for a settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine.
The Ukrainian parliament decided last week that the planned elections to local councils would not take place in the territory controlled by pro-Russian insurgents.
The Minsk agreement envisages that Kiev will regain control of the separatist-occupied Ukrainian territories with Russia after giving these regions broad autonomy and holding local elections there.
According to the Unian agency, the Zelenský office stated that both statesmen agreed on the benefits of the forthcoming ceasefire in Donbas and on the need to take further measures to promote peace in the region, such as demining combat areas or withdrawing troops from the front.
Zelensky also called on Putin to release Ukrainians detained in eastern Ukraine, on the occupied Crimean peninsula and in Russia itself.
The Minsk agreement helped stop the fighting, but occasional shootings and artillery attacks continue to kill people on both sides of the front.
The conflict in Donbas has claimed more than 14,000 lives since spring 2014.
Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of military support to the separatists, which Moscow denies.
Zelensky made the end of the war in Donbas his priority, but no major breakthrough in the negotiations has taken place yet.
The unexpected champion in decathlon is Rykl, heptathlon was dominated by Novotná
The defender of the last two titles, Doležal, did not finish four hundred at the end of Saturday's program;
The decathlon has long been ruled by the Latvian representative Reinis Kregers, who is training in the group of coach Josef Karas, but resigned after the discus.
Rykl had two bronze medals from the outdoor championship so far, this time he was the only decathlon fighter who crossed the 7,000 mark.
Vilém Stráský and Petr Urbánek won other medals for him.
After the competition, Rykl recalled the absence of Adam Sebastian Helcelet and Jiří Sýkora.
"It's a pity that there were no boys here and Kope didn't start it, because the results would look completely different.
But the title tastes very good, I especially appreciate the fact that I put a person 30 centimeters in the distance.
Then I was even more pleased with the stick and I was most disappointed with the disc, I was below average there, "he admitted on the union Facebook.
Kateřina Cachová won the first day of heptathlon with more than a hundred points, even though she suffered from an injured ankle on the bounce leg.
In the long-distance sector, however, she then entered only 570 cm, did not cross 40 meters with her spear, and did not enter the final octopus.
Novotná scored 5878 points and won by 241 points ahead of Kateřina Dvořáková.
It came out mainly from a distance, 631 cm is the best Czech performance of the year.
"I really wished it was around the 630.
Yesterday my calf started to pull, but I'm very glad that I didn't feel it at all and that it didn't limit me at all, "Novotná said on the federal Facebook page.
Organic LPG has arrived in the Czech Republic, it promises ecological operation
Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) is a very well-known alternative fuel in the Czech Republic.
It is especially popular for its significantly lower price compared to petrol or diesel, given the significantly lower excise tax, but its benefit is also in lower CO2 emissions per kilometer driven.
Like petrol and diesel, it also has its environmentally friendly variant - "bio LPG".
However, it is quite a novelty - it first appeared on the European market the year before last, and according to a press release from the Czech LPG Association, it arrived in the Czech Republic a few days ago.
"These days we have received the first fifteen tons of bio LPG, which will be distributed to our filling stations in a mixture with conventional fossil LPG," the association quotes Jiří Karlík from Primagas.
However, bio LPG cannot be taken as bioethanol or biodiesel.
According to the association, it is chemically identical to the classic petroleum LPG, which many motorists are refueling in their cars now.
Therefore, it is also possible to mix both versions as you wish.
"The only difference compared to conventional LPG is the method of production," says Ivan Indráček, chairman of the association, about bio LPG.
This is one of the great advantages of bio LPG over other alternative fuels.
It is easy to transport and store, and the distribution infrastructure is also relatively good, eg compared to hydrogen or electricity.
Currently, this gas is obtained as a by-product in the production of bioethanol from food residues and sugar cane.
In the future, it should also be produced in a targeted manner, eg from cellulose biomass, ie wood waste.
In contrast, conventional petroleum LPG is formed partly as a by-product in oil refining and partly by separation in natural gas extraction.
As a result, depending on the production technology and source, the operation of the car on bio LPG is 40-70% more environmentally friendly in terms of carbon footprint than the operation on oil LPG and up to 90% compared to diesel.
However, these are not CO2 emissions from the car's exhaust, but the ecology of fuel production, ie the so-called "well-to-tank" part (in Czech "from source to tank").
One of the largest producers of bio LPG is currently the petrochemical companies Eni, Total and Neste.
According to a recent update of the National Action Plan for Clean Mobility (NAP CM), Unipetrol is also examining the possibility of production in its Litvínov refinery.
According to the association's estimates, about 170,000 LPG vehicles run in the Czech Republic; the Ministry of the Environment states a slightly higher number in the NAP CM, roughly 200,000.
According to statistics from the Ministry of Transport, almost 6,000 conversions of LPG cars were carried out last year alone.
It is possible to refuel LPG in the Czech Republic at about 950 stations of various operators.
Vojtěch revised the number of infected, the number dropped by 1775 cases
Minister of Health Adam Vojtěch (for YES) ordered the ministry to revise the numbers infected with the coronavirus virus.
The new statistics were published by the Ministry of Health on its website on Sunday.
The number on Sunday afternoon dropped from Saturday's 5,254 to 3,479 cases, which is 1,775 less infected.
At present, there are 3422 patients in the Czech Republic.
"Behind the sharp increase in the number of cures is the revision of data, which hygienists have not been able to update recently," said the head of health statistics, Jaroslav Dušek.
By Sunday afternoon, 15,212 people in the Czech Republic had been infected with coronavirus, 11,419 had recovered, and unfortunately 371 Covid-19 had succumbed.
Mobile voting units or correspondence election.
A political scientist and a sociologist were looking for options for a pandemic
According to Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior Jan Hamáček (ČSSD), a change in the law is needed so that people in quarantine due to coronavirus can also vote in the October regional and senate elections.
Parliament could discuss it in August or September under an accelerated regime.
He stated this on Sunday in the Prima TV Party.
On Tuesday, he wants to discuss possible solutions at the ministry with representatives of parliamentary parties.
"Whatever we do, it will have to mean a change in the electoral law," Hamáček said.
On Wednesday, the Senate called on the government to find a solution within the applicable legal rules.
However, the minister stated that it would be necessary to amend the provision of the law, according to which people in quarantine cannot vote due to their health condition.
The ban on voting should be maintained, for example, for patients with open tuberculosis.
Daniel Prokop stated in the OVM program that the possibility of a correspondence option has been postponed since 2004.
Even the current bill, which is in the Chamber of Deputies, then envisages its introduction for voting abroad, but not in the Czech Republic.
At the same time, Prokop considers the concerns of YES or the CSSD (because, according to experience from abroad, it would rather be to other types of parties) of the correspondence choice overestimated.
Personally, he is against the possibility of electronic voting, where there is a significant possibility of abuse.
Michal Klíma said that now it is necessary to devise ad hoc mechanisms (elections), which could be carried out this year and with the least possible health risk.
He considers it to be the main thing to be ready for the year 2021, when parliamentary elections are to take place in the Czech Republic.
He considers the correspondence option (whether only abroad or also in the Czech Republic) to be one of the functional methods.
He sees the already mentioned electoral units or, for example, the possibility of proxy voting within the family as another.
He added that it is possible to learn how similar situations -⁠ choices at the time of coronavirus -⁠ were dealt with in Croatia, Poland or France.
Due to the spread of coronavirus infection, various types of elections have already been postponed this year in 67 countries around the world.
Protests in Hungary: Pig ears were being thrown by protesters at the government building
Participants in a demonstration against Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov and his cabinet threw pig ears at the government building.
It was another in a series of protests against the "mafia style of government" that have been taking place in Sofia and other cities for almost three weeks.
The organizers are planning a nationwide blockade on Wednesday, the DPA agency said.
According to Rádio Svobodná Evropa / Rádio Svoboda, today's protest, which took place for the 18th day in a row, had a weaker turnout than the previous one.
At 20:00, about 300 people gathered, some streets had to be closed to traffic.
Demonstrators played a stage in front of the government building, during which they symbolically locked Prime Minister Borisov and Attorney General Ivan Gešev to the prison cell in connection with the arrest of two advisers to President Rumen Radev, a strong political opponent of the Prime Minister.
The resignation of both is one of the basic demands of the protesters.
They also called for the abolition of the announced health care reform and an end to corruption in construction on the Black Sea coast.
The organizer of the protests, Nikolai Hajigenov, stated today on public radio that "the peak of the escalation" in the form of a "nationwide demonstration in Sofia and blockades across the country" is about to take place on Wednesday.
He reiterated his call for Borisov and his government to resign, as well as call early elections.
The regular ones should take place in March 2021.
Borisov has previously stated that he does not intend to resign.
He justified this, among other things, by the need to make Bulgaria a peacemic-19 pandemic and the resulting economic crisis.
However, he replaced five members of his government team on Friday, although the concession did not reassure the protesters.
Earlier this week, Borisov's government stopped the vote of confidence in parliament in parliament.
Coach Boloni Mihajlovič doesn ́t want to play without spectators
Boloni Siniša Mihajlovič, the coach of the football players, has had enough of the matches of the Italian league without spectators.
The Serbian coach hopes that fans will return to the stadiums from the new season.
"What we are currently doing here is not football.
I already have my teeth full of matches without spectators.
It's sexless football, it brings me no emotions, no joy.
Those matches are worse than training.
Playing like this is terrible and I don't think I'm the only one who thinks so, "said Mihajlovič before today's match against Lecce.
The coronavirus pause is followed by Series A matches in quick succession, and although they are played only in the evening, their actors are exposed to heat.
"We play in the heat every three days.
In such conditions, it is not even known how the teams are doing.
For this season to end.
Those measures had to be taken in order to complete the competition, but I hope that the fans will be back from September, "said the coach, who in the past also led Fiorentina and AC Milan.
For Mihajlovič, this season is extraordinary also because he has been missing on the bench for four months to treat leukemia.
"Despite my illness, the interruption of the league and everything else, our team managed to move up a level.
We want to keep growing and we need players to be mentally stronger, "he said.
We have been the target of a cyber attack by foreign states, says Iran
Since the end of June, fires and explosions have been reported from a number of Iranian military, industrial and nuclear facilities, as well as oil refineries, power plants, factories and businesses.
Some Iranian officials have said the fire that erupted in Natanz's underground nuclear operation this month could have caused cyber sabotage.
The cause of many other incidents has not yet been explained.
According to Iranian media, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi told reporters that the infrastructure of the Islamic Republic faces "thousands of cyber attacks" every day.
He added that this is not a new phenomenon and that most of them will be repelled.
In recent months, according to Mousavi, several wider cyber attacks have been recorded, which, according to analyzes, were "certain governments and groups".
However, he did not provide more details about possible perpetrators, according to Reuters.
Mousavi also added that fires in forests, refineries and other places are common in the summer.
An article by the Iranian state agency IRNA this month discussed that Iran's enemies, such as Israel and the United States, may have been behind the recent incidents.
However, none of these countries was directly accused of specific attacks in the article.
Iran and the United States severed diplomatic relations shortly after the 1979 revolution, when Iranian militant students attacked the US embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.
Long-standing tensions between the two countries intensified in 2018 after Washington withdrew from the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and the world powers and imposed sanctions on Iran that have a severe impact on its economy.
Another significant escalation came this year after the US military killed Iranian General Qasem Solejmani and Abu Mahdi Muhandis, a member of the Iraqi militia leadership, on January 3.
On January 8, Iran fired a number of missiles at bases in Iraq, where the Americans operate.
The United States has long admitted that dozens of American soldiers have been injured.
Israel sees Iran as its main enemy, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a major opponent of the 2015 international nuclear agreement with Iran.
According to the Israeli prime minister, Iran is trying to develop an atomic bomb, which Iran denies.
The carmaker TPCA has extended the shutdown of production, now until May 25
Cologne-based carmaker Toyota Peugeot Citroën Automobile (TPCA) has again extended production shutdown due to coronavirus.
Production lines are scheduled to resume on Monday, May 25 morning.
The launch will be accompanied by dozens of hygienic measures, said car spokesman Tomáš Paroubek.
The production has stood due to the coronavirus pandemic since the evening of March 18.
The company originally intended to restore it on Monday, May 18.
According to Paroubek, the reason for extending the outage is closed borders and closed dealerships, so there is no one to sell cars.
According to Paroubek, the company will produce 100 percent from the beginning, ie in two shifts.
Coronavir affects key company markets, such as Italy, the United Kingdom and Spain.
Mayor Michael Kašpar (Change for Kolín) said that the shutdown of production in TPCA is not affected by life in the city.
"It was obvious from the beginning, the city was empty.
But gradually the streets are filling up, especially now from Monday, when it has become very loose.
So the city is full, "said Kaspar.
According to him, there are no complications even with foreign workers who stayed in hostels.
"In those two months, we had to solve almost no problem," said Kašpar.
For example, Škoda Auto from Mladá Boleslav, which also discontinued production due to the coronavirus crisis, resumed production on Monday, April 27, in all three of its production plants in the Czech Republic.
None of the plants operate at 100 percent capacity.
The resumption of production at Škoda was accompanied by more than 80 hygiene measures.
On the night from Monday to Tuesday, the third, ie night shift, took place in Mladá Boleslav and Kvasiny for the first time after the resumption of production.
TPCA currently employs about 2,500 people and the company is one of the largest exporters in the Czech Republic and also an employer in the Kolín region.
The cancer killed the bride shortly after the wedding: She left a message for her family
Gemma Sisson had been battling insidious cancer for more than two years, and when she seemed to have beaten the cancer, the disease resounded.
The 39-year-old woman, who loved bodybuilding, ended up in a bed in a hospice, where she still managed to marry the love of her life.
Unfortunately, she succumbed to the disease.
A few hours after her death, a shocking message appeared to her Facebook account on the social network.
Gemma Sisson from Leeds, England, loved bodybuilding.
With a friend Ricky Moore, with whom she had lived for more than 16 years, they traveled to competitions around the world.
The 39-year-old woman played sports and lived a healthy life, yet in April 2018 she was diagnosed with cancer.
Gemma began an exhausting treatment, radiotherapy, hoping to recover.
After months of treatment, Gemma did appear to have overcome the cancer, but in August 2019, the cancer returned, this time invading the spine.
According to the British daily Daily Mirror, the bodybuilder and personal trainer underwent a ten-hour spine operation and then resumed drastic treatment.
But everything was in vain.
Earlier this year, on her 39th birthday, doctors told her she had a few months to live.
In April, the handsome blonde finally decided to go to a hospice in Leeds, where she was visited at any moment by her family, who even arranged a wedding for her with her love Ricky.
The marriage lasted two months.
Ricky took Gemma to the restaurant for their last month on their two-month anniversary.
Four days later, Gemma died in his arms.
Just hours after her death, a post Gema wrote for her family appeared on her social media account.
"If this was published, it means that I finally died after weeks of fighting too long.
Although I will have a broken heart to leave my loved ones here, I will be so happy to get rid of what this terrible disease has caused me.
I can't thank Ricky enough, who was by my side the whole time and gave me a huge amount of love and support during that terrible time, "she wrote on the social network, adding that the pain and suffering finally stopped and she found peace.
"I am also grateful for all the support I have received from all my followers on the social network," she wrote, adding that everyone should respect their life and live it to the fullest.
Vending machines sell sweat dating, a mushroom amulet and a memory game
For a hundred crowns, passers-by will receive the pocket work of mostly beginning Czech artists.
They create images and other creations directly for artmat, so they know in advance that they have to fit in the size of 8.5 by 5.5 centimeters.
Each piece is numbered and signed.
"The package always contains a curatorial text about the artist and then the work itself," specified the project's curator Petra Widžová.
Artmat works with the principle of chance.
The buyer can be surprised by what artwork he gets.
Currently, he may become, for example, the new owner of Alexandra Štoplová's fantastic illustrations or mini-views by Tereza Bonaventurová, which can also be sent.
The artist Punx 23, in collaboration with Dora Dutková, prepared a memory game connected with a walk through Prague.
Cards must be paired with house signs.
Ilona Polanski created a collection of tattoos for Artmat.
Marie Ladrová and Juliána Chomová sell pocket packs of spirituality: the first of the artists offers a protective amulet made of woodpecker and a divination card, the second a series of illustrations based on her comic Spiritistka.
Salaries in healthcare will increase by a maximum of five percent next year.
According to Vojtěch, a larger increase is unrealistic
Salaries in healthcare could increase by a maximum of five percent next year, said Minister of Health Adam Vojtěch (for YES) in Václav Moravec's Questions on Czech Television.
He considers the demand of trade unionists for an increase of up to 15 percent unrealistic.
He also said that the state should try to be self-sufficient in providing protective equipment.
According to him, hospitals now have their supplies.
"I think that the increase (in salaries) can be somewhere up to five percent," the minister said.
According to him, it is necessary to reflect the current situation where, since March, the coronavirus pandemic and the government's regulation against its spread have intervened in the selection of the insurance pandemic.
The income of insurance companies fell at that time.
"I get a 15 percent increase unrealistic at the moment," said Vojtech.
According to the data of the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (ÚZIS), the average monthly earnings of a doctor in acute inpatient care will probably reach 88,312 crowns this year, and nurses 47,498 crowns.
The difference between the salary of nurses in state hospitals and the salary of other founders will be up to seven thousand crowns.
The IHIS data also show that the number of nurses in hospitals has stopped.
According to data from the Czech Statistical Office, the average wage in the Czech Republic in 2019 was CZK 34,125.
Trade union representatives said in June that they would demand a minimum increase of ten percent for 2021, ideally 15 percent.
They criticize the long-term significant difference between the earnings of doctors and nurses in state hospitals, which must follow the salary scales, and the contractual wages in city, regional or private hospitals.
They therefore also demand that salary scales be uniform for health professionals.
For nurses this year, the difference will reach up to seven thousand crowns per month.
For example, for doctors last year, wages grew faster than wages.
According to the president of the Czech Dental Chamber, Roman Šmucler, trade unions should perceive what the current situation is.
Due to the effects of the covid epidemic, the Chamber of Deputies recently approved an increase in this year's state budget deficit to a record 500 billion crowns, of which 1.75 billion is to go to the remuneration of health professionals in hospitals and social services.
According to Šmucler, the council of health care providers does not agree with a general increase in salaries next year.
According to him, the remuneration should be decided by the hospitals and medical facilities themselves, and the extra money should go to them through a payment decree.
Vojtěch also stated that hospitals currently have enough protective equipment.
Pavel Švagr, chairman of the State Material Reserves Administration (SSHR), said this week that the administration does not currently own a single protective medical device.
Awaiting completion of tenders.
According to Vojtěch, suppliers in the world are now better able to deliver goods than in March, when they were bought out.
According to him, the state should try to be as self-sufficient as possible and buy from Czech companies as well.
Soldiers could take over the clever clever quarantine.
We're ready, they say
"Smart quarantine works, there is room for improvement of course.
We'll discuss it with the military tonight.
The army works perfectly and the question is whether they should not manage the whole thing again, "the Prime Minister said on Sunday in his Facebook program Chow People.
According to him, it is not possible to sufficiently connect IT systems and hygienic stations, which must gradually switch to more modern methods of operation.
According to the Prime Minister, the problems were in the Moravian-Silesian Region, where there are some of the current outbreaks of the epidemic.
Ministry of Defense spokesman Jan Pejšek told ČTK that he had no information about Sunday's meeting and that the government should discuss the matter on Monday.
According to him, the army is ready for this step.
The clever quarantine project was taken over by the Ministry of Health on May 25.
Until then, the clever quarantine was led by a 90-member central management team set up under the army as an advisory body to the government, led by former Deputy Minister Roman Prymula.
The rubbing project was criticized on Sunday by the Minister of the Interior Jan Hamáček (CSSD).
He also suggested that he could be taken over again by the army.
The government's Commissioner for IT and Digitization, Vladimír Dzurilla, who is in charge of the project, also previously admitted shortcomings in the project.
"The system is working, but it is still being worked on.
For twenty years it was created independently and unsystematically, now we are trying to unify it in a few months.
It's not galloping.
People on the go, poor hygiene on the go adapt the new systems and actually catch the mistakes, "he said.
Ostrava Mayor Macura will not run again, because he does not want to "get lost in politics"
The current mayor of Ostrava, Tomáš Macura (YES), will not run in the next municipal elections.
The reason is the effort to "not fool around in politics," he told the Respekt.cz server.
Macura, who is also a member of the YES movement board, has been the mayor of Ostrava since November 2014.
In the municipal elections in 2018, the candidate of the ANO movement led by Ostrava won almost a third of the voting votes.
Macura originally wanted to be in office for only four years.
"I thought I would last one term and with that business experience I could turn everything over here and get it on its feet," he told Respekt.
He added that he had been persuaded to some extent for the second term.
"It simply came to our notice then.
I don't want to fool around in that politics, "added Macura, who described himself in the interview as a difficult introvert who does not like frequent contact with people.
According to Respekt, Macura's possible end to the YES movement has been speculated for some time.
The server recalls that Macura has repeatedly criticized the YES movement, for example for its alliance with the SPD movement or for supporting Miloš Zeman in the presidential election.
As one of the few personalities, ANO supported Zeman's opponent Jiří Drahos in the elections.
Macura has no plans to leave the YES movement, which he joined in 2017.
"As long as I feel that I can change something in the movement, that it is not a completely futile fight and that no one is messing with it, I have no immediate motive to end it," he told Respekt.
Macura, 56, graduated from the University of Economics in Prague.
Before becoming mayor of Ostrava in 2014, Macura worked, among other things, as the director of the manufacturer of the pharmaceutical company Walmark.
He also sat on the bodies of other companies.
Uber will return to Brno offering transport services
The company Uber, which offers transport services, will return to Brno at the end of July.
It is a consequence of a change in the law, Petr Kratochvíl (ODS), Brno's councilor for transport, said in a press release on Thursday.
Taxi drivers protested against Uber in Brno, pointing out that Uber does not meet conditions such as designation as a taxi or taximeter.
However, the change in the law has changed the conditions for operating ordinary taxis as well as alternative ones since July.
In recent weeks, Kratochvíl has had several meetings with representatives of Uber.
"Based on them, this company decided to return to Brno with its services at the end of July this year.
This step is the result of a change in the law, which allows this company to operate legally.
The city was acquainted with this change and we believe that the company will operate its services within the given limits, "said Kratochvíl.
Uber worked in Brno in the past.
Taxi drivers protested against him for not marking vehicles as a taxi or missing a taximeter.
The court issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting Uber from driving in the city.
Brno originally supported taxi drivers, but last year at the end of the year, Mayor Markéta Vaňková (ODS) stated that the city would like to take steps to make Uber work in Brno.
According to later court decisions, Uber could travel in Brno, but the company did not use it.
He will now return based on a change in the law.
Since July, it has been the case that, in addition to classic taxis with a flashlight and a taximeter, it is easier to operate a transport service ordered and paid exclusively through mobile applications.
Too boisterous celebration in Brno: a flying chair landed a meter away from a man on the sidewalk
An office chair flew from the fourth floor of the apartment building on Saturday evening in Brno and landed about a meter from the sidewalk.
At that moment, a pedestrian followed him, who immediately called the guards.
Immediately upon arrival at the address in the western part of the city, the patrol noticed an open window, under which a chair still lay, and a few cans and cigarette butts beside it.
"The noise coming from the room on the fourth floor indicated that a rather noisy celebration was taking place inside.
The police officers went out into the hallway to the apartment and asked the three young men present, aged 26 to 29, for an explanation, "said spokesman Jakub Ghanem.
Babiš discusses the request to dismiss Rafaj with the CSSD
On Monday, Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO) plans to discuss with the coalition Social Democrats a request for a motion to dismiss the head of the Antimonopoly Office (ÚOHS) Petr Rafaj.
Non-profit organizations and the Ústí nad Labem Region also called on Rafaj to dismiss the government's anti-corruption council.
The Social Democrats say the exchange at the head of the office is appropriate.
According to ČTK, Rafaj was not invited to the Government Office on Monday.
His second term ends in the middle of next year, and by law he cannot be appointed a third time.
His dismissal is in the competence of President Miloš Zeman.
In addition to the invitation to non-profit organizations, the Prime Minister also received a letter with a similar request from the Ústí Region.
The reason is supposed to be, among other things, Rafaj's recent cases.
Last week, the prime minister refused to comment on the request, saying that he would get acquainted with the materials and that the government parties would take "some opinion" on this.
He also said that he had not yet discussed the challenges with the president, he did not have an appointment with him in the near future.
According to the statement of the Office, there is no reason to appeal, because Rafaj was not charged with anything.
Last week, the IHNED.cz and Aktuálně.cz servers wrote that the police were interested in Rafaj's meetings with President Jiří Čunk.
The meetings connected, among other things, with the decision to compete for the project of the controversial new Zlín hospital for eight billion, which Čunek is pushing hard for.
Cunek admitted the meetings, according to him they solved his "senate activities" together.
Rafaj speaks similarly.
The Ústí nad Labem Regional Council called for the government to dismiss Rafaj at the end of June.
It also calls for a reform of the Office's decision-making mechanisms.
According to Deputy Governor for Transport Jaroslav Komínek, the Office's decision-making on public procurement is not transparent and has signs of arbitrariness.
Last March, police intervened at the antitrust office over a toll tender.
In June this year, the Aktuálně.cz server pointed out that Rafaj uses apartments written for the company of the influential behind-the-scenes player of the CSSD, Alexander Čuba.
However, a deposit of 3.5 million for an apartment in Brno was paid from Rafaj's account.
Rafaj has been the Chairman of the Office for the Protection of Competition since July 9, 2009, and for the second term of office the President appointed a former Member of the Social Democracy in June 2015.
In less than a year, Rafaj's second six-year term will expire.
The Antimonopoly Office Act states that the President may remove the President of the Office at the suggestion of the Government.
He may be dismissed only if he has not held office for more than six months or seriously undermines the dignity of his office or the independence and impartiality of the Office.
Employees collapsed in the Blane library.
Air conditioning will help
The new technology will cost 740,000 and will be in operation in the second half of August.
"It is good news for me.
We go to the library in the center of Blansko regularly with three children.
In the warm months, however, it was practically impossible to stand there.
It was terribly hot and bad air.
Ventilation did not help.
That is why I am happy for air conditioning, "said one of the Blane readers, Petr Novotný.
According to the director of the library, Lukáš Dlapa, the temperatures in the building often climbed to over thirty degrees.
The south wall of the building is glazed and functions as a greenhouse on sunny days.
"In addition, the sun rests on it for most of the day due to the curvature of the building.
At the same time, it is a big problem to ventilate individual departments, because the windows must be closed overnight for safety reasons.
We often have it in the library since the morning to thirty degrees, "said Dlapa.
The worst was the study and reading room on the third floor.
And upstairs there are exhibition rooms and a director's office.
The unpleasant climate was also in the children's ward, which is located under the roof of the building.
"On several occasions, librarians collapsed at work and ended in incapacity for work.
The problem also regularly arose in the cultural room at lectures attended by dozens of people.
After a few minutes, it was impossible to breathe there, "Dlapa remarked.
Originally, the representatives of the city wanted to make air conditioning in all areas of the library this year.
In the end, there will be only three circuits out of five.
"Due to limited funding, air conditioning will have only the most problematic premises.
Study and reading room on the third floor.
Furthermore, the cultural room and the children's department one floor up, "said Jiří Svoboda from the Blane investment department.
He added that in the first phase, last autumn, the workers installed air conditioning in the mentioned premises and modified the electrical installation.
Approximately 360 thousand crowns.
The Blansko Municipal Library has almost three thousand registered readers.
Of this, he is about nine hundred to fifteen years old.
Chicago support expelled the coronavirus.
Crawford returns to the game
Not every infected athlete will come out with the truth.
Especially when it comes to NHL players who are silent about the health of players like a grave and don't publish anything at all.
He was one of the few to leave the Crawford series.
The 35-year-old native of Montreal was present only at the first training session, and has been missing from the line-up ever since.
"I would like to inform you all that I have tested positive on Covid-19 and have spent the last fortnight locked in my house because of this," he said.
Fans no longer have to worry about his health.
Crawford is ready to return to full load.
"It 's amazing to be back.
I will do everything to get in shape as soon as possible, "he added.
An experienced goalkeeper won two Stanley Cups with Chicago, and has been a fixed part of the goal area for the tenth season in a row.
The Blackhawks are waiting for the first preparatory duel with St. Louis, then they will face Edmonton in the preliminary round.
Thousands of people protested against the prime minister in Israel
Thousands of Israelis have protested in several parts of the country against unemployment, corruption and the way Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is addressing the coronary crisis.
The demonstrations took place, among other things, in front of Netanyahu's private villa in Caesarea, near his official residence or in a park in Tel Aviv.
Protests have been held regularly in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv for several weeks.
Their participants are demanding Netanyahu's resignation because of a trial in which he is accused of corruption and fraud, and also because the government is dealing with another wave of the coronavirus epidemic.
"Bibi, go home," according to the AP, one of the protesters wrote on his banner, referring to Netanyahu's well-known nickname.
"Everyone sees that the emperor has lost his clothes," said another.
Netanyahu, 70, is Israel's first prime minister to be in office.
He is charged in three cases of corruption, fraud and abuse of trust.
He denies all the allegations and calls them witch hunts.
According to local media, the trial can take up to three years, with over 300 witnesses being summoned.
The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed in nearly 60,500 people in Israel, which has a population of about nine million.
About 455 people died in connection with the infection.
The Israeli government introduced quarantine measures in March to help reduce daily increases in those infected.
However, after the gradual easing of restrictions from the end of April, the number of infected people began to rise significantly again, especially at the end of June.
Netanyahu's critics claim that the government did not help enough, for example, self-employed people affected by quarantine measures.
The protesters are also annoyed by the fact that the government is issuing conflicting instructions in the fight against coronavirus.
The driver smashed the car against a tree and died.
The body had to be cut out of the wreck by firefighters
The tragic accident happened around 11 pm near Neveklov on a narrow district leading from the Slapy dam.
The driver apparently flew down into the woods at considerable speed and smashed the car against a tree.
He died on the spot.
The body had to be rescued from the wreck by firefighters, among other things they cut off the roof.
The circumstances of the accident are being investigated by police officers.
They ordered a forensic autopsy, which should clarify, among other things, whether the man was driving under the influence of alcohol or other addictive substances.
No more wasting and spewing one collection after another.
Pietro Filipi cancels discounts and bets on sustainability
The Czech clothing brand Pietro Filipi wants to focus on sustainability and is embarking on a fundamental change in strategy.
He cancels discounts and no longer wants to spew one collection after another.
The fact that the fashion industry is one of the biggest polluters of the environment is nothing new.
Billions of pieces of clothing end up in incinerators and landfills every year.
However, the view of slow fashion, an often despised approach to dressing, has changed relatively quickly in recent years.
About half of Pietro Filipi's goods were sold at full price.
The other half, which was sold thanks to discounts, will not simply buy.
The company does not want to spit out one collection after another and at the end of each season reduce the price of products below their production price.
Moreover, according to the owner Michal Mička, the times of new and old collections and the blind following of rapidly changing fashion trends are gone.
"Most traders count on discounts when buying goods, so the full price includes a much higher margin.
So it's actually a bit of a scam, "says Pietro Filipi owner Michal Mička.
In addition, the company wants to support the local business with its approach.
"Each of our products is made from carefully selected quality fabrics and designed by local designers.
We emphasize that a large part of our collection consists of so-called basic pieces - ie clothing that is timeless and over-season.
Worldwide, the segment of premium brands in the absence of any discounts is typical, the price of the product simply corresponds to its quality and a discount is not needed, "adds Mička.
Giant graffiti features RAF pilot Kurt Taussig
"The task was to create something to mark the anniversary of the end of the war.
And I remembered our fighter pilot, who fought in the British Royal Air Force in World War II.
The management liked the design, "said Vacek, who finished his work after fourteen days of intensive work.
He used about 300 liters of paint and 50 sprays.
Kurt Taussig was born in 1923 in Teplice-Šanov.
He left town when he was 15 years old.
During the war, due to his Jewish origin, the Nazis dragged him to an internment camp, where they kept him for several weeks.
However, thanks to Nicholas Winton's organization, he and his brother managed to avoid a concentration camp.
In 1939, Taussig entered Great Britain, where he volunteered for the Royal Air Force (RAF), and later underwent pilot training in Southern Rhodesia and Palestine, Africa.
He joined combat operations in early 1945.
After the Velvet Revolution, he visited the Czechia and his native Teplice several times, which granted him honorary citizenship.
Forty-six-year-old Kamil Vacek, known to people in the street graphic arts industry under the nickname Camo, has been working with sprays in the streets of Teplice for over 20 years.
He started with graffiti on areas set aside for this purpose by the then mayor Jaroslav Kubera (ODS).
Storm Hanna arrived on the Texas coast
Hurricane Hanna arrived on the southwest coast of the US state of Texas on Saturday afternoon local time (before midnight CET at night).
It hit the Texas island of Padre Island, about 24 kilometers north of Port Mansfield, and weakened to a tropical storm as it moved over the mainland.
However, according to meteorologists, it still poses a great danger to the inhabitants of coastal areas.
It brought with it a strong wind and heavy rainfall; along with local floods, power outages and various property damage, including damaged ships, are reported, according to the AP.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott declared a state of natural disaster on 32 counties in southwest Texas on Saturday and recommended that people voluntarily evacuate.
The strongest warning was given to people from the coastal strip between Port Mansfield and Mesquite Bay, but in total the element is to hit an area almost 500 kilometers long before gradually moving over northeastern Mexico.
"Although Hanna is now a tropical storm, heavy rain and wind, rising water levels, dangerous surfs and isolated tornadoes can pose a threat," warned the US National Hurricane Center (NHC).
This morning local time (CET afternoon), the storm was moving in the area of the American-Mexican border and was accompanied by a wind of 85 kilometers per hour.
Hanna became the first hurricane of this year's hurricane season in the Atlantic area on Saturday.
It was accompanied by a wind of up to 145 kilometers per hour over the Gulf of Mexico, but as it progressed to the mainland, it gradually weakened to 112 kilometers per hour, which again excluded Hanna from the hurricane category.
Authorities urged locals to weather the storms, not forgetting hygiene measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
Texas is one of the US states most affected by the covid-19 pandemic.
Due to the existing safety measures and the need to observe distances, possible evacuations are also a great challenge.
Temporary shelters were opened in hotels, schools and gyms.
In Hidalgo County, Texas, one of the buildings was also adapted as a shelter for evacuees who tested positive for coronavirus or were otherwise infected.
Local authorities urged all evacuees to take veils and disinfectant gels with them if possible.
"We are far from over.
We are expecting catastrophic floods, "AP quoted Chris Birchfield, who works for the National Meteorological Service (NWS) in Brownsville.
Forecasts suggest that in some places up to 300 millimeters of rainfall could rain in a few hours, in some cases almost 500 millimeters, which, along with rising sea levels, could flood a number of coastal settlements.
Zeman will grant the rank of general to Colonel Lipek
On Wednesday, President Miloš Zeman will grant the rank of colonel to Colonel Pavel Lipek.
This follows from an overview of the expected events of the Ministry of Defense.
The reason for conferring the rank of brigadier general is Lipka's August appointment as deputy commander of the Alliance's Multinational Division Northeast in Poland.
Lipka still works as the deputy commander of the ground forces of the Czech army.
The government proposed a promotion to Zeman at the end of June.
From the beginning of August, Lipka will replace Brigadier General Karel Řehka in the position of Deputy Commander of the Multinational Division Northeast in Elblag, Poland, which commands units of the Alliance's advanced presence in Poland and the Baltics.
In March, Řehka became the director of the National Office for Cyber and Information Security (NÚKIB).
The government proposed to the president that he grant Lipek the rank of brigadier general.
According to the Act on Professional Soldiers, a higher rank may be granted to a soldier for the period of performing the elected office or for the period of performing a service task that requires the granting of a higher rank.
The position of Deputy Commander of the Alliance Division corresponds to the rank of general.
A soldier to whom a rank has been granted has the same rights and obligations as if he had been appointed to that rank.
However, he is not entitled to a salary adjustment that would correspond to the given rank.
The award of a rank lasts until the reason for which it was granted expires.
"Colonel Lipka demonstrates high professional readiness and is a role model for subordinates.
It plays an important role in fulfilling the tasks of the Czech Armed Forces, including cooperation with foreign partners and ensuring the army's participation in foreign operations, "the Ministry of Defense said in June of the proposal for promotion.
Wednesday's promotion will take place at 12:30 at Prague Castle, with the participation of Defense Minister Lubomír Metnar and Chief of General Staff Aleš Opata.
EU countries have coronavirus standards for aviation
European Union countries have agreed on common hygiene standards for air travel to help reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
This was announced by the German Minister of Transport Andreas Scheuer.
Among the agreed standards is keeping a distance or wearing veils in the plane and at the airport, but the middle seats in the aircraft will not have to remain unoccupied.
Reuters reported.
"I am glad that my colleagues have accepted the German proposal for Europe and that we have been able to agree on these uniform standards," Scheuer told the European Aviation Conference.
The German Ministry of Transport then added that the agreement had been concluded by officials and that it still had to be formally approved by the ministers.
The agreed measures include the requirement to cover the mouth and nose of passengers from the age of six, to observe the recommended distance during security checks and check-in at the airport.
Sufficient fresh air must also be guaranteed in aircraft and all information must be available in several languages.
Airlines will also be able to occupy the middle seats.
The common rules agreed by the officials meet at least some of the airlines' requirements.
Different standards caused confusion.
A temperature record was set in Arctic Svalbard, where they measured almost 22 degrees
"A 41-year-old record was set in Longyearbyen," the Norwegian Meteorological Institute said on Twitter.
In the early evening, the temperature there rose to 21.7 degrees Celsius, which exceeded the record of 1979 by 0.4 degrees, he added.
About 2,000 Longyearbyen is the largest city in Svalbard, located about 1300 kilometers from the North Pole.
Svalbard is heating up faster than almost any other place on Earth.
This highlights the dangers of warming other parts of the Arctic - from Alaska to Siberia, according to a report by last year's Norwegian Center for Climate Study.
According to him, the average temperature in Svalbard has risen by three to five degrees since the 1970s.
By 2100, it could rise by as much as ten degrees if greenhouse gas emissions are not reduced.
Rising temperatures in Svalbard can result in the melting of permafrost, which threatens the stability of many buildings, roads or airports and can cause more avalanches and landslides.
Climate warming is also threatening Arctic fauna, such as polar bears and seals, which are dependent on the ocean ice sheet.
The British who return from Spain will face a mandatory two-week quarantine
The British cabinet also called on citizens to avoid all unnecessary trips to mainland Spain due to the risk of spreading covid-19.
The Canary and Balearic Islands are therefore not mentioned, but even after returning from them, people have to go into isolation for two weeks.
The new rules come into force at midnight.
"Protecting public health is our absolute priority.
We have taken this decision to prevent the possible spread of the virus in Britain, "British diplomacy said in a statement.
"We have always made it clear that if necessary, we will immediately remove a country from the list of safe ones," she added.
As noted by the British newspaper Metro, the latest announcement will hit the travel plans of thousands of Britons.
Spain is one of the very popular holiday destinations.
Among other things, the British are concerned about whether they will be paid sick pay if they have to end up in isolation for 14 days after returning from vacation.
For example, Neil Hunter from Sittingbourne booked a 10-day vacation to Lanzarote, which was scheduled to depart on Tuesday.
They have booked the tour since December.
"We were supposed to go the whole family, my wife Amanda and daughter Bethany, but to be honest, I don't know what will happen after this announcement.
I work as a train driver and I don't think my employer will agree to be quarantined for two weeks after returning from vacation, "Metro Hunter was quoted as saying.
With regard to Spain, there are concerns that the country is at the beginning of the second wave of the epidemic.
Over the last two days, more than 900 new infections have been added in 24 hours.
Authorities in some areas are already tightening coronavirus measures, for example, Catalonia is trying to curb all nightlife to prevent people from meeting in large numbers.
The Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs has recently drawn attention to the increased risk of infection in Catalonia, Aragon, the Basque Country and the Madrid region.
The model of electricity purchase from Dukovany will be discussed by the government
On Monday, the government will discuss a model for the purchase of electricity from the planned new unit of the Dukovany Nuclear Power Plant.
The bill envisages that if the purchase price is higher than the price of power on the market, the difference will be paid by all consumers through tariffs.
In the second case, where the purchase price is lower than the market price, the impact on consumers will be the opposite.
Power electricity is an unregulated part of the final price of electricity for customers.
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry Karel Havlíček (for YES) and the energy company ČEZ have previously stated that a more probable option is that people will save on electricity thanks to the construction.
Analysts, on the other hand, point out that the long-term outlook for electricity prices in the markets is always uncertain, as developments in the past have shown several times.
The plan has previously been criticized by environmental organizations.
"The purchase price can be both below and above the market price of power electricity.
The final impact at the time of application of the rule can be both negative and positive.
The impact will be distributed among customers according to the size of the circuit breaker - with lower consumption or according to electricity consumption - with higher electricity consumption, "said the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MIT) in the material documents.
In May, Havlíček stated that he assumes that the wholesale price of electricity will increase and that people will earn on the Dukovan construction site.
Otherwise, the impact will be in the tens of crowns per year per family, which, according to him, is far less than people pay annually in electricity bills to support so-called supported resources.
He had previously estimated that the purchase price could be between 50 and 60 euros (about 1320 to 1600 CZK) per megawatt-hour (MWh).
The submitted material does not contain any proposed amount, it should be included only in the purchase contract.
The price of electricity on the Prague Energy Exchange for 2021, for which traders now supply the most, is currently around 45 euros (about 1190 CZK) per MWh.
"Given the difference between the purchase price and the market price of electricity of ten euros, the average household could pay a surcharge of 3.3 MWh per year - it may correspond to a four-member household, equipped with electrical appliances as standard, including an electric hob and oven, but does not use electricity for heating. and hot water heating - less than CZK 100 / year, "the MIT wrote in documents for the government.
"We live in an extremely turbulent time.
The coronavirus pandemic has shown us how vulnerable the global economy is.
For this reason, I consider the long-term forecast of market prices to be an explicitly speculative matter, "Tomáš Voltr, the executive director of the Energy financial group investment group, told ČTK earlier.
The proposed law envisages that the purchase would be carried out by the Ministry of Industry and Trade, or a legal entity authorized by it, owned by the state for a predetermined price.
The contract between the investor and the state, guaranteeing the conditions for the purchase of electricity, would be concluded for at least 30 years, with a possible extension of ten years, even repeated, but no longer than until the end of operation of low-carbon production.
It defines a low-carbon generation proposal as electricity generation with a nuclear reactor connected to an electricity system with an installed capacity with a minimum electrical output of 100 megawatts (MW) after 2030.
Havlíček previously stated that the new Dukovany unit should have an output of 1,200 MW and produce nine terawatt hours of electricity per year, which would correspond to one tenth of the expected Czech consumption.
The unit should be put into operation in 2036.
The government approved the financing model for the new Dukovany bloc on Monday.
The state should finance interest-free facilities during construction, and a 2% interest rate is expected during operation.
The opposition does not agree with the financing model, it is also bothered by the possibility that Dukovany would build Russian or Chinese companies.
The state should participate in the construction 70 percent.
The rest should be paid by ČEZ, which will also cover any additional costs.
In May, CEZ CEO Daniel Benes told CTK that the expected amount for the construction of the unit at current prices is about six billion euros (approximately 162 billion crowns).
Agreements between the state and ČEZ on the construction of a new Dukovany unit will be signed on Tuesday.
The Ministry of Regional Development has withdrawn material on the promotion of tourism in the media for two billion
The Office withdrew the material, according to which the Ministry for Regional Development (MRD) planned to spend two billion crowns in the media, on the Internet and on billboards for advertising on holidays in the Czech Republic.
Minister Klára Dostálová (for YES) of the SeznamZprávy.cz server said that the material is still being worked on.
The Zdopravy.cz server drew attention to the document in the eKlep (electronic library of the legislative process) on Friday.
The ministry justified the plan by the decline in tourism due to coronavirus.
During the coronavirus crisis, both the revenue and the media fell.
The proposal provoked criticism from the opposition and tourism representatives.
According to the proposal, which can now be viewed on the hlidacstatu.cz website, the Ministry of Regional Development planned to give money for advertising on television, radio, in the press, on the Internet, billboards and areas at railway stations through the state agency for tourism support CzechTourism.
The largest part of the money, 700 million crowns, would be given to television.
Most would be won by Nova and Prima private televisions.
Printed dailies and weeklies would receive 400 million and the same part would be given by the Ministry of Regional Development for PR articles, advertising banners and videos on websites.
Radio stations would receive 350 million for the media campaign, most of which again private stations.
The remaining 150 million would be used for outdoor advertising on billboards, LED screens and areas at stations or in the metro.
The campaign to support tourism in the Czech Republic was to begin in mid-August and last for a year.
"The material is still being worked on, it is definitely not in the form that should be presented yet," Dostálová said without further details to the SeznamZprávy server.
The material was criticized by the opposition, according to the head of TOP 09, Markéta Pekarová Adamová, the media from the trust funds of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (YES) would benefit from the advertisement.
"I firmly believe that this spectacular contempt will get a blow to the eyes in the autumn at the election," she wrote on Twitter.
Dostálová denies that it is in fact a matter of helping the media affected by the crisis.
"It can also be a coincidence, I don't know anything about media support at all," she told Deník N on Friday.
According to her, the budget of two billion is indicative.
"Of course we still count it, it can be less or more.
It is a working material, "she added.
The Save Tourism initiative does not make sense for a media campaign to promote domestic tourism.
"We want two billion for companies in tourism, not an unnecessary advertising campaign," the chairman of the initiative, Tomáš Barčík, said on Sunday.
If there are those two billion crowns in the state budget, they should go to companies, not the media, the initiative writes in an open letter to the government.
Broth of life, a rooster of beer and death like a blade of grass
The third album entitled And Death is a Blade of Grass by the Brno poet, a tireless organizer of cultural activities and publisher Jaroslav Erik Frič, who also left a year ago, on May 24, is posthumous.
He is the fifth item in Frič's discography and, as in previous titles, the main emphasis here is on Frič's poetry, of which he himself is an excellent performer.
Frič, born in 1949, was of course influenced by the American beat generation, but he inspired this inspiration through his own, individually presented experiences as well as very inner expressions of faith.
However, he was far from agitation, if he talked or wrote about faith, about God, it was always very intimate, non-aggressive, completely tolerant.
In this context, Bohuslav Reynek (in contrast to Jan Zahradníček, for example) comes to mind, the masters forgive.
Frič's album offers recordings of the author's reading from 2006, as well as performances with musicians who always accompanied him very sensitively, whether it was cellist Josef Klíč, or Honza Bartoň and Vítězslav Holata.
I will be happy - gladly - with the words of the Ostrava poet Petr Hruška about Frič's long poetic compositions.
"They radiated a proud and endless bitterness," Hruška writes, "over the state of our endangered world.
The world, which is sinking more and more into dull consumer vanity and greed, is moving further and further away from what its soul was made of - the mystery of faith, humility and human closeness.
There was a longing for those who know that the values for which it was created are of little interest to them, but who also know that they cannot be renounced simply because of a general lack of interest.
Those poems reminded that one may have to lose everything expensive, but it is not irrelevant how it is lost.
If he sells himself into general bankruptcy, he resigns skeptically, falls silently, or stays in peace and pride in the last moment on what he believes and loves. "
Paroubek is not my advisor, Hamáček said
Former Prime Minister and Chairman of the CSSD Jiří Paroubek is not a paid advisor to the Social Democracy.
The party chairman and interior minister Jan Hamáček only communicates with him and reads his opinions and articles.
Hamáček said this today on the Prima Partie television show.
On Friday, the SeznamZprávy.cz server informed that Paroubek should be Hamáček's advisor.
"From time to time we write a text message, he sometimes sends me some material and I read it," Hamáček said today.
He added that this was not an official and paid cooperation.
According to him, the CSSD does not have the resources to waste them for similar purposes.
"There are a lot of people like that that I read his opinion from time to time," he said.
In a subsequent discussion with ODS MP Jana Černochová, the minister said that many ODS members were still "openly listening to Václav Klaus' views".
According to him, this is fine, because he is an experienced politician and a former chairman of the party, which is also the case with Paroubek.
He described the fact that the media are making an affair a sign of this year's cucumber season.
The SeznamZprávy.cz server wrote on Friday that Paroubek plays the role of Hamáček's unofficial consultant.
He also wrote that the former chairman of the local cell, Petr Benda, who is connected with Paroubek and acted as vice-chairman of his LEV 21 party, is heading for the fourth place of the party's candidate in the Ústí nad Labem region.
Hamáček said today that he will not comment on the candidate's composition until it is ready and approved.
Duplantis has a mile lead, it's a kick in the ass, the Swede's challenger laments
The 22-year-old American pole vaulter has the ambition and potential to be one of the new ruler's most serious competitors.
He already knows what it's like to beat Duplantis two years younger, he defeated him at a meeting of the NCAA University Association last year.
"We had a battle the year before, then he won and I was second, then we swapped it.
In both cases, it was a very good duel, "describes Nilsen, who secured the victory with a performance of 5.95 meters.
But since then, Duplantis has shot up steeply and is currently alone in the highest spheres of clubbing.
In just twenty years, he became a world record holder, this year on February 8 in Toruń he crossed the bar of 6.17 meters, a week later in Glasgow he added another centimeter.
"He jumped six meters when he was 18 when he finished high school," recalls his peer Nilsen for the World Athletics website.
"It was clear that once he grew from a boy to a man, he would multiply all his potential and talent tenfold.
Twenty years is a pretty good age to break the world record, "he believes.
Although Nilsen's list of accomplishments is much thinner than Duplantis's pride, the American has similar goals.
So far, he has indicated his options at the NCAA races, which he regularly won, in February this year he improved his internal personal record to 5.93 m. Last August he won a gold medal at the Pan American Games in Lima, in 2017 he fought his way to the American expeditions to the world championship, where he finished 13th.
The next milestone for him is to taste the Diamond League for the first time.
"It's definitely my priority to get on the professional circuit and race as much as possible in the Diamond League, because you can make a name for yourself there," he realizes.
"If you can succeed at this level, you can undoubtedly do the same at events such as the Olympics, the World Cup or the Pan American Games."
However, due to the pandemic, these high holidays are being postponed, which gives Nilsen and the other pole vaulters time to improve.
But will that be enough to catch up with Duplantis, who can easily turn a race under five laps into a mere battle for silver?
"Everyone is trying to catch up with him, but I don't think it will be possible in the near future," Nilsen thinks.
"The boy has been jumping for 16 years and has a mile lead over everyone else in training."
And before Tokyo 2021 begins, it will want to increase it even more.
The woman spent hundreds of thousands on her disabled son's disability pension.
A trial awaits her
The money that a 33-year-old man receives from the state as a disability pension is intended primarily to improve the quality of his life.
A woman faces up to eight years in prison for embezzlement.
Due to poor health, the court deprived the sick man of his rights and appointed his mother as a guardian, who was to manage his son's money, among other things.
"From mid-November 2013 to January this year, the woman used part of the funds from her son's disability pension for her own needs and thus deprived him of 440 thousand crowns," said police spokeswoman Dana Ladmanová, adding that she accused the accused woman of having a special guardian obligation to defend the interests of the injured party.
According to the court's instructions, the woman opened an account for her son, but she had his pension sent to her account.
"After paying for the costs associated with her son's stay in the medical facility and payment for the necessary medicines, she used the remaining funds to buy a vehicle, electrical appliances and to run a household," the indictment said.
The woman admitted that she could not use her son's money for her own needs.
But she defended herself by helping them pay family expenses.
"We had problems with our income tightening the household.
We never bought anything above standard.
It was always on things that my son would approve of buying.
I considered it family money.
I had no idea that I was committing a crime, "the woman explained to the police.
She promised to return the money to her son.
North America has been inhabited for 30,000 years, scientists say after finding the tools
Finds from the Chiquihuite cave in the Mexican state of Zacatecas include 1930 limestone tools, including fine blades that could be used to cut meat and pointed objects that could serve as spearheads or spears.
Researchers have found that the oldest of the tools date from 33,000 to 31,000 years ago.
"There are only a few products of this age.
But they are here, "said archaeologist Ciprian Ardelean of the University of Zacatecas and lead author of one of two studies published on the subject in the journal Nature.
The youngest instruments are 12,500 years old.
According to experts, the people have inhabited the Chiquihuite cave, located at high altitude, for 20,000 years.
Until now, the generally accepted theory was that the first representatives of the species Homo sapiens crossed the land bridge from the area of today's Russia to Alaska about 13,500 years ago.
Archaeological evidence, including unique spearheads used to kill mammoths and other prehistoric animals, has shown that this human culture subsequently spread to much of North America.
However, this model has cracked in recent decades when several ancient settlements were discovered that were two to three thousand years older.
A second study published in the journal Nature reports 42 different sites throughout North America that demonstrate a human presence on the continent between 26,000 and 19,000 years ago.
Researchers believe that a small number of people may have come to the North American mainland earlier than previously thought.
Some could get to America by boat.
"Obviously, people were in America long before the development of the so-called human culture," said anthropologist Ruth Gruhn of a university in the Canadian province of Alberta.
So far, the interest in tickets is fulfilled by the optimistic scenario, say the sellers.
Prices are also gradually falling
Ticket sales in the Czech Republic are growing every week.
Compared to last summer, the interest is still about half, but the demand is growing by up to 20 percent every week.
According to the sellers, the development after the crisis thus fulfills the most optimistic scenarios.
Ticket prices are also gradually falling.
According to the sellers, the most popular destinations are mainly the southern European countries.
According to Kiwi.com, Spain, Italy and Greece lead.
Flights to Split, Croatia are the most sold on the Letuška.cz portal.
Of the other countries, the United Kingdom is the most sought-after, but it has always been one of the busiest destinations.
The average price of air tickets is also falling.
At the Letuška.cz portal, it was around 6,250 crowns in the middle of the month, down 3,000 crowns year-on-year.
This is mainly due to an increase in demand for European destinations, which now account for about 85 percent of sales.
However, prices themselves are also falling to some European cities, such as Spain or Italy, which have fallen by about a fifth in recent weeks.
The crisis has also affected the behavior of customers who now buy tickets much less in advance than before, because they fear further developments in the coronavirus situation.
According to previous information from Kiwi.com, the time of ticket purchase before departure decreased by about ten days year-on-year.
"This is confirmed by the future trend where people will order tickets much less in advance, they will require more flexibility, less risk," said Michal Šindelář, Vice President for Kiwi.com Products.
Currently, the average booking time before departure is 21 days.
Along with the growth in sales, the number of renewed airlines from the Czech Republic is also rising.
At Prague Airport, there are currently regular flights to more than 60 destinations.
Compared to last summer season, this is about half of the destinations.
The grand finale tonight!
Watch the darts battle live at Nova Sport
The second most prestigious tournament within the PDC organization reached the grand final.
It will feature the experienced forty-nine-year-old Scottish darts Gary Anderson and the surprise of the tournament, the 26-year-old Belgian Dimitri van den Bergh.
Gary Anderson eliminated Justin Pip in the first round, then ran into his neighbor in the leaderboard.
However, he also managed with James Wade and in the quarterfinals he fought well with Simon Whitlock, who had previously sent home the world number one.
He had "Flying Cattle" in the semifinals when he faced Michale Smith.
At the last moment, however, he escaped the gravedigger from the shovel, dominated in overtime and after the result of 18:16 he won a place in the finals of the tournament, which he dominated in 2018, when he defeated Mensur Suljovič in an amazing battle at 21:19.
The biggest surprise of World Matchplay is Dimitri van den Bergh.
He enjoys the Belgian talent in the tournament and perhaps the knowledge that he has nothing to lose helped him to play on an absolutely fantastic wave.
The 26-year-old darts first surprisingly eliminated Nathan Aspinall's world number six, they also pushed Joe Cullen in a dramatic battle and defeated Adrian Lewis in the quarterfinals after a sharp start.
The semifinals were a big test.
Glen Durrant showed his strength at the beginning, but the calmly playing Belgian then gained an advantage with an excellent series, which he held more or less without problems until the end.
Van den Bergh showed his strength in high scoring, which he encountered the occasional uncertainty on doubles.
Cases of coronavirus have increased at least since the beginning of the week, and the number of tests has decreased
Since the beginning of March, when the new coronavirus was first discovered in the Czech Republic, it has been proven to have infected 15,212 people.
Almost 9,600 of them have already been cured, 368 patients have died.
At present, 5,254 people are ill.
This follows from data on the website of the Ministry of Health.
The daily number of newly confirmed cases this week has exceeded four hundred four times in a row.
The maximum was 281 cases on Friday.
There were 235 positive people on Thursday, 246 a day earlier and 206 on Tuesday.
On the first working day of this week, 169 more were infected.
9,590 people have already been cured of covid-19 in the Czech Republic, ie 63 percent of all those infected so far.
In most cases, the disease was mild.
According to the latest data from the Ministry of Health, there are 151 people with coronavirus in the hospital, 19 of whom are assessed as serious by doctors.
There are several outbreaks of covid-19 in the Czech Republic.
Karviná is still the most infected in the last seven days per 100,000 inhabitants, almost 59.
This is followed by the district of Jihlava with 56 and Frýdek-Místek with 36 infected per 100,000 inhabitants in the last week.
Due to the increased number of infections, new measures against the spread of coronavirus have been in force in the Czech Republic since Saturday.
People must wear wearing veils at indoor mass events of over 100 people, these are cultural and sporting events, but also weddings and funerals inside buildings.
From Monday, the capacity of these events will be halved from the current thousand people.
Worldwide, the number of people demonstrably infected with the new coronavirus has already exceeded 16 million.
This was stated by the American Johns Hopkins University, which monitors the development of the pandemic globally.
According to this source, the balance of victims who died with covid-19 is close to 645,000.
The latest million infected have been added to the statistics in just three days; the 15 million mark fell on July 22.
The United States, which already registers over 4.1 million infected people, Brazil with 2.4 million and India, where the authorities say almost 1.4 million people became infected, had the largest share in the rapid growth in the number of cases in recent days.
Infection is now increasing at a record pace.
The World Health Organization announced this week that more than 284,000 new cases were added worldwide between Thursday and Friday, the highest daily balance since the start of the pandemic.
This development can be attributed to the fact that the spread of the disease is at its peak in populous countries such as the USA, Brazil and India, but according to Reuters, the number of new cases grew last week in almost 40 countries around the world.
This applies, for example, to Australia, Japan, Bolivia, Sudan, Bulgaria, Belgium and Israel.
The disease has already appeared in almost all countries of the world, the first case was officially announced by the DPRK today.
Household air is up to five times worse than outdoor air.
Air fresheners and deodorants are harmful to health
Health is threatened not only by poor air quality outdoors, but also at home.
Israeli human health expert Carol Abraham, quoted by The Jerusalem Post, pointed this out.
According to Abraham, who helped create the Israeli Ministry of Environmental Protection, household pollutants need to be addressed right now, with many people spending more time working from home.
Abraham mentioned a study by the American Environment Agency (EPA), according to which the quality of domestic air is up to five times worse than outdoor air.
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 3.8 million people die prematurely each year due to poor air quality in their homes.
"Because of the coronavirus epidemic, which has forced and continues to force many to work from home, people have to spend more hours in their homes than before, so it's time to focus on indoor air quality," Abraham said.
According to her, almost no one in Israel deals with the quality of "domestic air".
Things that a person normally comes into contact with can be dangerous - paints, air fresheners, disinfectants, deodorants or pesticides.
"The poison gas is also emitted by clothes that we regularly carry to the treatment plant," Abraham said.
According to her, the most endangered are children, old household members and people with breathing difficulties.
Even otherwise, healthy individuals may begin to suffer from problems such as headaches, fainting, nasal irritation, nosebleeds, vomiting, or skin allergies.
Prolonged exposure to unhealthy substances can damage internal organs and the central nervous system.
However, not all pollutants come from objects inside households, the source can also be the material from which houses are built.
Quiz about Václav Havel: How long he spent in prison and what made him write Charter 77
Fuenlabrada lost her chance to advance to the top Spanish football league due to a coronavirus infection in the team.
The management of the competition canceled the originally postponed duel of the last round of the second league, in which the team could secure its participation in the playoffs.
Fuenlabrada reported another 12 infected people on Saturday, bringing the total number of positive tests for covid-19 at the club to 28.
Due to an infection in the team, Monday's duel against La Coruni was postponed, in which Fuenlabrada had enough points to make it to the playoffs.
The management of the competition stated today that the duel against La Coruni was definitively canceled due to force majeure due to the fact that it was never played again.
Fuenlabrada accepted the decision.
On the other hand, La Coruňa's play was disheartening.
In the end, given the results of their rivals, even a victory over Fuenlabrada would not be enough to save him, but he considers it unfair that the last round did not take place according to custom, complete in a single time.
The leadership of the former elite Spanish club is threatened by a court due to a fall into the third league.
The first two teams in the Huesca and Cádiz tables have the certainty of advancing among the elite.
Zaragoza, Almería, Girona and Elche will compete for the remaining third place in the playoffs.
Did Karel Gott not like Václav Havel ?!
Dominika's daughter revealed it
"Dad didn't have to have him for many years," she told Aha! Gott Dominika's eldest daughter, with the proviso that the Master could not come to Havel's name and whenever it came to him, Karel was always annoyed.
It's hard to say what they did, but according to Dominic, the dispute began sometime in the mid-1990s.
"In an article after the revolution, Dad said it was easier than him.
That Havel could write in a drawer in the dark, but if he resisted, he would have ended his career, "says Gott.
But then he adds that in the end the Czech greats still found their way to each other.
"I know Havel couldn't hear the word until he was in his sixties.
But then the president congratulated him on his birthday and suddenly his father's relationship with him began to change, "Dominika recalls.
After all, ten years later, Gott even invited the former president to celebrate his 70th birthday at the Ambassador Hotel on Wenceslas Square.
"And that's where a new era of their relationship began, because my father then regularly invited Mr. Havel home to Bertramka," added the blonde, whose father died last October.
It is also said that Slavík was sorry that he never received a state award from Václav Havel.
After all, he survived it in 2009, even though it was already in the hands of his successor as Václav Klaus (79).
He will receive further honors in memoriam, as the current president Miloš Zeman (75) is to award him the Order of the White Lion and thus honor his memory.
