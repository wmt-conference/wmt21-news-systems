The well-hidden cave at the hermit in the forests near nový Bor was not actually habitable
In the north of Bohemia, in the foothills of the lusatian mountains, near nový Bor in Czechoslovakia, several sandstone rock formations are hidden in the forests along the count's path.
Both natural and man-made.
And we will go after the man-made one.
The place is called the hermit's cave.
In fact, no hermit ever lived here, and the cave served as a shelter, more precisely, a hiding chamber, probably for grain.
The cave is carved from the side into the rock face and accessible by stairs from above.
At the same time, until the last moment, it is practically not visible.
It is revealed only by narrow steps leading to a kind of rock gallery, from where you only enter the rock.
Although it seems that the chamber is considerably far from human habitation, at the time of creation it could have been on the plateau, where today there is a forest, a field.
"The fact that the building does not have a window and the traditional location of the firebox clearly proves that no hermit could ever survive the winter here," explains historian Kamil podroužek from the Faculty of philosophy of John the evangelist purkyně in Ústí nad Labem.
The one-story building has only a stone bench at the back, apparently serving to store containers.
"I see it as a storage chamber for some food or products from the field," adds Kamil podroužek.
Traces of tools are visible on the walls of the cave.
Breaking off the sandstone with a tip was quite simple and quick for the initiates.
It was enough to properly use the joints and gradually break off the sandstone.
According to the length of the trail of the canines and the method of cutting in general, it is possible to determine the period of formation of the cave.
According to the historian, this is probably the end of the 18th century. century.
The cave is freely accessible and according to the mess that appears in it, someone sometimes sleeps there these days.
If you approach the cave from above from one of the forest paths and you are intrigued by a flowing stream under the cave and a nearby count's path, then you will definitely find a path down.
And on the way out of the forest, you may still be captivated by the nearby Raven rocks.

Electric cars report a new record.
In the Czech Republic, they were recharged the most in history
"Growth was driven by a 30% increase in the number of stations in our network and the trend of more frequent charging at public stations, as well as the accelerated development of registrations of new e-cars," said Tomáš chmelík, head of the čez clean technologies department.
Other big players, such as PRE and e, are also claiming their share of the market.He, the manufacturer of electric cars Tesla, but also supermarkets bill and Lidl.
In turn, the operators of conventional petrol stations are represented by MOL.
She doesn't have the numbers yet.
"We started building our network for electromobility only last year," explained company spokeswoman Jana jusková.
However, the editors of the journal exclusively obtained data from all 216 electrical stands operated by čez.
It follows from them that drivers from the stations took an average of 13.5 kWh.
That's equivalent to a 100-mile range of a smaller electric car.
Leaving aside minor pumping up to 1 kWh, the average charge lasts two and a half hours.
The vast majority of refueling then took place at a free tariff.
If motorists have already paid for the collection, their typical spend was around CZK 330.
Electromobility pulls mainly in the capital.
On the territory of Prague there are all five of the most busy recharges of čez, which overshadow the entire regional cities with their popularity.
Between the regions then leads Olomouc.
On the contrary, the least interest is in remote stations in the border area, for example in bohumín or in prachatice, which often remain unused throughout the day.
More than four thousand electric vehicles are currently registered in the Czech Republic.
In the first half of this year alone, 1274 new e-cars were added.
In an extensive survey of the newspaper "Czechs in motion", eight percent of readers said that they are considering buying an electric car for the family.
However, only a third of respondents know where to look for the nearest charging station in their area.

She stated that the main demands of the protesters are the creation of a plan for water retention in the countryside, a radical change in agricultural policy and the subsidy system towards the promotion of sustainable agriculture and the fastest possible transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.
"The government has to defend the interests of the people, not reckless and devastating business," she said.

"It threatens the source of drinking water for 140, 000 people," he said.
He added that wells represent the fifth most productive source of drinking water in the Czech Republic.

Vojtěch Veselý came from the village of valeč in Karlovy Vary as a so-called agroecological farmer.
He drew attention to the advantages of small farms, which do not seek income and profit and supply the population directly on the spot.

Now the daily increases in the number of infected are higher, but every day with covid-19, a maximum of two people die.
Karvinsko still has the highest number of people infected per capita, and Jihlava has similar numbers due to an outbreak in the local Alzheimer's center, where there are already 57 infected - 40 clients and 17 employees.

Debutant champion!
Van den Bergh finished the fairy tale, Anderson was swept away
The big surprise of the tournament by the name of Dimitri van den Bergh showed an excellent performance even in a duel with the player who won the second most prestigious enterprise within the PDC in 2018.
The start of the match was balanced on both sides, the break came at 8: 7 for the Belgian dart player.
Van den Bergh took brejk with a 13-point leg and has had the upper hand ever since.
He literally crushed his opponent with his game, and the significantly more experienced "Flying Scot" was hardly able to get to the doubles.
The way the "dream maker" had it in his hand is also evidenced by the fact that a disheveled Anderson played his first maximum only at 24. LEGO.
In addition, the young Belgian coped brilliantly with high checkouts.
The last time he lost in the 11th leg, under unfavorable conditions, but "caught a big fish" and closed 170.
At the end of the match, Anderson showed tremendous frustration.
He was more of a dart thrower and his triumphant opponent was absolutely masterful.
Van den Bergh converted the first of three match darts and lived up to his name-he wrote his big dream.
Winning the trophy named after Phil Taylor is all the more valuable for the Belgian dart player because it is his first major won.
The last player to beat van den Bergh was Karel sedláček.
In Nantes, charges were filed over the fire of the cathedral, the man confessed
The cathedral of St. Peter and Paul in the heart of Nantes caught fire last Saturday and the fire severely damaged the original stained glass windows from the 16th century. century and destroyed the organ.
Suspicion of arson investigators checked due to the fact that the fire proceeded through the temple from three different places.
At the same time, the police at the entrances did not find any signs that someone had entered the cathedral by force.
The accused is a volunteer with the local diocese, a 39-year-old Rwandan refugee.
The police arrested him shortly after the fire, but then released him without opening a criminal case.
Now the prosecutor's office reported that on the basis of new evidence, the man was arrested again on Saturday, confessed and faces charges of arson.
If found guilty, he faces up to ten years in prison and a hefty fine.
According to his lawyer, the man regrets the crime and decided to cooperate fully with the investigators, wrote Le Monde.
Vojtěch: on Monday we will present "traffic light" for epidemiological measures
The new system is supposed to fulfill the role of a pandemic plan, because of the absence of which the government and the Ministry of health are facing criticism.
"The degrees will be according to the strength of community dissemination," explained the minister.
He added that at present, for example, the Moravian-Silesian region or Prague would reach the middle, orange degree.
The system is designed as a regional one, since the situation in individual regions varies significantly, he added.
On the system, the ministry cooperated with epidemiologists and the Institute of health information and statistics (Uzis).
According to the minister, specific measures will be linked to individual degrees, whether it is the obligation to wear veils or the organization of special departments in hospitals.
The minister of the interior Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) called for the creation of an epidemiological plan on prima partie television, according to which people should have clear information about what measures they can expect if the epidemiological situation worsens.
The daily increase in confirmed cases in the Czech Republic has been growing in recent days, although the number of hospitalizations remains low.
Vojtěch commented that nothing fundamental is happening there is no place to talk about declaring a state of emergency or calling the crisis staff again.
The government in view of the growing number of infected from Saturday across the Czech Republic again introduced the obligation to wear masks at internal events over 100 people.
From Monday, the capacity of these events will be limited to 500 people, now it is 1000 people.
The government's action, which until the last moment was not clear what measures and when they will start to apply or when they will be announced, has received criticism.
"I think that in a situation that is quite tense, the main actors should, on the contrary, create a sense of security and, on the contrary, straighten out the confusion," Senator Marek Hilser said in the questions.
Measures may already vary by region, for example, in Prague, from Sunday, the obligation to wear veils applies even in non-residential medical institutions, for example, in pharmacies or in waiting rooms at the doctor.
The obligation to wear veils when visiting health and social facilities or pharmacies has been introduced since Friday also in the Liberec and Ústí region.
In the highlands of Jihlava, it is necessary to wear masks in indoor public places, in public transport and in medical institutions from the 14th to the 16th centuries. July.
On the contrary, in the Moravian-Silesian region, anti-epidemic measures were relaxed, as in the Central Bohemian region of kutno.
At the beginning of June, the Czech government also approved the so-called traffic light for Europe, which colorfully differentiates the level of risk of infection in individual European countries and, accordingly, regulates the rules applicable to entry into the Czech Republic from these countries.
For low-and medium-risk countries, authorities from 15. they do not require Czech citizens to test negative for coronavirus or order quarantine instead.
The latter are mandatory when returning Czechs from high-risk countries.
At the moment, all EU member states are now in the low-risk category of infection.

About 2000 people were at the event on Saturday morning.
If the number of participants had not decreased, the police would have intervened.
This was stated by the minister of the interior Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) on the prima partie television programme.
However, the number of participants fell below 1000, so the police assessed that intervention was not needed, and neither did the sanitary station or the Ministry of health.
Czech television (CT) reported on Sunday that the technoparty had extended to the surrounding land, whose owners did not agree with the use for the technoparty.
It is possible that the owners of the surrounding land will demand compensation for damage.
Techno fans came to the meadow near Hlaváčkova Lhota on Friday evening.

Blažim is located about 30 kilometers from Hlaváčkovy Lhota, where the engineers actually went.
According to nováková, no one came to blažimi.
Viper bite: the little girl ended up in the hospital!
"The first case this year was recorded in Zheleznorudsk.
The Viper bit a girl, year 2010, in the leg, which her parents themselves brought to the rescue service base there," regional spokeswoman of the medical rescue service Mária svobodová told the newspaper, adding that the child was then taken to the hospital in Klatovy.
The Viper is the only venomous snake in the Czech Republic and it is in Šumava that these animals are found in higher numbers, so it is good to be careful when walking.
However, there is no great danger from these animals.
The chance that the Viper will bite you is not very high, with normal contact, it is afraid of itself.
And if she has room for it, she likes to crawl away with a loud hiss.
She will only attack if she feels very threatened-for example, if you accidentally step on her.
Although its bite is not a tragedy, its venom is very effective against small mammals, but it does not kill people.
This can happen only if a person has a particularly weakened organism, or he suffers from an allergy.
Thus, the risk of danger is primarily in children, the elderly and allergy sufferers.
"After a bite, a person often feels nauseous, sweats, has an elevated temperature, thirst, abdominal pain and diarrhea, in weakened individuals and especially allergy sufferers, anaphylactic shock can occur," Miriam Gredová from the Klatovy hospital described for the daily.

Sapa market: raid reveals meat, fish and eggs of unknown origin
"One of the vehicles entering the premises transported 1320 pieces of quail eggs of unknown origin, moreover, in unsuitable conditions.
Also, these eggs will be disposed of at the rendering plant," the state veterinary administration said.
When inspecting the stand with live fish, it was then found that the seller does not have documents on the origin of the goods and is not registered for the sale of live fish.
The market is considered problematic from a veterinary point of view in the long term.
For example, last fall, veterinarians discovered an illegal food store in it, there were almost half a ton of unmarked food without documents of origin.
Most could not find out the expiration date, some of the products had expired shelf life and were spoiled.
For five kilograms of cuttlefish, the expiration date was exceeded by three years.

Putin spoke on the phone with Zelensky before the start of the ceasefire in the Donbass, the Kremlin criticizes the planned elections
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke by phone with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky about the situation in the Donbass, where a new ceasefire is to take effect from midnight.
According to the Kremlin statement, Putin, among other things, criticized the decision of the Ukrainian parliament to hold local elections; Kiev reported that Zelensky called for the release of the detained Ukrainians.
A new ceasefire was agreed on Wednesday evening by the negotiators of Ukraine and Russia with the support of the organization for security and cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
The truce is to begin after midnight on Monday night, is to be "complete and general" and is to open the way to fulfilling other provisions of the peace agreements.
Putin told Zelensky in an interview that the decision of the Ukrainian parliament to hold local elections contradicts the Minsk peace agreement and threatens the prospects for a settlement of the conflict in the east of Ukraine.
The Ukrainian parliament last week decided that the upcoming elections to local councils will not take place in the territory controlled by pro-Russian rebels.
The Minsk agreement assumes that Kiev will regain control of the border of Ukrainian lands occupied by separatists with Russia, after granting these regions broad autonomy and holding local elections there.
Zelensky's office, according to the Unian agency, said that both statesmen agreed on the usefulness of the upcoming truce in the Donbas and on the need to carry out other measures to promote peace in the region, such as the demining of areas of fighting or the withdrawal of part of the troops from the front.
Zelensky also called on Putin to release Ukrainians detained in the east of Ukraine, on the occupied peninsula of Crimea and in Russia itself.
The Minsk agreement helped to stop the fighting, but people continue to die on both sides of the front in sporadic shootings and artillery attacks.
The conflict in the Donbas has claimed over 14,000 lives since the spring of 2014.
Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of military support for the separatists, which Moscow denies.
Zelensky has made ending the war in the Donbas his priority, but a more fundamental breakthrough in negotiations has not yet occurred.

Yesterday my calf started to pull, but I am very glad that I did not feel it at all and that it did not limit me at all, " Novotná said on the union's Facebook page.
Bio LPG arrives in Czech Republic, promises ecological operation
Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) is a well-known alternative fuel in the Czech Republic.
It is especially popular for its significantly lower price compared to petrol or diesel, due to a significantly lower excise tax, but its benefit is also in lower CO2 emissions per kilometre.
Like gasoline and diesel, it also has its environmentally friendly variant - "bio LPG".
However, it is quite a novelty-it first appeared on the European market a few years ago and arrived in the Czech Republic a few days ago, according to the press release of the Czech Association of LPG.
"These days we have received the first fifteen tons of bio LPG, which will be mixed with the classic Fossil LPG distributed to our gas stations," the association quotes Jiří karlík from primagas.
However, bio LPG cannot be taken as bioethanol or biodiesel.
According to the association, it is chemically identical to the classic oil LPG, which many motorists now refuel in their cars.
Therefore, it is also possible to mix both versions arbitrarily.
"The only difference from conventional LPG is the method of production," says Ivan Indráček, chairman of the association, about bio LPG.
This is also one of the great advantages of bio LPG over other alternative fuels.
It is easy to transport and store, and the distribution infrastructure is relatively good, e.g. compared to hydrogen or electricity.
Currently, this gas is obtained as a by-product in the production of bioethanol from food residues and sugar cane.
In the future, it should also be produced in a targeted way, e.g. from cellulosic biomass, i.e. from wood waste.
In contrast, conventional petroleum LPG is produced partly as a by-product in oil refining, partly by separation in natural gas extraction.
As a result, depending on the production technology and the source, the operation of the car on bio LPG is 40-70% more environmentally friendly in terms of carbon footprint than the operation on oil LPG and up to 90% compared to diesel.
However, it is not about CO2 emissions from the exhaust of the car, but about the ecology of fuel production, that is, the so-called "well-to-tank" part (from the source to the tank).
Petrochemical companies Eni, Total and Neste are currently among the largest producers of bio LPG.
According to the recent update of the national clean mobility action plan (NAP čm), Unipetrol is also exploring the possibility of production at its Litvinov refinery.
According to the association's estimates, about 170,000 vehicles use LPG in the Czech Republic; the Ministry of the environment reports a slightly higher figure, about 200,000, in the NAP čm.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of transport, last year alone, almost 6 thousand conversions of cars to LPG were made.
It is possible to refuel LPG in the Czech Republic at about 950 stations of various operators.
Vojtěch revised the number of infected, the number decreased by 1775 cases
Minister of health Adam Vojtěch (for yes) ordered the ministry to revise the numbers infected with the coronavirus virus.
The new statistics were published on Sunday by the Ministry of health on its website.
The number on Sunday afternoon fell from Saturday's 5254 to 3479 cases, which is 1775 fewer infected.
There are currently 3422 patients in the Czech Republic.
"Behind the jump in the number of cured is the revision of data, which hygienists have not been able to update recently," said the head of health statistics Jaroslav dušek.
By Sunday afternoon, 15,212 people had become infected with coronavirus in the Czech Republic, 11,419 had recovered and 371 had unfortunately succumbed to covid-19.
Mobile voting units or correspondence dialing.
The political scientist and sociologist were looking for variants for the time of the pandemic
According to deputy prime minister and interior minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD), a change in the law is needed in order for people in quarantine due to coronavirus to be able to vote in the October regional and Senate elections.
Parliament could debate it in August or September under a fast-track procedure.
He stated this on Sunday in the party of Prima Television.
On Tuesday, the ministry wants to discuss possible solutions with representatives of parliamentary parties.
"Whatever we do, it will have to mean changing the electoral law," said Hamáček.
The Senate on Wednesday called on the government to find a solution within the current statutory rules.
But the minister said that it will be necessary to adjust the provisions of the law, according to which people in quarantine because of the state of health can not vote.
The prohibition to vote should be maintained, for example, for patients with open tuberculosis.
Daniel Prokop stated on ovm that the possibility of a correspondence election has been postponed since 2004.
Even the current bill, which is in the house, then provides for its introduction for voting abroad, but not in the Czech Republic.
At the same time, Prokop considers the concerns of ANO or ČSSD (because, according to the experience from abroad, it would rather record to other types of parties) from the correspondence election to be overestimated.
Personally, he is against the possibility of electronic voting, where there is a considerable possibility of abuse.
Michal Klíma said that now it is necessary to invent ad hoc mechanisms (elections) that could be carried out this year and with the least possible health risk.
The main thing is to be ready for 2021, when parliamentary elections are to be held in the Czech Republic.
He considers the correspondence option (whether in a foreign country or also in the Czech Republic) as one of the functional methods.
As another, they see the already mentioned electoral units or, for example, the possibility of proxy voting within the family.
He added that there is an opportunity to learn how similar situations - elections at the time of coronavirus - were handled in Croatia, Poland or France.
Due to the spread of coronavirus infection, various types of elections in 67 countries of the world have already been postponed this year.
Protests in Buhari: pig's ears thrown by demonstrators at the government building
Participants of the demonstration against the Bulgarian prime minister Boyko Borisov and his cabinet threw pig ears at the government building.
It was another in a series of protests against the" mafia style of government " that have been taking place in Sofia and other cities for almost three weeks.
The organizers are planning a nationwide blockade on Wednesday, the dpa news agency reported.
Today's protest, which took place already 18. the day after, according to Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty, had a weaker turnout than the previous one.
By 20: 00, about 300 people had gathered, some streets had to be closed to traffic.
In front of the government building, demonstrators staged a theatrical scene in which they symbolically locked in a prison cell prime minister Borisov and prosecutor general Ivan Geshev in connection with the arrest of two advisers to President Rumen Radev, who is a strong political opponent of the prime minister.
The resignations of both are among the basic demands of the protesters.
They also demanded the cancellation of the announced health care reform and the end of corruption in construction on the Black Sea coast.
The organizer of the protests, Nikolai hadzhigenov, said today on public radio that the "peak of escalation" in the form of "nationwide demonstrations in Sofia and blockades throughout the country"is about to take place on Wednesday.
He repeated the demand for the resignation of Borisov and his government, as well as the call for early elections.
The regular ones should take place in March 2021.
Borisov has previously said that he does not intend to resign.
He justified this, among other things, by the need to implement the covid-19 pandemic in Bulgaria and the resulting economic crisis.
On Friday, however, he replaced five members of his government team, though the concession did not placate the demonstrators.
Earlier this week, Borisov's government withstood a vote of confidence in parliament.
Coach Boloni Mihajlovic no longer wants matches without spectators
Coach of football players of Bologna Siniša Mihajlovic already has enough matches of the Italian league without spectators.
The Serbian coach hopes that from the new season the fans will return to the stadiums.
"What we are running here at the moment is not football.
I'm tired of games without spectators.
It's sexless football, it doesn't bring me any emotion, no joy.
Those fights are worse than training.
Playing like this is terrible and I think I'm not the only one who thinks so, " Mihajlovic said before today's match against Lecce.
After the coronavirus pause, the matches of series a follow in rapid succession, and although they are played only in the evening, their actors are exposed to the heat.
"We play every three days in terrible heat.
You don't even know where the teams stand in these conditions.
I wish this season was over.
These measures had to be taken in order to finish the competition, but I hope that by September the fans will be back," said the coach, who has also led Fiorentina and AC Milan in the past.
For Mihajlovic, this season is also unusual because he missed four months on the bench due to leukemia treatment.
"Despite my illness, the interruption of the league and everything else, our team managed to move up a level.
We want to continue to grow and for that we need players to be mentally stronger, " he said.
We have become the target of cyberattacks by foreign states, says Iran
Since the end of June, fires and explosions have been reported from a number of Iranian military, industrial and nuclear facilities, as well as oil refineries, power plants, factories and enterprises.
Some Iranian officials have said that the fire that broke out this month at the underground nuclear plant in Natanz could have been caused by cyber sabotage.
The cause of a number of other incidents has not yet been explained.
Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi told reporters, according to Iranian media, that the infrastructure of the Islamic republic faces "thousands of cyber attacks"daily.
He added that this is not a new phenomenon and that most of them will be repelled.
In recent months, according to Mousavi, several broader cyber attacks have been recorded, behind which, according to analyzes, were"certain governments and groups."
However, he did not disclose more details about possible perpetrators, according to Reuters.
Musavi also added that fires in forests, refineries and other places are frequent in the summer.
An article by Iran's state-run IRNA news agency this month suggested that Iran's enemies, such as Israel and the US, may have been behind the recent incidents.
However, neither of these countries was directly accused of specific attacks in the article.
Iran and the United States severed diplomatic relations shortly after the 1979 revolution, when Iranian militant students stormed the U.S. embassy in Tehran, holding 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.
Long-strained relations between the two countries escalated in 2018 after Washington withdrew from the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers and imposed sanctions on Iran, which have a hard impact on its economy.
Another major escalation came this year after the US military 3. in January, she killed Iranian general Qassem Soleimani and a member of the leadership of Iraqi militias, Abu Mahdi Muhandis.
Iran then 8. January fired at the bases in Iraq, where the Americans operate, a number of missiles.
The US only admitted in hindsight that dozens of US soldiers had been wounded.
Israel considers Iran its arch-enemy, and prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is the main opponent of the 2015 international nuclear agreement with Iran.
According to the Israeli prime minister, Iran is trying to develop an atomic bomb, which Iran denies.

The thirty-nine-year-old woman, who loved bodybuilding, eventually ended up on a bed in a hospice, where she still had time to take the love of her life.
Unfortunately, she succumbed to the disease.
A few hours after her death, a shocking message for those closest to her appeared on her Facebook account.

Gemma began a grueling treatment, radiotherapy, in the hope of healing.
After months of treatment, it really seemed that Gemma had managed to win over the cancer, however, in August of 2019, the cancer returned and this time attacked the spine.
The bodybuilder and personal trainer, according to the information of the British Daily Mirror, underwent a ten-hour operation on the spine and then began again with drastic treatment.
However, everything was in vain.
Earlier this year, on her 39th birthday, doctors told her that she had a few months left to live.
In April, finally, the handsome blonde decided to go to a hospice in Leeds, where she was visited every now and then by her family, who even arranged her a wedding with her love Ricky.
The marriage lasted two months.

Artmat works with the principle of chance.
Thus, the buyer can be surprised at what kind of work of art he acquires.
Currently, he may become the new owner of fantasy illustrations by Alexandra štoplová or mini-views by Tereza bonaventurová, which can also be sent.

Salaries in the health sector will rise by a maximum of five percent next year.
A bigger increase is unrealistic according to Vojtech
Salaries in the health sector could rise by no more than five percent next year, said Health Minister Adam Vojtěch (for ANO) in Václav Moravec's questions on Czech television.
The demand of trade unionists for an increase of up to 15 percent considers unrealistic.
He also said that the state should try to be self-sufficient in providing protective equipment.
According to him, hospitals now have their supplies.
"I think that the increase (in salaries) can be somewhere within five percent," said the minister.
According to him, it is necessary to reflect the current situation, when since March intervened in the collection of insurance premiums pandemic coronavirus and government regulations against its spread.
The income of insurance companies at that time fell.
"I find the increase of 15 percent unrealistic at the moment," Vojtěch said.
The average monthly earnings of a doctor in acute inpatient care, according to the data of the Institute of health information and statistics (Uzis), are likely to reach 88, 312 crowns this year, 47, 498 crowns for nurses.
The difference between the salary of nurses in state hospitals and the salary of other founders will be up to seven thousand crowns.
Uzis data also show that the decline in nurses in hospitals has stopped.
The average salary in the Czech Republic was CZK 34,125 in 2019, according to data from the Czech Statistical Office.
Representatives of trade unionists already said in June that for 2021 they will demand a minimum increase of ten percent, ideally 15 percent.
They criticize the long-term significant difference between the earnings of doctors and nurses in state hospitals, which must be guided by salary tables, and contract wages in hospitals of cities, counties or private.
They therefore also call for uniform pay tables for health professionals.
For nurses this year, the difference will be up to seven thousand crowns per month.
But for doctors, for example, wages grew faster than salaries last year.
According to the president of the Czech Stomatological Chamber, Roman šmucler, trade unionists should perceive the current state of affairs.
Due to the effects of the covid epidemic, the chamber recently approved an increase in this year's state budget deficit to a record 500 billion crowns, of which 1.75 billion is to go to the remuneration of health workers in hospitals and social services.
The board of health care providers, according to shmucler, does not agree with a blanket salary increase next year.
According to him, the remuneration should be decided by the hospitals and medical institutions themselves, and the extra money should go to them through the reimbursement decree.
Vojtěch also said that the hospitals currently have enough protective equipment.
Pavel svagr, chairman of the state material reserves administration (sshr), said this week that the administration does not currently have a single protective medical device in its assets.
He is waiting for the completion of the selection procedures.
According to Vojtěch, now suppliers in the world are able to deliver goods better than in March, when they were redeemed.
According to him, the state should also try to be as self-sufficient as possible and buy from Czech companies.
The scrubbing smart quarantine could be taken over by soldiers.
We're ready, they say.
"Smart quarantine works, there is something to improve of course.
We'll discuss it with the army tonight.
The army is working perfectly and the question is whether they should not manage it all again, " the prime minister said on Sunday in his Facebook show Hello people.
According to him, it is not enough to connect IT systems and sanitary stations, which gradually have to switch to more modern methods of functioning.
According to the prime minister, the problems were in the Moravian-Silesian region, where there are some of the current outbreaks of the epidemic.
Defense ministry spokesman Jan pejšek told CTK that he had no information about Sunday's meeting and that the government should discuss the matter on Monday.
According to him, the army is ready for this step.
The smart quarantine project was taken over by the Ministry of health 25. may.
Until then, the smart quarantine was led by a 90-member central management team established under the army as an advisory body to the government, headed by the former minister's deputy Roman prymula.
Interior minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) criticized the scrubbing project on Sunday.
He also suggested that the army might take over again.
The shortcomings in the project were previously admitted by the government commissioner for it and digitization, Vladimir dzurilla, who is in charge of it.
"The system works, but it is still being worked on.
For 20 years it was created independently and unsystematically, now we are trying to unite it in a few months.
It's not going in the jet.
People on the move, poor sanitation workers on the move are adapting these new systems and actually picking up these mistakes," he said.
Ostrava Mayor Macura will not run again, because he does not want to "get crazy in politics"
The current mayor of Ostrava Tomáš Macura (ANO) will not run in the next local elections.
The reason for this is an effort "not to fool around in politics," he told the server Respekt.cz.
Macura, who is also a member of the Presidium of the ANO movement, has been mayor of Ostrava since November 2014.
In the 2018 municipal elections, the candidate of the ANO movement led by him won almost a third of the electoral votes in Ostrava.
Macura originally wanted to be in office for only four years.
"I thought that I would last one term and with the experience of business here in that time I can turn everything around and put on its feet," said Respektu.
He added that he had been persuaded to a certain extent for a second term.
"But for me this is the maximum.
I don't want to fool around in politics, " added Macura, who in an interview described himself as a heavy introvert who does not like frequent contact with people.
According to respect, there has been speculation for some time about Macura's possible end in the ANO movement.
The server recalls that Macura has repeatedly criticized the ANO movement, for example, for its alliance with the SPD or for supporting Milos Zeman in the presidential elections.
As one of the few personalities, ano supported Jiří Drahoš, Zeman's anti-candidate, in the elections.
Macura does not plan to leave the ANO movement, which he joined in 2017.
"As long as I feel that I can change something in the movement, that it is not a completely futile struggle and that no one is interfering with me, I have no immediate motive to quit," said Respektu.
Macura, 56, graduated from the University of Economics in Prague.
Before becoming mayor of Ostrava in 2014, Macura served as director of the manufacturer of the pharmaceutical company walmark, among others.
He also sat on the boards of other companies.
Uber will return to Brno offering transportation services
Uber, which offers transportation services, will return to Brno at the end of July.
This is a consequence of the change in the law, said on Thursday in a press release the Brno councillor for transport Petr kratochvíl (ODS).
Taxi drivers protested against Uber in Brno, pointing out that Uber does not meet the conditions such as the designation as a taxi or taximeter.
However, by changing the law, since July, the conditions for operating both ordinary taxis and alternative ones have changed.
Kratochvil has held several meetings with representatives of Uber in recent weeks.
"On their basis, this company decided to return to Brno with its services at the end of July this year.
This step is due to a change in the law, which allows the company to operate legally.
The city was familiar with this change and we believe that the company will operate its services within the given limits, " said Kratochvil.
Uber has operated in Brno in the past.
Taxi drivers protested against him because of the non-marking of vehicles as taxis or the absence of a taximeter.
The court issued a preliminary injunction that banned Uber from driving in the city.
Brno initially supported taxi drivers, but at the end of last year, Mayor Markéta vaňková (ODS) said that the city would like to take steps to make Uber work in Brno.
According to later court decisions, Uber could ride in Brno, but the company did not take advantage of this.
Now they will return on the basis of a change in the law.
Since July, in addition to classic taxis with a flashlight and a taximeter, it is easier to operate a transport service ordered and paid exclusively through mobile applications.
Too exuberant celebration in Brno: a flying chair landed a meter from a man on the sidewalk
An office chair flew from the fourth floor of an apartment building on Saturday night in Brno and landed about a meter from the sidewalk.
After him at that moment went a pedestrian, who immediately called the officers.
The patrol noticed an open window right after arriving at the address in the western part of the city, under which a chair was still lying, and next to it several cans and cigarette butts.
"The noise that was carried from the room on the fourth floor indicated that a rather noisy celebration was taking place inside.
The officers went down the corridor to the apartment and asked the three young men present, aged between twenty-six and twenty-nine, for an explanation," said Jakub Ghanem, a spokesman for the officers.
Request for dismissal of Rafaj probere Babiš with ČSSD
Prime minister Andrej Babiš (ano) plans to discuss with the coalition Social Democrats on Monday the request for the draft dismissal of the head of the antimonopoly office (úohs), Petr rafaj.
Non-profit organizations at the meeting of the anti-corruption Council of the government and also the Ústí nad Labem Region called for Rafaj's dismissal.
The Social Democrats state that the replacement of the head of the office is in place.
According to CTK, Rafaj was not invited to the government office on Monday.
The second mandate expires in the middle of next year, according to the law, he can not be appointed for the third time.
His dismissal is within the competence of President Milos Zeman.
In addition to the appeal of non-profit organizations, the prime minister received a letter with a similar request from the Ústí region.
The reason is supposed to be among other Rafaj's cases from recent times.
In the past week, the prime minister refused to comment on the request, saying that he will get acquainted with the materials and the government parties will take "some position" on this.
He also said that he has not yet discussed the challenges with the president, a meeting with him in the near future has not been arranged.
According to the statement of the úohs, there is no reason to appeal, since Rafaj was not accused of anything.
Servers IHNED.cz a Aktuálně.cz in the past week, they wrote that the police are interested in Rafaj's meetings with Hetman Jiří čunek.
The meetings were related, among other things, to the decision on the competition for the controversial new Zlín hospital project for eight billion, which Čunek is pushing hard for.
According to him, together they dealt with his "Senate activities".
Similarly, Rafay speaks.
The Ústí nad Labem regional council called on the government to remove rafaj at the end of June.
It also calls for reform of the authority's decision-making mechanisms.
According to the deputy governor for transport Jaroslav komínek, the decision-making of the úohs regarding public procurement is not transparent and has signs of arbitrariness.
Last March, the police interfered with the antimonopoly office because of a tender for the collection of tolls.
This June then server Aktuálně.cz he drew attention to the fact that Rafaj uses apartments written for the company of an influential backstage player of ČSSD, Alexander čuba.
But the advance of 3.5 million for the apartment in Brno was paid from Rafaj's account.
The president of the office for the protection of competition is rafaj since 9. July 2009, for a second term, the president appointed a former Social Democrat MP in June 2015.
In less than a year, Rafajova's second six-year mandate will expire.
The law on the antimonopoly bureau states that the president can dismiss the head of the bureau on a proposal from the government.
He may be removed only if he has not held office for more than six months or if he seriously undermines the dignity of his office or the independence and impartiality of the office.
In the library of Blaine, the employees collapsed in the heat.
Will help air conditioning
The new technique will cost 740 thousand and will be in operation in the second half of August.
"For me, this is good news.
With three children we go to the library in the center of blansko regularly.
But in the warm months there was practically impossible to endure.
It was so hot and the air was so bad.
Ventilation did not help.
Therefore, I am happy for the air conditioning, " said one of blanensky readers Petr Novotný.
According to the director of the library, Lukáš dlapa, the temperature in the building often climbed to over thirty degrees.
The southern wall of the building is glazed and works as a greenhouse on sunny days.
"In addition, the sun relies on it for a large part of the day due to the curvature of the building.
At the same time, it is a big problem to ventilate individual compartments, because overnight the windows must be closed for safety reasons.
We often have thirty degrees in the library in the morning, " said dlapa.
Worst of all was the study and reading room on the third floor.
And one floor up, the exhibition rooms and the principal's office.
Unpleasant climate was also in the children's department, located under the roof of the building.
"Several times it happened that librarians at work collapsed and ended up on sick leave.
The problem regularly occurred also in the cultural room at lectures, which are attended by dozens of people.
After a few minutes there was no way to breathe, " said dlapa.
Originally, city officials wanted to make this year air conditioning in all areas of the library.
In the end, there will be only three circuits out of five.
"Due to limited funding, only the most problematic premises will have air conditioning.
Study and reading room on the third floor.
Then there is the cultural room and the children's department one floor higher," said Jiří Svoboda from the blaně investment department.
He added that in the first phase, the workers had already installed HVAC systems in the mentioned premises last autumn and adjusted the wiring.
Approximately for 360 thousand crowns.
The municipal library of blansko has almost three thousand registered readers.
Of these, about nine hundred are under fifteen.

Crawford returns to the game
Not every infected athlete comes out with the truth.
Especially when it comes to players from the NHL, which is silent about the health of players like a tomb and does not publish anything at all.
As one of the few stood out from the ranks of Crawford.
The 35-year-old native of Montreal was present only at the first training session, since then he was absent from the lineup.

Thousands of people protested in Israel against the Prime Minister
Thousands of Israelis in several parts of the country protested against unemployment, corruption and the way prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is handling the coronavirus crisis.
Demonstrations took place in front of Netanyahu's private villa in Caesarea, near his official residence, and in a park in Tel Aviv.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, protests have been held regularly for several weeks.
Their participants are demanding Netanyahu's resignation because of the trial in which he is accused of corruption and fraud, as well as how the government is dealing with the next wave of the coronavirus epidemic.
"Bibi, go home," one of the protesters wrote on his banner, referring to Netanyahu's widely known nickname, according to AP.
"Everyone sees that the emperor has lost his clothes," it said on another.
The 70-year-old Netanyahu is the first prime minister of Israel to be tried in office.
He is accused in three cases of corruption, fraud and abuse of trust.
He denies all the accusations and calls them a witch hunt.
According to local media, the trial can last up to three years, more than 300 witnesses are summoned.
The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has been confirmed in almost 60,500 people in Israel, which has a population of about nine million.
At 455 people died in connection with the disease.
In March, the Israeli government introduced quarantine measures that helped reduce the daily increase in the infected.
However, after a gradual easing of restrictions since the end of April, the numbers of infected began to grow significantly again, especially at the end of June.
Netanyahu's critics argue that the government has not done enough to help, for example, the businesses affected by the quarantine measures.
Protesters also resent the fact that the government is issuing contradictory instructions in the fight against coronavirus.

The body had to be cut from the wreckage by firefighters
The tragic accident happened around 23. clock at neveklov on a narrow district leading from the Slapské dam.
The driver apparently flew at considerable speed down into the forest and smashed the car against a tree.
He died on the spot.

The circumstances of the crash are being investigated by police.
They ordered a forensic autopsy, which should, among other things, clarify whether the man did not drive under the influence of alcohol or another addictive substance.
No more wasting and spewing one collection after another.
Pietro Filipi cancels discounts and bets on sustainability
The Czech clothing brand Pietro Filipi wants to focus on sustainability and is embarking on a fundamental change of strategy.
He cancels discounts and no longer wants to churn out one collection after another.
The fact that the fashion industry is among the largest polluters of the environment is not news.
Billions of pieces of clothing end up in incinerators and landfills every year.
But the view of slow fashion, the often despised approach to dressing, has been changing quite rapidly over the past few years.
Approximately half of the goods Pietro Filipi sold at full price.
The other half, which was sold due to discounts, is not so easy to buy.
The company does not want to churn out one collection after another and at the end of each season the products are discounted below their production price.
In addition, according to the owner Michal mička, the Times of new and old collections and blind following of rapidly changing fashion trends are over.
"Most discount retailers are already counting on the purchase of goods, so a much higher margin is included in the full price.
It is actually a bit of a scam, " says Michal mička, owner of Pietro Filipi.
In addition, with its approach, the company also wants to support local business.
"Each of our products is made from carefully selected quality fabrics and designed by local designers.
We emphasize that a large part of our collection is made up of so - called basic pieces-i.e. clothing that is timeless and over-the-season.
Worldwide, the segment of premium brands is typical of the absence of any discounts, the price of the product simply corresponds to its quality and the discount is not needed, " adds mička.
Giant graffiti representing RAF airman Kurt Taussig
"The assignment was to create something for the anniversary of the end of the war.
And I remembered our fighter pilot who fought in the ranks of the British Royal Air Force in the Second World War.
The city administration liked the design, " said Vacek, who completed his work after fourteen days of intensive work.
He consumed about 300 liters of paint and 50 sprays.
Kurt Taussig was born in 1923 in Teplice-šanov.
He left town when he was 15.
During the war, because of his Jewish origin, the Nazis dragged him to an internment camp, where he was held for several weeks.
However, he and his brother managed to avoid the concentration camp thanks to the organization of Nicholas Winton.
In 1939, Taussig arrived in the United Kingdom, where he volunteered to join the Royal Air Force (RAF), and subsequently underwent pilot training in Southern Rhodesia and Palestine.
He joined the combat operations in early 1945.
After the velvet revolution, he visited Czech Republic several times and his native Teplice, which granted him honorary citizenship.
The 46-year-old Kamil Vacek, whom people in the field of street graphic art know by the nickname camo, has been working with spray paint in Teplice's streets for over 20 years.
He started with graffiti on the areas that were set aside for these purposes by the then mayor Jaroslav Kubera (ODS).
Storm Hanna has arrived on the coast of Texas
Hurricane Hanna on Saturday afternoon local time (before midnight CEST on the night of today) arrived on the southwestern coast of the US state of Texas.
It struck the Texas island of Padre Island, about 24 kilometers north of the town of Port Mansfield, and weakened to a tropical storm as it moved over land.
However, according to meteorologists, it nevertheless poses a great danger to the inhabitants of coastal areas.
It brought with it strong winds and intense rainfall; along with local flooding, according to the AP agency, there are reports of power outages and various material damage, including damaged ships.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott already on Saturday for 32 counties in southwest Texas declared a state of natural disaster and advised people to voluntarily evacuate.
The strongest warnings were given to people from the coastal strip between Port Mansfield and Mesquite Bay, but the element is expected to hit an area of almost 500 kilometers before gradually moving over northeastern Mexico.
"Although Hanna is now a tropical storm, heavy rain and wind, surface highs, dangerous surf and isolated tornadoes can pose a threat," the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) warned.
This morning local time (afternoon CEST), the storm moved in the area of the US-Mexican border and was accompanied by winds of 85 kilometers per hour.
On Saturday, Hanna became the first hurricane of this year's hurricane season in the Atlantic region.
Over the Gulf of Mexico, it was accompanied by winds of up to 145 kilometers per hour, but the latter gradually weakened to 112 kilometers per hour as it approached the mainland, which again knocked Hanna out of the category of hurricanes.
The authorities urged local residents to wait out the storm at home, while not forgetting the hygiene measures associated with the prevention of the spread of coronavirus.
Texas is among those U.S. states that the covid-19 disease pandemic plagues the most.
Due to the existing security measures and the need to observe the distances, possible evacuations are also a great challenge.
Temporary shelters were opened in hotels, schools and gymnasiums.
In Hidalgo County, Texas, one of the buildings was also adapted as a shelter for evacuees who tested positive for coronavirus or were otherwise exposed to the disease.
Local authorities called on all evacuees to take masks and disinfectant gels with them to the shelter, if possible.
"We're not nearly there yet.
We expect catastrophic flooding," AP quoted Chris Birchfield, who works for the National Weather Service (NWS) service in the city of Brownsville.
Forecasts say that in some places, up to 300 millimetres of rain could fall in a few hours, in some cases almost 500 millimetres, which, together with rising sea levels, could flood a number of coastal settlements.
Zeman bestows the general rank of Colonel Lipko
On Wednesday, President Miloš Zeman will bestow the general rank on colonel Pavel Lipko.
This follows from the review of the expected events of the Ministry of defense.
The reason for granting the rank of brigadier general is the August arrival of Lipka at the post of deputy commander of the NATO multinational division north-east in Poland.
Lipka still serves as deputy commander of the ground forces of the Czech army.
The promotion to Zeman at the end of June was proposed by the government.
From the beginning of August, Lipka will replace brigadier general Karel řehka as deputy commander of the multinational north-east division in Elblag, Poland, which commands the Allied advance presence in Poland and the Baltic states.
In March, řehka became director of the national cyber and information security bureau (nukib).
The government proposed to the president that Lipko be given the rank of brigadier general.
According to the law on professional soldiers, a higher rank can be granted to a soldier for the duration of the performance of an elected function or for the duration of the performance of a service task that requires the granting of a higher rank.
The post of deputy commander of the alliance division corresponds to the rank of general.
The soldier to whom the rank was bestowed has the same rights and duties as if he were appointed to this rank.
However, he is not entitled to a salary adjustment corresponding to the rank.
The conferment of the rank shall continue until the reason for which it was granted ceases to exist.
"Colonel Lipka demonstrates high professional readiness and is a role model for subordinates.
It takes a significant part in fulfilling the tasks of the armed forces of the Czech Republic, including cooperation with foreign partners and ensuring the participation of the army in foreign operations, " the Ministry of Defense said in June on the proposal for promotion.
Wednesday's promotion will take place at 12: 30 at Prague Castle, attended by Defense Minister Lubomir Metnar and chief of the general staff Aleš Opata.
EU countries have coronavirus standards for aviation
European Union countries have agreed on common sanitary standards for air travel to help limit the spread of the new coronavirus.
This was announced by German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer.
Among the agreed standards is the observance of distance or wearing of veils on the plane and at the airport, but the middle seats in airplanes will not have to remain unoccupied.
This was reported by Reuters.
"I am glad that my colleagues accepted the German proposal for Europe and that we were able to agree on these uniform standards," Scheuer said at the European aviation conference.
The German transport ministry then added that the agreement had been concluded by officials and that it still had to be formally approved by ministers.
The agreed measures include the requirement to cover the mouth and nose for passengers from the age of six, to observe the recommended distance during security checks and check-in at the airport.
There must also be sufficient fresh air on the aircraft and all information must be available in several languages.
The airlines will also be able to occupy the middle seats.
The common rules that officials have agreed on Meet at least some of the requirements of airlines.
The different standards caused confusion.
In the Arctic Spitsbergen fell temperature record, measured there almost 22 degrees
"A 41-year-old record has fallen in Longyearbyen," the Norwegian Meteorological Institute said on Twitter.
On the eve of the temperature there rose to 21.7 degrees Celsius, breaking the record of 1979 by 0.4 degrees, he added.
About two thousand Longyearbyen is the largest city in Spitsbergen, located about 1300 kilometers from the north pole.
Spitsbergen heats up faster than almost any other place on earth.
This fact highlights the dangers arising from the warming of other parts of the Arctic - from Alaska to Siberia, according to a report last year by the Norwegian Center for climate studies.
According to him, the average temperature in Spitsbergen has risen from 70. flight 20. century by three to five degrees.
By 2100, it can rise even by ten degrees, if the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere is not reduced.
The increase in temperature can lead to the melting of permanently frozen soil in Svalbard, which threatens the stability of many buildings, roads or airports, and can cause more avalanches and landslides.
The warming of the climate also threatens Arctic fauna, such as polar bears or seals, which depend on the ice cover of the ocean.
The British, who will return from Spain, waiting for a mandatory two-week quarantine
The British cabinet also urged citizens to avoid all non-essential travel to mainland Spain due to the risk of spreading covid-19.
The Canary and Balearic islands are therefore not mentioned, however, even after returning from them, people have to be isolated for two weeks.
The new rules come into force at midnight.
"Protecting public health is our absolute priority.
We took this decision to prevent the possible spread of the virus in Britain, " British diplomacy said in a statement.
"We have always made it clear that if necessary, we will immediately remove a country from the list of safe ones," she added.
As noted by the British newspaper Metro, the latest announcement will hit the travel plans of thousands of Britons.
Spain is a very popular holiday destination.
Among other things, Britons are concerned about whether they will be paid sick leave if they have to end up in isolation for 14 days after returning from holidays.
For example, Neil Hunter from Sittingbourne booked a ten-day holiday to Lanzarote, they were supposed to leave on Tuesday.
The tour has been booked since December.
"We were supposed to go the whole family, my wife Amanda and daughter Bethany, but to be honest, after this announcement I do not know what will happen.
I work as a train driver and I do not think that my employer will accept that I will be quarantined for two weeks after returning from vacation, " the Metro newspaper quoted Hunter as saying.
With regard to Spain, there are fears that the country is at the beginning of the second wave of the epidemic.
Over the past two days, there have been over 900 new infections every 24 hours.
Authorities in some areas are already tightening coronavirus measures, for example, Catalonia is trying to limit all nightlife to prevent people from gathering in large numbers.
The Czech Ministry of foreign affairs has recently warned of an increased risk of infection in Catalonia, Aragon, the Basque country and the Madrid region.
The Model of electricity purchase from Dukovany will be discussed by the government
On Monday, the government will discuss a model for the purchase of electricity from the planned new block of the Dukovany nuclear power plant.
The bill provides that in the event that the purchase price will be higher than the price of power electricity on the market, the difference will be paid by all consumers through tariffs.
In the latter case, when the purchase price will be lower than the market price, the impact on consumers will be the opposite.
Power electricity is an unregulated part of the final price of electricity for customers.
Deputy prime minister and minister of industry Karel Havlíček (for yes) and energy company CEZ have previously stated that a more likely option is that people will save on electricity thanks to the construction.
On the contrary, analysts point out that the long-term outlook for electricity prices in the markets is always uncertain, which has been shown several times in the past.
The plan has previously been criticized by environmental organizations.
"The purchase price can be both below the market price of power electricity, and above it.
Thus, the final impact at the time of application of the rule can be both negative and positive.
The impact will be distributed among customers according to the size of the circuit breaker - with lower consumption or according to electricity consumption - with higher electricity consumption," the Ministry of industry and trade (MPO) said in the materials.
Havlíček said in May that he expects the wholesale price of electricity to rise and people will make money on the Dukovan construction site.
Otherwise, the impact will be in the tens of crowns per year per family, which, according to him, is far less than people annually pay in electricity bills to support the so-called supported resources.
He has previously estimated that the purchase price could range between 50 to 60 euros (about 1320 to 1600 USD) per megawatt-hour (MWh).
The submitted material does not contain any proposal for the amount, it should be included only in the purchase agreement.
The price of electricity on the Prague power exchange for 2021, for which traders now have the most supplies, is currently around 45 euros (about 1190 CZK) per MWh.
"With the difference between the purchase price and the market price of power electricity of ten euros, the supplement of an average household with consumption of 3.3 MWh per year could correspond to a household of four, equipped with standard electrical appliances, including an electric hob and oven, but which does not use electricity for heating and hot water - less than 100 CZK/year," the MPO wrote in the documents for the government.
"We live in an extremely turbulent time.
The coronavirus pandemic has shown us how vulnerable the global economy is.
For this reason, I consider the long-term prediction of market prices to be a purely speculative matter," Tomáš voltr, executive director of the energy financial group, told CTK.
The proposed law envisages that the purchase would be carried out by the MPO, or a legal entity authorized by it, owned by the state at a predetermined price.
The contract between the investor and the state, guaranteeing the conditions for the purchase of electricity, would be concluded for at least 30 years, with a possible extension of ten years, even repeated, but no longer until the end of the operation of low-carbon production.
The proposal defines a low-carbon generation plant as an electricity generating station with a nuclear reactor connected to the electricity grid with an installed capacity of at least 100 megawatts (MW) after 2030.
Havlíček previously stated that the new dukovanský Blok should have a capacity of 1200 MW and produce nine terawatt-hours of electricity per year, which would correspond to a tenth of the expected Czech consumption.
The block should be put into operation in 2036.
The financing model for the new Dukovany block was approved by the government on Monday.
The facility should be financed by the state during construction without interest, for operation it is calculated with 2% interest.
The opposition disagrees with the financing model, and is also concerned about the possibility of Russian or Chinese companies building Dukovany.
The state should participate in the construction of 70 percent.
The rest should be paid by čez, which will also cover any additional costs.
CEZ CEO Daniel Beneš told CTK in May that the expected amount for the construction of the block at current prices is about six billion euros (approximately 162 billion crowns).
Contracts between the state and CEZ on the construction of the new dukovanské block will be signed on Tuesday.
The Ministry of Regional Development withdrew the material on the promotion of tourism in the media for two billion
The material, according to which the Ministry of regional development (MMR) planned to spend two billion crowns in the media, on the internet and billboards for advertising on holidays in the Czech Republic, the office withdrew from the comment procedure.
Minister Klára Dostálová (for Yes) of the server SeznamZprávy.cz she said the material was still being worked on.
The document in eklep (Electronic Library of the legislative process) was brought to the attention of the server on Friday Zdopravy.cz.
The ministry justified the plan by the decline in tourism due to coronavirus.
During the coronavirus crisis, the media also experienced a decline in income.
The proposal provoked criticism from the opposition and representatives of the tourism industry.
According to the proposal, which is now available on the site hlidacstatu.cz, MMR planned to give money through the state agency for the promotion of tourism CzechTourism for advertising on television, radio, the press, on the internet, billboards or areas at railway stations.
The biggest part of the money, 700 million crowns, would be given to television.
Most would be acquired by private television Nova and prima.
Printed newspapers and weeklies would receive 400 million, and the same share would be given to MMR for PR articles, advertising banners and videos on websites.
Radio stations would receive 350 million for the media campaign, most of which would again be private stations.
The remaining 150 million would be used for outdoor advertising on billboards, LED screens and areas at stations or on the subway.
The campaign to promote tourism in the Czech Republic was supposed to start in mid-August and last for a year.
"The material is still being worked on, it is definitely not yet in the form that should be presented," dostálová said without further details to the seznamzvávy server.
The material was criticized by the opposition, according to the head of TOP 09, Markéta pekarová adamová, the media would benefit from the advertising from the trust funds of prime minister Andrej Babiš (ano).
"I firmly believe that this blatant contempt will get a blow between the eyes at the elections in the fall," she wrote on Twitter.
Dostalova denies that in fact it is about helping the media affected by the crisis.
"It can also be a coincidence, I do not know anything about media support," she told the newspaper N on Friday.
According to her, the budget of two billion is indicative.
"Of course, we are still counting it, it can be less or more.
It is working material, " she added.
The save tourism initiative does not make sense for a media campaign to promote domestic tourism.
"We want two billion for tourism companies, not an unnecessary advertising campaign," said Tomáš barčík, chairman of the initiative, on Sunday.
If the two billion crowns are in the state budget, they should go to companies, not the media, the initiative writes in an open letter to the government.
Broth of life, cock of beers and death as a blade of grass
Posthumous is also the third album titled a death is a blade of grass by the Brno poet, tireless organizer of cultural activities and publisher Jaroslav Erik frič, who also left a year ago, 24. may.
It is the fifth entry in frič's discography and, like the previous titles, the main emphasis here is on frič's poetry, of which he himself is an excellent interpreter.
Frič, class of 1949, was of course influenced by the American beat generation, but he channeled this inspiration through his own personal experiences and also very intimate expressions of faith.
However, he was far away from any agitation, if he spoke or wrote about faith, about God, it was always very intimate, non-aggressive, absolutely tolerant.
I think in this context Bohuslav reynek (in contrast to Jan zahradníček), the Masters will forgive.
Frič's album offers recordings of author readings from 2006, as well as performances with musicians who have always accompanied him very sensitively, whether it was cellist Josef klič, or Honza bartoň and Vítězslav holata.
I will help myself-glad-in the words of the Ostrava poet Peter hruška about Frič's long poetic compositions.
"A proud and never-ending bitterness flowed from them," writes Hruska, " over the state of our world threatened with extinction.
A world that is sinking more and more into dull consumerist vanity and avarice is increasingly moving away from what its soul was made of - the mystery of faith, humility and human closeness.
They echoed the anguish of one who knows that the values for which he was created are of little interest, but who also knows that they cannot be renounced just because of general disinterest.
The poems were a reminder that a person may have to lose everything precious, but it is not unimportant how he will lose it.
If he sells himself out to a general decline, he resigns skeptically, shuts up fearfully, or remains until the last moment in a calm and proud insistence on what he believes and loves."
Paroubek is not my advisor, said Hamáček
Jiří paroubek, former prime minister and chairman of the ČSSD, is not a paid adviser to social democracy.
Party chairman and interior minister Jan Hamáček only communicates with him and reads his opinions and articles.
Hamáček said this today on the TV show prima partie.
On Friday, the server informed that Paroubek should be Hamáček's advisor SeznamZprávy.cz.
"From time to time we write a text message, he sometimes sends me some material and I will read it," Hamáček said today.
He added that, however, this is not an official and paid cooperation.
According to him, ČSSD does not have the means to waste them for similar purposes.
"The fact that I sometimes read his opinion, so there are a lot of such people," he said.
In a subsequent discussion with ODs member Jana černochová, the minister said that many ODS members were still "listening to the views of Václav Klaus".
According to him, this is fine, because he is an experienced politician and former party chairman, which is also the case of Paroubek.
The fact that the media is making an affair of it, he called a sign of this year's cucumber season.
Server SeznamZprávy.cz on Friday, he wrote that Paroubek fulfills the role of Hamáček's unofficial consultant.
He also wrote that the fourth place of the party's candidate in the Ústí region is headed by the former chairman of the local cell Petr Benda, who is associated with paroubek and served as deputy chairman of his party Lev 21.
Hamáček said today that he will not comment on the composition of the candidate until it is ready and approved.
Duplantis has a one-mile lead, it's a kick in the ass, laments Sweden's challenger
It is the 22-year-old American rodent who has the ambition and potential to belong to the most serious competitors of the new ruler.
He already knows what it's like to beat Duplantis, two years younger, last year at an NCAA college reunion.
"We had a battle the year before, then he won and I was second, then we switched.
In both cases it was a very good fight, " says Nilsen, who secured the victory with a power of 5.95 meters.
But Duplantis has shot up steeply since then, and is currently alone in the highest pole spheres.
In just twenty years he became the world record holder, this year 8. February in Torun broke the bar of 6.17 meters, a week later in Glasgow another centimeter added.
"He jumped six meters already at the age of 18, when he finished high school," recalls his peer Nilsen for the world athletics website.
"It was clear that as soon as he grew from a boy into a man, all his potential and talent would be tenfold.
Twenty years is a pretty good age to jump a world record, " he believes.
Although Nilsen's list of achievements is thinner than Duplantis', the American has similar goals.
He has so far indicated his options at the NCAA competitions, which he regularly won, this February he improved his personal indoor record to 5.93 m.last August he won a gold medal at the Pan American Games in Lima, already in 2017 he fought his way into the American team for the world championship, where he finished 13th.
The nearest milestone for him is to experience the Diamond League for the first time.
"It's definitely my priority to get on the professional circuit and race as much as possible in the Diamond League, because that's where you can make a name for yourself," he realizes.
"If you can succeed at this level, you can certainly do the same in events such as the Olympic Games, the world cup or the Pan American Games."
But because of the pandemic, these peak holidays are postponed, which gives Nilsen and the other rodent owners time to improve.
But will it be enough to catch up with Duplantis, who can easily turn the race under five circles into a mere duel for silver?
"Everyone is trying to catch up with him, but I don't think it will be possible any time soon," Nilsen reflects.
"The boy has been jumping for 16 years and in training he has a mile lead over everyone else."
And before Tokyo 2021 starts, he will want to increase it even more.
A woman spent hundreds of thousands on her disabled son's disability pension.
She's in court.
The money that a 33-year-old man receives from the state as a disability pension is intended primarily to improve the quality of his life.
For embezzlement, a woman faces up to eight years in prison.
Due to poor health, the court deprived the sick man of his rights and appointed his mother as a guardian, who, among other things, was to manage his son's money.
"From mid-November 2013 until January this year, the woman used part of the funds from her son's disability pension for her own needs and deprived him of 440 thousand crowns," said police spokeswoman Dana ladmanová, adding that the accused woman is aggravated by the fact that as a guardian she had a special duty to defend the interests of the injured.
The woman, according to the instructions of the court, did set up an account for her son, but she had his pension sent to her account.
"After paying the costs associated with the son's stay in a medical facility and paying for the necessary medicines, she used the remaining funds to purchase a vehicle, electrical appliances and to run the household," the indictment says.
That he can not use his son's money for his own needs, the woman admitted.
But she defended herself by helping them pay for family expenses.
"We had problems from our income to tighten the running of the household.
We never bought anything fancy.
It was always for things that the son would approve of buying.
I thought it was family money.
I had no idea that I was committing a crime, " the woman explained to the police.
She promised to return the money to her son.
North America has been inhabited for 30, 000 years, scientists say after finding tools
The findings from the chiquihuite cave in the Mexican state of Zacatecas include 1930 tools made of limestone, including fine blades that could have been used to cut meat, and pointed objects that could have served as spearheads or spears.
Scientists have found that the oldest of the tools date back to 33, 000 to 31, 000 years ago.
"There are only a few products of this age.
But they are here, " said archaeologist Ciprian Ardelean of the University of Zacatecas state and lead author of one of two studies published on the subject in the journal Nature.
The youngest instruments reach an age of 12,500 years.
Thus, according to experts, people inhabited the Chiquihuite cave, located at high altitude, for a long 20, 000 years.
Until now, the generally accepted theory spoke of the fact that the first representatives of the species Homo sapiens crossed the land bridge from the area of present-day Russia to Alaska about 13,500 years ago.
Archaeological evidence, including unique spearheads used to kill mammoths and other prehistoric animals, has shown that this clovian culture subsequently spread throughout much of North America.
But this model has received cracks in recent decades, when several ancient settlements were discovered that were two to three thousand years older.
The second study, published in the journal Nature, reports on 42 different sites across North America that prove human presence on the continent as early as 26, 000 to 19, 000 years ago.
Scientists believe that a small number of people could come to the North American mainland earlier than previously thought.
Some could have made it to America by boat.
"It is clear that people were in America long before the development of the so-called clovian culture," said anthropologist Ruth Gruhn of the University of Alberta, Canada, commenting on the new findings.
Interest in tickets so far fulfills an optimistic scenario, sellers say.
Gradually, prices are also reduced
Ticket sales in the Czech Republic are growing every week.
Compared to last summer, the interest is still about half, but the demand is growing every week by up to 20 percent.

The average price of air tickets is also decreasing.
At the portal Letuška.cz in about the middle of the month it was around 6250 crowns, 3000 crowns less year-on-year.
This is mainly due to an increase in demand for European destinations, which now account for about 85 percent of sales.
However, prices in some European places, such as Spain and Italy, have fallen by about a fifth in recent weeks.
The crisis has also affected the behavior of customers, who now buy tickets much less in advance than before, fearing the further development of the coronavirus situation.
According to earlier information Kiwi.com the time to purchase a ticket before departure decreased year-on-year by about ten days.
"This confirms to us the future trend where people will order tickets with much less advance, they will require more flexibility, they will take less risks," said the vice president for products Kiwi.com Michal šindelář.
Currently, the average booking time before departure is 21 days.
Along with the growth in sales, the number of restored Air Lines from the Czech Republic is also growing.
Prague airport currently operates scheduled flights to more than 60 destinations.
Compared to last year's summer season, this is about half of the destinations.
The grand final is tonight!
Watch darts battle live on Nova Sport
The second most prestigious tournament within the PDC organization reached the grand final.
It will feature the experienced 49-year-old Scottish darts player Gary Anderson and the surprise of the tournament, the 26-year-old Belgian Dimitri van den Bergh.
Gary Anderson knocked out Justin pip in the first round, then came across his neighbor in the table ranking.
However, he managed to beat James Wade in the quarter-finals against Simon Whitlock, who had previously sent home the world number one.
The "Flying Scotsman" had almost in the semi-finals, when he faced Michael Smith.

The biggest surprise of world matchplay is Dimitri van den Bergh.
The Belgian talent is enjoying the tournament and perhaps the knowledge that he has nothing to lose has helped him to play on an absolutely fantastic wave.
The 26-year-old darts player first surprisingly knocked out world number six Nathan Aspinall, in a dramatic battle they also pushed Joe Cullen, and in the quarterfinals after a sharp start he also defeated Adrian Lewis.
The big test was the semifinals.
Glen Durrant showed his strength at the start, but the calmly playing Belgian then won the lead with an excellent series, which he then held more or less without problems until the end.
Van den Bergh showed his strength in high scoring, by which he encountered occasional uncertainty on the doubles.
The number of cases of coronavirus has increased since at least the beginning of the week, the number of tests has decreased
Since the beginning of March, when the new coronavirus was first discovered in the Czech Republic, 15,212 people have been proven infected with it.
Almost 9,600 of them have already been cured, 368 patients have died.
Currently, 5,254 people are sick.
This follows from the data on the website of the Ministry of health.
The daily number of newly confirmed cases this week has exceeded four times in a row two hundred.
The maximum was 281 cases on Friday.
On Thursday, 235 tested positive, 246 the day before and 206 on Tuesday.
On the first working day of this week, there were 169 infected.

Air in homes is up to five times worse than outside.
Harm to health both air fresheners and deodorants
Health is threatened not only by poor air quality in the open air, but also at home.
This was pointed out by the Israeli human health expert Carol Abraham, quoted by the Jerusalem Post.
According to Abraham, who was instrumental in the creation of the Israeli Ministry of environmental protection, pollutants in homes need to be addressed right now, when many people are spending more time working from home.
Abraham mentioned the research of the US Environmental Agency (EPA), according to which the quality of domestic air is up to five times worse than outdoor.
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 3.8 million people die prematurely every year due to poor air quality in their homes.
"Because of the coronavirus epidemic, which has forced many and still forces them to work from home, people have to spend more hours in their homes than before, so it's time to focus on the quality of the air in their homes," said Abraham.
In Israel, according to her, almost no one is engaged in the quality of "home air".
Dangerous can be things with which a person normally comes into contact-paints, air fresheners, disinfectants, deodorants or pesticides.
"The poisonous gas is also emitted by the clothes that we regularly wear to the dry cleaners," said Abraham.
According to her, children, elderly household members and people with respiratory problems are the most at risk.
Even otherwise healthy individuals may begin to suffer from problems such as headache, fainting, nasal irritation, nosebleeds, vomiting, or skin allergies.
With prolonged exposure to unhealthy substances, internal organs and the central nervous system can be damaged.
But not all pollutants come from objects inside homes, the source may also be the material from which the houses are built.
