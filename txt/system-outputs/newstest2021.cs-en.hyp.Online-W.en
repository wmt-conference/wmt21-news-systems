Novak helped Trabzonspor to second place, Škoda also scored
Defender Filip Novak helped Trabzonspor to the runners-up title with a goal in the last round of the Turkish Football League.
His team won 2-1 at Kayserispor and kept Besiktas third.
Striker Milan Škoda scored his 10th goal for Rizespor after his January transfer from Slavia, which saved itself despite losing 1-3 at Fenerbahce.
Novak confirmed his excellent productivity for a defender with his seventh goal in this league season.
In the 63rd minute, Kayserispor's goalkeeper only parried a fierce shot and the Czech player headed the ball into the net from an angle.
The home side managed to equalise with five minutes to go, but Trabzonspor pulled off the winner in the sixth minute of stoppage time, successfully finishing off a four-on-one break.
Skoda equalised early in the second half against Fenerbahce after a solo effort to make it 1-1.
Although Rizespor did not hold the draw for long, they did not have to regret it as they remained three points above the relegation zone thanks to the results of their opponents.
The competition will end with the champion Basaksehir's match at Kasimpasa on Sunday.
The hermit's cave in the woods near Novo Bor was not actually habitable.
In northern Bohemia, in the foothills of the Lusatian Mountains, near Nový Bor in the Českolipsko region, in the forests through which the Count's Way led, several sandstone rock formations are hidden.
Both natural and man-made.
And we're going to see the man-made ones.
The place is called the Hermit's Cave.
But in reality, no hermit ever lived here and the cave was used as a shelter, or more accurately, a storage chamber, probably for grain.
The cave is carved out of the side of a rock outcropping and is accessible by stairs from above.
However, it is practically invisible until the last moment.
It is only revealed by a narrow staircase leading to a kind of rock gallery, from where one enters the rock.
Although the chamber appears to be a considerable distance from human habitation, at the time of its construction there may have been a field on the plateau where the forest is today.
"The fact that the building does not have a window or even a fireplace in the traditional place clearly proves that no hermit could ever have survived the winter here," explains historian Kamil Podroužek from the Jan Evangelista Purkyně Faculty of Arts in Ústí nad Labem.
The one-room building has only a stone bench at the back, which was probably used to store containers.
"I see it as a chamber for storing some food or products from the field," says Kamil Podroužek.
Tool marks are visible on the cave walls.
Breaking off the sandstone with a spike was quite simple and quick for the insiders.
It was enough to use the joints appropriately and gradually break off the sandstone.
The length of the point marks and the method of cutting in general give a rough indication of the period of the cave's formation.
According to the historian, it is probably the end of the 18th century.
The cave is freely accessible and, judging by the mess that appears in the cave, someone occasionally sleeps there nowadays.
If you approach the cave from above from one of the forest paths and are attracted by the stream flowing under the cave and the nearby counting road, you will certainly find the path down as well.
And on the way out of the forest you may be captivated by the nearby Raven Rocks.
Jockey Minařík is in artificial sleep after a heavy crash in Germany
"Filip is in the best hands now.
The institute is equipped for such cases, and fortunately we have part of the family in Hannover.
This makes the situation much easier for me and also the care of my daughter Finja," the Jezdci.cz server quoted a statement by Minarek's wife Katja.
"Everyone is doing their best, Filip needs time to recover now.
There is no point in giving any forecasts.
Anyone who has ever encountered the problem of head trauma and patients in artificial sleep knows that the situation can change.
Philip is a great fighter.
We all have to be patient now and give him time," said the wife of the 45-year-old jockey.
Star Frankie Dettori, who won the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes for the seventh time at Ascot on Saturday, matching the legendary Lester Piggott, also called for financial support for the injured Minarik on Twitter.
Nearly €70,000 has been raised on Gofundme to date.
The target is 100,000 euros (2.6 million crowns).
Video referee takes four goals from Sassuolo, they lose 0:2
The Sassuolo players got the ball into the opponent's goal four times in Saturday's match in Naples, but had to accept a 0:2 defeat.
The referee did not concede any of their goals after consulting the video due to offside.
According to the Italian media, this is a record-breaking technological disadvantage, as VAR has never prevented a team from scoring so many goals.
"VAR was tougher on Sassuolo than the road radar and punished them like no team has ever been punished before.
The new technology is breaking records," Gazzetta dello Sport wrote in a commentary.
"A festival of disallowed Sassuolo goals.
Never has VAR been so strict on one team," added the Corriere dello Sport newspaper.
Napoli took the lead in the 8th minute on Saturday, but after half an hour of play Sassuolo seemed to have equalised.
Filip Djuricic's goal, however, was disallowed due to offside after the video referee intervened.
For the same reason, Djuricic's next shot and goals by Francesco Caputo and Domenico Berardi were also disallowed.
The home team, on the other hand, added one more goal.
Electric cars set a new record.
The Czech Republic has the highest number of recharges in history
"The growth was driven by a 30% increase in the number of stations in our network and the trend towards more frequent charging at public stations, as well as the accelerated development of registrations of new e-cars," said Tomáš Chmelík, head of CEZ's clean technology unit.
Other big players, such as PRE and E.ON, electric car manufacturer Tesla, as well as supermarkets Billa and Lidl, are also claiming their share of the market.
The operators of conventional petrol stations are represented by MOL.
However, the latter does not have figures yet.
"We only started building our network for electromobility last year," explained company spokeswoman Jana Jusková.
However, the editors of Deník exclusively obtained data from all 216 electric stands operated by ČEZ.
It shows that drivers took an average of 13.5 kWh from the stations.
This corresponds to a range of about 100 kilometres for a smaller electric car.
Ignoring minor draws of up to 1 kWh, the average charging takes two and a half hours.
The vast majority of refuelling then took place on the free tariff.
If motorists were already paying for the charge, their typical spend was around CZK 330.
Electromobility is particularly strong in the capital.
All five of ČEZ's busiest charging stations are located in Prague, and their popularity overshadows that of entire regional cities.
Among the regions, Olomouc leads the way.
On the contrary, the least interest is in remote stations in the border region, for example in Bohumín or Prachatice, which often remain unused all day.
More than four thousand electric cars are currently registered in the Czech Republic.
In the first half of this year alone, 1,274 new e-cars were added.
In a large poll by the daily newspaper "Czechs on the Move", eight percent of readers said they were considering buying an electric car for their family.
However, only a third of respondents know where to find the nearest charging station in their area.
Not only for better water retention.
Environmental activists protested in Prague
According to the organizers, the government's actions so far in the issues of protection and recovery of the Czech landscape and solving the climate crisis are insufficient, the speakers called on the state for a more vigorous approach.
Representatives of large organisations such as the Duha Movement, Greenpeace and the Green Party, as well as smaller local associations, attended the event called The Last Drop.
"For example, we have people who have been speaking out against the expansion of the Turów mine for a long time, we have people who are speaking out against the gravel mining near Uherské Ostroh, we have people who are speaking out against the construction of senseless dams," said Marika Volfová on behalf of the organisers.
She said that the main demands of the protesters are the creation of a plan for water retention in the landscape, a drastic change in agricultural policy and the subsidy system towards the promotion of sustainable agriculture, and the fastest possible transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.
"The government is supposed to defend the interests of the people, not a reckless and devastating business," she said.
A stall was set up in Malostranské náměstí (Lesser Town Square) with a petition calling on Czech state leaders to push for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the restoration of Czech soil and landscape.
The people present were equipped with banners with slogans such as "No more depression from rape" or "Less coal, more boars".
Jan Škoda from the association Za vodu pro lidé, which protests against the plan to mine gravel in the Hodonín region, came to Prague from South Moravia.
"It threatens the source of drinking water for 140,000 people," he said.
He added that boreholes represent the fifth most productive source of drinking water in the Czech Republic.
He said the planned gravel extraction is located only about 500 metres from the boreholes and according to assessments, the water quality is certain to be compromised.
Vojtěch Veselý came from the village of Valeč in the Karlovy Vary region on behalf of the so-called agroecological farmers.
He pointed out the advantages of small farms that do not chase yields and profits and supply the inhabitants on the spot.
"Small agro-ecological farms are able to feed the entire population in a completely normal way, and on top of that they do not wreak such havoc on the rural landscape and the environment," he said.
Three people died when a plane crashed into a house in Germany
Three people died and two others were injured when an ultralight aircraft crashed into an apartment building in western Germany today.
The local emergency services reported that the dead are believed to include two crew members and one female resident of the house.
The plane crashed onto the roof of a building in the town of Wesel in North Rhine-Westphalia.
The penthouse, which was one of five units in the building, was subsequently engulfed in fire.
Firefighters have now managed to bring the flames under control.
Robert Meyboom, the deputy chief of the local fire brigade, said that both crew members of the aircraft had apparently died.
Police say the third victim is a woman who lived in the house.
The Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ), citing the mayor of Wesel, said the victim was a single mother whose two-year-old daughter was rescued from the flat with minor injuries.
An emergency parachute, which apparently served as a brake during landing, was found near the accident.
Police assume it came from the crashed plane.
There was room for two people in the plane.
The machine took off from an airport in the nearby town of Marl.
The Rheinische Post newspaper, citing eyewitnesses, said the plane collided with a hot air balloon before crashing.
However, this information has not yet been confirmed.
WAZ, citing other witnesses, wrote that the aircraft disintegrated in mid-air before hitting the ground.
Česká spořitelna erroneously charged some card payments twice on Saturday.
The error has already been corrected.
Česká spořitelna erroneously charged its clients twice on Saturday afternoon.
According to the bank's spokesman Lukáš Kropík, the problem could have involved thousands of transactions.
The error has already been corrected and the money has been returned to the clients.
The problems with double billing of card payments were noticed by the savings bank on Saturday afternoon.
"We updated the system yesterday (Saturday) night and returned all these duplicate payments to clients immediately.
At the moment everything is working without any problems," Kropík said on Sunday afternoon.
The exact number of clients who had money deducted from their card payments twice was not known to the bank spokesman, who estimated that the number of transactions was in the lower thousands.
The savings bank is investigating the causes of the problems.
"It could be a combination of several factors," Kropík said.
Česká spořitelna is the largest bank in the Czech Republic by number of clients.
It had 4.6 million customers at the end of March.
The savings bank is owned by Austrian financial group Erste Group Bank, a key player in the Central and Eastern European banking market.
Vojtech to present three-stage coronavirus alert system on Monday
"The tiers will be according to the strength of community spread at the regional level.
We are working on this together with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics," Vojtech told CT.
It will be a so-called traffic light, with individual regions marked in green, orange or red according to the risk of coronavirus.
The minister added that he would still discuss the classification of individual regions with epidemiologists.
He admitted that currently only the Moravian-Silesian region would be orange and Prague would be close to it.
The map would also include individual measures for regional health stations, hospitals, social facilities and employers.
"We want to deal with this at the level of the regions, because the situation is not uniform," Vojtěch said.
Waterman and Caroline
When Jonah the waterman and Caroline, the miller's daughter, fall in love with each other, it's not easy for them.
Jonáš is prevented from falling in love by his father, the uncouth waterman Hastrbuch, while Karolina has no idea that her beloved Jonáš is not human.
Luckily, there is Libor, the young man, who will do everything he can to protect the whole village, especially Karolina, from the watery villain.
What does it matter if he plots and lies?
Especially if he can get Caroline to reject Jonah in favour of the valiant Libor.
Soon it becomes clear to everyone in the village who is responsible for the drowning of the nightingale Konvička, the spoiled flour, the mill fire and other mischief.
The angry villagers organize a hunt for the waterman, and an irreconcilable waterman's curse falls on Jonáš's head.
And now, Konvick's little soul, advise Karolina!
How to soften old Hastrbuch, convince the neighbours of Jonah's innocence, find Jonah and free him from the curse?
The fairy tale was filmed in September 2010 in the studios of the Czech Television and in exteriors at the Brzina pond, in Obděnice in the Sedlčany region and in the beautiful surroundings of the historical mill in Hoslovice.
Mostecký autodrom launches new e-shop
Customers of the Mostecký autodrom can use a new e-shop on its website.
They can now also buy coupons for free and test drives by car or motorcycle on the large racing circuit, which was previously only possible in person at the autodrom employee in the starting tower.
"We have improved the e-shop to make it more user-friendly, while expanding the portfolio of products and services that can be purchased through it.
At the same time, on this occasion, we have prepared a bonus for our customers in the form of a CZK 1,000 discount on all safe driving courses from our offer.
The discount coupon can be found at www.autodrom-most.cz," explained Jana Svobodová, Sales and Marketing Director of AUTODROM MOST.
According to her, the e-shop website is now clear and easy to navigate.
"Visitors to the e-shop can select the focus they are targeting on the bar.
For example, sports, safe or sports driving courses, training, experiential programmes, gift items, gift vouchers, activities for children and more," the director listed.
Among the new products and services offered by the e-shop are, for example, the Racing Legends collection T-shirt with a surprise, a car track, a course for safe driving in low visibility, promotional and gift items of the domestic professional racing team Buggyra Racing or Engelmuller gloves from the limited edition of the watch manufactory BOHEMATIC, created on the occasion of the historic victory in the prestigious 24 Hours of Le Mans race in 1949.
"The offer is very varied, the customer can choose from more than 200 items," said Jana Svobodová.
When paying for the selected product or service, the customer can choose one of four options.
Payment by advance payment (bank transfer), cash on delivery, cash on collection or online via a payment gateway.
The course of the illness of the majority is mild, only three percent of those infected have to go to hospital
Either a milder form of the coronavirus is spreading through the Czech Republic or the summer dose of sunshine has significantly improved our immunity.
Infectious disease wards in hospitals are half-empty, even though the numbers are rising.
"The situation today and in April is completely different and it is mainly due to the number of people hospitalised," confirms Health Minister Adam Vojtěch.
It is worth remembering that on 11 April, when the first wave of the epidemic peaked in our country, everyone wore masks, the army carried out sampling, the republic was closed and the Czechs had used up their disinfectant for a year in advance.
Yet ten people a day were dying.
Now the daily increases in the number of infected are higher, but no more than two people die each day with covid-19.
The Karviná region still has the highest number of infected people per population, and Jihlava already has similar numbers due to an outbreak at the local Alzheimer's centre, where 57 people are already infected - 40 clients and 17 staff.
Another home for the elderly has been closed by health officials in Černožice in the Hradec Králové Region.
Tests have confirmed the disease in one of the nurses.
"We are shivering, we have restricted movement, we have all the hygiene measures in place," says Martin Scháněl, the director of the retirement home.
According to him, none of the home's clients have symptoms of the disease so far.
Hygienists will start testing tomorrow and then decide on further measures.
Hospitals are also responding to the increased number of infected people.
The Oncology Institute in Brno today launched an automatic camera system at the entrance, which will detect if people are wearing a veil when they enter.
South Bohemian sanitary workers have reported a record twenty-five cases of coronavirus - most of them foreign employees of a company in Prachatice.
In total, 131 people were infected on Saturday - half of Friday's number - but fewer are being tested over the weekend.
Debutant champion!
Van den Bergh finishes the tale, sweeps Anderson
The big surprise of the tournament, Dimitri van den Bergh, put in an outstanding performance against the player who won the second most prestigious event in the PDC in 2018.
The start of the match was evenly matched on both sides, with the break coming at 8:7 for the Belgian darter.
Van den Bergh took the break with a 13-dart leg and had the upper hand from then on.
He literally crushed his opponent with his game and the much more experienced "Flying Scotsman" had a hard time getting doubles.
The way the "Dream Maker" had him in his grasp was evidenced by the fact that the unhinged Anderson only played his first maximum in the 24th leg.
In addition, the young Belgian handled the high checkcuts superbly.
His last loss was in Leg 11, but he "caught a big fish" in the bad situation and closed with 170.
Anderson's frustration was evident at the end of the match.
He was throwing his darts away and his triumphant opponent was doing an absolute masterful job.
Van den Bergh converted the first of three match darts and lived up to his name - he wrote his big dream.
Winning the trophy named after Phil Taylor is all the more valuable for the Belgian darts player as it is his first major win.
It remains the case that the last player to beat van den Bergh was Karel Sedlacek.
In Nantes, a man confessed to the cathedral fire.
The Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul in the heart of Nantes caught fire last Saturday, and the fire severely damaged the original 16th century stained glass windows and destroyed the organ.
The suspected arson was being investigated by investigators due to the fact that the fire progressed through the cathedral from three different locations.
At the same time, police found no signs at the entrances that anyone had forced their way into the cathedral.
The accused is a volunteer with the local diocese, a thirty-nine-year-old Rwandan refugee.
Police arrested him shortly after the fire but then released him without prosecuting him.
Now the prosecutor's office has reported that based on new evidence, the man was re-arrested on Saturday, confessed and faces charges of arson.
If found guilty, he faces up to ten years in prison and a hefty fine.
According to his lawyer, the man regrets the crime and has decided to cooperate fully with investigators, Le Monde reported.
Vojtěch: On Monday we will introduce a "traffic light" for epidemiological measures
The new system is supposed to act as a pandemic plan, for the absence of which the government and the Ministry of Health are facing criticism.
"The grades will be according to the strength of the community spread," the minister explained.
He added that currently, for example, the Moravian-Silesian region or Prague would reach the medium, orange level.
The system is designed to be regional because the situation varies significantly from region to region, he added.
The ministry worked with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (IHIS) on the system.
The minister said specific measures would be linked to the different levels, whether it was the obligation to wear masks or the organisation of special wards in hospitals.
Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) called for the creation of an epidemiological plan on the Prima Partie television programme, saying that people should have clear information on what measures they can expect if the epidemiological situation worsens.
The daily increase in confirmed cases in the Czech Republic has been rising in recent days, although the number of people hospitalised remains low.
Vojtěch commented that nothing major is happening and it is not appropriate to talk about declaring a state of emergency or reconvening the crisis staff.
In view of the rising number of infected people, the government has reintroduced the obligation to wear masks at indoor events of over 100 people since Saturday across the country.
From Monday, the capacity of such events will be limited to 500 people, currently at 1,000.
The government's action, which did not make it clear until the last minute what measures would take effect or when they would be announced, has been criticised.
"I think that in a situation that is quite tense, the main actors should create a sense of certainty and, on the contrary, straighten out the confusion," Senator Marek Hilšer said in his Questions.
The measures may already vary by region, for example, in Prague from Sunday the obligation to wear masks also applies in non-residential medical facilities, i.e. in pharmacies or in waiting rooms at the doctor's office.
Since Friday, the obligation to wear balaclavas when visiting health and social care facilities and pharmacies has also been introduced in the Liberec and Ústí regions.
In the Vysočina region of Jihlava, it has been compulsory to wear balaclavas in indoor public areas, public transport and health facilities since 14 July.
On the other hand, in the Moravian-Silesian Region, anti-epidemic measures have been relaxed, as well as in the Central Bohemian Region in Kutná Hora.
In early June, the Czech government also approved the so-called traffic light for Europe, which differentiates the level of risk of infection in individual European countries by colour and adjusts the rules for entry into the Czech Republic from these countries accordingly.
For low- and medium-risk countries, the authorities have not required Czech citizens to have a negative coronavirus test or ordered quarantine instead since 15 June.
These are compulsory when Czechs return from high-risk countries.
At the moment, all EU member states are now in the low-risk category.
The Technoparty in the Benešov region continues.
It is playing at one-third capacity, it was supposed to end at noon
Hlaváčkova Lhota (Benešov Region) The Technoparty at Hlaváčkova Lhota in Benešov Region continues on Sunday evening.
A third of the original 12 music systems are still playing.
According to evening police estimates, about 500 people remain there after 8 p.m., while the original rough estimates spoke of three hundred, but in the morning there were 900, said police spokeswoman Lucie Nováková.
Originally, the technoparty was supposed to end at noon on Sunday, by which time some of the music systems had actually gone silent.
"Some have already left and others are preparing to leave.
The music production is still partly going on.
We expect that there will be a gradual disconnection and dismantling of the music systems," Nováková said.
"Police officers are still rigorously checking departing visitors to prevent drivers under the influence of alcohol or addictive substances from driving.
Drivers have the opportunity to take a preventive breath test before leaving," she added.
Dozens of riot police officers are overseeing the event, foreign police, traffic and riot police are on site and dog handlers with service dogs are also on standby.
"During today's event, police officers checked 470 people moving around the venue and 485 vehicles, 270 drivers were subjected to breath tests, six of whom got behind the wheel under the influence of alcohol," Nováková said.
A total of 95 drivers were tested by police for the presence of narcotic and psychotropic substances, of which one tested positive.
Officers also dealt with 14 traffic offences.
At the request of technoparty participants, police officers carried out 300 preventive breath tests and four preventive tests for the presence of narcotic and psychotropic substances.
About 2,000 people were at the event on Saturday morning.
If the number of participants did not decrease, the police would intervene.
Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) said this on the Prima Partie television programme.
However, the number of participants had fallen below 1,000, so the police assessed that there was no need for intervention, and neither the hygiene station nor the Ministry of Health asked for it.
Czech Television (ČT) reported on Sunday that the technoparty had spread to surrounding land whose owners had not agreed to its use for the technoparty.
It is possible that the owners of the surrounding land will seek compensation for damages.
Techno fans arrived at the meadow near Hlaváčka Lhota on Friday evening.
Police originally patrolled the meadow in Blažim, in the Benešov region, where the technoparty was held last year.
Blažim is located about 30 kilometres from Hlaváčka Lhota, where the technauts actually descended.
According to Nováková, no one came to Blažim.
Viper bite.
"The first case this year was recorded in the Železnáruda region.
A viper bit the leg of a girl, born in 2010, who was taken by her parents to the local emergency service base," regional emergency service spokeswoman Mária Svobodová told the daily, adding that the child was then taken to hospital in Klatovy.
The viper is the only venomous snake in the Czech Republic and these animals are found in higher numbers in Šumava, so it is good to be careful when walking.
However, there is no great danger from these animals.
The chances of being bitten by a viper are not very high, as they are afraid of normal contact.
And if it has the space to do so, it will happily crawl away with a loud hiss.
It will only attack if it feels very threatened - for example, if you accidentally step on it.
But even a bite is not a tragedy; its venom is very effective against small mammals, but it won't kill humans.
This can only happen if a person has a particularly weakened organism or suffers from allergies.
The risk of danger is therefore particularly high for children, the elderly and people with allergies.
"After a bite, a person often feels like vomiting, sweats, has an elevated temperature, thirst, abdominal pain and diarrhoea, and in weakened individuals and especially allergy sufferers, anaphylactic shock can occur," Miriam Gredová from the Klatovy Hospital described to the daily.
The man threatened to throw the infant out of the window.
He poured wine and threw dishes at a policewoman
After 23:00, a SWAT team entered the apartment and detained the man.
The infant was immediately taken into the care of paramedics, regional police spokeswoman Markéta Janovská said in a press release.
The man did not want to cooperate with the officers, throwing dishes, knives or pouring wine out the window at the police negotiator.
Several times during the negotiations, he intensified his threats by leaning out the window with the child in his arms.
On one occasion, he even climbed onto the window sill himself, where he growled.
Police are still investigating the man.
He does not want to disclose any further information.
Stosur will give her daughter a chance before the tennis season.
Australian tennis player Samantha Stosur will no longer take part in the coronavirus-affected season this year.
But the 36-year-old 2011 US Open champion, who became a mother in June, does not want to end her career just yet.
She plans to return to the courts next year and believes she will enjoy tennis even more than before thanks to her family and daughter.
Stosur announced on social media two weeks ago that her partner Liz Astling gave birth to daughter Genevieve in mid-June.
"I'm going to stay at home, spend time with my family, be there for all the little milestones our Evie is going to experience over the next six months and just enjoy it," the former world number one doubles player said on the Australian Open website.
The WTA Tour resumes its season, suspended since March, on August 3 with a clay tournament in Palermo.
Sapa market: raid reveals meat, fish and eggs of unknown origin
"One of the vehicles entering the premises was carrying 1,320 quail eggs of unknown origin, and in unsuitable conditions.
These eggs will also be disposed of at a rendering plant," the State Veterinary Administration said.
An inspection of the live fish stall then revealed that the seller did not have documents of origin and was not registered to sell live fish.
The market has long been considered a problem from a veterinary point of view.
Last autumn, for example, veterinarians discovered an illegal food outlet there, with nearly half a tonne of unlabelled food without proof of origin.
Most of them had no expiry date, some of the products were out of date and spoiled.
Five kilograms of cuttlefish had exceeded their expiry date by three years.
Last May, veterinarians and police officers seized 80 kilograms of food without proof of origin, including dried fish, squid and frozen ducks, some of which were mouldy.
Putin telephones Zelensky ahead of Donbass ceasefire, Kremlin criticises planned elections
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke by phone with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky about the situation in Donbass, where a new ceasefire is due to take effect from midnight.
According to a Kremlin statement, Putin criticised, among other things, the Ukrainian parliament's decision to hold local elections; Kiev reported that Zelensky called for the release of detained Ukrainians.
The new ceasefire was agreed on Wednesday evening by negotiators from Ukraine and Russia, backed by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
The ceasefire is due to begin after midnight on Monday night, is to be "complete and universal" and is intended to open the way for the implementation of other provisions of the peace accords.
In the interview, Putin told Zelensky that the Ukrainian parliament's decision to hold local elections contradicts the Minsk peace agreement and threatens the prospects for a settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine.
Ukraine's parliament decided last week that upcoming local elections would not be held in territories controlled by pro-Russian rebels.
The Minsk agreement stipulates that Kiev will regain control of the border of Ukrainian territories occupied by separatists with Russia after granting these regions broad autonomy and holding local elections there.
According to Unian, Zelensky's office said the two statesmen agreed on the usefulness of the upcoming ceasefire in Donbas as well as the need to implement other measures to promote peace in the region, such as demining areas of fighting or withdrawing some troops from the frontline.
Zelensky also called on Putin to release Ukrainians detained in eastern Ukraine, the occupied Crimea peninsula and in Russia itself.
The Minsk agreement has helped stop the fighting, but people continue to die on both sides of the front in sporadic gun battles and artillery attacks.
The conflict in Donbas has claimed over 14,000 lives since the spring of 2014.
Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of militarily supporting the separatists, a charge Moscow denies.
Zelensky has made ending the war in Donbas his priority, but there has been no major breakthrough in negotiations.
Rykl is unexpected decathlon champion, Novotná dominates the heptathlon
Defending champion of the last two titles Dolezal failed to finish the 400 at the end of Saturday's program, Kopecky did not jump a base in the pole vault on Sunday.
The decathlon was long dominated by Latvian athlete Reinis Kregers, who is training in the group of coach Josef Karas, but withdrew after the discus.
Rykl had two bronze medals from the outdoor World Championships so far, and this time he was the only decathlete to break the 7,000 mark.
Other medals behind him went to Vilém Stráský and Petr Urbánek.
After the competition, Rykl recalled the absence of Adam Sebastian Helcelet and Jiri Sykora.
"It's a pity that the boys weren't here and Kope didn't set up, because then the results would have looked completely different.
But the title tastes very good, I especially appreciate the fact that I gave myself a personal best by 30 centimetres in distance.
Then I was also pleased with the pole vault and I guess the most disappointing was the discus, I was below average there," he admitted on the federation's Facebook page.
Katerina Cachova won the first day of the heptathlon with more than a hundred points advantage, despite being troubled by an injured ankle on her rebounding leg.
However, she then registered only 570 cm in the long-distance sector, failed to throw the javelin 40 metres and did not enter the final eight.
Novotná collected 5878 points and won by 241 points ahead of Kateřina Dvořáková.
Her best performance of the year was 631 cm.
"I really wanted it to be around 630.
My calf started to pull yesterday, but I am very happy that I didn't feel it at all and that it didn't limit me at all," Novotná said on the federation's Facebook page.
Bio LPG has arrived in the Czech Republic, promises environmentally friendly operation
Liquefied petroleum gas, abbreviated LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas), is a well-known alternative fuel in the Czech Republic.
It is popular mainly because of its substantially lower price compared to petrol or diesel, due to significantly lower excise duty, but it also has the benefit of lower CO2 emissions per kilometre travelled.
Like petrol and diesel, it also has an environmentally friendly variant - "bio LPG".
It is, however, quite new - it first appeared on the European market last year and arrived in the Czech Republic a few days ago, according to a press release from the Czech LPG Association.
"These days we have received the first fifteen tonnes of bio LPG, which will be distributed to our filling stations in a mixture with conventional fossil LPG," the association quotes Jiří Karlík from Primagas as saying.
However, bio LPG cannot be thought of as bioethanol or biodiesel.
According to the association, it is chemically identical to conventional petroleum LPG, which many motorists now fill their cars with.
Therefore, it is also possible to mix the two versions freely.
"The only difference with conventional LPG is the way it is produced," says Ivan Indráček, chairman of the association.
This is one of the big advantages of bio LPG over other alternative fuels.
It can be easily transported and stored, and the distribution infrastructure is also quite good, e.g. compared to hydrogen or electricity.
Currently, this gas is obtained as a by-product of the production of bioethanol from food residues and sugar cane.
In the future, it should also be produced in a targeted way, e.g. from cellulosic biomass, i.e. wood waste.
In contrast, conventional petroleum LPG is produced partly as a by-product of oil refining and partly by separation during natural gas extraction.
As a result, depending on the production technology and source, running a car on bio LPG is 40-70% more environmentally friendly in terms of carbon footprint than running on petroleum LPG and up to 90% compared to diesel.
However, it is not about CO2 emissions from the car's tailpipe, but about the ecology of fuel production, i.e. the "well-to-tank" part.
Some of the largest producers of bio LPG are currently the petrochemical companies Eni, Total and Neste.
According to a recent update of the National Action Plan for Clean Mobility (NAP ČM), Unipetrol is also exploring the possibility of production at its Litvínov refinery.
According to the association's estimates, about 170,000 vehicles run on LPG in the Czech Republic; the Ministry of the Environment states a slightly higher number in the CNMP, about 200,000.
According to statistics from the Ministry of Transport, almost 6,000 LPG conversions were carried out last year alone.
It is possible to fill up with LPG in the Czech Republic at about 950 stations of various operators.
Vojtěch revised the number of infected people, the number dropped by 1,775 cases
Health Minister Adam Vojtěch (ANO) ordered the ministry to revise the number of people infected with the coronavirus.
The new statistics were published by the Health Ministry on its website on Sunday.
The number dropped from 5,254 on Saturday afternoon to 3,479 cases, which is 1,775 fewer infected.
There are now 3,422 patients in the Czech Republic.
"The jump in the number of cured is due to a revision of data that health officials have not been able to update recently," said Jaroslav Dušek, the head of health statistics.
By Sunday afternoon, 15 212 people had contracted coronavirus in the Czech Republic, 11 419 had recovered and 371 had unfortunately succumbed to Covid-19.
Mobile polling units or correspondence voting.
A political scientist and a sociologist searched for options for the pandemic
A change in the law is needed to allow people quarantined because of coronavirus to vote in the October regional and senate elections, according to Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD).
Parliament could discuss it in August or September in an accelerated procedure.
He said this on Sunday on Prima TV's Partia.
On Tuesday, he plans to discuss possible solutions with representatives of parliamentary parties at the ministry.
"Whatever we do, it will have to mean changing the electoral law," Hamáček said.
The Senate on Wednesday called on the government to find a solution within the framework of the current legal rules.
But the minister said the law's provision that says people quarantined because of their health cannot vote would have to be amended.
For example, the ban on voting should remain for patients with open tuberculosis.
Daniel Prokop told OVM that the possibility of voting by correspondence has been postponed since 2004.
Even the current bill in the lower house envisages its introduction for voting abroad, but not in the Czech Republic.
At the same time, Prokop considers the fears of ANO or ČSSD (because, according to the experience from abroad, it would rather favour other types of parties) about correspondence voting to be overestimated.
Personally, he is against the possibility of electronic voting, where there is a significant possibility of abuse.
Michal Klíma said that it is now necessary to devise ad hoc mechanisms (of elections) that could be carried out already this year and with the least possible health risk.
The main thing is to be ready for 2021, when the parliamentary elections are to be held in the Czech Republic.
He considers the correspondence election (whether abroad or also in the Czech Republic) as one of the functional methods.
He sees the already mentioned electoral units or the possibility of proxy voting within the family as others.
He added that it is possible to learn from how similar situations - elections during the coronavirus - were dealt with in Croatia, Poland or France.
Various types of elections have already been postponed in 67 countries this year due to the spread of the coronavirus.
Protests in Buhari: Pigs' ears thrown by protesters at the government building
Demonstrators against Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov and his cabinet threw pig ears at the government building.
This was the latest in a series of protests against "mafia-style governance" that have been taking place in Sofia and other cities for almost three weeks.
Organisers are planning a nationwide blockade for Wednesday, DPA news agency reported.
Today's protest, the 18th in a row, had a weaker turnout than previous ones, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.
About 300 people had gathered by 20:00 and some streets had to be closed to traffic.
Demonstrators staged a theatrical skit in front of the government building, symbolically locking Prime Minister Borissov and Prosecutor General Ivan Geshev in a prison cell in connection with the arrest of two advisers to President Rumen Radev, a strong political opponent of the prime minister.
The resignation of both is one of the protesters' main demands.
They also demanded the cancellation of the announced health care reform and an end to corruption in construction on the Black Sea coast.
Protest organiser Nikolai Hadzhigenov said on public radio today that the "peak of escalation" was planned for Wednesday in the form of "a national rally in Sofia and blockades across the country".
He reiterated the demand for the resignation of Borissov and his government, as well as for early elections.
Ordinary ones should be held in March 2021.
Borisov has previously said that he does not intend to resign.
He justified this, among other things, by the need to guide Bulgaria through the covid-19 pandemic and the resulting economic crisis.
But on Friday he replaced five members of his government team, although the concession did not appease the demonstrators.
Earlier this week, Borisov's government survived a confidence vote in parliament.
Boloni coach Mihajlovic no longer wants matches without spectators
Boloni football coach Siniša Mihajlovic has had enough of Italian league matches without spectators.
The Serbian coach hopes that from the new season onwards the fans will return to the stadiums.
"What we are currently doing here is not football.
I'm fed up with matches without spectators.
It's mindless football, it brings me no emotion, no joy.
The games are worse than training.
Playing like this is terrible and I think I'm not the only one who thinks so," Mihajlovic said ahead of today's game against Lecce.
After the coronavirus break, the Serie A matches follow in quick succession, and although they are played in the evening, the players are exposed to the heat.
"We play every three days in terrible heat.
In such conditions, you can't even tell how the teams are doing.
I wish this season was over.
These measures had to be taken to finish the competition, but I hope that from September the fans will be back," said the coach, who has also managed Fiorentina and AC Milan in the past.
This season is also unusual for Mihajlovic because he missed four months on the bench due to leukaemia treatment.
"Despite my illness, the interruption of the league and everything else, we managed to take our team to the next level.
We want to keep growing and for that we need the players to be mentally stronger," he said.
We have become the target of a cyber attack by foreign states, Iran claims
Since late June, fires and explosions have been reported from a number of Iranian military, industrial and nuclear facilities, as well as oil refineries, power plants, factories and businesses.
Some Iranian officials have said the fire that broke out this month at the underground nuclear facility in Natanz may have been caused by cyber sabotage.
The cause of a number of other incidents has not yet been explained.
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Musavi told reporters that the Islamic Republic's infrastructure faces "thousands of cyber attacks" every day, according to Iranian media.
He added that this is not a new phenomenon and that most of them will be repelled.
In recent months, Musavi said, there have been several broader cyber attacks, which he said were behind "certain governments and groups".
However, he did not provide further details about the possible perpetrators, according to Reuters.
Musavi also added that fires in forests, refineries and other places are common in the summer.
An article by Iran's state-run IRNA news agency this month discussed how Iran's enemies, such as Israel and the U.S., may have been behind the recent incidents.
But neither country was directly blamed for the specific attacks in the article.
Iran and the United States severed diplomatic ties shortly after the 1979 revolution, when Iranian militant students attacked the U.S. embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.
Long-tense relations between the two countries escalated in 2018 after Washington withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers and imposed sanctions on Iran that have hit its economy hard.
Another major escalation came this year after the US military killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani and a member of the Iraqi militia leadership, Abu Mahdi Muhandis, on January 3.
Iran then fired a number of missiles on January 8 at bases in Iraq where the Americans are operating.
The US only admitted after the fact that dozens of American soldiers were wounded.
Israel regards Iran as its arch-enemy and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a major opponent of the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran.
According to the Israeli prime minister, Iran is trying to develop an atomic bomb, which Iran denies.
TPCA has extended the production shutdown, now until May 25th.
The Cologne-based carmaker Toyota Peugeot Citroën Automobile (TPCA) has again extended its production shutdown due to a coronavirus.
Production lines are due to restart on the morning of Monday 25 May.
The start-up will be accompanied by dozens of hygiene measures, said automaker spokesman Tomas Paroubek.
Production has been halted due to the coronavirus pandemic since the evening of 18 March.
The company originally planned to resume it on Monday, May 18.
The reason for the extended shutdown, according to Paroubek, is the closed borders and closed dealerships, so there is no one to sell the cars.
According to Paroubek, the company will be producing at 100 percent from the beginning, i.e. in two shifts.
The coronavirus has affected the company's key markets, such as Italy, the UK and Spain.
Mayor Michael Kašpar (Change for Cologne) said the TPCA production shutdown is not affecting life in the city.
"At the beginning it was noticeable, the city was empty.
But gradually the streets are filling up, especially now since Monday, when things have loosened up a lot.
So the city is full," Kašpar said.
According to him, there are no complications even with foreign workers who stayed in hostels.
"We have hardly had to deal with any problem in these two months," Kašpar said.
For example, Mladá Boleslav-based Škoda Auto, which also suspended production due to the coronavirus crisis, resumed it on Monday, April 27, at all three of its production plants in the Czech Republic.
None of the plants is operating at 100 percent capacity.
The resumption of production at Skoda was accompanied by more than 80 hygiene measures.
On the night from Monday to Tuesday, the third, i.e. night shift was held in Mladá Boleslav and Kvasiny for the first time after the resumption of production.
TPCA currently employs around 2,500 people and is one of the largest exporters in the Czech Republic and an employer in the Kolín region.
Cancer killed a bride shortly after her wedding.
For more than two years Gemma Sisson battled an insidious cancer, and just when it seemed she had beaten the disease, it struck again.
The thirty-nine-year-old woman who loved bodybuilding eventually ended up in a hospice bed, where she still managed to marry the love of her life.
Sadly, she succumbed to the disease.
A few hours after her death, a shocking message appeared on her Facebook account for those closest to her.
Gemma Sisson, from Leeds, England, loved bodybuilding.
She and boyfriend Ricky Moore, with whom she lived for more than 16 years, traveled to competitions held around the world.
The 39-year-old played sports and lived a healthy lifestyle, yet in April 2018 she was diagnosed with cancer.
Gemma began a gruelling treatment, radiotherapy, in the hope that she would recover.
After months of treatment, Gemma did indeed seem to have beaten the cancer, however in August 2019 the cancer returned and this time attacked her spine.
The bodybuilder and personal trainer underwent a ten-hour spinal surgery and then started the drastic treatment again, according to the UK's Daily Mirror.
However, it was all in vain.
Earlier this year, on her thirty-ninth birthday, doctors told her she had a few months to live.
In April, the pretty blonde finally decided to enter a hospice in Leeds, where she was visited every now and then by her family, who even arranged her wedding to her love Ricky.
The marriage lasted two months.
Ricky took Gemma to the restaurant one last time for their two-month anniversary.
Four days later, Gemma died in his arms.
Just hours after her death, a post Gema wrote for her family appeared on her social media account.
"If this has been posted it means I have finally died after weeks of fighting for too long.
Although I will be heartbroken to leave my loved ones behind, I will be so glad to be rid of what this terrible disease has done to me.
I can't thank Ricky enough, who has been by my side the whole time and has given me a tremendous amount of love and support during that horrible time," she wrote on social media, adding that the pain and suffering has finally stopped and she has found peace.
"I am also grateful for all the support I have received from all my followers on social media," she wrote, adding that everyone should appreciate their life and live it to the fullest.
Art vending machines sell a sweat book, a mushroom amulet and a memory game
For 100 crowns, a passer-by can get a pocket-sized work of art by mostly emerging Czech artists.
They create the pictures and other art directly for the artmat, so they know in advance that they have to fit into the 8.5 by 5.5 centimetre size.
Each piece is numbered and signed.
"The package always includes a curatorial text about the artist and then the work itself," said Petra Widžová, the project's curator.
Artmat works with the principle of chance.
The buyer can thus be surprised by what kind of artwork they get.
Currently, he or she can become the new owner of Alexandra Štoplová's fantasy illustrations or mini-views by Tereza Bonaventura, which can also be sent.
The artist Punx 23 in cooperation with Dora Dutkova has prepared a memory game connected with a walk through Prague.
The cards need to be paired with house signs.
Ilona Polanski created a collection of tattoos for Artmat.
Marie Ladrová and Juliána Chomová sell pocket packs of spirituality: the former offers a protective amulet made of tinder and divination cards, the latter a series of illustrations based on her comic book Spiritists.
Salaries in the health sector will rise by a maximum of five percent next year.
According to Vojtěch, a bigger increase is unrealistic
Healthcare salaries could rise by a maximum of five percent next year, Health Minister Adam Vojtěch (ANO) said on Czech Television's Václav Moravec Questions.
He considers the union's demand for an increase of up to 15 percent unrealistic.
He also said that the state should try to be self-sufficient in providing protective equipment.
Hospitals, he said, now have stocks of them.
"I think the increase (in salaries) can be somewhere up to five per cent," the minister said.
He said the current situation, where the coronavirus pandemic and government regulations against its spread since March have interfered with the collection of insurance premiums, needed to be reflected.
The income of insurance companies has fallen during that time.
"A 15 per cent increase seems unrealistic to me at the moment," Vojtech said.
The average monthly earnings of a doctor in acute inpatient care are likely to reach 88,312 crowns this year, according to data from the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (IHIS), and 47,498 crowns for a nurse.
The difference between the salary of nurses in state hospitals and the salary of nurses in other founders will be up to CZK 7 000.
The data from the IHIS also shows that the decline of nurses in hospitals has stopped.
The average wage in the Czech Republic in 2019 was 34,125 crowns, according to data from the Czech Statistical Office.
Union representatives said in June that they would demand a minimum increase of 10 percent for 2021, ideally 15 percent.
They criticise the long-standing significant difference between the earnings of doctors and nurses in state hospitals, which have to follow salary tables, and contractual wages in city, regional or private hospitals.
They are therefore also demanding that salary scales for health workers be uniform.
For nurses this year, the difference will be up to CZK 7,000 per month.
But for doctors, for example, wages rose faster than salaries last year.
According to Roman Šmucler, president of the Czech Chamber of Dentistry, trade unionists should take note of how the state is currently doing.
The House of Commons recently approved an increase in this year's state budget deficit to a record CZK 500 billion due to the impact of the epidemic, of which CZK 1.75 billion is to go towards the remuneration of health workers in hospitals and social services.
According to Šmucler, the Council of Health Care Providers does not agree with the across-the-board salary increase next year.
According to him, remuneration should be decided by hospitals and health care facilities themselves and the extra money should go to them through the reimbursement decree.
Vojtěch also said that hospitals currently have enough protective equipment.
Pavel Švagr, chairman of the State Material Reserves Administration (SSHR), said this week that the administration does not currently have a single protective medical device in its possession.
It is waiting for the completion of the tenders.
According to Vojtech, suppliers around the world are now better able to deliver the goods than in March when they were bought out.
However, he said the state should also try to be as self-sufficient as possible and buy from Czech companies.
Scrubbing smart quarantine could be taken over by the military.
We're ready, they say.
"Smart quarantine works, there is room for improvement of course.
We'll be discussing it with the army tonight.
The army is working perfectly well and the question is whether they should take charge of the whole thing again," the prime minister said on his Facebook show Hello People on Sunday.
He said there is a failure to adequately connect IT systems and health posts, which gradually need to move to more modern methods of functioning.
The Prime Minister said there were problems in the Moravian-Silesian region, which is one of the current outbreaks.
Defence Ministry spokesman Jan Pejšek told the Czech News Agency that he had no information about Sunday's meeting and that the government would discuss the matter on Monday.
He said the army was ready for the move.
The health ministry took over the smart quarantine project on 25 May.
Until then, the smart quarantine was run by a 90-member central management team set up under the army as an advisory body to the government, headed by former deputy minister Roman Prymula.
Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) criticised the crumbling project on Sunday.
He also raised the possibility that the army could take it over again.
The government's IT and digitalisation commissioner Vladimír Dzurilla, who is in charge of the project, also admitted shortcomings in the project earlier.
"The system works, but it is still being worked on.
For 20 years it was created separately and in a disjointed way, now we are trying to unify it within a few months.
It's not going by jet.
People are adapting these new systems as they go along, the poor people in the sanitation departments are actually tweaking the bugs," he said.
Ostrava mayor Macura will not run again because he doesn't want to "get stupid in politics"
Tomáš Macura (ANO), the current mayor of Ostrava, will not run in the next municipal elections.
The reason is that he wants "not to get lost in politics," he told Respekt.cz.
Macura, who is also a member of the board of the ANO movement, has been mayor of Ostrava since November 2014.
In the 2018 municipal elections, the ANO candidate he led won nearly a third of the votes in Ostrava.
Macura originally wanted to serve only four years.
"I told myself that I would last one term and with my experience in business I would be able to turn things around and get things back on their feet in that time," he told Respekt.
He added that he was persuaded to a certain extent to run for a second term.
"But for me this is the maximum.
I don't want to fool around in politics," said Macura, who in the interview described himself as a heavy introvert who is not comfortable with frequent contact with people.
According to Respekt, there has been speculation for some time about Macura's possible end in the ANO movement.
The server recalls that Macura has repeatedly criticised the ANO movement, for example for its alliance with the SPD or for supporting Miloš Zeman in the presidential elections.
He was one of the few ANO personalities to support Zeman's opponent Jiří Drahoš in the elections.
Macura does not plan to leave the ANO movement, which he joined in 2017.
"As long as I have the feeling that I can change something in the movement, that it is not a completely futile struggle and that no one is interfering with me, I have no immediate motive to quit," he told Respekt.
Macura, 67, graduated from the University of Economics in Prague.
Before he became Ostrava's mayor in 2014, Macura worked, among other things, as director of the pharmaceutical company Walmark.
He also sat on the boards of other companies.
Uber will return to Brno offering transportation services
Uber, a company offering transportation services, will return to Brno at the end of July.
This is a consequence of a change in the law, Petr Kratochvíl, Brno's councillor for transport (ODS), said in a press statement on Thursday.
Taxi drivers in Brno protested against Uber, pointing out that Uber does not meet conditions such as being labeled as a taxi or a taximeter.
However, a change in the law in July changed the conditions for operating regular taxis and alternative ones.
Kratochvíl has held several meetings with Uber representatives in recent weeks.
"On the basis of these discussions, the company decided to return to Brno at the end of July this year.
This move is a result of a change in the law that allows the company to operate legally.
The city has been informed of this change and we believe that the company will operate its services within the given limits," Kratochvíl said.
Uber has operated in Brno in the past.
Taxi drivers protested against it for not marking vehicles as taxis or the lack of a taximeter.
The court issued a preliminary injunction banning Uber from operating in the city.
Brno initially supported taxi drivers, but late last year Mayor Markéta Vaňková (ODS) said the city would like to take steps to make Uber work in Brno.
According to later court rulings, Uber was allowed to operate in Brno, but the company did not take advantage of this.
It will now return based on a change in the law.
Since July, it has been easier to operate a transport service ordered and paid for exclusively via mobile apps, in addition to the traditional taxis with a lantern and a meter.
Too exuberant celebration in Brno: a flying chair landed a meter away from a man on the sidewalk
An office chair flew out of the fourth floor of an apartment building in Brno on Saturday evening and landed about a meter away from the sidewalk.
A pedestrian was walking on it at the time and immediately called the police.
Upon arrival at the address in the western part of the city, the patrol noticed an open window with the chair still lying underneath and several cans and cigarette butts next to it.
"The noise coming from the fourth floor room indicated that a rather noisy party was going on inside.
Officers walked down the corridor to the apartment and asked the three young men present, aged between twenty-six and twenty-nine, for an explanation," said officers' spokesman Jacob Ghanem.
Babiš and ČSSD will discuss the demand to dismiss Rafaj
Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO) plans to discuss with the coalition Social Democrats on Monday the demand to dismiss the head of the Antimonopoly Office (ÚOHS), Petr Rafaj.
Non-profit organisations called for Rafaje's dismissal at a meeting of the government's anti-corruption council, as did the Ústí Region.
The Social Democrats say that a replacement at the head of the office is in order.
According to the Czech Press Agency, Rafaj was not invited to the Government Office on Monday.
His second term expires in the middle of next year and he cannot be appointed a third time under the law.
His removal is within the powers of President Miloš Zeman.
In addition to the call from NGOs, the prime minister also received a letter with a similar demand from the Ústí Region.
The reason is supposed to be, among other things, Rafaj's recent cases.
Last week, the prime minister refused to comment on the request, saying that he would get acquainted with the materials and the government parties would take "some position" on it.
He also said that he had not yet discussed the call with the President and had not arranged a meeting with him anytime soon.
According to a statement from the Office of the Public Prosecutor, there is no reason for the appeal because Rafaj has not been accused of anything.
Servers IHNED.cz and Aktuálně.cz reported last week that police are interested in Rafaj's meetings with the president.
The meetings were linked, among other things, to the decision on the tender for the controversial eight-billion project for a new hospital in Zlín, which Čunek is pushing hard.
Čunek admitted the meetings, saying they dealt with his "senate activities" together.
Rafaj speaks similarly.
The Ústí Region's assembly called on the government to dismiss Rafaj at the end of June.
It is also calling for a reform of the authority's decision-making mechanisms.
According to Jaroslav Kominek, the deputy governor for transport, the decision-making of the Office for Public Procurement is not transparent and has signs of arbitrariness.
Last March, police intervened at the antitrust office over a tender for toll collection.
In June this year, news server Aktuálně.cz pointed out that Rafaj was using flats signed over to the company of influential ČSSD backroom player Alexander Čuba.
The deposit of CZK 3.5 million for the Brno apartment was paid from Rafaj's account.
Rafaj has been chairman of the Office for the Protection of Competition since 9 July 2009, and the president appointed the former Social Democrat MP for a second term in June 2015.
Rafaj's second six-year term will thus expire in less than a year.
The law on the Antimonopoly Office states that the president can dismiss the chairman of the office on the proposal of the government.
He can only be dismissed if he fails to perform his duties for more than six months or seriously undermines the dignity of his office or the independence and impartiality of the office.
Staff collapsed in the Blanken library due to the heat.
Air conditioning will help
The new equipment will cost 740 thousand and will be in operation in the second half of August.
"This is good news for me.
With three children we go to the library in the centre of Blansko regularly.
But in the warm months it was practically impossible to stay there.
It was terribly hot and the air was bad.
The ventilation didn't help.
That's why I'm glad for the air conditioning," said Petr Novotný, one of Blansko's readers.
According to the library's director, Lukáš Dlapa, temperatures in the building often climbed to over 30 degrees.
The south wall of the building is glazed and on sunny days it acts as a greenhouse.
"Moreover, the curvature of the building allows the sun to hit it for a large part of the day.
At the same time, it is a big problem to ventilate the individual wards, because the windows have to be closed overnight for security reasons.
So we often have temperatures in the library in the early morning towards 30 degrees," said Dlapa.
The study and reading room on the third floor was the worst off.
And one floor up, the exhibition rooms and the director's office.
The climate was also uncomfortable in the children's department, which is located under the roof of the building.
"Several times it happened that librarians collapsed at work and ended up incapacitated.
There was also a regular problem in the cultural room during lectures, which are attended by dozens of people.
After a few minutes it was impossible to breathe," Dlapa noted.
Initially, city officials wanted to make air conditioning in all areas of the library this year.
In the end, there will be only three circuits out of five.
"Because of limited funding, only the most problematic areas will have air conditioning.
The study room and reading room on the third floor.
Then the cultural room and the children's department one floor up," said Jiří Svoboda from the Blansko Investment Department.
He added that in the first phase last autumn, workers installed air conditioning and modified the electrical wiring in the aforementioned areas.
It cost approximately CZK 360,000.
The Blansko Municipal Library has nearly three thousand registered readers.
Of these, about nine hundred are under fifteen years of age.
Chicago's resistance has banished the coronavirus.
Crawford is back in the game
Not every infected athlete comes clean.
Especially when it comes to players from the NHL, which is as silent as the grave about players' health and doesn't disclose anything at all.
Crawford was one of the few to step out of line.
The 35-year-old Montreal native was only present at the first practice and has been missing from the lineup since.
"I want to let you all know that I tested positive for Covid-19 and because of that I have spent the last fortnight locked up in my house," he revealed the reason for his absence.
Fans no longer have to worry about his health.
Crawford is ready to hit the ground running again.
"It's great to be back.
I'll do everything I can to get back in shape as soon as possible," he added.
The experienced goaltender has won two Stanley Cups with Chicago and has been a fixture in the crease for the 10th straight season.
The Blackhawks will play St. Louis first, then face Edmonton in the preliminary round.
Thousands of people protested in Israel against the prime minister
Thousands of Israelis protested in several parts of the country against unemployment, corruption and the way Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is handling the coronavirus crisis.
Demonstrations took place outside Netanyahu's private villa in Caesarea, near his official residence and in a park in Tel Aviv.
Protests have been held regularly in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv for several weeks.
They are demanding Netanyahu's resignation because of the trial in which he is accused of corruption and fraud, as well as the government's handling of the next wave of the coronavirus epidemic.
"Bibi, go home," one protester wrote on his banner, referring to Netanyahu's widely known nickname, according to the AP.
"Everyone can see that the emperor has lost his clothes," read another.
Netanyahu, 70, is Israel's first prime minister tried while in office.
He is charged in three cases of corruption, fraud and breach of trust.
He denies all the charges, calling them a witch hunt.
According to local media, the trial could take up to three years, with over 300 witnesses called.
The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has been confirmed in nearly 60,500 people in Israel, which has a population of about nine million.
About 455 people have died in connection with the infection.
The Israeli government introduced quarantine measures in March that have helped reduce the daily increases in infections.
However, after a gradual easing of restrictions from the end of April, the numbers of infected people began to rise again, particularly in late June.
Netanyahu's critics say the government has not sufficiently helped, for example, tradesmen affected by the quarantine measures.
Protesters are also concerned that the government is issuing sometimes contradictory instructions in the fight against the coronavirus.
The driver smashed his car into a tree and died.
The body had to be cut out of the wreckage by firefighters
The tragic accident happened at around 23:00 near Neveklov on the narrow district road leading from the Slap dam.
The driver apparently drove down into the forest at a considerable speed and smashed the car into a tree.
He died on the spot.
The body had to be extricated from the wreckage by firefighters, who, among other things, cut off the roof.
Police are investigating the circumstances of the crash.
They have ordered a forensic autopsy, which should, among other things, clarify whether the man was driving under the influence of alcohol or another addictive substance.
No more wastage and churning out one collection after another.
Pietro Filipi abolishes discounts and bets on sustainability
Czech clothing brand Pietro Filipi wants to focus on sustainability and is embarking on a major change of strategy.
It is cancelling discounts and no longer wants to churn out one collection after another.
The fact that the fashion industry is one of the biggest polluters of the environment is nothing new.
Billions of garments end up in incinerators and landfills every year.
But the view of slow fashion, an often despised approach to dressing, has been changing quite rapidly over the past few years.
Around half of Pietro Filipi's goods have been sold at full price.
The other half, which sold through discounts, simply won't be bought that way.
The company does not want to churn out one collection after another and discount products below their production price at the end of each season.
Moreover, according to owner Michal Mička, the days of new and old collections and blindly following fast-changing fashion trends are over.
"Most retailers already count on discounts when buying goods, so the full price includes a much higher margin.
So it's actually a bit of a scam," says Pietro Filipi owner Michal Mička.
In addition, the company wants to support local business with its approach.
"Each of our products is made from carefully selected quality fabrics and designed by local designers.
We put emphasis on the fact that a large part of our collection is made up of so-called basic pieces - i.e. clothes that are timeless and timeless.
Globally, the segment of premium brands is typical in the absence of any discounts, the price of the product simply corresponds to its quality and so there is no need for a discount," adds Mička.
Giant graffiti features RAF airman Kurt Taussig
"The brief was to create something to mark the anniversary of the end of the war.
And I thought of our fighter pilot who fought in the ranks of the British Royal Air Force in the Second World War.
The city authorities liked the design," said Vacek, who finished his work after 14 days of intensive creation.
He used about 300 litres of paint and 50 spray cans.
Kurt Taussig was born in 1923 in Teplice-Shanów.
He left the town when he was 15 years old.
During the war, because of his Jewish origin, the Nazis took him to an internment camp where he was held for several weeks.
However, thanks to Nicholas Winton's organisation, he and his brother managed to avoid the concentration camp.
In 1939 Taussig made his way to the UK, where he volunteered to join the Royal Air Force (RAF), and subsequently underwent pilot training in Southern Rhodesia, Africa, and Palestine.
He joined combat operations in early 1945.
After the Velvet Revolution he visited the Czech Republic several times and his native Teplice, which granted him honorary citizenship.
Kamil Vacek, forty-six years old, who is known in the street graphic art industry as Camo, has been working with spray paint on the streets of Teplice for over 20 years.
He started out with graffiti on the areas that were set aside for this purpose by the then mayor Jaroslav Kubera (ODS).
Storm Hanna has made landfall on the Texas coast
Hurricane Hanna made landfall on the southwest coast of the US state of Texas on Saturday afternoon local time (before midnight CEST tonight).
It struck Texas' Padre Island, about 24 kilometres north of the town of Port Mansfield, and weakened to a tropical storm as it moved over the mainland.
However, meteorologists say it still poses a great danger to coastal residents.
It has brought with it strong winds and intense rainfall; along with localised flooding, power outages and various material damage, including damaged boats, have been reported, according to the AP.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott had already declared a state of natural disaster for 32 counties in southwest Texas on Saturday and advised people to voluntarily evacuate.
The strongest warning was given to people in the coastal strip between Port Mansfield and Mesquite Bay, but in total the element is expected to hit an area nearly 500 miles long before gradually moving over northeastern Mexico.
"Although Hanna is now a tropical storm, heavy rain and wind, rising sea levels, dangerous surf and isolated tornadoes may pose a threat," the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) warned.
The storm was moving across the US-Mexico border this morning local time (afternoon CEST) and was accompanied by winds of 85 kilometres per hour.
Hanna became the first hurricane of this year's Atlantic hurricane season on Saturday.
It was accompanied by winds of up to 145 kilometres per hour over the Gulf of Mexico, but these gradually weakened to 112 kilometres per hour as it made landfall, taking Hanna out of the hurricane category again.
Authorities have urged local residents to wait out the storm at home, while taking hygiene precautions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
Texas is one of the US states most affected by the covid-19 pandemic.
Given the existing security measures and the need to maintain distances, evacuations are a major challenge.
Makeshift shelters have been opened in hotels, schools and gymnasiums.
In Hidalgo County, Texas, one building has also been adapted as a shelter after evacuees tested positive for coronavirus or were otherwise exposed to the disease.
Local authorities have urged all evacuees to take their masks and disinfectant gels with them to the shelter if possible.
"We are far from over it.
We're expecting catastrophic flooding," the AP quoted Chris Birchfield, who works for the National Weather Service (NWS) service in Brownsville, as saying.
Forecasts say that in some places it could splash as much as 300 millimetres of rain in a matter of hours, and in some cases nearly 500 millimetres, which, combined with sea level rise, could flood many settlements along the coast.
Zeman to confer general rank on Colonel Lipek
President Miloš Zeman will confer the rank of general on Colonel Pavel Lipka on Wednesday.
This follows from the overview of expected events of the Ministry of Defence.
The reason for conferring the rank of brigadier general is Lipka's assumption of the post of deputy commander of the allied multinational division Northeast in Poland in August.
Lipka has been serving as deputy commander of the Czech Army's ground forces.
The promotion was proposed to Zeman by the government at the end of June.
From the beginning of August, Lipka will replace Brigadier General Karel Rehka as deputy commander of the Multinational Division Northeast in Elblag, Poland, which commands units of the Alliance's forward presence in Poland and the Baltic States.
In March, Rehka became director of the National Cyber and Information Security Bureau (NCIS).
The government has proposed to the president that Lipka be given the rank of brigadier general.
According to the law on professional soldiers, a higher rank can be conferred on a soldier for the duration of the performance of an elected office or for the duration of a service task that requires the conferment of a higher rank.
The position of deputy commander of an allied division corresponds to the rank of general.
A Soldier to whom a rank has been conferred has the same rights and obligations as if he had been appointed to that rank.
However, he is not entitled to a pay adjustment commensurate with the rank.
The conferral of rank shall continue until the reason for which it was conferred has passed.
"Colonel Lipka demonstrates a high degree of professional readiness and is a role model for his subordinates.
He contributes significantly to the fulfilment of the tasks of the Armed Forces of the Czech Republic, including cooperation with foreign partners and securing the participation of the army in foreign operations," the defence ministry said in June on the promotion proposal.
Wednesday's promotion will take place at 12:30 pm at Prague Castle and will be attended by Defence Minister Lubomír Metnar and Chief of the General Staff Aleš Opata.
EU countries have coronavirus standards for aviation
European Union countries have agreed on common hygiene standards for air travel to help curb the spread of a new coronavirus.
The announcement was made by German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer.
Among the agreed standards are keeping a distance or wearing a veil on the plane and at the airport, but the middle seats on planes will not have to remain unoccupied.
This was reported by Reuters.
"I am pleased that my colleagues have accepted the German proposal for Europe and that we could agree on these uniform standards," Scheuer told the European Aviation Conference.
The German transport ministry then added that the agreement had been concluded by officials and still needed to be formally approved by ministers.
The agreed measures include a requirement for passengers aged six and over to cover their mouths and noses, and to keep a recommended distance during security checks and airport check-in.
Plans must also guarantee sufficient fresh air and all information must be available in several languages.
Airlines will also be able to occupy middle seats.
The common rules agreed by officials meet at least some of the airlines' requirements.
Different standards have caused confusion.
Arctic Svalbard hits temperature record of almost 22 degrees
"A 41-year-old record has fallen in Longyearbyen," the Norwegian Meteorological Institute said on Twitter.
The temperature there rose to 21.7 degrees Celsius in the afternoon, breaking the 1979 record by 0.4 degrees, it added.
The roughly 2,000-strong Longyearbyen is the largest town in Svalbard, located about 1,300 kilometres from the North Pole.
Svalbard is warming faster than almost any other place on Earth.
This fact highlights the dangers of warming elsewhere in the Arctic - from Alaska to Siberia, according to a report last year by the Norwegian Centre for Climate Studies.
The average temperature in Svalbard has risen by three to five degrees since the 1970s, it said.
By 2100, it could rise by as much as ten degrees if greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere are not reduced.
Rising temperatures in Svalbard may result in the thawing of permafrost, which will threaten the stability of many buildings, roads and airports, and may cause more avalanches and landslides.
Climate warming also threatens Arctic fauna such as polar bears and seals, which depend on the ocean's ice cover.
Britons returning from Spain face a mandatory two-week quarantine
The British cabinet has also urged citizens to avoid all non-essential travel to mainland Spain because of the risk of the spread of covid-19.
The Canary and Balearic Islands are therefore not mentioned, but even after returning from them, people must go into isolation for two weeks.
The new rules come into force at midnight.
"'Protecting public health is our absolute priority.
We have taken this decision to prevent the possible spread of the virus in Britain," the British diplomatic service said in a statement.
"We have always made it clear that we will immediately remove a country from the safe list should the need arise," it added.
As the British newspaper Metro noted, the latest announcement will affect the travel plans of thousands of Britons.
Indeed, Spain is one of the most popular holiday destinations.
Among other things, Britons are worried about whether they will be paid sick pay if they have to end up in isolation for 14 days when they return from holiday.
Neil Hunter from Sittingbourne, for example, has booked a ten-day holiday in Lanzarote and was due to leave on Tuesday.
They have been booked on the trip since December.
"We were supposed to go as a family, my wife Amanda and daughter Bethany, but to be honest after this announcement I don't know what's going to happen.
I work as a machinist and I don't think my employer will agree to me being quarantined for two weeks when I return from holiday," the Metro quoted Hunter as saying.
In relation to Spain, there are fears that the country is at the beginning of a second wave of the epidemic.
Over 900 newly infected people have been reported there in each of the last two days in a 24-hour period.
Authorities in some areas are already tightening coronavirus measures, with Catalonia, for example, trying to restrict all nightlife to prevent people from gathering in large numbers.
The Czech Foreign Ministry has now warned of an increased risk of infection in Catalonia, Aragon, the Basque Country and the Madrid area.
Model for buying electricity from Dukovany to be discussed by the government
The government will discuss on Monday a model for buying electricity from the planned new unit of the Dukovany nuclear power plant.
The draft law foresees that if the purchase price is higher than the price of power electricity on the market, all consumers will pay the difference through tariffs.
In the second case, where the purchase price is lower than the market price, the impact on consumers will be the opposite.
Power electricity is the unregulated part of the final price of electricity for consumers.
Deputy Prime Minister and Industry Minister Karel Havlicek (ANO) and the energy company CEZ have previously stated that the more likely option is that people will save money on electricity thanks to the construction.
Analysts, on the other hand, point out that the long-term outlook for electricity prices on the markets is always uncertain, as developments in the past have shown several times.
Environmental organisations have previously criticised the plan.
"The feed-in tariff can be below or above the market price of power electricity.
Thus, the final impact at the time of the rule's applicability can be both negative and positive.
The impact will be distributed among customers according to the size of the circuit breaker - when electricity consumption is lower - or according to the electricity consumption - when electricity consumption is higher," the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MIT) said in the documents accompanying the material.
Havlicek said in May that he expected the wholesale price of electricity to rise and people to make a profit from the construction of Dukovany.
Otherwise, the impact will be in the tens of crowns per year per family, which he said is far less than what people pay annually in electricity bills to support so-called supported resources.
He has previously estimated that the feed-in tariff could be between 50 and 60 euros (about CZK 1,320 to 1,600) per megawatt hour (MWh).
The submitted material does not contain any proposal for the amount, which is to be included in the power purchase agreement.
The price of electricity on the Prague Power Exchange for 2021, the year for which traders are now mostly stocked, is currently around €45 (about CZK 1,190) per MWh.
"With a difference of 10 euros between the purchase price and the market price of power electricity, the additional payment for an average household with a consumption of 3.3 MWh per year - which may correspond to a four-person household, equipped with standard electrical appliances including an electric hob and oven, but which does not use electricity for heating and hot water - could be less than 100 CZK/year," the MIT wrote in its documents for the government.
"We live in extremely turbulent times.
The coronavirus pandemic has shown us how vulnerable the global economy is.
For this reason, I consider a long-term prediction of market prices to be a purely speculative matter," Tomas Voltr, executive director of the Energy financial group, told the Czech News Agency earlier.
The proposed law foresees that the purchase would be carried out by the MIT, or by a legal entity owned by the state, at a predetermined price.
The contract between the investor and the state, guaranteeing the terms of the power purchase, would be concluded for a minimum of 30 years, with a possible extension of ten years, even repeatedly, but no longer than until the low-carbon production is completed.
The proposal defines low-carbon generation as nuclear reactor power generation connected to the electricity grid with an installed capacity of at least 100 megawatts (MW) after 2030.
Havlicek previously said the new Dukovany unit would have a capacity of 1,200 MW and produce nine terawatt-hours of electricity annually, equivalent to one-tenth of expected Czech consumption.
The unit should be commissioned in 2036.
The financing model for the new Dukovany unit was approved by the government on Monday.
The state should finance the plant without interest during construction, while during operation it is expected to pay 2% interest.
The opposition disagrees with the financing model and is also concerned about the possibility of Russian or Chinese companies building Dukovany.
The state should participate in 70 percent of the construction.
The rest should be paid by ČEZ, which will also cover any additional costs.
ČEZ CEO Daniel Beneš told ČTK in May that the expected sum for the construction of the unit at current prices is about six billion euros (approximately 162 billion crowns).
Contracts between the state and CEZ for the construction of the new Dukovany unit will be signed on Tuesday.
Ministry for Regional Development withdraws material on tourism support in media for two billion
The Ministry of Regional Development planned to spend CZK 2 billion on advertising holidays in the Czech Republic in the media, on the internet and on billboards, according to the material, which was withdrawn from the comments procedure.
Minister Klára Dostálová (ANO) told SeznamZprávy.cz that the material is still being worked on.
Zdopravy.cz pointed out the document in eKlep (an electronic library of the legislative process) on Friday.
The ministry justified the plan on the grounds of a drop in tourism due to the coronavirus.
During the coronavirus crisis, the media also saw a drop in revenue.
The proposal drew criticism from the opposition and tourism representatives.
According to the proposal, which can now be viewed on the hlidacstatu.cz website, the MMR planned to give money for advertising on television, radio, in the press, on the internet, on billboards and on station areas through the state agency for tourism promotion CzechTourism.
The largest part of the money, CZK 700 million, would go to television stations.
Most of it would go to the private Nova and Prima TV stations.
Print newspapers and weeklies would receive 400 million and the same share would be given to the Ministry of Culture for PR articles, advertising banners and videos on websites.
Radio stations would receive 350 million for the media campaign, most of which would again go to private stations.
The remaining 150 million would be used for outdoor advertising on billboards, LED screens and surfaces in stations or in the metro.
The campaign to promote tourism in the Czech Republic was due to start in mid-August and last for a year.
"The material is still being worked on, it is definitely not yet in the form that should be presented," Dostálová told SeznamZprávy without giving further details.
The material has been criticised by the opposition, with TOP 09 chief Marketa Pekarova Adamová saying that media outlets from the trust funds of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (ANO) would benefit from the advertising.
"I firmly believe that this spectacular contempt will get a punch between the eyes in the autumn elections," she tweeted.
Dostálová denies that this is actually about helping the media hit by the crisis.
"It could be a coincidence, I know nothing about supporting the media," she told the Daily N on Friday.
According to her, the budget of two billion is indicative.
"Of course, we are still counting it, it could be less or more.
It's working material," she added.
The Save Tourism Initiative's media campaign to promote domestic tourism makes no sense.
"We want two billion for tourism companies, not an unnecessary advertising campaign," Tomáš Barčík, chairman of the initiative, said on Sunday.
If the two billion crowns are in the state budget, they should go to companies, not to the media, the initiative wrote in an open letter to the government.
The broth of life, the rooster of beer and death like a blade of grass
Posthumous is also the third album entitled And Death is a blade of grass by the Brno poet, tireless organizer of cultural activities and publisher Jaroslav Erik Frič, who also passed away a year ago, on 24 May.
It is the fifth entry in Frič's discography and, as with his previous titles, the main emphasis here is on Frič's poetry, of which he himself is an excellent interpreter.
Frič, born in 1949, was understandably influenced by the American Beat Generation, but he passes this inspiration through his own distinctively rendered experiences as well as very intimate expressions of faith.
However, he was far from any agitation, if he spoke or wrote about faith, about God, it was always very intimate, non-aggressive, absolutely tolerant.
Bohuslav Reynek comes to mind (in contrast to Jan Zahradníček, for example), the masters will forgive me.
Frič's album offers recordings of readings from 2006, as well as performances with musicians who always accompanied him very sensitively, whether it was the cellist Josef Klíč or Honza Barton and Vítězslav Holata.
Let me help myself - gladly - with the words of the Ostrava poet Petr Hruška about Frič's long poetic compositions.
"They radiated a proud and unending bitterness," Hruška writes, "over the state of our world threatened with extinction.
A world that is sinking further and further into numbed consumer vanity and avarice, becoming more and more distant from what its soul was made of - the mysteries of faith, humility and human intimacy.
They echoed the longing of one who knows that the values for which he was created are of little interest to anyone, but who also knows that it is only through general disinterest that they cannot be renounced.
The poems were reminders that one may have to lose everything dear, but it is not unimportant how one loses it.
Whether he sells out to general decline, resigns skeptically, falls fearfully silent, or remains to the last moment in calm and proud insistence on what he believes and loves."
Paroubek is not my adviser, said Hamáček
Former Prime Minister and ČSSD chairman Jiří Paroubek is not a paid adviser to the Social Democrats.
Party chairman and Interior Minister Jan Hamáček only communicates with him and reads his opinions and articles.
Hamáček said this today on the Prima Partie television programme.
The server SeznamZprávy.cz reported on Friday that Paroubek would be Hamáček's advisor.
"From time to time we text each other, he sometimes sends me some material and I read it," Hamáček said today.
However, he added that this is not an official and paid cooperation.
He said the CSSD does not have the resources to waste on such purposes.
"The fact that I occasionally read his opinion, there are plenty of such people," he said.
In a subsequent discussion with ODS deputy Jana Černochová, the minister said many ODS members still "listen to Václav Klaus' opinions disingenuously".
He said this is fine because he is an experienced politician and former party chairman, which is also the case with Paroubek.
He described the fact that the media are making an affair out of it as a sign of this year's cucumber season.
The server SeznamZprávy.cz wrote on Friday that Paroubek is acting as Hamáček's unofficial consultant.
It also wrote that the fourth place on the party's list of candidates in the Ústí nad Labem region goes to Petr Benda, the former chair of the party's local cell, who is associated with Paroubek and served as vice-chair of his LEV 21 party.
Hamáček said today that he would not comment on the composition of the candidate list until it is finalized and approved.
Duplantis has a mile lead, it's a kick up the arse, laments Swede's challenger
It is the 22-year-old American pole vaulter who has the ambition and potential to be one of the new ruler's most serious competitors.
He already knows what it's like to beat the two years younger Duplantis, having overpowered him at the NCAA Universities Association meet last year.
"We had a battle the year before, he won then and I was second, then we switched.
Both times it was a very good battle," describes Nilsen, who secured the win with a 5.95m performance.
But Duplantis has shot up steeply since then and is currently alone in the highest pole vaulting spheres.
At just 20 years of age, he became the world record holder, breaking the 6.17m bar in Torun on 8 February this year and adding a centimetre a week later in Glasgow.
"He was already jumping six metres when he finished high school at the age of 18," his peer Nilsen recalled to the World Athletics website.
"It was clear that once he matured from a boy into a man, he would decimate all his potential and talent.
Twenty is a pretty good age to jump a world record," he believes.
Although Nilsen's list of achievements is much thinner than that of Duplantis, the American has similar goals.
He has so far hinted at his potential at NCAA events, which he has regularly won, improving his indoor personal best to 5.93m at one of them this February. He won a gold medal at the Pan American Games in Lima last August, and back in 2017 he made the US team to the world championships, where he finished 13th.
The next milestone for him then is to get his first taste of the Diamond League.
"Definitely my priority is to get on the professional circuit and compete in the Diamond League as much as possible because that's where you can make a name for yourself," he realizes.
"If you can succeed at that level, you can undoubtedly do the same at events like the Olympics, World Championships or Pan American Games."
But because of the pandemic, those top festivals have been postponed, giving Nilsen and other pole vaulters time to improve.
But will it be enough to catch up with Duplantis, who could easily turn a race under five rings into a mere battle for silver?
"Everyone is trying to catch him, but I don't think it will be possible anytime soon," Nilsen muses.
"The kid has been jumping for 16 years and in training he has a mile lead over everyone else."
And before Tokyo 2021 begins, he'll be looking to increase it.
A woman spent hundreds of thousands of her disabled son's disability pension.
She's going to court
The money the 33-year-old man receives from the state as a disability pension is primarily intended to improve his quality of life.
The woman faces up to eight years in prison for embezzlement.
Because of his poor health, the court stripped the sick man of his legal capacity and appointed his mother as guardian, who was to manage her son's money, among other things.
"Between mid-November 2013 and January this year, the woman used part of her son's disability pension funds for her own use, depriving him of CZK 440 000," police spokeswoman Dana Ladmanová said, adding that the accused woman was aggravated by the fact that as guardian she had a special duty to protect the interests of the victim.
The woman had set up an account for her son, as ordered by the court, but had his pension sent to her own account.
"After paying the costs of her son's stay in a medical facility and paying for necessary medication, she used the remaining funds to purchase a vehicle, electrical appliances and to run the household," the indictment states.
The woman admitted that she could not use her son's money for her own use.
But she defended herself by saying she used the money to help pay for family expenses.
"We had problems to run the household on our income.
We never bought anything extra.
It was always on things my son would approve of buying.
I considered it family money.
I had no idea that I was committing a crime," the woman explained to the police.
She promised to return the money to her son.
North America has been inhabited for 30,000 years, scientists say after finding tools
The finds from the Chiquihuite cave in the Mexican state of Zacatecas include 1,930 tools made of limestone, including fine blades that may have been used to cut meat and pointed objects that could have served as spearheads or spears.
The researchers found that the oldest of the tools date from 33,000 to 31,000 years ago.
"There are only a few products of this age.
But they are here," said Ciprian Ardelean, an archaeologist at the University of Zacatecas and lead author of one of two studies on the subject published in the journal Nature.
The youngest tools are 12,500 years old.
According to the experts, people have inhabited the Chiquihuite cave, located at high altitude, for 20 000 years.
Until now, the generally accepted theory was that the first representatives of the species Homo sapiens crossed the land bridge from the area of present-day Russia to Alaska about 13,500 years ago.
Archaeological evidence, including unique spearheads used to kill mammoths and other prehistoric animals, has shown that this Clovis culture subsequently spread across much of North America.
But this model has been cracked in recent decades, with the discovery of several ancient settlements that date back two to three thousand years.
A second study published in the journal Nature reports on 42 different sites across North America that show evidence of human presence on the continent as early as 26,000 to 19,000 years ago.
Scientists believe that a small number of people may have arrived on the North American mainland earlier than previously thought.
Some may have reached the Americas by boat.
"It is clear that people were in the Americas long before the development of the so-called Clovis culture," said anthropologist Ruth Gruhn of the University of Alberta in Canada, commenting on the new findings.
So far, interest in tickets is fulfilling an optimistic scenario, sellers say.
Prices are gradually coming down
Ticket sales in the Czech Republic are rising every week.
Compared to last summer, interest is still roughly half of what it was last year, but demand is growing by up to 20 percent every week.
According to retailers, the post-crisis development is thus fulfilling the most optimistic scenarios.
Ticket prices are also gradually falling.
According to the retailers, the most popular destinations are mainly southern European countries.
According to Kiwi.com data, Spain, Italy and Greece are leading the way.
At Letuška.cz, flights to Split, Croatia, are the most popular.
Of the other countries, the UK is the most popular, but it has always been one of the busiest destinations.
The average ticket price is also decreasing.
At the Letuška.cz portal, it was around CZK 6,250 in the middle of the month, down CZK 3,000 year-on-year.
This is mainly due to an increase in demand for European destinations, which now account for about 85 percent of sales.
However, prices to some European destinations themselves are also falling, with prices to Spain and Italy, for example, down by about a fifth in recent weeks.
The crisis has also affected consumer behaviour, with customers now buying tickets much less in advance than before, fearing further developments in the coronavirus situation.
According to earlier Kiwi.com information, the time taken to buy a ticket before departure has fallen by around ten days year-on-year.
"This confirms to us the future trend, when people will book airline tickets with much less advance notice, demand more flexibility, take less risk," said Michal Šindelář, Kiwi.com's vice president for products.
Currently, the average booking time before departure is 21 days.
Along with the growth in sales, the number of renewals from the Czech Republic is also increasing.
Prague Airport currently operates scheduled flights to more than 60 destinations.
Compared to last year's summer season, the number of destinations has increased by approximately half.
The grand finale is tonight!
Watch the darts battle live on Nova Sport
The second most prestigious tournament in the PDC organization has reached the grand finale.
It will feature the experienced forty-nine-year-old Scottish darter Gary Anderson and the surprise of the tournament, twenty-six-year-old Belgian Dimitri van den Bergh.
Gary Anderson knocked out Justin Pip in the first round, then ran into his neighbour in the leaderboard.
He also handled James Wade, however, and in the quarter-finals he had a good fight with Simon Whitlock, who had earlier sent the world number one home.
The "Flying Scotsman" had a tough time in the semi-finals when he faced Michale Smith.
However, he escaped the gravedigger's shovel at the last moment, dominated in the extra time and after a score of 18:16, earned his place in the final of the tournament he had already dominated in 2018, beating Mensur Suljovic 21:19 in a stunning battle.
The biggest surprise of the World Matchplay is Dimitri van den Bergh.
The Belgian talent is enjoying the tournament and it is perhaps the knowledge that he has nothing to lose that has helped him to play in an absolutely fantastic way.
The twenty-six year old darts player first knocked out world number six Nathan Aspinall in a surprising fashion, then outlasted Joe Cullen in a dramatic battle, and even beat Adrian Lewis in the quarter-finals after a sharp start.
The semi-final was the big test.
Glen Durrant showed his strength right from the start, but the Belgian, playing calmly, then used an excellent series to take the lead, which he then held more or less easily to the end.
Van den Bergh showed his strength in high scoring, which he used to counter the occasional uncertainty on doubles.
The number of coronavirus cases was the lowest since the beginning of the week, and the number of tests was reduced.
Since the beginning of March, when the new coronavirus was first discovered in the Czech Republic, 15,212 people have been proven to have contracted it.
Almost 9 600 of them have been cured, while 368 have died.
Currently, 5 254 people are ill.
This is according to data on the website of the Ministry of Health.
The daily number of newly confirmed cases this week exceeded two hundred four times in a row.
The peak was Friday's 281 cases.
On Thursday, 235 people tested positive, 246 the day before and 206 on Tuesday.
On the first working day of this week, 169 infected people were added.
Already 9,590 people have been cured of covid-19 in the Czech Republic, 63 percent of all those infected so far.
Most have had a mild course of the disease.
According to the latest figures from the Ministry of Health, 151 people with coronavirus are in hospital, with doctors assessing the condition of 19 of them as serious.
There are several outbreaks of covid-19 in the Czech Republic.
Karviná still has the highest number of infected people per 100,000 inhabitants over the last seven days, with almost 59.
This is followed by the Jihlava district with 56 and the Frýdek-Místek district with 36 infected per 100 000 inhabitants in the last week.
Due to the increased number of infections, new measures against the spread of the coronavirus have been in force in the Czech Republic since Saturday.
People must wear masks at indoor mass events of more than 100 people, including cultural and sporting events, as well as weddings and funerals inside buildings.
From Monday, the capacity of these events will be reduced by half from the current 1,000 people.
Worldwide, the number of people proven to have contracted the new coronavirus has already passed the 16 million mark.
The US Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking the pandemic globally, said.
The balance of victims who have died with the covid-19 disease is close to 645 thousand, according to this source.
The latest one million infected were added to the statistics in just three days; the 15 million mark fell on 22 July.
The largest contributors to the rapid rise in cases in recent days have been the United States, which has already registered over 4.1 million infected, Brazil with 2.4 million and India, where authorities say nearly 1.4 million people have been infected.
Infections are now increasing at a record pace.
The World Health Organization said this week that more than 284,000 new cases were added globally from Thursday to Friday, the highest daily tally since the pandemic began.
The development can be attributed to the fact that the spread of the disease is at its peak in populous countries such as the US, Brazil and India, but according to Reuters, the number of new cases rose in nearly 40 countries around the world in the past week.
These include Australia, Japan, Bolivia, Sudan, Bulgaria, Belgium and Israel.
The outbreak has already appeared in almost every country in the world, with the first case officially announced today by the DPRK.
Indoor air is up to five times worse than outdoor air.
Air fresheners and deodorants are bad for your health
Health is not only threatened by poor air quality outdoors, but also at home.
Israeli human health expert Carol Abraham, quoted by The Jerusalem Post, warned of this.
According to Abraham, who was instrumental in the creation of Israel's Environmental Protection Ministry, the need to focus on pollutants in the home comes at a time when many people are spending more time working from home.
Abraham mentioned research by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that found that home air quality is up to five times worse than outdoor air.
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 3.8 million people die prematurely each year because of poor air quality in their homes.
"Because of the coronavirus epidemic, which has forced and continues to force many to work from home, people are having to spend more hours in their homes than before, so it's time to focus on indoor air quality," Abraham said.
In Israel, she said, almost no one is concerned about the quality of "home air."
Yet things that people come into contact with on a regular basis - paints, air fresheners, disinfectants, deodorants or pesticides - can be dangerous.
"Even the clothes we regularly wear to the dry cleaners give off poisonous gas," Abraham said.
Children, elderly household members and people with respiratory problems are most at risk, she said.
Even otherwise healthy individuals can begin to suffer problems such as headaches, fainting, nasal irritation, nosebleeds, vomiting or skin allergies.
With prolonged exposure to unhealthy substances, internal organs and the central nervous system can become damaged.
But not all pollutants come from objects inside the home; the material from which houses are built can also be a source.
Václav Havel quiz: How long he spent in prison and what made him write Charter 77
Fuenlabrada lost its chance to qualify for the top Spanish football league due to a coronavirus infection in the team.
The management of the competition cancelled the originally postponed game of the last round of the second league, in which the team could have secured participation in the play-offs.
Fuenlabrada reported 12 more people infected on Saturday, bringing the total number of positive tests for covid-19 at the club to 28.
Monday's game against La Coruna, in which Fuenlabrada needed a point to make the playoffs, was postponed due to the team's infection.
The competition's management said today that the duel against La Coruna had been definitively called off in view of force majeure due to the fact that there was no time to play it.
Fuenlabrada accepted the decision.
La Coruna, on the other hand, is rebelling against the non-playing of the match.
In the end, given the results of their rivals, even a win against Fuenlabrada would not have been enough to save them, but they consider it unfair that the last round was not played on a single date, as is customary.
The management of the former elite Spanish club is threatening to sue over their relegation to the third division.
The top two teams in the table, Huesca and Cadiz, are guaranteed promotion to the elite.
Zaragoza, Almería, Girona and Elche will face off in the play-offs for the remaining third promotion place.
Karel Gott didn't like Václav Havel?!
His daughter Dominika revealed
"Dad didn't have to like him for many years," Gott's eldest daughter Dominika revealed to Aha!, adding that the Master couldn't think of Havel's name and whenever the subject came up, Karel was always upset.
It's hard to say what they did to each other, but according to Dominika, the feud started sometime in the mid-1990s.
"Dad said in an article after the revolution that he had it easier than him.
That Havel could write in a drawer during the dark ages, but if he somehow rebelled, his career was over," Gott says.
She adds that the Czech greats found their way to each other in the end.
"I know that he couldn't even hear the word Havel until his 60th birthday.
But then the president congratulated him with a birthday letter and suddenly my father's relationship with him began to change," Dominika recalls.
In fact, ten years later, Gott even invited the then former president to celebrate his seventieth birthday at the Ambassador Hotel on Wenceslas Square.
"And there began a new era in their relationship, because my father regularly invited Mr Havel to his home in Bertramka," added the blonde, whose father died last October.
Slavík said he was also sorry that he never received a state decoration from Václav Havel.
He did receive one in 2009, although it was from his successor in office, Václav Klaus (79).
He will receive another honour in memoriam, as the current President Miloš Zeman (75) is to award him the Order of the White Lion to honour his memory.
Czech weathermen warn of fires
Meteorologists are warning of high temperatures for Tuesday afternoon for the whole of Bohemia, except for the Karlovy Vary region, as well as for southern and central Moravia.
"Exceptionally, temperatures may exceed 34 degrees Celsius, especially in central Bohemia," they said.
They advise people to drink in the heat and limit physical exertion in the afternoon and midday.
Due to the warm weather with minimal rainfall, there will be a risk of fires from Tuesday morning.
Windy weather could contribute to their rapid spread.
Meteorologists are warning of the risk of fires in central Bohemia, including Prague, Liberec, Ústí nad Labem, Karlovy Vary and Pilsen.
The fire warning will remain in effect until further notice.
"We do not expect any significant precipitation to mitigate the danger in northwest and western Bohemia until at least the end of the week," the Czech Hydrological Office said.
The Prague City Hall has responded to the meteorologists' warning by banning bonfires in risky places, which is due to take effect from Tuesday.
People in the capital will not be allowed to build open fires in parks, gardens or forests, for example, up to 50 metres from the edge of forest cover.
Smoking and the use of pyrotechnics are also banned in these areas.
The measure will remain in force until further notice, Prague City Hall spokesman Vít Hofman said.
