Novák helped Trabzonspor to second place, and Škoda hit
Defender Filip Novák helped a goal in the last round of the Turkish Football League Trabzonspor to the title of vice champion.
His team won 2:1 on the Kayserisporo pitch, keeping the third Besiktas behind.
Milan Škoda striker put in his 10th goal for Rizespor after January's transfer from Slavia, who saved himself even though he succumbed 1:3 on the Fenerbahce pitch.
Novák confirmed excellent productivity at fullback with a seventh goal in this league edition.
In the 63rd minute, the Kayserisporo goal-scooped only a surging shot and the Czech footballer powered the ball into the net from an angle.
Home managed five minutes before the end to equalise but Trabzonspor snatched victory to his side in the sixth minute of set-up as he successfully capped a four-on-one shot.
Skoda in the opening second half match with Fenerbahce equalised after a solo at 1:1.
While Rizespor did not hold the indecisive state for long, he did not have to be sorry, as he remained three points above the relegation band thanks to his opponents” results.
The competition will conclude Sunday's duel of the masterful Basaksehir at the Kasimpasy Course.
The well-concealed cavern at the hermit in the woods near Nový Bor was not actually habitable
In the north of Bohemia in the foothills of the Lusatian Mountains, near Nový Bor in Českolipsk, several sandstone rock formations are sheltered in the forests through which the Count Road led.
Natural and man-made.
And we will go after that human hand created.
The place is called the Cave at the Hermit.
In fact, no hermit ever lived here, and the cave served as a shelter, more precisely a hiding chamber apparently for grain.
The cave is carved from its side into a rock promontory and accessed by stairs from above.
But it is practically not visible until the last moment.
He gives it up the narrow steps leading to a kind of rock gallery, from where it is yet to enter the rock.
Although the chamber appears to be considerably far from human habitation, at the time of formation there may have been a field on the plateau where the forest is today.
“The fact that this object does not have a window and even a firebox located in a traditional place demonstrates unequivocally that no hermit here could ever survive the winter,” explains historian Kamil Podroužek of Faculty of Philosophy of Jan Evangelista Purkyně in Ústí nad Labem.
The single-space object has only a stone bench at the rear used apparently to put away the vessels.
“I see it as a chamber to store some food or produce from the field,” adds Kamil Podroužek.
Tool marks are noticeable on the walls of the cave.
The declamation of sandstone by the canine was quite simple and fast for the insiders.
It was enough to make good use of the joints and gradually deglaze the sandstone.
Depending on the length of the canine trace and even the method of chopping, the period of formation of the cave can be determined in a framework
According to the historian, this is probably about the end of the 18th century.
The cave is freely accessible and, according to the disorder that appears in it, someone occasionally sleepovers there in today's times.
If you approach the cave from above from one of the forest roads and you are taken under the cave running the creep and the nearby Count Road, you will definitely find the trail down.
And on the way out of the woods, you may still be captivated by the nearby Raven Rocks.
Jockey Minařík is in artificial sleep after heavy fall in Germany
“Philip is in the best hands now.
The Institute is furnished for similar cases, in addition, luckily we have part of the family in Hanover.
This greatly eases me the situation and also the care of daughter Finju,” the server Ridci.cz quoted a statement from Minařík's wife Katja as saying.
“Everybody's doing their utmost, Philip now needs time to convalesce.
There's no point in giving any forecasts.
Anyone who has ever encountered the issue of head trauma and patients in artificial sleep knows that the situation can change.
Philip is a great warrior.
We all have to be patient now and give him time,” stated the 40-year-old jockey's wife.
Also called on Twitter for financial support for the injured Minark, star-studded Frankie Dettori, who won the obsessive King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot on Saturday, levelling evened the legend of Lester Piggott.
Nearly 70 thousand euros have been raised on the Gofundme server to date.
The goal is 100 thousand euros (2.6 million kronor).
Video referee took Sassuola footballers four goals, lost 0:2
Sassuola's footballers, while getting the ball into their opponent's goal four times in Saturday's game in Napoli, eventually they had to put up with a 0:2 defeat.
Neither of their goals was acknowledged by the referee after consulting the video due to offside.
According to Italian media, this is a record adversity of technology, so many interventions have never been thwarted by VAR to one team.
“The VAR was stricter on Sassuolo than the road radar and punished him like no team yet.
New technology is tearing up records,” Gazzetta dello Sport newspaper wrote in a commentary.
“Festival of unrecognized goals by Sassuola.
Never before has VAR been so strict on one team,” added the Corriere dello Sport sheet.
Napoli took the lead as early as the 8th minute on Saturday, but after half an hour of play Sassuolo seemed to have equalised.
But Filip Djuričič's goal was not acknowledged after the video referee's intervention due to offside.
For the same reason, then, successively, Djuričič's other hit and the hits of Francesco Caputo and Domenico Berardi did not apply either.
Home, by contrast, they added one more goal.
Electric cars report a new record.
In the Czech Republic, the most rechargeable in history
“Growth has been dragged both by a 30 per cent increase in the number of stations on our network and the trend of more frequent charging at public stations, as well as the accelerated development of new e-car registrations,” said the head of the Clean Unit technology ČEZ Tomáš Chmelík.
Other big players, such as PRE and E.ON, Tesla electric car maker, but also Bill and Lidl supermarkets, are also reporting their part on the market.
In turn, the operator of classic petrol stations is represented by MOL.
But she doesn't have numbers yet.
“We started building our electric mobility network only last year,” explained Jana Jusková, a spokeswoman for the firm.
However, the editorial staff of the Diary exclusively obtained data from all 216 electric stands operated by CEZ.
It follows that drivers took an average of 13.5 kWh from stations.
This corresponds to the range of roughly a hundred kilometers of a smaller electric car.
If small pumping up to 1 kWh, the average charge takes two and a half hours.
The vast majority of refueling then took place in a free tariff.
If motorists were already paying for the take-out, their typical spans were around 330 kronor.
Electric mobility stretches primarily in the capital.
All five of ČEZ's most busiest rechargers are located on the territory of Prague, which are overshadowed by all regional cities.
Between the regions, Olomouc leads.
On the contrary, the least interest is in remote stations in the borderlands, such as in Bohumin or Prachatice, which often remain unused throughout the day.
More than four thousand electric cars are currently registered in the Czech Republic.
For this year's first half alone, 1274 new e-cars added.
In a wide-ranging poll by Diary “Czechs on the Move,” eight percent of readers said they were considering buying an electric car into the family.
Only a third of respondents, however, know where to look for the nearest charging station in their area.
Not just for better water retention.
In Prague, environmental activists protested
According to the organizers, the government's actions to date on the protection and healing of the Czech landscape and the resolution of the climate crisis are insufficient, the speakers called on the state to take a more vigorous approach.
The event, titled The Last Drop, was attended by representatives of major organisations such as the Rainbow Movement, Greenpeace or the Green Party, as well as smaller local associations.
“We have people here, for example, who have been speaking out against the expansion on the Turów mine for a long time, there are people who are speaking out against gravel mining near Uherský Ostroh, there are people who stand out against the construction of senseless dams,” Marika Volf said behind the organizers.
It stated that the protesters' main demands were the creation of a plan for water retention in the landscape, a sharp change in agricultural policy and the subsidy system towards promoting sustainable agriculture; and as fast as possible transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.
“The government is supposed to defend the interests of the people, not a reckless and devastating business,” she said.
A stand was placed in the Malostransky Square with a petition calling on the leaders of the Czech state to push for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and restoring Czech soil and landscape.
People present were equipped with banners with slogans such as “End of rapeseed depletion” or “Less coal, more newts.”
Jan Škoda came from South Moravia to Prague from the company Za water for people, protesting against the gravel mining plan in Hodonínsk.
“It threatens the source of drinking water for 140,000 people,” he said.
He added that wells represent the fifth most hearty source of drinking water in the Czech Republic.
The planned gravel mining operation, according to him, is only about 500 metres from the wells and, according to reports, it is certain that water quality will be compromised.
The so-called agroecological farmers came from the village of Valeč in Karlovy Vary Vojtěch Veselý.
He drew attention to the pros of small farms that don't get behind yields and profit, supplying residents on site.
“Small agro-organic farms are capable of feeding the whole population completely normally, in doing so they do not put such destruction on the form of the countryside and the environment,” he said.
Three people died in plane crash on house in Germany
Three people died in the fall of an ultralight plane on an apartment block in western Germany today and two others were injured.
They informed local emergency forces about this, according to which two crew members and one resident of the house are believed to be among the dead.
The aircraft crashed onto the roof of a building in the town of Wesel in North Rhine-Westphalia.
The penthouse, which was one of five housing units in the house, subsequently engulfed the fire.
Firefighters have already managed to bring the flames under control.
Local Fire Department Deputy Chief Robert Meyboom disclosed that apparently both members of the aircraft crew had died.
The third victim, according to police, is a woman who lived in the house.
Citing the mayor of Wesel, the Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ) newspaper wrote that it was a single mother whose two-year-old daughter was rescued from the flat with light injuries.
An emergency parachute was found near the accident, which apparently served as a brake on landing.
Police are based on the fact that it came from a crashed plane.
There was room for two people in the aeroplane.
The machine kicked off from the airport in the nearby town of Marl.
Citing eyewitnesses, the Rheinische Post newspaper said that before crashing, the plane collided with a hot air balloon.
However, this information has not yet been confirmed.
WAZ, citing other witnesses, wrote that the aircraft disintegrated in mid-air before impacting the ground.
The Czech savings bank erroneously charged some card payments twice on Saturday.
Already removed the error
The Czech Savings Bank erroneously charged some card payments twice on Saturday afternoon.
According to the bank's spokesman, Lukas Kropík, the problem could have covered thousands of transactions.
The error has already been eliminated by the savings bank and returned the money to clients.
Problems with the double billing of card payments the savings bank noted on Saturday afternoon.
'We still made an update to the system yesterday (Saturday) night and returned all these double payments to clients immediately.
At the moment everything is working without problems,” Kropík told the news on Sunday afternoon.
The exact number of clients to whom the bank has deducted money from card payments twice, a bank spokesman does not know, in his estimation it was lower thousands of transactions.
The causes of problems the savings bank is finding out.
“It could have been a combination of multiple factors,” Kropík said.
Česká spořitelna is the largest bank in the Czech Republic by number of clients.
It had 4.6 million of them at the end of March.
The owner of the savings bank is the Austrian financial group Erste Group Bank, which is a key player in the central and eastern European banking market.
Vojtěch on Monday will present a system of three emergency stages against coronavirus
“Degrees will be region-level according to the strength of community spread.
We work on this together with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics,” Vojtěch said in CT.
It will be a so-called traffic light, individual regions will be marked green, orange or red according to the risk of coronavirus.
The minister added that he would still talk to epidemiologists about the inclusion of individual counties.
He accepted that only the Moravian-Silesian Region would currently have the orange colour and Prague would be close to it.
The map will also include individual arrangements for county sanitation stations, hospitals, social facilities and employers.
“We want to address this at the level of the regions, because the situation in them is not one-centered,” Vojtěch said.
Vodník and Carolingka
When the waterman Jonah and the miller's daughter Carolingka look into each other, they don't have it easy at all.
Jonah is defended in love by his father, the unrefined waterman Hastrbuch. Carolingia has no idea that her dear Jonah is not human.
Well, there's a Libor guy who'll do everything he can to protect the whole village, and especially Carolingka, from the watershed villain.
What about him scheming and lying?
Especially when he can make Carolingia dismiss Jonah and prefer him, the burly Libor.
Before long, it is clear to everyone in the village who is responsible for the drowning of the slipping Konvika, the spoiled flour, the fire of the mill and other lotrovina.
The villagers arrange a hunt for the waterman, and in order to do so, the irreconcilable water curse falls on Jonah's head.
Now advise Konviček's soul to Carolingian!
How to soften the old Hastrbuch, convince the neighbors of Jonah's innocence, find Jonah and deliver him from the incantation?
The fairy tale was filmed in September 2010 in ČT studios and in exteriors near Brzina pond, in Obděnice in Sedlčansk and in the beautiful surroundings of a historic mill in Hoslovice.

The course of the disease of the majority is mild, only three per cent of the infected
Either a milder form of coronavirus is spreading through the Czech Republic, or the summer dose of sunshine has greatly improved our immunity.
Infection wards of hospitals are half-empty, though numbers of those infected are rising.
“That situation today and in April is quite different and it's mainly due to the number of hospitalized,” confirms Health Minister Adam Vojtěch.
It is worth remembering that on April 11, when the first wave of the epidemic peaked, all the guise was worn by the army, the republic was closed, and the Czechs consumed disinfection for a year forward.
Yet ten people a day were dying.
Now the daily increases in the number of infected are higher, but every day with covid-19 a maximum of two people die.
Karvinsko still has the highest number of infected per population, Jihlava already has similar numbers due to the outbreak at the local Alzheimer's Centre, where 57 are already infected - 40 clients and 17 employees.
Another home for the elderly was closed by hygienics in Chernožice in Královéhradeck.
The disease was confirmed by tests in one of the nurse practitioners.
“We are routing, we have restricted movement, we have all the hygiene measures,” says the director of the retirement home, Martin Scháněl.
According to him, none of the home's clients have symptoms of illness yet.
Area testing will begin to be carried out by hygienists tomorrow, and then decide on the next measure.
Hospitals also respond to the increased number of infected.
The Institute of Oncology in Brno today launched an automatic camera system at the entrance, which can tell if people have a cloth on their entry.
The record is reported by South Bohemian hygienists, who have recorded twenty-five cases of coronavirus - most of them being foreign employees of the prachatice company.
Overall, 131 infected - half of Friday's number - over the weekend, added for Saturday, but fewer are tested.
Debutant champion!
Van den Bergh finished fairytale, swept Anderson away
The great surprise of the tournament named Dimitri van den Bergh gave an excellent performance even in a duel with the player that the second most prestigious enterprise within the PDC won in 2018.
The opening of the match was two-sided, the break coming at 8:7 status for the Belgian dart.
Van den Bergh took his shot with a 13-dart legem and has had the upper hand ever since.
He was literally crushing his opponent with his game, and the significantly more experienced “Flying Scotsman” was just hard to get to the doubles.
The way “Dreammaker” had it in a handful is evidenced by the fact that the dismembered Anderson played his first maximum in the 24th Leg.
Plus, the young Belgian handled superbly high checkouts.
Last time he lost in the eleventh lego, but he “caught a big fish” and closed 170.
There was huge frustration to see on Anderson at the conclusion of the match.
He was rather just throwing the darts away, and his behind the triumph the striding opponent was perfectly sovereign.
Van den Bergh turned into the very first of three match darts and lived up to his name - he wrote his big dream.
The gain of a trophy named after Phil Taylor makes it all the more valuable to the Belgian darter that this is his first major won.
It continues to be the case that the last player who was able to defeat van den Bergh is Karel Sedlacek.
Charges fell over cathedral fire in Nantes, man confessed
The Cathedral of St Peter and Paul in the heart of Nantes started burning last Saturday and the fire severely damaged the original 16th-century stained glass windows and destroyed the organ.
Suspected arson investigators were looking into due to the fire advancing through the temple from three different locations.
At the same time, police found no signs at the entrances that anyone had reached the cathedral by force.
The accused is a volunteer with the local diocese, a 33-year-old Rwandan refugee.
Police arrested him already shortly after the fire, but then released him without initiating a criminal prosecution.
Now the prosecutor's office has informed that, based on new evidence, the man was arrested again on Saturday, confessed and faces arson charges.
He faces up to ten years in prison and a high fine if he is found guilty.
According to his attorney, the man regrets the act and has decided to cooperate fully with investigators, Le Monde wrote.
Vojtěch: On Monday we will introduce a “traffic light” for epidemiological measures
The new system is meant to fulfil the role of a pandemic plan, due to whose absence, the government and the Department of Health have faced criticism.
“Degrees will be according to the strength of community spread,” the minister explained.
He added that at present, for example, the Moravian-Silesian Region or Prague would reach a middle, orange degree.
The system is designed as regional because the situation from county to county varies significantly, he added.
On the system, the ministry cooperated with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (ÚZIS).
According to the Minister, specific measures will be linked to the individual grades, whether it is the obligation to wear the guise or the organisation of special departments in hospitals.
To create an epidemiological plan on Prima Partie TV, Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) called on the basis of which people should have clear information about what measures they can expect, if the epidemiological situation worsens.
The daily increase in confirmed cases in the Czech Republic has grown in recent days, although the number of hospitalized remains low.
Vojtěch commented on this by saying that nothing major happening is in place to talk about declaring a state of emergency or reconvening a crisis staff.
In view of the growing number of infected since Saturday across the Czech Republic, the government has again introduced a duty to wear guise at indoor events above 100 people.
From Monday the capacity of these events will be limited to 500 people, now totalling 1,000 people.
The government's procedure, when it was unclear until the last moment what measures and when they would start to apply or when they would be announced, has come to criticism.
“I think that in a situation that is quite tense, the main officials should create, on the contrary, a sense of certainty and straighten the confusion out on the contrary,” Senator Marek Hilšer said in Questions.
Measures may already vary by region, for example in Prague since Sunday the obligation to wear guise even in non-residential medical institutions, such as pharmacies or waiting rooms at the doctor.
The obligation to wear the guise when visiting health and social facilities or pharmacies have also been established in the Liberec and Ústí Region since Friday.
In Vysočina Jihlavsk, it is necessary to wear guises in indoor public areas, public transport and medical facilities from 14 July.
Conversely, in the Moravian-Silesian Region, anti-epidemic measures relaxed, as in the Central Bohemian Region of Kutnohorsk.
In early June, the Czech Government also approved a so-called traffic light for Europe, which colourfully distinguishes the level of disease risk in individual European countries and adjusts the rules to enter the Czech Republic from these countries.
For low- and medium-risk countries, authorities do not require a negative test for coronavirus or quarantine instead of Czech citizens from June 15.
These are mandatory when returning Czechs from high-risk countries.
For the moment, all EU member countries are now in the low-risk category of contagion.
Technoparty in Benešovsk continues.
Playing at one-third capacity, finish was due at noon
Hlaváčkova Lhota (Benešovsko) Technoparty near Hlaváčkovy Lhota in Benešovsk continues on Sunday evening.
A third of the original 12 music systems still play.
According to evening estimates by police, about 500 people remain here after 8 p.m., the original rough estimates spoke of three hundred, in the morning they were at 900, said police spokeswoman Lucie Novákova.
Originally, the technoparty was supposed to end at noon on Sunday, at which time a part of the music systems had gone silent.
“Some have already left and others are about to depart.
Music production partly still lasts.
We expect that there will be gradually disconnection and dismantling of music systems,” Novákova said.
'Police officers still consistently check departing visitors in order to prevent drivers from driving while intoxicated or substance.
Drivers have the opportunity to submit to a preventive breath test before leaving,” she added.
Dozens of police officers oversee the event, foreign police, traffic and order police are on the scene, and handlers with service dogs are also on standby.
'During today police officers have checked 470 people moving at the venue and 485 vehicles, 270 drivers have been subjected to a breath test, six of which got behind the wheel under the influence alcohol,” Nováková said.
A total of 95 drivers were tested by police officers for the presence of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, of which one was positive.
Police officers dealt with 14 traffic offences as well.
At the request of technoparty participants, police officers conducted 300 preventive breath tests and four preventive tests for the presence of narcotic drugs and psychotropic agents.
About 2,000 people were at the event on Saturday morning.
If the number of participants did not decrease, the police would intervene there.
On the Prima Partie TV show, Interior Minister Jan Hamacek (ČSSD) said it.
But the number of participants fell below 1000, the police so assessed that there was no need for intervention, and neither was requested by the sanitation station or the health ministry.
Czech Television (ČT) said on Sunday that technoparty had spread to surrounding land, whose owners did not agree to use for technoparties.
It is possible that the owners of surrounding land will claim damages.
Techno supporters at the meadow near Hlaváčkovy Lhota arrived on Friday night.
Police initially guarded a meadow in Blažimi, Benešovsk, on Friday, where the technoparty took place last year.
Blažim is located roughly 30 kilometers from Hlaváčko Lhota, where the technars eventually went down.
According to Nováková, no one came to Blažimi.
Viper bites: Little girl ended up in hospital!
“The first case of this year was recorded in Železnorudsk.
The adder had smitten a girl in the leg, 2010, who had been imported by her parents to the emergency services base there,” Mária Svobodová, a regional spokeswoman for the medical emergency service, told the newspaper. that the child was then transferred to a hospital in Klatovy.
Viper is the only venomous snake in the Czech Republic, and it is on Šumava that these animals occur in higher numbers, so it is good to watch out for walks.
But there is no great danger from these animals.
The chance of a viper being smitched is not very high, with normal contact it itself is afraid.
And if she has room to do that, she likes to crawl away for a loud hiss.
She will only attack if she feels threatened a lot - such as if you accidentally step on her.
Nor is her bites a tragedy, although its venom is very effective against small mammals, but it will not kill humans.
This can only happen if a person has a particularly weakened organism, or suffers from an allergy.
Thus, the risk of danger is primarily among children, seniors and allergy sufferers.
“A person often feels vomiting after biting, sweats, has an elevated temperature, thirst, abdominal pain and diarrhea, weakened individuals and especially allergists may experience anaphylactic shock,” described for Diary by Miriam Gredová from Klatov Hospital.
The man threatened to throw the infant out the window.

Once he even climbed himself on the window sill, where he crowed.
Police are continuing to investigate the man.
He does not want to disclose further information yet.

Sapa Market: Raid revealed meat, fish and eggs of unknown origin
“One of the vehicles entering the premises was carrying 1320 pieces of quail eggs of unknown origin, in addition, in unsuitable conditions.
Also, these eggs will be disposed of at the resanation enterprise,” the State Veterinary Administration said.
When inspecting the live fish stall, it was then found that the vendor did not have evidence of the origin of the goods and was not registered for the sale of live fish.
The market is considered a problem from a veterinary perspective for the long term.
Last fall, for example, vets uncovered an illegal food store in it, it had nearly half a ton of unmarked food undocumented origin.
For most, the date of consumption could not be found, part of the products had an expired shelf life and was spoiled.
For five kilograms of sepia, the shelf life date was exceeded by three years.
Last May, vets with police officers on the grounds of the market hall detained 80 kilograms of food without documents of origin, among other dried fish, squid or frozen duck, with part of it moldy.
Putin on phone with Zelensky before ceasefire begins in Donbass, Kremlin criticizes planned elections
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke by telephone with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky about the situation in the Donbass region, where a new ceasefire is due to begin to apply from midnight.
Putin, according to a statement from the Kremlin, criticized, among other things, the Ukrainian parliament's decision to hold local elections; Kiev informed that Zelenskyi had called for the release of detained Ukrainians.
The new arms lull was agreed on Wednesday night by negotiators of Ukraine and Russia, backed by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
The ceasefire is due to begin after midnight on Monday night, is meant to be “complete and general” and is intended to open the way for meeting other provisions of the peace accords.
Putin said in an interview to Zelensky that the Ukrainian parliament's decision to hold local elections contradicted the Minsk peace agreement and threatens the prospect of settling the conflict in Ukraine's east.
Ukraine's parliament decided last week that forthcoming elections for local councils would not take place in territory controlled by pro-Russian rebels.
The Minsk agreement envisages Kiev bringing back under control the border of Ukrainian separatist-occupied lands with Russia after giving these regions broad autonomy and arranging local election.
Zelensky's office said, according to the Unian agency, that the two statesmen agreed on the benefit of the forthcoming ceasefire in the Donbass region as well as the need to implement further measures to promote peace in the region such as de-mining areas of combat or withdrawing part of units from the front.
Zelenskyi also called on Putin for the release of Ukrainians detained in Ukraine's east, in the occupied peninsula of Crimea, as well as in Russia itself.
The Minsk agreement helped stop the fighting, but people are further dying on both sides of the front in occasional firefights and artillery attacks.
The conflict in Donbass has claimed over 14,000 dead since spring 2014.
Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of militarily supporting the separatists, which Moscow denies.
Zelenskyj has made ending the war in Donbass his priority, a more fundamental breakthrough in negotiations but has not yet occurred.
An unexpected champion in the decathlon is Rykl, sevens champion was dominated by Novotná
Defending champion of the last two titles Doležal did not run a four-hundred at the conclusion of Saturday's program, Kopecký did not jump foundation in pole on Sunday.
The decathlon was long ruled by Latvian representative Reinis Kregers, who prepares in the group of coach Josef Karas, but resigned after the disc.
Rykl has had two bronze medals from the outdoor MCR so far, this time being the only decathlete to make it over the seven-thousandth boundary.
Other medals behind him were won by Vilém Stráský and Petr Urbánek.
Rykl recalled the absence of both Adam Sebastian Helcelet and Jiří Sýkora after the competition.
“Too bad the boys weren't here and Kope didn't set up because that would make those results look completely different.
But the title tastes very good, I especially appreciate the fact that I put a person 30 centimeters in the distance.
Then I was still pleased by the pole and I was most disappointed about the disc, there I was below average,” he acknowledged on union facebook.
On the first day of the sevens, Kateřina Cachová won with more than a hundred-point superiority despite being tormented by an injured ankle on the rebound leg.
However, she entered only 570 cm in the distance sector, did not throw 40 metres in the javelin and did not enter the final eight.
Novotná collected 5878 points and won by 241 points ahead of Kateřina Dvořáková.
Her distance came out, 631 cm is the best Czech performance of the year.
“I really wished it was around those 630.
Yesterday my calf started pulling, but I'm very glad I didn't feel it at all and that it didn't limit me at all,” Novotná said on union facebook.
Organic LPG arrived in Czech Republic, promises eco-operation
Liquefied petroleum gas, abbreviated LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas), is a very well-known alternative fuel in the Czech Republic.
In particular, it is popular for its fundamentally lower price versus gasoline or diesel, given by a significantly lower excise tax, but its benefit is also in lower CO2 emissions per kilometre travelled.
Like gasoline and diesel, it has its environmentally friendly option - “bio LPG.”
But it is quite a novelty - it first appeared on the European market before last year and arrived in the Czech Republic according to a press release from the Czech LPG Association a few days ago.
“In these days, we received the first fifteen tons of bio LPG, which, mixed with classical fossil LPG, will be distributed to our gas stations,” the association of Jiří Karlík quotes from the company Primagas.
However, bio LPG cannot be taken as bioethanol or biodiesel.
According to the association, the chemical side is identical to the classic oil LPG, which a number of motorists are refueling into their cars now.
Therefore, it is also possible to mix both versions arbitrarily.
“The only difference over the classic LPG is the method of production,” Ivan Indráček, chairman of the association, says of the bio LPG.
This means one of the great advantages of organic LPG over other alternative fuels.
It is easy to transport and store, and also the distribution infrastructure is quite good, e.g. compared to hydrogen or electricity.
Currently, this gas is obtained as a byproduct in the production of bioethanol from food residues and sugarcane.
In the future, it should also be purposefully produced, e.g. from cellulosic biomass, i.e. wood waste.
In contrast, classic petroleum LPG arises partly as a byproduct in oil refining, partly by separation in natural gas extraction.
As a result, depending on the technology of production and source, the operation of the car on bio LPG is 40 -70% more environmentally friendly in terms of carbon footprint than the operation on petroleum LPG and up to 90% compared to diesel.
But it is not about CO2 emissions from car exhaust, but about the ecology of fuel production, hence the so-called “well-to-tank” part (Czech “from source to tank”).
Some of the largest organic LPG producers currently include petrochemicals firms Eni, Total and Neste.
According to a recent update of the National Clean Mobility Action Plan (NAP ČM), Unipetrol is exploring the possibility of production in its Litvinov refinery.
According to estimates of the association in the Czech Republic, about 170 thousand vehicles run on LPG; the Ministry of Environment reports a slightly higher figure in NAP ČM, roughly 200 thousand.
According to statistics from the Department of Transportation, nearly 6 thousand LPG-powered car rebuilds were carried out last year alone.
It is possible to refuel LPG in the Czech Republic at about 950 stations of different operators.
Vojtěch revised the numbers of infected, the number fell by 1775 cases
Health Minister Adam Vojtěch (for ANO) ordered the Ministry to revise the numbers infected with the coronavirus virus.
The new statistics were published on Sunday by the Health Ministry on its site.
The number on Sunday afternoon fell from Saturday's 5254 to 3479 cases, about 1775 fewer infected.
Thus, there are currently 3422 sick people in the Czech Republic.
“Behind the jump increase in the number of cured is a data review, which recently hygienists have not prosecuted to update,” said Jaroslav Dušek, the head of health statistics.
By Sunday afternoon, 15,212 people had become infected with coronavirus in the Czech Republic, 11,419 had healed and 371 had sadly succumbed to Covid-19 diseases.
Mobile polling units or correspondence choice.
Political scientist and sociologist sought variants for pandemic era
In order to allow even people quarantined for coronavirus to vote in October's regional and senate elections, according to Vice Premier and Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (CSSD), a change in the law is needed.
Parliament could discuss it in August or September in an accelerated regime.
He stated this on Sunday on Partii television Prima.
On Tuesday, he wants to discuss possible solutions in the ministry with representatives of parliamentary parties.
“Whatever we do, this will have to mean a change in the electoral law,” Hamacek said.
The Senate on Wednesday urged the government to find a solution within applicable statutory rules.
But the minister said there would be a need to adjust the provisions of the law, under which people quarantined because of a medical condition cannot vote.
The ban on voting should remain maintained, for example, for patients with open tuberculosis.
Daniel Prokop said on the OVM programme that the possibility of a correspondence choice has been postponed since 2004.
Even the current bill, which is in the House, then envisages its introduction for voting abroad, but not in the Czech Republic.
At the same time, Prokop considers the concerns of the correspondence or of the Czech Republic (because it would rather record other types of parties, according to experience abroad) to be overstated.
Personally, he is then opposed to the possibility of electronic voting, where there is considerable possibility of abuse.
Michal Klíma said that now there is an ad hoc need to devise mechanisms (elections) that could be carried out already this year and with as little health risk as possible.
He then considers the main one to be ready for 2021, when parliamentary elections are due to be held in the Czech Republic.
He considers correspondence choice (whether abroad or also in the Czech Republic) as one of the functional methods.
They see the already mentioned electoral units or, for example, the possibility of proxy voting within the family.
He added that there was a chance to learn how similar situations - elections at the time of coronavirus - they handled in Croatia, Poland or France.
Due to the spread of coronavirus disease, various types of elections in 67 countries have already been postponed this year.
Buharsk protests: Pig ears thrown at government building by protesters
Participants in a demonstration against Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov and his cabinet threw pig ears on the government building.
It was another in a series of protests against “mafia-style governance” that have been taking place in Sofia and other cities for nearly three weeks.
Organizers are planning a nationwide blockade for Wednesday, the DPA agency said.
Today's protest, which took place for the 18th consecutive day, had a weaker turnout than the previous one, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Freedom station.
As of 8 p.m., roughly 300 people had gathered; some streets had to be closed to traffic.
Protesters outside the government building played down a theatrical scene in which they symbolically locked into both Prime Minister Borisov's prison cell and Prosecutor General Ivan Geshev in connection with the arrest of two advisers to President Rumen Radev, who is a strong political opponent of the Prime Minister.
The resignations of both are among the protesters' basic demands.
They also demanded the repeal of announced health reform and the end of corruption in construction on the Black Sea coast.
Protest organizer Nikolai Hajigenov said on public radio today that a “peak of escalation” in the form of a “nationwide manifestation in Sofia and blockades across the country” was going for Wednesday.
He reiterated the demand for the resignation of Borisov and his government, as well as the write-out of early elections.
The proper ones should take place in March 2021.
Borisov has previously disclosed that he does not intend to step down.
He justified this, among other things, by the necessity of implementing Bulgaria with the covidu-19 pandemic and the resulting economic crisis.
But he swapped five members of his government team on Friday, though the concession did not appease the protesters.
Earlier this week, Borisov's government stopped a confidence vote in parliament in parliament.
Bologna coach Mihajlovich no longer wants matches without spectators
Bologna footballers coach Siniša Mihajlovich already has enough Italian league games without spectators.
The Serbian coach hopes that from the new season, fans will return to the stadiums.
“What we're running here at the moment is not football.
I'm already full match-teeth with no spectators.
It's genderless football, it brings me no emotion, no joy.
Those fights are worse than training.
Playing like that is terrible and I think I'm not the only one who thinks that,” Mihajlovic stated ahead of tonight's match against Lecce.
The coronavirus pause is followed by Série A matches in quick succession, and although they are not played until the evening, their actors are exposed to heat.
“We play every three days in terrible heat.
In conditions like that, he doesn't even know how teams are.
So this season is over.
These measures had to be approached in order to finish the competition, but I hope that from September the fans will be back,” said the coach, who has managed Fiorentina or AC Milan in the past.
For Mihajlovich, this season is extraordinary even because he missed four months on the bench because of leukemia treatment.
“Despite my illness, league interruption and everything else, our team managed to move a level higher.
We want to keep growing and to do that we need the players to be mentally stronger,” he said.
We have become targets of cyberattack by foreign states, Iran claims
Since late June, fires and explosions have been reported from a number of Iranian military, industrial and nuclear facilities, as well as oil refineries, power plants, fabrics and businesses.
Some Iranian officials said a fire that erupted earlier this month in the Natanz underground nuclear operation may have caused cyber sabotage.
The cause of a number of other incidents has not yet been explained.
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Musavi told reporters, according to Iranian media, that the Islamic Republic's infrastructure faces “thousands of cyber attacks” daily.
He added that it is not a new phenomenon and that most of it will succeed in fending off.
Several wider cyberattacks have been recorded in the past months, according to Musavi, behind which “certain governments and groups,” according to analyses.
However, he did not share closer details of possible offenders, according to Reuters.
Muáví also added that fires in forests, refineries and other places are frequent during the summer.
An article this month by Iran's state agency IRNA discussed that enemies of Iran, like Israel and the US, may have been behind recent incidents.
But neither of those countries was accused directly of the specific attacks in the article.
Iran and the United States cut off diplomatic relations shortly after the 1979 revolution when Iranian militant students stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held hostage for 444 days 52 Americans.
Long-tense relations between the two countries sharpened in 2018 after Washington withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers and imposed sanctions on Iran, that have a hard impact on its economy.
Another major escalation came this year after the U.S. military killed Iranian General Qasem Soleimani and a member of Abu Mahdi Muhandis, an Iraqi militia leadership member.
Iran then fired scores of missiles at bases in Iraq, where the Americans operate, on January 8.
The US only acknowledged with the stand-off that dozens of US troops had been wounded.
Israel regards Iran as its archenemy, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is the main opponent of the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran.
According to the Israeli prime minister, Iran is trying to develop an atomic bomb, which Iran denies.
Automaker TPCA extended production shutdown, now until May 25
Cologne carmaker Toyota Peugeot Citroën Automobile (TPCA) has extended production shutdown again due to coronavirus.
Production lines are expected to restart on Monday, May 25 in the morning.
The raid will accompany dozens of sanitary measures, said Tomas Paroubek, a spokesman for the automaker.
Production stands due to the coronavirus pandemic from the evening of March 18.
Originally, the firm intended to restore it on Monday, May 18.
According to Paroubko, the reason for the extension of the shutdown is closed borders and closed dealerships, so he has no one to sell cars.
According to Paroubko, the company will produce at 100 percent from the start, that is, two shifts.
Koronavirus is the firm's key markets affected, such as Italy, the UK or Spain.
Mayor Michael Kašpar (Change for Cologne) said the production shutdown at TPCA was not signing off on life in the city.
“In the beginning it was to know, it was empty in the city.
But gradually, the streets are filling up, especially now from Monday, when it's unleashed a lot.
So the city is full,” Kašpar said.
According to him, there are no complications even with foreign workers who stayed in hostels.
“We didn't have to address almost any problem in those two months,” Kašpar said.
For example, Mědoboleslav Škoda Auto, which also discontinued production due to the coronavirus crisis, resumed it on Monday 27 April at all three of its production facilities in the Czech Republic.
Neither plant operates at 100 per cent capacity.
The resumption of production in Škoda was accompanied by more than 80 sanitary measures.
On the night of Monday to Tuesday, a third, i.e. night shift, was held in Mladá Boleslav and Kvasiny for the first time after the resumption of production.
About 2500 people currently work in TPCA, and the company represents one of the largest exporters in the Czech Republic and an employer in Cologne.
Cancer killed bride shortly after wedding: She left message to family
For more than two years she battled Gemma Sisson's insidious cancer, and when she already seemed to have beaten the cancer, the disease heard back again.
A 33-year-old woman who loved bodybuilding eventually ended up on a bed in a hospice where she was still enough to marry her life's love.
Unfortunately, the disease succumbed.
A few hours after the death, a shocking message appeared on her social network facebook account for those closest to her.
Hailing from Leeds, England, Gemma Sisson loved bodybuilding.
She and boyfriend Ricky Moore, with whom she lived for more than 16 years, toured competitions taking place around the world.
The 33-year-old woman sported and lived healthy, yet she was diagnosed with cancer in April in 2018.
Gemma began gruelling treatment, radiotherapy, in the hope of healing herself.
After months of treatment, it really seemed that Gemma had managed to win over cancer, but in August 2019, the cancer returned and this time attacked her spine.
The bodybuilder and personal trainer, according to information from Britain's Daily Mirror newspaper, underwent a ten-hour spinal operation and afterwards began drastic treatment again.
But everything was in vain.
Earlier this year, on her 31st birthday, doctors notified her that she had a few months left to live.
In April, the eventually handsome blonde decided to board a hospice in Leeds, where she was visited every now and then by her family, who even arranged her wedding to her love Ricky.
The marriage lasted two months.
Ricky took Gemma to the restaurant for the last time on their two-month anniversary.
Four days later, Gemma died in his arms.
Just hours after the deaths, a post Gema had written for her family appeared on her social network account.
“If this has been published, it means that I have finally died after weeks of fighting too long.
Although I will be heartbroken to leave my loved ones here, I will be so glad to get rid of what this terrible illness has caused me.
I cannot thank Ricky enough, who has been by my side throughout and given me a huge amount of love and support during that terrible time,” she wrote on the social network, saying pain and suffering finally stopped and she found peace.
“I am also grateful for all the support I have received from all my watching on the social network,” she wrote, saying everyone should value their life and live it to the fullest.
Art machines sell sweat dating, mushroom and pexeso amulet
For one hundred crowns, a passer-by gets a pocket work of mostly budding Czech artists.
Images and other creation create directly for artmat, so they know that they must fit in size 8.5 by 5.5 centimeters.
Each piece is numbered and signed.
“There is always a curatorial text about the artist and then the work itself,” stated the project's curator Petra Widžová.
Artmat works with the principle of chance.
Thus, the buyer can let himself be surprised at what artwork he acquires.
Currently, perhaps the new owner of fantasy illustrations by Alexandra Štoplová or mini-views by Tereza Bonaventurova, which can also be sent.
Artist Punx 23 in collaboration with Dora Dutková prepared a pexeso associated with a walk through Prague.
The cards need to be paired with home signs.
Ilona Polanski created a collection of tattoos for Artmat.
Marie Ladrová and Juliána Chomová sell pocket-packs of spirituality: the first of the women artists offers a protective amulet of troudnatice and oracle cards, the second a series of illustrations based on her comic book Spiritists.
Healthcare salaries will rise by a maximum of five per cent next year.
The larger increase is unrealistic according to Vojtěch
Salaries in health care could rise by no more than five percent next year, Health Minister Adam Vojtěch said (for Václav Moravec's Questions on Czech Television.
He considers unionists' demand for increases of up to 15 per cent unrealistic.
He also said the state should strive to be self-sufficient in providing protective equipment.
Hospitals, he says, now have their supplies.
“I do think the increase (in salaries) may be somewhere within five per cent,” the minister stated.
According to him, the current situation has to be reflected, where coronavirus pandemic selection and government regulations against its spread have intervened since March.
Insurance companies' incomes fell at the time.
“By 15 percent, I find the increase unrealistic at the moment,” Vojtěch said.
The average monthly earnings of a doctor in acute inpatient care according to data from the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (UZIS) is likely to reach 88,312 crore this year, nurses 47,498 crore.
The difference between the salary of nurses in state hospitals and that of other constituents will be up to seven thousand crowns.
The UZIS data also shows that the decline of nurses in hospitals has stopped.
The average wage in the Czech Republic was 34,125 crore in 2019, according to data from the Czech Statistical Office.
Trade unionist representatives had already indicated in June that for 2021 they would call for a minimum increase of ten per cent, ideally 15 per cent.
They criticize the long-standing significant difference between the earnings of doctors and nurses in state hospitals, which must follow pay tables, and contractual wages in hospitals of cities, counties or private.
They therefore also demand that pay tables be uniform for paramedics.
For nurses this year, the difference will be up to seven thousand crowns per month.
For example, for doctors last year, wages grew faster than salaries.
According to the president of the Czech Dental Chamber Roman Šmucler, trade unionists should see how the state is at present.
The House recently, due to the effects of the covid epidemic, approved an increase in this year's state budget deficit to a record 500 billion kronor, of which 1.75 billion is to go to the remuneration of health professionals in hospitals and social services.
According to Shmucler, the Council of Healthcare Providers does not agree with next year's flat pay increases.
According to him, remuneration should be decided by hospitals and medical facilities themselves, and the extra money should go to them via the reimbursement decree.
Vojtěch also stated that hospitals currently have enough protective equipment.
The chairman of the State Tangible Reserves Administration (SSHR), Pavel Brother-in-law, said this week that the administration does not have a single protective health aid in the property at the moment.
Waiting for the finalization of tenders.
According to Vojtěch, suppliers in the world are now able to deliver goods better than they were in March when they were bought out.
According to him, the state should try to be as self-sufficient as possible and buy from Czech companies as well.
Scrubbing a smart quarantine could be taken over by soldiers.
We are ready, they message
“Clever quarantine works is what to improve of course.
We're going to discuss this tonight with the military.
The military is working perfectly and there is a question if again they should not manage the whole thing,” the Prime Minister said on Sunday in his Facebook show Hi People.
According to him, IT systems and sanitation stations are failing to adequately connect, which gradually have to switch to more modern methods of operation.
The problems were, according to the prime minister, in the Moravian-Silesian region, where there are some of the current outbreaks of the epidemic.
Ministry of Defence spokesman Jan Pejšek said for ČTK that he did not have information about Sunday's negotiations and that the government should discuss the matter on Monday.
The military is ready for this step, according to him.
The smart quarantine project was taken over by the Department of Health on May 25.
Until then, the shrewd quarantine was led by a 90-member central management team set up under the army as an advisory body to the government, which was led by the minister's former deputy Roman Prymula.
The scrubbing project was criticised on Sunday by Interior Minister Jan Hamacek (ČSSD).
He, too, stated that the army might take it again.
The shortcomings in the project were previously admitted by the government's IT and digitisation agent Vladimir Dzurilla, who is in charge of it.
“The system works, but it's still being worked on.
Twenty years it was created separately and non-systemically, now within a couple of months we're trying to unite it.
It doesn't go nozzle.
People on the march, the poor people on the sanitation march adapt those new systems and take actually the bugs,” he stated.
Ostrava Mayor Macura won't run again, because he doesn't want to “go crazy in politics”
Ostrava's current mayor, Tomas Macura, will not stand in the next local elections.
The reason is to try “not to go mad at politics,” he told the Respect.cz server.
Macura, who is also a member of the Bureau of the ANO movement, has been Mayor of Ostrava since November 2014.
In the 2018 municipal elections, the candidate of the ANO movement in Ostrava won almost a third of the electoral votes.
Macura wanted originally to be in office for only four years.
“I was like, I'm going to last one term and with that business experience, I can roll everything over here in that time and get it on my feet,” he told Respect.
He added that for a second term he had let himself be talked down to some extent.
“But for me, it's the maximum.
I don't want to jerk about that politics,” added Macura, who in an interview referred to himself as a heavy introvert who doesn't suit frequent contact with people.
According to Respect, there has been speculation about Macur's possible end in the ANO movement for a long time.
The server recalls that Macura criticized the ANO movement several times, such as for alliances with the SPD movement or for supporting Milos Zeman in the presidential election.
As one of the few figures, ANO supported Zeman's anti-candidate Jiří Drahoš in the election.
From the YES movement, which he joined in 2017, Macura does not plan to leave.
“As long as I feel like I can make a difference in the movement, that it's not a completely futile fight and that no one is camfing into it, I have no immediate motive to end,” he told Respect.
The 6-year-old Macura graduated from the University of Economics in Prague.
Before becoming Mayor of Ostrava in 2014, Macura served as a director of the manufacturer of the pharmaceutical company Walmark, among other things.
He also sat on the bodies of other firms.
Uber to return to Brno offering transport services
Uber, which offers transport services, will return to Brno at the end of July.
It is a consequence of a change in the law, Brno Councillor for Transport Petr Kratochvíl (ODS) said in a press statement on Thursday.
Taxi drivers protested against Uber in Brno, pointing out that Uber does not meet conditions such as designation as a taxi or taxameter.
However, by changing the law, conditions for operating ordinary taxis as well as alternative ones have changed since July.
Kratochvíl has undergone several negotiations with Uber representatives in recent weeks.
“On their basis, this company decided at the end of July this year to return to Brno with its services.
The move is a result of a change in the law that allows that company to operate legally.
The city was acquainted with this change and we believe that the company will operate its services within the given limits,” Kratochvíl said.
Uber has operated in Brno in the past.
It was protested by taxi drivers over not labelling vehicles as taxis or missing taxameter.
The court issued a preliminary measure banning Uber from driving in the city.
Brno initially supported taxi drivers, but Mayor Markéta Vaňková (ODS) said the city would like to make moves to make Uber work in Brno.
According to later court rulings, Uber was allowed to ride in Brno, but the company did not take advantage of it.
He will now return based on a change in the law.
As of July, alongside classic taxi-lamp and taxameter taxameter taxis, it is easier to operate a transport service ordered and paid exclusively via mobile apps.
Too exuberant celebration in Brno: a flying chair hit a meter from a man on the pavement
An office chair came out of the fourth floor of the apartment building building in Brno on Saturday night and hit about a metre from the sidewalk.
After him at that point was a pedestrian who immediately called the officers.
The patrol noticed an open window immediately upon arrival at the said address in the western part of the city, under which a chair still lay and several cans and butts next to it.
“The rub carried from the room on the fourth floor suggested that a rather noisy celebration was taking place inside.
Officers walked down the corridor to the flat and asked the three young men present, aged between twenty-six and twenty-nine, for an explanation,” said Jakub Ghanem, a spokesman for the constables.
Request to appeal Rafaj discusses Babiš with CSSD
Prime Minister Peter Rafaj plans to discuss with the coalition Social Democrats on Monday a demand to draft an appeal by Antitrust Authority (ÚOHS) chief Petr Rafaj.
For Rafaj's appeal, non-profit organizations called for the anti-corruption council of the government, as well as the Ústí Region.
The Social Democrats state that the exchange at the head of the office is spot on.
According to ČTK information, Rafaj was not invited to the Cabinet Office for Monday.
A second mandate will expire for him in the middle of next year, under the law he cannot be appointed for a third time.
His appeal is within the purview of President Milos Zeman.
In addition to the challenge of non-profit organizations, the Prime Minister also received a letter with a similar request from the Ústí Region.
The reason is to be, among other things, Rafai's caucuses of recent times.
In the past week, the Prime Minister has refused to comment on the demand, saying that he would be familiar with the materials and government parties would take “some position” on it.
He also stated that he had not yet discussed the challenges with the President, a meeting with him at the earliest.
According to the comments of the OHS to appeal, there is no reason because Rafaj has not been charged with anything.
The servers Ihned.cz and Aktuálně.cz have written in the past week that the police are interested in Rafai's meetings with Hetman Jiří Čunk.
The meetings were linked to, among other things, deciding on a competition for a controversial new eight-billion Zlin hospital project, which Čunek has been pushing hard.
Chunek acknowledged the meeting, according to him, they jointly handled his “Senate activities.”
Similarly, Rafaj speaks.
The representative of the Ústí Region to appeal Rafaj called on the government at the end of June.
It also asks for reform of the authority's decision-making mechanisms.
The decision of the OHS regarding public contracts according to the Deputy Hetman for Transport Jaroslav Komínek is not transparent and has features of arbitrary.
Last March, police intervened at the Antitrust Authority over a myth collection tender.
This June, the server Aktuálně.cz pointed out that Rafaj was using apartments written to the company of influential backroom player ČSSD Alexander Chuba.
The deposit of 3.5 million for an apartment in Brno was paid from Rafajova's account.
The President of the Office of Competition Protection has been Rafaj since 9 July 2009, for the second term the President of the former Social Democracy MP appointed in June 2015.
In less than a year, Rafai's second six-year mandate expires.
The Antitrust Authority Act states that the President may dismiss the President of the Office upon a proposal from the Government.
He can only be revoked if he has not held office for more than six months or undermines the dignity of his office or the independence and impartiality of the office in a serious way.
In the Blanenian library, the people collapsed with heat.
Air conditioning will help
The new technique will cost 740 thousand and will be operational in the second half of August.
“For me, it's good news.
With three children, we go to the library in downtown Blansko on a regular basis.
In the warm months, though, it was practically impossible to stand there.
It was terrible heat and bad air.
Ventilation didn't help.
That's why I love for air conditioning,” said one of Blanensian readers Petr Novotný.
According to the library's director, Lukas Dlapa, temperatures in the building often climbed up to over thirty degrees.
The south wall of the property is glazed and functions as a greenhouse on sunny days.
“In addition, the sun leans into it because of the curvature of the building for much of the day.
At the same time, it is a big problem for individual departments to air because overnight windows have to be closed for safety reasons.
We often have that way from morning in the library to thirty degrees,” stated Dlapa.
Worst off was the study room and reading room on the third floor.
And a floor up the exhibition room and the principal.
An unpleasant climate was also in the children's ward located under the roof of the building.
“It happened several times that librarians at work collapsed and ended up on sick leave.
The problem also regularly occurred in the culture room at lectures attended by dozens of people.
After a few minutes, there was no longer a breath there,” Dlapa noted.
Originally, city representatives wanted to do air conditioning this year on all premises of the library.
In the end, only three circuits out of five will
“Due to limited funding, only the most troubled spaces will have air conditioning.
Study room and reading room on the third floor.
Then the culture room and the children's department a floor higher,” Jiří Svoboda from the Blanenian Investment Department informed him.
He added that in the first phase, workers had already installed HVAC and modified wiring in said premises last fall.
Approximately 360 thousand crowns.
The Blansko Municipal Library has almost three thousand registered readers.
Of these, about nine hundred are under fifteen years old.
Opora of Chicago drove out the coronavirus.
Crawford bounces back into the game
Not every single one of the infected athletes comes out with the truth.
Especially when it involves an NHL player who keeps quiet about the health of players like a grave and doesn't publish anything at all.
As one of the few, he stepped out of the line Crawford.
The 35-year-old Montréal native was present at just the first training session, missing from the line-up since.
“I would like to announce to all of you that I tested positive for Covid-19 and have spent the last fortnight locked up in my home because of that,” he revealed the reason for his absence.
Fans no longer have to worry about his medical condition.
Crawford is ready to throw himself into full ballast again.
“It's amazing that I'm back.
I'll do everything I can to get in shape as soon as possible,” he added.
The experienced goalie earned two Stanley Cups with Chicago, a solid part of the crease being for the tenth season in a row.
The Blackhawks await first a prep duel with St. Louis, then they will face Edmonton in the preround.
Thousands of people protested in Israel against the prime minister
Thousands of Israelis in several places of the country have protested against unemployment, corruption and the way Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is handling the coronavirus crisis.
Manifestations took place outside Netanyahu's private villa in Caesarea, near his official residence or in a park in Tel Aviv, among others.
Protests have been held regularly in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv for several weeks.
Their participants are demanding Netanyahu's resignation because of the process in which he is indicted on corruption and fraud charges, as well as over the government's handling of the next wave of the coronavirus epidemic.
“Bibi, go home,” one of the protesters wrote on his transparent, referring to Netanyahu's commonly known nickname, according to the AP agency.
“Everyone sees that the emperor has lost his clothes,” another said.
The 70-year-old Netanyahu is Israel's first prime minister on trial while holding office.
He is indicted in three counts of corruption, fraud and abuse of trust.
He rejects all charges, calling them a witch hunt.
According to local media, the trial can take up to three years, with over 300 witnesses being called.
Sars-COV-2 coronavirus has been confirmed in nearly 60,500 people in Israel, which has a population of about nine million.
455 people have died in connection with the disease.
The Israeli government imposed quarantine measures in March that helped reduce daily increases in those infected.
However, after a gradual easing of restrictions since the end of April, in particular, the numbers of infected began to grow significantly again at the end of June.
Netanyahu's critics say the government has not adequately helped, for example, business owners affected by quarantine measures.
Protesters are also bothered by the government issuing contradictory guidelines in the fight against coronavirus.
The driver smashed the car against a tree and perished.
Body had to be cut out of wreck by firefighters
The tragic accident happened around 23rd hour near Neveklov on a narrow district leading from the Slapska Dam.
The driver flew apparently at no small speed down into the woods and smashed the car against a tree.
He perished on the spot.
The body had to be extricated from the wreck by firefighters, cutting off the roof, among other things.
The circumstances of the crash are being checked by police officers
They ordered a court autopsy, which should clarify, among other things, if the man was driving under the influence of alcohol or any other addictive substance.

Pietro Filipi cancels discounts and bets on sustainability
Czech clothing brand Pietro Filipi wants to focus on sustainability and is embarking on a major change in strategy.
It cancels discounts and no longer wants to spew one collection after another.
The fact that the fashion industry is among the biggest environmental polluters is no news.
In incinerators and landfills, billions of items of clothing end annually.
But the sight of slow fashion, a much-despised approach to dressing, has been changing quite rapidly during recent years.
Approximately half of Pietro Filipi's merchandise sold at full price.
The other half, which sold thanks to discounts, simply won't buy.
The firm doesn't want to spew one collection after another and cheapen products below their production price at the end of each season.
Moreover, according to owner Michal Mičky, the times of new and old collections and the blind following of rapidly changing fashion trends are gone.
“Most discount dealers count already when buying goods, so the full price includes a much higher margin.
So it's actually kind of a scam,” says Pietro Filipi owner Michal Mička.
Moreover, with its approach, the firm also wants to support local business.
“Each of our products is made of carefully selected quality fabrics and designed by local designers.
We place emphasis on making sure that much of our collection is made up of so called basic pieces - i.e. clothing that is timeless and over-season.
Globally, the premium brand segment in the absence of any discounts is typical, the price of the product simply corresponds to its quality and the discount is not needed,” adds Mička.
Giant graffiti features RAF airman Kurt Taussig
“The assignment was to create something for the anniversary of the war's end
And I remembered our fighter pilot who fought through the ranks of Britain's Royal Air Force in World War II.
The design was liked by the city's leadership,” said Vacek, who finished his work after a fortnight of intensive work.
He consumed roughly 300 litres of paint and 50 sprays.
Kurt Taussig was born in 1923 in Teplích-Šanov.
He left town when he was 15 years old.
During the war, due to his Jewish ancestry, the Nazis dragged him to an internment camp, where they held him for several weeks.
However, he and his brother managed to avoid a concentration camp thanks to Nicholas Winton's organization.
In 1939, Taussig reached the UK, where he voluntarily joined the Royal Air Force (RAF), and afterwards underwent pilot training in African Southern Rhodesia and Palestine.
He became involved in combat operations in early 1945.
After the Velvet Revolution, he visited both Czech Republic and his native Teplice several times, which granted him honorary citizenship.
The 46-year-old Kamil Vacek, who is known by people in the street graphic art business by the nickname Camo, has been working with sprays in warm streets for over 20 years.
He started with graffiti on surfaces set aside for these purposes by the then Mayor Jaroslav Kubera (ODS).
Storm Hanna reached Texas coast
Hurricane Hanna on Saturday afternoon local time (before midnight CEST night to today) arrived on the southwest coast of the U.S. state of Texas.
It struck Texas's Padre Island, roughly 24 kilometres north of the small town of Port Mansfield, and weakened to a tropical storm on its move over land.
But it nevertheless poses a major danger to coastal residents, according to meteorologists.
Indeed, it brought with it strong winds and intense rainfall; along with local flooding, power cuts and various material damage, among other damaged ships, are reported, according to the AP agency.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott had already declared a state of natural disaster for 32 counties in southwest Texas on Saturday and recommended people voluntary evacuation.
The strongest warning was received by people from the coastal strip between Port Mansfield and Mesquite Bay, in total it has but the element to hit a territory almost 500 kilometres long before gradually moving above northeastern Mexico.
“Although Hanna is now a tropical storm, heavy rain and winds, level rises, dangerous surf and isolated tornadoes can pose threats,” the US National Hurricane Center warned ( NHC).
This morning local time (afternoon CEST), the storm was moving in the area of the US-Mexican border and was accompanied by winds of 85 kilometres per hour.
Hanna on Saturday became the first hurricane of this year's hurricane season in the Atlantic region.
It was accompanied by winds of up to 145 kilometres per hour over the Gulf of Mexico, but it gradually weakened to 112 kilometres per hour as it progressed to land, bringing Hanna out of the hurricane category again discarded.
Authorities urged locals to weather the storm at home, oblivious to the hygiene measures associated with preventing the spread of coronavirus.
Texas is among those U.S. states that the covid-19 disease pandemic plagues the most.
Given existing security measures and the need to comply with stand-off clearances, eventual evacuations are also a major challenge.
Makeshift shelters were opened in hotels, schools and gyms.
In Hidalgo County, Texas, one of the buildings was also set up as shelter after evacuees who tested positive for coronavirus or were exposed to the disease in other ways.
Local authorities urged all evacuees to take their guise and disinfectant gels with them to shelter if possible.
“We don't have it nearly behind us yet.
We expect catastrophic flooding,” the AP agency quoted Chris Birchfield, who works for the National Weather Service (NWS) service in the city of Brownsville, as saying.
Forecasters claim that in some places, up to 300 millimetres of rainfall could rain in just a few hours, in some cases nearly 500 millimetres, which would go along with a rise in levels the sea may have flooded a number of settlements on the coast.
Zeman bestows general rank to Colonel Lipka
President Milos Zeman will lend the general rank to Colonel Pavel Lipka on Wednesday.
It follows from a review of expected events by the Ministry of Defence.
The reason for bestowing the rank of brigadier general is Lipka's August ascension to the post of deputy commander of the Alliance Multi-National Division Northeast in Poland.
Lipka still serves as Deputy Commander of the Land Forces of the Czech Army.
Promotion to Zeman at the end of June was proposed by the government
Lipka from the beginning of August will replace Brigadier General Karel Řehka as Deputy Commander of the Northeast Multi-National Division in Elblag, Poland, which commands the units of the alliance forward presence in the territory of Poland and the Baltics.
Řehka became director of the National Bureau of Cyber and Information Security (NÚKIB) in March.
The government proposed to the president that he bestow Lipka the rank of brigadier general.
Under the Occupational Soldiers Act, a higher rank may be bestowed upon a soldier for a period of time of execution of an elected office or for the period of performance of a service task that bestowing a higher rank requires.
The post of Deputy Commander of the Alliance Division is the responsibility of a general rank.
The soldier to whom the rank has been bestowed has the same rights and duties as if he had been appointed to that rank.
However, he is not entitled to a salary adjustment that would match the rank.
The granting of rank lasts until the remission of the reason for which it was granted.
“Colonel Lipka demonstrates high professional readiness and is a model for subordinates.
It participates significantly in the performance of the tasks of the armed forces of the Czech Republic, including cooperation with foreign partners and securing the participation of the military in foreign operations,” it said in June Ministry of Defence to proposal for promotion.
Wednesday's promotion will take place at 12:30 in Prague Castle, and will be attended by Defence Minister Lubomir Metnar or Chief of Staff Ales Opata.
EU countries have coronavirus standards for aviation
European Union countries have agreed common hygiene standards for plane travel to help curb the spread of the new coronavirus.
It was announced by German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer.
Among the agreed standards is compliance with the stand-off or wearing of guise on both the aircraft and at the airport, but the middle seats on planes will not have to remain unoccupied.
Reuters reported on this.
“I am pleased that my colleagues accepted the German proposal for Europe and that we could agree on these uniform standards,” Scheuer said at the European Aviation Conference.
The German transport ministry then added that officials had made the deal and that it had yet to be formally approved by ministers.
The measures agreed include a requirement to cover one's mouth and nose for passengers as young as six, observe a recommended stand-off during security checks and check-in at the airport.
Aircraft must also be guaranteed enough fresh air and all information must be available in several languages.
The airline also will be able to occupy middle seats as well.
The common regulations agreed to by officials meet at least some of the airline's requirements.
Indeed, the differing standards were causing confusion.
Temperature record fell on Arctic Spitsbergen, measured nearly 22 degrees there
“A 41-year-old record has fallen in Longyearbyen,” the Norwegian Meteorological Institute said on Twitter.
In the early evening, temperatures there soared to 21.7 degrees Celsius, breaking the 1979 record by 0.4 degrees, he added.
Roughly two-thousand-long Longyearbyen is the largest city in Spitsbergen, located about 1300 kilometers from the North Pole.
Svalbard heats up faster than almost any other place on Earth.
This fact highlights the dangers arising from warming other ends of the Arctic - from Alaska to Siberia, last year's report by the Norwegian Centre for Climate Study said.
The average temperature in Spitsbergen, he says, has risen by three to five degrees since the 1970s.
By 2100, it can rise even ten degrees unless the greenhouse gas discharge into the atmosphere is reduced.
Temperature rises may result in the melting of eternally frozen soil in Svalbard, which will threaten the stability of many buildings, roads or airports and may cause greater avalanches and landslides.
Climate warming also threatens Arctic fauna, such as polar bears or seals, which depend on the ocean's ice cover.
Britons to return from Spain awaits mandatory two-week quarantine
Britain's cabinet also urged citizens to avoid all trips to mainland Spain that are not necessary because of the risk of spreading covid-19 disease.
Thus, the Canary and Balearic Islands are not mentioned, however, even after returning from them, people must enter isolation for two weeks.
The new rules come into effect at midnight.
“Protecting public health is our absolute priority.
We took this decision to prevent the potential spread of the virus in Britain,” British diplomacy said in a statement.
“We have always made it clear that in case there is a need, we will remove a particular country from the list of safe ones immediately,” she added.
As Britain's Metro newspaper noted, the latest announcement will hit the travel plans of thousands of Britons.
Spain is a very popular holiday destination.
Britons, among other things, have concerns about whether they will be paid sick leave in case they have to end up in isolation for 14 days after returning from holidays.
Neil Hunter from the town of Sittingbourne, for example, booked a ten-day holiday to Lanzarote, they were due to depart on Tuesday.
They have a tour ordered from Dec.
'We had the whole family going, my wife Amanda and daughter Bethany, but to be honest, after this announcement I don't know what's going to happen.
I work as a train driver and I don't think my employer will accede to being quarantined after returning from vacation for two weeks,” the Metro newspaper quoted Hunter as saying.
In the context of Spain, there are concerns that the country is at the beginning of a second wave of epidemic.
Over the last two days there have always been over 900 newly infected in 24 hours.
Authorities in some areas are already tightening coronavirus measures, such as Catalonia is trying to restrict all nightlife, preventing people from coming together in bulk.
The Czech Foreign Ministry has newly drawn attention to the increased risk of the disease in Catalonia, Aragon, the Basque Country and the Madrid region.
Model of electricity buyout from Dukovan to be discussed by the government
The government on Monday will discuss a model to buy out electricity from the planned new block of the Dukovany Nuclear Power Plant.
The bill reckons that if the feed-in price is higher than the price of power electricity on the market, the difference will be paid by all consumers through tariffs.
In the latter case, when the feed-in price will be below the market price, the impact on consumers will be the opposite.
Power electricity is the unregulated part of the final price of electricity for customers.
Vice Premier and Industry Minister Karel Havlicek (for ANO) and the energy company CEZ have previously said that the more likely option is that people will save for electricity by building.
Analysts, on the other hand, caution that the long-term outlook for electricity prices in the markets is always uncertain, something developments have shown several times in the past.
The intent has previously been criticised by environmental organisations.
“The feed-in price can be both below and above the market price of power electricity.
Thus, the final impact at the time of applicability of the rule can be both negative and positive.
The impact will be spread among customers according to the size of the circuit breaker - at lower consumption or by electricity consumption - at higher electricity consumption,” the Ministry of Industry said in the material documents and trade (MPO).
Havlicek stated in May that he projected that the wholesale price of electricity would rise and people on the Dukovan construction would earn.
Otherwise, the impact will be in the tens of kronor per year per family, which he says is far less than people pay each year in electricity invoices to support so-called supported resources.
He has previously estimated that the feed-in price could be between 50 to 60 euro (about 1320 to 1600 CZK) per megawatt-hour (MWh).
The material presented does not contain any draft amount, it is to be contained only in the buyout agreement.
The price of electricity at the Prague Energy Exchange for 2021, for which traders now share the most, is currently around 45 euros (about 1190 CZK) per MWh.
“With a difference in the feed-in tariff and the market price of power electricity of ten euros, the balance of the average household with consumption of 3,3 MWh per year could be equivalent to a household of four, standard equipped with electrical appliances including electric hob and oven, which, however, does not use electricity for heating and hot water heating - less than 100 CZK/year,” wrote in the documents for the MPO government.
“We live in a hugely turbulent time.
The coronavirus pandemic has shown us how vulnerable the global economy is.
For this reason, I consider the long-term prediction of market prices to be a very speculative matter,” said ČTK previously managing director of the investment group Energy financial group Tomáš Voltr.
The proposed law reckons that the buyout would be carried out by the MPO, respectively, the state-owned legal entity, at a predetermined price.
A contract between the investor and the State guaranteeing the terms of the purchase of electricity would be concluded for a minimum of 30 years, with a possible extension of ten years, even repeated, but the longest until termination the operation of low-carbon production.
It defines a low-carbon generating design as a nuclear reactor power generating plant connected to an electrification system with an installed capacity of a minimum electrical output of 100 megawatts (MW ) after 2030.
Havlicek previously stated that the new Dukovan block should have a capacity of 1200 MW and produce nine terawatt-hours of electricity annually, equivalent to a tenth of the expected Czech consumption.
The block is expected to be commissioned in 2036.
The funding model for the new Dukovan bloc was approved by the government on Monday.
The facility should be financed by the state during construction at no rate, with 2 percent interest in operation.
The opposition does not agree with the financing model, it also bothers the possibility of Russian or Chinese firms building Dukovans.
The state should participate in the construction 70 percent.
The rest should be paid by CEZ, which will also cover all possible additional costs.
CEZ CEO Daniel Beneš told ČTK in May that the expected sum for building the block at current prices was roughly six billion euros (approximately 162 billion kronor).
Contracts between the state and CEZ on the construction of the new Dukovan block will be signed on Tuesday.
Department for Regional Development has withdrawn material on promoting tourism in media for two billion
Material according to which the Ministry for Regional Development (MMR) planned to spend two billion kroner in media, internet and billboards on holiday advertising in the Czech Republic, the office from a reminder proceedings withdrew.
Minister Klara Dostálová (for YES) told the server that the material was still being worked on.
The document in EKLEP (electronic library of legislative process) was brought to the attention of the document in Epravy.cz on Friday.
The Ministry justified the plan with a slump in tourism due to the coronavirus.
During the coronavirus crisis, both revenue and the media experienced a slump.
The proposal drew criticism from both the opposition and tourism representatives.
According to the proposal, which is now available on hlidacstatu.cz, MMR planned to give money through the state tourism promotion agency CzechTourism for advertising on televisions, radio, print, internet, billboards or surfaces at train stations.
The biggest part of the money, and that of 700 million kronor, would receive televisions.
Most would be acquired by private Nova and Prima televisions.
Printed diaries and weeklies would get 400 million, and the same volume would give MMR for PR articles, advertising banners and videos on the website.
Radio stations would receive 350 million for the media campaign, most of it again private stations.
The other 150 million would be used for outdoor advertising on billboards, LED screens and surfaces at train stations or subways.
The campaign to promote tourism in the Czech Republic was scheduled to start in mid-August and last for a year.
“The material is still being worked on, it is certainly not yet in the form that should be presented,” Dostálová said without further details of the ListNews server.
The material was criticised by the opposition, according to TOP 09 chief Marketa Pekarova Adamova, media from Prime Minister Andrei Babiš's trust funds (YES) would profit from advertising.
“I firmly believe that this flamboyant contempt will get a blow between the eyes at the election this fall,” she wrote on Twitter.
Dostal retorts that it is, in fact, about helping crisis-hit media.
'It can also be a coincidence, I don't know anything about media support, 'she told Diary N on Friday.
According to her, the budget of two billion is indicative.
“Of course, we still count it, it may be less and more.
It's working material,” she added.
The Save Tourism initiative makes no sense for a media campaign to promote domestic tourism.
“We want two billion for companies in tourism, not an unnecessary advertising campaign,” Tomáš Barčík, the initiative's chairman, said on Sunday.
If there are two billion crowns in the state budget, they should go to firms, not to the media, the initiative says in an open letter to the government.
Broth of life, cock beers and death like a blade of grass
Posthumous is also the third album titled A Death is a blade of grass by Brno poet, tireless organizer of cultural activities and publisher Jaroslav Erik Frič, who also left a year ago, 24. May.
In Friča's discography it is the fifth item and, like the previous titles, the main emphasis is on Friča's poetry, which he is himself an excellent artist.
Frič, 1949, was understandably influenced by the American beat generation, but he also inspired this inspiration through his own, distinctively served experiences and also very intrinsic expressions of faith.
However, he was left with some agitation on the hunt, if he spoke or wrote about faith, about God, it was always very intimate, non-aggressive, completely tolerant.
I can think of Bohuslav Reynek in this context (in contrast to Jan Zahradníček), the masters are forgiven.
Friča's album offers records of the author's reading from 2006, as well as performances with musicians who have always accompanied it very sensitively, whether it was celist Josef Kelek or Honza Bartoň and Vizzslav Holata.
I will help - like - in the words of Ostrava poet Petr Hruška about Friča's long poetry compositions.
“There was a proud and never-ending bitterness of them,” Pear writes, “over the state of our world threatened with extinction.
A world increasingly sinking into numbing consumerist vanity and raking, it is increasingly moving away from what its soul was made of - from the mysteries of faith, humility and human closeness.
There was a statement of one who knows that the values for which he was created are of little interest, but who also knows that only because of general disinterest, they cannot be renounced.
Those poems were a reminder that one might have to lose everything dear, but it is not immaterial in which way it will lose.
If he sells out to general decline, he skeptically resigns, falls silent, or stays quiet until the last moment in a calm and proud insistence on what he believes and what he loves.”
Paroubek is not my adviser, Hamáček said
Former prime minister and chairman of the Czech Republic Jiri Paroubek is not a paid social democracy adviser.
Party Chairman and Interior Minister Jan Hamáček only communicates with him and reads his views and articles.
Hamáček said it on the Prima Partie TV show today.
Paroubek should be Hamáčka's advisor reported on Friday the server Seizprvy.cz.
“We write an essay from time to time, he sends me some material occasionally and I read it,” Hamacek said today.
He added that it was nonetheless not an official and paid collaboration.
The SSD doesn't have the resources to waste them on similar purposes, according to him.
“That I occasionally read his opinion, so people like that are a lot,” he said.
In a follow-up discussion with ODS MP Jana Černochová, the minister said that many ODS members still “uncovered listen to the views of Václav Klaus”.
It's fine, according to him, because this is an experienced politician and a former chairman of the party, which is also the case for Paroubko.
The fact that the media is making an affair out of it marked this year's cucumber season mark.
The server Dizprvy.cz wrote on Friday that Paroubek fulfils the role of Hamáček's unofficial consultant.
He also wrote that former chairman of the cell Petr Benda, who is affiliated with Paroubek and served as deputy chairman of his LEV 21 party, was heading to the fourth position of the party's candidate in the Ústí region.
Hamáček said today that the composition of the female candidate would not comment until she was done and approved.
Duplantis has a mile lead, he's a kick in the ass, whitewash Swede's challenger
It is the 22-year-old American pole player who has the ambition and potential to be among the most serious competitors of the new ruler.
He already knows what it's like to beat the two years younger Duplantis, overpowered him to an NCAA university association meet last year.
'We had a battle the year before, that's when he won and I was second, then we threw it through.
In both cases, it was a very good duel,” describes Nilsen, who secured the victory with a performance of 5.95 metres.
But Duplantis has since shot steeply upwards and is currently found alone in the highest pole spheres.
In just 20, he became a world recordman, breaking the bar of 6.17 metres this year in Toruń on 8 February, an inch added still in Glasgow a week later.
“He was jumping six metres already at 18 when he finished high school,” recalls his peer Nilsen for the World Athletics website.
“It was clear that once he matured from boy into man, he would make all his potential and talent tenfold.
Twenty years is a pretty good age to jump a world record,” he believes.
As much as Nilsen's account of achievements is thinner about knowledge than the one Duplantis prides himself on, the American sets similar goals.
He has hinted at his options so far at the NCAA races he has won regularly, this February he improved his indoor personal record to 5.93 m. Last August, he won a gold medal at one of them Pan American Games in Lima, already in 2017 he fought his way to the American quest to the World Championship, where he finished 13th.
The closest milestone then for him is to taste the Diamond League for the first time.
“It's definitely my priority to get on the professional circuit and race as much as possible in the Diamond League because that's where you can make a name for yourself,” he realises.
“When you can succeed at this level, you can undoubtedly do the same at events such as the Olympics, the World Championships or the Pan American Games.”
Because of the pandemic, though, these peak holidays are being postponed, giving Nilsen and the other bars time to improve.
But will that be enough to catch up with Duplantis, who lightly can turn the under-five circle race into a mere duel for silver?
“Everyone is trying to catch up to him, but I don't think it will be possible any time soon,” Nilsen ponders.
“That kid has been jumping for 16 years and he's got a mile edge over everyone else in training.”
And before Tokyo 2021 starts, he'll want to increase it.
A woman has spent hundreds of thousands on an infirm son's disability pension.
She is awaiting trial
The money the 33 year-old receives from the state as a disability pension is mainly intended to improve his quality of life.
For embezzlement, a woman threatens up to eight years in prison.
Due to poor health, the court deprived the sick man of arbitrary and appointed his mother as a guardian to manage, among other things, his son's money.
“A woman from mid-November 2013 to this January used part of the funds from the son's disability pension for her need and thus deprived him of 440 thousand crowns,” it said Police spokeswoman Dana Ladman, stating that it aggravated the accused woman, that as a guardian she had a separately imposed duty to defend the interests of the aggrieved.
The woman, as instructed by the court, had set up an account for her son, but she had his pension sent to her account.
“After paying the costs associated with the son's stay in a medical facility and reimbursement of necessary medicines, she used the remaining funds for the purchase of the vehicle, electrical appliances and the operation of the household,” stands in the indictment.
That she can't use her son's money for her need, the woman admitted.
But she defended herself by helping with them in paying family expenses.
“We had problems from our income to tighten the running of the household.
We never bought anything above standard.
It was always down to things the purchase of which the son would approve.
I thought of it as family money.
I had no idea I was committing an offence by doing so,” the woman explained to police officers.
She promised to return the money to her son.
North America has been populated for 30,000 years, scientists claim after tool find
Finds from Chiquihuite Cave in the Mexican state of Zacatecas include 1930 tools made of limestone, among which are a fine blade that may have been used to slice meat, and pointed objects that could serve as spikes of spears or spears.
Scientists found that the oldest of the instruments date from 33,000 to 31,000 years ago.
“There are only a few products of this age.
But there they are,” said archaeologist Ciprian Ardelean of the university in the state of Zacatecas and lead author of one of two studies published on the subject in the journal Nature.
The youngest instruments reach the age of 12,500.
According to experts, humans thus inhabited the Chiquihuite Cave, located at a great altitude, for a long 20,000 years.
So far, a widely accepted theory has spoken of the first representatives of the Homo sapiens species crossing over the mainland bridge from an area of present-day Russia to Alaska some 13,500 years ago.
Archaeological evidence, including unique spear spikes used to kill mammoths and other prehistoric animals, showed that this clovian culture subsequently spread across much of the North America.
But this model has received a crack in recent decades when several ancient settlements that were two to three thousand years older were discovered.
In a second study published in the journal Nature, it says of 42 different sites across North America proving human presence on the continent as early as 26,000 to 19,000 years ago.
Scientists believe a small number of people may have come to the North American mainland earlier than predicted until now.
Some could reach America by boat.
“Clearly, people were in America long before the development of the so-called Clovian culture,” anthropologist Ruth Gruhn of the University of Canada's Alberta province said on the new findings.
Interest in airfare so far fulfills an upbeat scenario, dealers say.
Gradually, even prices are reduced
Ticket sales in the Czech Republic grow every week.
While interest is still roughly half that compared to last summer, demand is growing by as much as 20 per cent each week.
Thus, post-crisis development fulfills the most optimistic scenarios, according to vendors.
Ticket prices are also gradually decreasing.
Among the most sought-after destinations are particularly southern European states, according to retailers.
Spain, Italy and Greece lead, according to Kiwi.com data.
At the portal Letuška.cz, the most sold flights to Split, Croatia.
Of other countries, the most sought-after is the UK, which has always been one of the most bustling destinations.
The average ticket price is also decreasing.
At the portal Letuška.cz was around 6250 crore in the middle of the month, 3000 crore.
This is mainly due to an increase in demand for European destinations, which now account for about 85 per cent of sales.
However, prices themselves are falling to some European places, such as Spain or Italy have fallen by about a fifth in the past weeks.
The crisis has also affected the behaviour of customers who are now buying tickets far less in advance than before, fearing further developments in the coronavirus situation.
According to earlier Kiwi.com information, the pre-departure ticket purchase period decreased by roughly ten days year-on-year.
“It confirms to us a future trend where people will order tickets with much less advance, they will require more flexibility, less risk,” Kiwi.com's vice president of products said Michal Shingle.
Currently, the average booking time before departure is 21 days.
Along with the growth in sales, the number of renewed airline routes from the Czech Republic is rising.
Regular services to more than 60 destinations are currently operating at Prague Airport.
Against last summer's season, it goes about half the destinations.
Grand final already tonight!
Watch the dart battle live on Nova Sport
The second most prestigious tournament within the PDC organization went to the grand final.
It will feature experienced nine-year-old Scottish darter Gary Anderson and the surprise of the tournament, 26-year-old Belgian Dimitri van den Bergh.
Gary Anderson knocked out Justin Pip in the first round, then ran into his neighbor in the scoreboard.
Even with James Wade, however, he copped himself and in the quarter-finals he prowled profusely with Simon Whitlock, who had previously sent home the world number one.
The “Flying Scotsman” had a lame finish in the semi-final when he faced Michale Smith.
But he escaped the gravedigger from the shovel at the last minute, dominating in extra time and after a result of 18:16 he claimed a place in the final of the tournament he had already dominated in 2018 when he defeated in an amazing battle Mensur Suljovich 9:19 p.m.
World Matchplay's biggest surprise is Dimitri van den Bergh.
The Belgian talent is enjoying the tournament and just perhaps the knowledge that he has nothing to lose has helped him to play on an absolutely fantastic wave.
The 26-year-old dart first surprisingly knocked out Nathan Aspinall's world six, pressurised even Joe Cullen in a dramatic battle, and battered Adrian Lewis in the quarter-finals after a sharp onset.
The big clearance was the semi-final.
Glen Durrant showed his strength right on the opening, but in the calm playing Belgian then regained a lead with an excellent series, which he then more or less kept unchallenged until the end.
Van den Bergh showed his strength in the high scoring through which he ran occasional uncertainty on the doublets.
Coronavirus cases added at least since the beginning of the week, the number of tests decreased
Since the beginning of March, when the new coronavirus was first discovered in the Czech Republic, 15,212 people have proven to have infected it.
Nearly 9,600 of them have already cured; 368 patients have died.
At present, 5,254 people are sick.
It follows data on the Department of Health's Web site.
The daily number of newly confirmed cases this week exceeded two hundred four times in a row.
The maximum was Friday's 281 cases.
There were 235 tested positive on Thursday, 246 a day earlier and 206 on Tuesday.
In the first working day of this week, 169 of those infected added.
Of covidu-19, 9,590 people have already been cured in the Czech Republic, or 63 percent of all those infected so far.
In most, the disease had a mild course.
There are 151 people with coronavirus at the hospital, according to the latest Health Ministry figures, a condition 19 of them rated by doctors as serious.
There are several outbreaks of covid-19 disease in the Czech Republic.
Karvinsko still shows the most infected in the last seven days in the 100 thousand population, almost 59.
This is followed by Jihlava District with 56 and Frýdecko-Místecko with 36 infected per 100 thousand inhabitants in the last week.
Due to the increased number of infected, new measures against the spread of coronavirus are in effect in the Czech Republic from Saturday.
People have to wear guise at indoor mass events over 100 people, these are cultural and sporting events but also weddings and funerals inside buildings.
From Monday, the capacity of these events will be halved from the current 1,000 people.
In the world, the number of people who have been demonstrably infected with the new coronavirus has already exceeded the 16 million mark.
This was stated by America's Johns Hopkins University, which tracks pandemic development globally.
The balance of victims who died with covid-19 disease is closer to 645,000, according to this source.
The latest million infected added to the statistics in just three days; the 15 million threshold fell on July 22.

The infected is now increasing at a record rate.
The World Health Organization reported this week that more than 284 thousand new cases were added globally between Thursday and Friday, the highest daily balance since the pandemic began.

Air in homes is up to five times worse than outdoor ones.
Health harms air fresheners as well as deodorants
Health threatens not only poor air quality in outdoor areas, but also at home.
This was brought to attention by Israeli human health expert Carol Abraham, already quoted by The Jerusalem Post newspaper.
According to Abraham, who was deserving of the creation of Israel's Ministry of Environmental Protection, it is necessary to focus on household harms right now, when many people spend more time working from home.
Abraham referred to research by the US Environment Agency (EPA), which said the quality of domestic air is up to five times worse than outdoor.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) judges that 3.8 million people die prematurely annually due to poor air quality in their homes.
'Because of the coronavirus epidemic, which has forced many and is still forcing them to work from home, people have to spend more hours in homes than before, so it's time to focus on home air quality, ' said Abraham.
In Israel, according to her, almost no one deals with the quality of “domestic air”.
Dangerous can be things that a person normally comes into contact with - coatings, air fresheners, disinfectants, deodorants or pesticides.
“Poison gas is also given off by garments that we regularly wear to the dry cleaners,” Abraham said.
The most at risk, she says, are children, old members of the household and people with respiratory problems.
Even otherwise healthy individuals may begin to suffer problems such as headache, fainting, nasal irritation, nosebleeds, vomiting or skin allergies.
With prolonged exposure to unhealthy substances, internal organs and central nervous system can be damaged.
But not all harmful substances come from objects inside households, the source can also be the material from which the houses are built.
