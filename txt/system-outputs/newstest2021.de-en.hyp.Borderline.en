Biker reacts lightning fast and prevents worse
On Friday evening, a traffic accident occurred on the country road between Machtolsheim and Merklingen, in which a motorcyclist was only slightly injured thanks to his quick reaction.
Driver overlooks bikers
A 44-year-old driver wanted to turn around 9.30 pm with her VW coming from Merklingen to the left onto the state road 1230 in the direction of Machtolsheim.
Here she overlooked the 24-year-old motorcyclist coming from the direction of Nellingen.
Hand- and foot brake levers fly away in the collision
The biker still tried to avoid the car, but still touched it at the rear of the vehicle.
Due to the grazing process, the hand and foot brake levers on the Suzuki were torn off and the driver was no longer able to brake.
Mindfully, he steered his motorcycle in the green stiffeners next to the road and let it roll out there without falling.
Biker suffers leg injury
Due to the collision with the car, the biker still suffered an injury to Beim and had to be treated in a clinic.
Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 harvest workers infected
After a corona mass infection on a large vegetable farm in Mamming in Lower Bavaria, almost 500 people are under quarantine and are no longer allowed to leave the farm.
A security service monitors the ban on going out.
A total of 174 harvest workers were tested positive for the corona pathogen Sars-CoV-2 during the screening, as the district office of Dingolfing-Landau announced on Saturday evening.
"In order to avoid further expansion, we unfortunately have to take this step to protect the population," explained District Administrator Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Previously, seven employees had already been infected in the company - this was the reason for the series test.
The farm is a large vegetable farm that grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and beetroot - but the cucumbers are only for jars.
Mamming is a rural community with a good 3300 inhabitants not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW plant.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to keep calm: "According to our information, it is a closed group of people."
On the farm, infected employees were separated from non-infected employees, the site is now surrounded by a fence.
Greens and SPD gave the state government joint responsibility.
The two opposition factions accused Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet of neglecting the control of the accommodation of seasonal workers.
"This can take bitter revenge if such local infection events spread and regional lockdowns have to be ordered," said Jürgen Mistol, the parliamentary executive director of the Greens.
The SPD takes a similar view: "After the corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof slaughterhouse in mid-May, we have already called for a special control programme for farms with harvest workers," said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
"Especially the hygiene conditions at the workplace and the living conditions must be strictly controlled from our point of view.
That obviously didn't happen. "
The outbreak had come "with an announcement".
Underground station Aidenbachstraße: Dangerous dispute: 19-year-old falls into the track bed after Schubser
In a dispute between two youth groups at the Aidenbachstraße underground station, a 19-year-old fell through a pusher and slipped into the track bed.
Obersendling - On Friday there was a dispute between two youth groups at the Aidenbachstraße underground station around 4:15 p.m.
A passer-by alerted the police, who arrived with several patrols.
According to initial investigations, a resident of Munich (17) pushed a 19-year-old to the ground.
The young man slid over the platform edge and fell into the track bed.
People from the group of the 17-year-old helped the fallen man to climb out of the track.
Danger by an incoming train did not exist.
As reported by the police, there were again clashes between the two people.
The 17-year-old initially fled the crime scene, but his personal details could be determined afterwards.
Accompanied by his father, he went to the police station 29.
The 17-year-old is under investigation for assault.
Report: Seehofer urges longer data retention
Data retention is currently suspended.
According to a media report, however, Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer calls for an extension of the storage period.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
According to a media report, Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer (CSU) is calling for extended data retention - half a year instead of the planned ten weeks.
As the "Bild am Sonntag" reports, Seehofer asked Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht (SPD) in a letter for a quick change in the law.
Seehofer therefore wants to strengthen the measures against child abuse.
He considers it sensible to "make urgently needed adjustments to the law already now," the newspaper quotes from the letter.
Data retention is currently suspended.
A decision of the European Court of Justice is expected.
Seehofer, however, wants the changes in advance so that they could be applied immediately after a possible positive verdict, the report continues.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice told the newspaper that it can only be meaningfully examined whether legal adjustments are needed once the courts have decided.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer, together with the interior ministers of the federal states, had already spoken out in June in favour of data retention.
NBA: Stripclub-Ärger für Clippers-Star Lou Williams
Excitement in the NBA!
Lou Williams (33), basketball pro of the Los Angeles Clippers, is said to have left the tournament quarter in Disney World in Orlando / Florida with permission for a funeral.
According to US media reports, he visited the strip club "Magic City" in Atlanta in the evening.
Williams, who is said to have admitted the visit according to ESPN, is back in Isloation, being tested daily for COVID-19.
His reason for the visit: Chicken Wings.
In February last year, "Sweet Lou," as he is called in the NBA, has already expressed his love for exactly these wings.
The American wrote: "Magic City and Blue Flame (another strip club in Atlanta) have the best wings in town."
NBA insider Shams Charania announced on Twitter on Sunday that the NBA Williams has ordered a ten-day quarantine.
Thus, the Clippers star misses the first two official games after the friendly phase.
In Disney World, the NBA wants to finish the corona season.
Currently, the best 22 teams are preparing with training matches for the season finale, which begins on Friday night.
Söder comments on the corona situation after mass infection
Munich - Health Minister Melanie Huml (CSU) has already announced a test offensive for large farms on Sunday.
The press conference will be shown live on our homepage.
The case in Mamming in the district of Dingolfing-Landau has alarmed authorities and politicians.
Almost 500 harvest workers from several countries are currently working on the large vegetable farm, and over a third have been infected with the coronavirus pathogen.
The farm is now under quarantine and is cordoned off with a construction fence.
No one is allowed to leave the premises, food is delivered.
The authorities are now offering the 3,300 residents of the community free corona tests.
Since the harvest workers had little contact with the local population, the district office has so far assumed that the infections have not spread beyond the farm.
"Bites of conscience": Confession of the alleged arsonist of Nantes
"My client has shown himself to be cooperative," lawyer Quentin Chabert told the newspaper.
The defence lawyer added: "He regrets the actions very much, the confession was a liberation for him".
His mandate was "plagued by pangs of conscience and deeply affected by the extent of the destruction".
According to the public prosecutor's office, if convicted, the man faces ten years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros.
The Gothic St. Peter and Paul Cathedral in Nantes had been severely damaged in a fire on Saturday night last week.
The fire had broken out in three distant places in the church.
Laboratory tests confirmed the suspicion of arson.
The now detained suspect had already been arrested a few hours after the fire.
However, he was released after one day.
The man works as a volunteer for the diocese of Nantes and was responsible for the closure of the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
Since there was no trace of a violent intrusion into the church, he quickly became the focus of the investigators' attention.
Discuss Abolition of the 50 + 1 Rule
Former DFB President Reinhard Grindel has recommended thinking about abolishing the 50 + 1 rule.
"German football should at least discuss setting conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates fait accompli," Grindel told "Bild am Sonntag".
He stressed: "For the clubs that are most likely to be dangerous to Bayern and Dortmund, the 50 + 1 rules do not work anyway: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, one cannot avoid the debate as to whether it is not appropriate to facilitate the inclusion of investors for clubs that want to break into this phalanx".
However, he has doubts whether there is a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority participation, which is prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50 + 1 rule.
"It remains a legal risk to draw investment fences around the Bundesliga as a business location in a European internal market," said Grindel.
The former DFB boss sees the danger that "the attempts to ensure more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will ultimately only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs on a European level, but will not lead to more tension in the championship".
Even an equal distribution of TV funds will not have a decisive effect.
"FC Bayern makes a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million.
The differences are therefore already immense among the first three clubs alone.
The other 15 clubs have an average budget of 130 million, "explained the 58-year-old.
Looking at the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Unfortunately, there have been people who have noticed this mistake and pierced the press instead of talking to me about it," said Grindel about the acceptance of an expensive watch that led to his resignation in April 2019.
"That has already occupied me very much on a human level."
He had received the gift, worth around 11,000 euros, from a Ukrainian official.
"I committed a compliance violation, and it was right to draw the consequences from it," said Grindel.
"I dealt with the ominous watch gift in a completely transparent and unsuspecting way.
Many in the DFB knew about it".
He had never "made a secret of the gift," the 58-year-old assured.
"This may be called naive, but at any rate this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption".
"Black Lives Matter": Injured and One Dead
Protests against police violence in the United States have been exacerbated by Donald Trump's deployment of federal police in several cities.
On Saturday there were clashes between demonstrators and police officers in various cities.
Three people were injured in Louisville and 16 people were arrested in Seattle.
In Austin, a person was shot and killed while a march was crossing an intersection.
Prior to this, clashes broke out again in Portland during protests against racism and police violence.
The security forces, including federal police officers, used tear gas on Saturday night and violently dispersed demonstrators.
Hundreds of demonstrators, some armed, marched through Louisville in Kentucky on Saturday, demanding that those responsible for the death of Breonna Taylor be held accountable.
The 26-year-old student was shot dead in March during a drug raid in her apartment in Louisville.
The target of the raid was someone else who didn't even live there, and no drugs were found.
When a member of a group that calls itself an armed alliance of black Americans fired a shot on Saturday, three people were injured.
According to NBC, they were taken to the hospital.
None of them was in mortal danger.
The police set up barricades because counter-demonstrators of a white militia had also formed.
In the end, there was no meeting between the two groups.
In Austin, Texas, a person was shot dead in the course of a "Black Lives Matter" demonstration and died.
According to their own statements, the police took a suspect into custody.
She has not yet given any further details on the circumstances of the crime.
Mayor Steve Adler said, according to the New York Times, he was, like many in the city, "inconsolable and stunned" by what had happened.
Demonstrators also clashed with police in the American metropolis of Seattle on Saturday.
They set fire to construction vehicles in front of a youth prison, and the police used stun grenades and pepper spray.
According to the "Seattle Times", 16 people were arrested for resisting police officers or assault.
In the city of Oakland, California, a courthouse was set on fire.
A small group of protesters smashed windows, shot down fireworks, and blinded police officers with lasers, Oakland police said late Saturday night (local time).
The fire could be extinguished quickly.
In Aurora, a suburb of Denver in Colorado, a car drove through a crowd demonstrating on a highway.
According to the police, one of the demonstrators fired a gun and at least one person was injured and taken to hospital.
In addition, windows were also smashed in a court there and a fire was set, as the police announced.
Investigations have begun.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historical costumes defy Corona
Although the big party in the spa town was missing, visitors and performers enjoyed the Rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, performers and organizers: The Rakoczy weekend without the Rakoczy festival.
But: Even if the big party mile in the city center was missing, the crowds and program highlights such as Saale brennt, Rakoczy Ball or pageant, many got their money's worth with the Corona-compliant alternative program.
"I think we have succeeded in spreading Rakoczy flair," says Kurdirektor Sylvie Thormann.
The guests would have accepted it well.
In principle, one returns to the beginnings of the Rakoczy festival, when only the historical ones were in the focus of the festival.
Pleasant atmosphere
Vesna Konhäuser and her husband have always been visiting Bad Kissingen for the Rakoczy festival for more than 25 years.
So also this time in the corona year.
The couple has made themselves comfortable at the Luitpold Casino, watching the historical while strolling and listening to the Cuban live music at the casino restaurant.
"I also find it quite pleasant," says Konhäuser.
She doesn't miss the crowds that otherwise belong to Rakoczy.
But it lacks the usual program highlights, especially Saale brennt on Friday evening as well as the historic procession and the final fireworks on Sunday evening.
"That's a shame.
The weather would have been perfect this year, "she says.
Rakoczy-Riding Tournament to take place again
For the performers of the historic spa guests, the alternative program meant more work in part.
For example, for Christina Gold, who participates in the procession in a normal year and can be seen there on the carriage of the Kurgartencafé.
This year she was walking around the city in costume on Saturdays and Sundays.
"That's more strenuous, otherwise we'll have it easier," she says.
The equestrian club had less to do, even if individual riders were out and about in the park.
"We very much hope that the equestrian quadrille can take place again next year," says chairwoman Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that after a break of several years, a Rakoczy equestrian tournament will take place again in 2021.
28 Corona cases at Spanish second division side Fuenlabrada
The Spanish second division football team CF Fuenlabrada is sliding deeper and deeper into the crisis due to a corona outbreak.
Since the newcomer from near Madrid had flown to a game in the city of A Coruña on July 20, despite the first corona cases, one low blow follows the next.
By Sunday, 28 players or team members had been tested positive, one came to the hospital, as the club announced.
Fuenlabrada from the city of the same name southwest of Madrid still had the chance to reach the promotion playoffs.
Now even the descent into the B-group of the Second League threatens.
The game against Deportivo La Coruña last Monday was canceled at the last moment, the prosecutor's office is investigating a possible crime against public health, the supreme sports authority CSD is considering the forced relegation of the club.
Players and other team members are sitting in a hotel in quarantine.
"Until the sixth day of quarantine, they did not receive a fresh towel or gel", wrote the sports newspaper "AS".
Photos show how players hung up underwear and club clothes to dry in their rooms in the hotel after they apparently had to wash them themselves.
Also, the bed linen had not been changed for five days.
Another problem is the food.
It was neither good nor sufficient, wrote "AS".
The club management, on the other hand, said that they were satisfied with the hotel.
The accusation of deliberately endangering public health was rejected by the club's lawyer, Javier Tebas Llanas.
One had not violated the corona rules established by the football association, stressed the son of the president of the Spanish Primera Division, Javier Tebas, as reported by the news agency Europa Press and the sports newspaper "Marca".
Before departure, there had been four people infected until July 19, but they were all isolated and did not travel with them.
Directly before the flight to A Coruña on Monday, all players and team members were tested again.
When the team was already in A Coruña, the corona test was positive for "five or six" other team members.
The match was cancelled 60 minutes before kickoff, Tebas Llanas said.
Police must capture torn horses at Dampfach
Two animals were on the road.
The police led her back to her owner.
On Sunday morning shortly before 6 o'clock, a road user informed two free-running horses on the feeder road between the junction Donnersdorf / Steinsfeld and the motorway junction Theres.
When the officials arrived, the horses were already back between the feeder road and the village of Dampfach.
After shortly before Dampfach the confidence of the horses could be won by the officials, they each had a rope carried in the patrol car put down.
Professional cyclist Tony Martin: Career continuation conceivable
Time trial specialist Tony Martin is thinking about a continuation of his career.
Frankfurt / Main - The seven-time time time trial world champion Tony Martin can well imagine continuing his cycling career.
"I am currently defining the framework conditions with the team as to how and in what form it could continue," the 35-year-old told the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung".
Martin is currently employed by the Dutch team Jumbo-Visma and had considered ending his career after this year before the corona break.
The negotiations with his team are also about the number of race days, he said.
Or about other problems that would plague him as a family man, said Martin.
He used to get up after a fall, and the first thought was: "Quickly get back on the bike.
Today, as the father of a little daughter, I think: what if. "
The professional cyclist admitted that there are certainly aspects with which he finds it increasingly difficult.
"But it was good for me to remember from the Corona period what I have about cycling and how much fun it is for me."
The time-trial specialist returns to the competition at the Tour de l'Ain (5 to 9 August).

Why the car got into the opposite lane was initially unclear.
In Upper Bavaria, a 22-year-old collided with a horse-drawn carriage on his machine on Saturday.
According to the police, he was going downhill near Beilngries.
In a left-hand bend he crashed into the carriage.
His injuries were so severe that he died at the scene of the accident.

He died at the scene of the accident.
The 57-year-old driver suffered a shock, the remaining three people in the car remained uninjured.
The safety of motorcyclists was discussed on Saturday by Bavaria's Minister of Transport Kerstin Schreyer (CSU).
In a letter to the organizer of the biker protests against driving bans announced for August, Gabor Kovacs, the minister referred to extensive investments such as underride protection on crash barriers and the defusing of dangerous curves.
"For the safety of motorcyclists, we have achieved a lot in recent years," the letter said.
"The number of motorised two-wheelers killed fell by around 28 percent compared to 2011."
Kovac tests with Monaco against Frankfurt
Frankfurt / Main (dpa) - For football coach Niko Kovac there will soon be a reunion with Eintracht Frankfurt with his new club AS Monaco.
The eight-time French champion will make a guest appearance on 1 August (6 p.m.) at the Hessen, the former club of the Croatian.
For the Bundesliga, it is the first and only endurance test before the return leg in the Europa League against FC Basel (6 August).
Because of the coronavirus pandemic, the match will be played without spectators.
"We are especially looking forward to this game.
It's always nice to come to Frankfurt and meet friends, "explained Kovac.
In sporting terms, this is an interesting test, said the 48-year-old.
Before joining FC Bayern Munich, Kovac had coached the Hessians from 2016 to 2018 and led them to victory in the DFB Cup.
"A top-class opponent like Monaco is a good test for us with regard to the match against Basel.
Like everyone in Frankfurt, I'm looking forward to seeing Niko Kovac again, "said Eintracht coach Adi Hütter.
The 50-year-old Austrian had succeeded the Croatian at Eintracht.
In March, the Frankfurt had lost the round of 16 first leg against Basel in their own stadium with 0:3.

700 Deaths from Monsoon Rainfall in Southeast Asia
More than 9 million people are affected by the severe floods in Southeast Asia, especially in Bangladesh, India and Nepal.
Due to the heavy monsoon rain, a total of 700 people lost their lives.
In Bangladesh, the Red Crescent is trying to reach the isolated people in boats.
Entire villages are under water.
The farmers have lost their crops.
Rhinoceroses in National Park die by landslides
In Kaziranga National Park, several of the 120 armored rhinoceroses died from landslides.
They are under protection and are considered to be endangered.
This year, the floods are particularly severe, which scientists attribute to climate change.
According to the United Nations, Bangladesh is one of the countries most affected by global warming.
New apartments are empty
In the village of Cox's Bazar in the south of Bangladesh, the state has built apartments for 650 people displaced by the floods.
So far, only a few have moved in.
It's difficult to get people to Cox's Bazar.
The enthusiasm also persists in Grenezn.
Who previously had a house, it was still so small and resembled a hut, often does not want to spend his life in a large apartment block.
Many apartments are empty, but - as the government wants it - will soon be occupied by those who have lost their house due to the floods.

Argentina rejects creditors' counter offer
The new demands could not be met, the Ministry of Economy in Buenos Aires announced on Saturday.
"That would not only be irresponsible, but also unfair," it said in a statement.
"While 50 percent of children in Argentina live in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors."
The debt of the second-largest economy in South America is no longer sustainable under current conditions.
That is why Argentina is demanding that its private creditors waive part of their claims of around 66 billion US dollars (around 59 billion euros).
If no agreement is reached, the country is again threatened with state bankruptcy.
It would be the ninth default in Argentina's history.
Lenders had recently called for higher interest rates on government bonds and changes to some contractual clauses.
However, the Argentine government is sticking to its last offer and is not prepared to make any further concessions.
Argentina is in the midst of a severe financial and economic crisis.
The inflation rate was recently more than 50 percent.
For the current year, experts expect economic power to decline by around ten percent.
At the end of May, Argentina had not settled interest claims amounting to 503 million US dollars and had thus slipped into a limited default.
Professionally arrived - privately not yet
"It's going super well" - this is the conclusion drawn by Dr. Stefanie Kramer after her first days in the notary's office in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything went very quickly: In mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she will succeed Lutz Feller in the notarial office in Eggenfelden.
Already six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the doctor of law took up the work, the normal day-to-day business has long been running at full speed.
"Privately, however, I still have to arrive," she explains in an interview with the Rottaler Anzeiger and laughs.
The short lead time was of course not enough to completely relocate the centre of life from Regensburg to Eggenfelden, reports the native Dingolfinger.
She and her husband, who works as a judge at the regional court in Regensburg, are currently looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city.
At least her husband was still able to apply for parental leave at short notice in order to be able to guarantee the care of the two daughters (3 ½ and 1 ½ years old).
In order not to have to commute every day from Regensburg, she also has overnight accommodation with her parents in Dingolfing, explains the 39-year-old.
Raised in the neighbouring district, the city of Eggenfelden has of course long been known to her.
During visits on site with her family in recent months, she found out again: "Eggenfelden is a really beautiful small town".
She was all the more pleased that she had won the race in the selection process for the vacant position.
Her native Lower Bavaria also plays a central role in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's professional career: After studying law in Passau, she completed her legal traineeship and the 2nd state examination in Regensburg.
After several positions as a notary assessor, including in Rehau and Hof in Upper Franconia, Babenhausen in Unterallgäu and Regensburg - during this time she also "incidentally" shouldered her doctorate in employment law - she took up her first position as a notary in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau in 2012.
In 2016, she took parental leave, which was finally followed by the move to Regensburg.
Since then she has taken over representation services in various notarial offices.
When the position in Eggenfelden was advertised because of the approaching retirement of Lutz Feller, she saw the right time for full professional re-entry, explains the 39-year-old.
The team of her predecessor, who will take over the holiday replacement in the notarial office in the future, has completely taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer - and immediately has a praise for the team of the law firm ready: "It's going super well!"
The fact that she can rely on well-rehearsed processes here makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming relocation of her private centre of life.
In terms of kindergarten and nursery places, she has already made contact with a local institution.
And everything works out as desired, she hopes to be able to pursue her hobby here soon - and get to know the most beautiful jogging routes in the Rottal.
BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be filled to 20 percent at the start of the season in the event of a fan return.
"Due to the distance regulation, which is mandatory to comply with, we are currently planning with 12,000 to 15,000 spectators," said Borussia Dortmund's managing director Carsten Cramer to the "Tagesspiegel".
Normally, the arena in the Revierstadt holds slightly more than 81,000 spectators at Bundesliga matches.
In the ghost games of last season caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BVB had lost around four million euros per game.
Cramer, who is responsible for marketing, digitalization and internationalization at BVB, hopes that in addition to the normal spectator seats, some of the approximately 4000 seats in the hospitality area can also be opened again: "It is of course a blow to the office if these revenues completely break away."
In view of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, everyone is currently "well advised to take a stable page length for the time being."
"If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people in Germany alone are on short-time work, then the need for entertainment is limited," explained Cramer.
The Dortmund marketing boss praised the BVB pros for their partial salary waiver, which is intended to help overcome the crisis: "Of course, the players know that their salary waiver has a different effect than if we put 100 people who work in merchandising on short-time work."
Tiny miracles: Early start to life with a few hundred grams
Hardly heavier than a pack of butter, just three tablespoons of blood in his entire body: That was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The boy is one of around 400 premature babies who are cared for annually at the Children's Hospital in Graz.
A quarter of them weigh less than 1,500 grams, a few - like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael - are extreme lightweights with a birth weight of less than one kilogram.
They are so small and born so early that neither lungs, nor intestines, nor muscles are fully developed.
Their skin is sometimes so tender that they could injure the electrodes of an ECG.
And they are so tiny that they sometimes wear doll clothes and mini diapers made especially for them.
But not so small that they wouldn't have a voice - "and how," smiles Berndt Urlesberger.
"Even if, of course, they don't scream as loudly as big babies."
When the Whiteboard Becomes a Stage
Despite Corona Theater in the classroom: The whiteboard as a stage experienced the 9th grades of the Sankt-Jakobus-Gymnasium in Abtsgmünd shortly before the start of the holidays.
Actress Julia Sylvester from the Theater der Stadt Aalen presented the pupils with the production "Das Heimatkleid" - via video.
Afterwards, the students were able to talk via Skype with the actress and the director Winfried Tobias about the play and the performance.
The idea for the performance format was born from the current corona situation.
Teacher Teresa Nar was happy about the enrichment of the lessons.
Even if in the end all participants agreed that the direct encounter in the theater and stage space would still offer additional stimuli, the theater also sees the potential for contact with the schools.
"If we continue to improve the technical framework, this could be an interesting addition to the game," said director Winfried Tobias.
First round drawn: TSV 1860 would face Eintracht Frankfurt in the DFB Cup
Should TSV 1860 qualify for the DFB Cup, the Lions will face Eintracht Frankfurt in the first round.
This was the result of the draw on Sunday.
Munich - Sixty possible opponents in the first round of the DFB Cup have been determined.
The lions would meet Eintracht Frankfurt in a successful qualification.
This was the result of the draw on Sunday evening in the ARD sports show.
Because the field of participants is not yet complete due to the COVID-19 pandemic, placeholders were used in the draw.
Due to the voluntary waiver of semi-final opponent FC Memmingen, TSV 1860 is already in the final of the Bavarian Toto Cup (4 or 5 September).
There the lions meet either the Würzburger Kickers or Viktoria Aschaffenburg.
Should second division climber Würzburg reach the final, Sechzig would already be firmly qualified for the first round in the DFB Cup.
Otherwise, the Giesinger would have to prevail in the final against Regional League side Aschaffenburg.
The first round of the DFB Cup will take place between 11 and 14 September and thus one week before the third-league start.
"Gone with the Wind": Film legend Olivia de Havilland is dead
Film legend and Oscar winner Olivia de Havilland is dead.
She died a natural death on Sunday in Paris at the age of 104, her spokeswoman for the German Press Agency confirmed.
De Havilland was known for her role as Melanie Hamilton in the Southern epic "Gone with the Wind" (1939).
Born in Tokyo to British parents, Olivia de Havilland moved to California as a toddler.
The Austrian theater man Max Reinhardt discovered the 19-year-old in the role of Hermia in Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream."
The film studio Warner Brothers signed her for seven years and brought her out big at the side of Eroll Flynn.
She shot eight movies with the heartbreaker.
In 1946 she won her first Oscar in the leading role of "To Each His Own."
The film ran in Germany under the title "Mutterherz."
Three years later came the award for best actress in William Wyler's "The Heiress."
She also received a lot of recognition as a neurotic eccentric in "Der dunkle Spiegel" and "Die Schlangengrube."
Daphne du Maurier suggested her in 1952 for the leading role in the film adaptation of her novel "My Cousine Rachel".
The play became a worldwide success.
With her long-time friend Bette Davis she played in "Lullaby for a Corpse."
The marriage with the writer Marcus Goodrich (1946 to 1953) produced the son Benjamin.
In Paris de Havilland married the journalist Pierre Paul Galante and had the daughter Gisèle with him.
This marriage also broke up.
Rumors of an affair with former British Prime Minister Edward Heath have never been confirmed.
"Road to Timmendorf": Beach volleyball: Thole / Wickler miss final at comeback
The World Cup runners-up Julius Thole and Clemens Wickler missed the final at the beach volleyball tournament "Road to Timmendorf."
At the meeting of the top teams in Düsseldorf they were defeated in the semi-final by their national team colleagues Nils Ehlers and Lars Flüggen with 1:2 (17:21, 21:17, 19:21).
Most recently, Thole / Wickler had played at the World Tour Final in Rome in September of last year.
In the final on the Rhine, their conquerors Ehlers / Flüggen suffered a defeat against the surprise team Lukas Pfretschner and his interim partner Steven van de Velde with 0:2 (17:21, 17:21).
In addition to the show tournament, three starting places for the German Championships were played out in Timmendorfer Strand at the beginning of September: The tickets were secured by Armin Dollinger / Simon Kulzer, Manuel Harms / Richard Peemüller and Simon Pfretschner / Milan Sievers.
Kalbitz expulsion from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "Feigenblatt"
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is from the point of view of the FDP only a "fig leaf" and does not change the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the extreme right in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the tip of the iceberg of radicals in the AfD, "FDP politician Benjamin Strasser told the dpa news agency in Berlin.
The Federal Arbitration Court of the AfD had confirmed on Saturday in Stuttgart, after several hours of hearings, the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Executive Board had decided by a majority in May.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD parliamentary group in the Brandenburg state parliament.
"If the AfD really wanted to consistently remove right-wing extremists from its party, functionaries like Björn Höcke and his supporters would have been excluded long ago," said Strasser.
"However, there is no political will for this in the AfD, because right-wing extremism is now part of the party."
CSU General Secretary Markus Blume expressed a similar view: "The fact that Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded says nothing and does not change anything," he told "Welt am Sonntag."
"Rather, it speaks volumes how many frenetic supporters a right-wing extremist in the middle of the AfD still has."
Blume assumes that the AfD will again land below five percent in elections in the future.
"The days of the AfD in parliaments are numbered."
Kalbitz was one of the spokesmen of the now officially dissolved "wing" around the Thuringian AfD state and parliamentary party chairman Björn Höcke; the Office for the Protection of the Constitution classifies the extension as a "secured right-wing extremist endeavor."
In May, the AfD federal executive threw Kalbitz out of the party.
As a reason, he stated that when he joined the party, Kalbitz had not stated an earlier membership in the now banned right-wing extremist "Heimattreue Deutsche Jugend" (HDJ) and among the Republicans.
Kalbitz denies membership in the HDJ.
The chairman of the left-wing fraction in the Brandenburg state parliament, Sebastian Walter, also stressed that the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court did not change the character of the AfD: "The wolf has only eaten chalk.
The AfD remains a far-right party, whether with or without Kalbitz. "
This decision would neither weaken the federal party nor the right wing.
"The manoeuvre of the Meuthen troops is transparent.
They want to avoid further observation by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution and are trying to get through under the radar, "said Walter.
"The AfD won't get rid of the ghosts it called.
An expulsion does not change anything, "commented the Brandenburg SPD General Secretary Erik Stohn on the decision in the Kalbitz case.
"Here, the AfD regional association and the parliamentary group have remained their right-wing leader to this day."
The legal dispute over Kalbitz's membership in the AfD will continue.
The latter announced on Saturday that he would now take civil action against the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court.
North Sea wind farms deliver a good 21 percent more electricity
The wind power plants on the German North Sea fed 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity into the grid in the first six months of the year.
That is a good 21 percent more than in the same period of the previous year, announced the network operator Tennet in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of the North Sea electricity to the mainland and the transmission through the German electricity grid.
The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of Tennet's grid area, have fed in a further 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
Overall, wind power from the North and Baltic Seas thus comes to 13.73 TWh, compared to a good 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind harvest at sea thus accounts for almost 19 percent of total wind power in Germany; that is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms ensure higher generation capacities
In addition to the wind conditions, the increased contribution of offshore wind energy results from higher generation capacities because new wind farms have been connected to the grid in the past twelve months.
If the 1270 wind power plants in the North Sea were all running at full power at the same time, they could mathematically generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient for this; according to Tennet, it is 7.1 gigawatts.
It is expected to rise to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea by 2030.
"By then, we will be investing 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore grid connections in Germany and the Netherlands," said Tennet Managing Director Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, wind farms cannot make full use of their capacity even at sea, but reach around 40 percent.
The previous record day this year is January 2, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind turbines produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, which corresponds to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could supply almost seven million households with electricity.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the Gmünder Kunstverein.
That was almost a small anniversary celebration for the 130th anniversary.
Birthday of the Gmünder Kunstverein: The exhibition opening "Skirmish" with works by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold went beyond the usual framework after the corona break.
Many more art lovers than usual followed the dialogue between the artist and the chairman of the Kunstverein, Professor Dr. Klaus Ripper.
The musical equivalent was provided by the band "Defenders of the Universe" on the southern Kornhausplatz.
The association "Sandtogether" was active north of the gallery.
Freital: Windbergfest cancelled due to corona
The Windbergfest will not take place this year.
The city of Freital has cancelled the three-day festival planned for September.
In other years, over 30,000 people had attended this city festival.
"We really did not make this decision easy for ourselves and - aware of how difficult it is economically for those involved - hoped until the last minute," explained Lord Mayor Uwe Rumberg (non-partisan).
"But ultimately, as organizers, we are responsible for the health of many thousands of people."
Because if tens of thousands had flocked to the festival grounds and the marquee, minimum distances, hygiene regulations and contact tracking in accordance with the current corona protection regulation could not have been complied with.
Or the restrictions would have been so strong that not much would have remained of a folk festival.
In addition, the organizational and monitoring effort would increase disproportionately many times over.
Rumberg put off on next year.
Then the city of Freital will celebrate its 100th anniversary, including the Winterbergfest from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the Day of the Saxons from 10 to 12 September 2021.
Dressage Olympic champion Werth in Achleiten unbeatable
Achleiten - The six-time Olympic champion Isabell Werth was the outstanding rider at the dressage tournament in Achleiten, Austria.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg came to four victories at four starts at the weekend.
After she had won a Grand Prix at the start with Weihegold and Quantaz, she was also unbeatable on Sunday in the Grand Prix Special and in the freestyle.
On the 15-year-old mare Weihegold, Werth clearly prevailed in the Special on Sunday against the Austrian Victoria Max-Theurer on Abegglen.
Also in the freestyle, the German was clearly ahead of her 34-year-old student Victoria Max-Theurer on Saturday on Quantaz.
Werth's winning horse Quantaz belongs to Max-Theurer.
The most successful dressage rider in the world is to establish the ten-year-old stallion in the Grand Prix.
For Quantaz it was the first freestyle ever.
Werth had already won all four important tests at the first tournament in Achleiten three weeks ago.
The last of the three international tournaments is scheduled for August 14-16.
More air traffic controllers in Worms in the future
The University of Applied Sciences in Worms continues to take to the skies: "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" endows a professorship for "Air Traffic Management."
A corresponding contract between the university and DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially concluded for three years and will start in 2021.
With the professorship, it is possible to start studies not only in the summer, but also in the winter semester.
This means that twice as many students can be trained as before.
At the same time, capacities at both the university and the DFS Academy of Air Navigation Services will be equally utilized.
DFS will advise the university on the establishment and appointment of the professorship.
Represented at the university since 2019
Since the summer semester 2019, the first students have been in the Air Traffic Management degree programme as part of their training as air traffic controllers at Worms University of Applied Sciences.
Nine students have already started this year.
So far, the experiences of DFS have been very positive, and the performance of the students has been outstanding.
The combination of studies and pilot training contributes significantly to further increasing the attractiveness of the pilot profession.
"In these times, funding is not easy for us economically.
However, we firmly expect air traffic to recover and grow again in the long term.
In order to be able to fulfil our legal mandate in the future, we need highly qualified personnel, "says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, Chairman and CEO of DFS, at the signing of the contract.
"For DFS, the endowed professorship is a future-proof investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, interdisciplinary knowledge base in the long term.
We are therefore continuing the good cooperation with the university and at the same time underpinning our attractiveness as an employer. "
This is also underlined by Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of Worms University of Applied Sciences: "The endowed professorship forms an important bridge between science and industry.
With it, we would like to build on the existing cooperation with DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual bachelor's degree programme in Air Traffic Management. "
The trust of Deutsche Flugsicherung is both a motivation and an obligation for Worms University of Applied Sciences to further expand its teaching and research expertise in the future-oriented fields of aviation.
Working for the air traffic controllers of tomorrow, the university can set very special highlights and innovative priorities for its students with the first endowed professorship for a dual course of study.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary in the Ministry of Science, Continuing Education and Culture, emphasises: "With its focus on air transport, Worms University of Applied Sciences has a unique selling point in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Today's signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the university's profile. "
Rescue screwdriver lands on the A 45
About 30 minutes, the A 45 motorway was completely closed on Saturday afternoon in the direction of Aschaffenburg, as the rescue helicopter was in use after a traffic accident.
A 76-year-old drove straight ahead in the curve with a Ford around 12.40 in the Alzenau-Mitte exit and landed at the guardrail.
Due to the impact, the front airbags triggered, the driver suffered minor injuries to his face and had to be taken to a hospital for treatment.
The injuries of the 72-year-old co-driver were treated by the emergency doctor and the patient was then flown to a hospital by rescue helicopter.
Currently, however, the police assume that there is no danger to life.
The damaged vehicle, which suffered damage of around 2000 euros, had to be towed away.
Heil wants to examine other industries after meat industry
The COVID-19 crisis brought conditions in parts of the meat industry back to light.
Law tightening is imminent.
But are they right - and will they stay that way?
Federal Minister of Labour Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to examine other sectors after the now planned strict regulations against grievances in the meat industry.
"We will look at industry by industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective industry if necessary," said Heil to the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany's employers are already warning against restricting contracts for work and services in general.
After the massive corona outbreak at the meat giant Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet wants to pass a law of salvation this Wednesday.
Large-scale slaughterhouses should no longer be allowed to employ external personnel for slaughter, cutting and meat processing.
For this purpose, the use of contract and temporary workers is to be prohibited there.
Employer president Ingo Kramer told dpa: "Stay away from a general restriction on work contracts and temporary employment if you don't want to completely strangle the economy."
Contracts for work and services are, for example, for wide areas of trade, the construction industry and plant engineering necessarily the basis for their added value for the customer.
"The failings of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument."
Heil assured: "My goal is not to ban contracts for work and services everywhere in the German economy."
Work contracts make sense.
"If an industrial company commissions a craftsman to install a security system, this is a completely normal work contract."
The German meat industry considers a ban on contracts for work and temporary work to be unconstitutional in its sector alone.
It cannot be explained why different labour law should apply to the portioning and packaging of cheese in the future than to sausages, it says in a statement on the proposed law, as reported by the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Saturday).
In the event of a ban, the consumer price would rise by 10 to 20 percent per kilo and product.
According to the results of an examination by the North Rhine-Westphalia Occupational Safety and Health Administration, many Eastern European employees from work contract companies worked in the industry, sometimes 16 hours a day.
Often they had no rest.
Wage was withheld for protective equipment or rent.
It was also noted that the situation regarding the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Heil said that a relatively harsh law had already entered into force for the meat industry in 2017.
However, these were circumvented by "tricky constructions."
"Now we have to clean up fundamentally."
The politician announced: "The Occupational Safety and Health Act, which we want to adopt in the cabinet at the end of July, also includes measures that not only affect the meat industry - for example, higher testing rates for occupational health and safety or clear criteria for communal accommodation."
The draft submitted to dpa includes amendments to the Act on the Protection of Workers' Rights in the Meat Industry and the Occupational Health and Safety Act.
Brandenburg's consumer protection minister Ursula Nonnemacher (Green Party) considers more intensive controls necessary.
"I would like us to be able to carry out even more inspections in many supervisory areas: food inspections, animal welfare, everything possible, for example animal transport," said Nonnemacher on Sunday in the RBB programme "Brandenburg aktuell."
But more personnel positions are also needed for more controls.
Three dead in crash of microlight aircraft in Germany
According to the police, three people died in the crash of an ultralight aircraft on an apartment building in Wesel in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia.
One child was slightly injured.
Two more people were rescued injured in the accident, said a spokesman for the district control center in Wesel.
A parachute was found at the scene of the accident, according to the police.
The "Rheinische Post" reported, citing eyewitnesses, that the plane had collided with a hot-air balloon before the crash.
The house is a single or two-family house.
Further details were not known at first.
Eviction of Frankfurter Opernplatz proceeding peacefully
One week after the riots in Frankfurt, the evacuation of the Opernplatz in the night to Sunday was also peaceful.
Finally, a few dozen people were still on the square, but left it before the curfew began at 1 o'clock.
The police had been in action since the early evening with numerous officers, a larger police presence could be seen throughout the city.
For the first time, this weekend from midnight, there was a ban on entering Opernplatz, where there had been riots a week ago.
Policemen had been attacked with bottles from the crowd of revellers.
According to police reports, at least five officers were injured and several police vehicles were damaged.
The night to Saturday had also remained quiet.
Car rolls over: Young woman seriously injured in accident on federal highway 83 near Hofgeismar
A 21-year-old suffered serious injuries in an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme on Sunday at around 1: 25 p.m.
She was taken to the Kassel Hospital.
The fire department used thermal imaging cameras to look for potential passengers.
According to the police, the woman was on the road on federal highway 83 in the direction of her place of residence, Hümme, when her car drifted off the road for unknown reasons and rolled over several times.
In order to save the victims, the fire department had to cut open the roof of the car.
Since it was unclear whether someone was still in the vehicle, the adjacent corn field was searched from the turntable ladder with a thermal imaging camera.
The drone squadron from Warburg, which also works with thermal imaging cameras, had also been ordered for the search for persons.
However, the volunteers did not find anyone between the tall maize plants.
The seriously injured woman was taken by ambulance to the hospital in Kassel for further care.
Almost 50 firefighters from the Hofgeismar, Hümme and Schöneberg fire brigades were on site.
The main road was closed for two hours because of the accident.
Juventus Turin champions in Italy
Turin - After a redeeming goal from Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin has secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in a row.
The team around the five-time world footballer made the total of 36th Scudetto of the club's history perfect with a 2: 0 (1: 0) on Sunday evening in the home game against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo scored 1:0 before half-time.
With 83 points, Turin, which competed without the last long-injured ex-national player Sami Khedira, can no longer be displaced from first place two matchdays before the end of the Serie A season.
The runner-up Inter Milan is seven points behind.
Juventus was harmless despite optical superiority in the first half, then Ronaldo scored after a free kick variant with the last action.
The 35-year-old scored a pass from Miralem Pjanic directly from the penalty area border with a flat shot (45th + 7).
Against the now more offensive guests Ronaldo was also involved in the 2: 0, after his shot Federico Bernardeschi (67th) dusted off.
This secured the lackluster but decisive success.
The foul missed to the bar in the 89th minute should only have eaten Ronaldo himself with a view to the goal scorer rating.
"It's complicated to stay mentally and physically at ball level for 90 minutes.
The games are weird, and momentum is changing very slightly, "explained coach Maurizio Sarri after the 1-2 win at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Above all, the mental exhaustion of his players is great, said the Juve coach.
Because of the defeat, the people of Turin had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
The reassuring lead in the championship lead at the end was mainly due to the weakness of the competitors.
Because in the eleven games before the game on Sunday, the Sarri team had only managed five victories.
Whether Ronaldo will also be the top scorer is questionable.
Because while the Portuguese superstar has scored 31 goals so far, the former Dortmund Ciro Immobile has already scored 34 goals on his account after his pack of three in the 5: 1 (1: 1) of fourth-placed Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to FC Bayern's title win.
The record in Italy is held by the current Juventus pro Gonzalo Higuaín.
The Argentinean scored 36 goals for SSC Napoli in the 2015 / 2016 season.
In August, the next title chance awaits the "old lady" of Italian football.
Juventus is in the last 16 of the Champions League, but has to make up for a 0-1 first-leg bust against Olympique Lyon on 7 August in order to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next knockout round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would be waiting as opponents.
Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal car races recorded
Stuttgart - Despite all threatened penalties and court rulings, motorists continue to step on the gas in countless illegal races on the roads of Baden-Württemberg: In the past year and the first four months of this year, the police in the southwest have already registered more than 250 illegal car races.
There are no comparable values for the years before, but the speeders are increasingly making work for the judicial authorities: At the public prosecutor's offices between Konstanz and Mannheim, a total of 155 investigations for illegal races were conducted in 2018, a year later there were already 252 and in the current year by the beginning of June already 151.
The races were less about organized events, as can be seen from the response of the Ministry of the Interior to an inquiry by the Landtag-SPD.
In most cases, the drivers competed against each other spontaneously or they fled from the police - this is also reported as an illegal race.
The drivers were mainly German men between the ages of 18 and 60.
113 fines - 15 times imprisonment
Only in comparatively few cases are the speeders caught and also asked to pay: According to the Ministry of the Interior, a total of 113 fines have been imposed and 15 prison sentences pronounced since 2018.
However, there are no indications that the number of illegal car races is actually increasing.
Rather, because of the numerous tragic accidents and trials of past years, other drivers reacted more sensitively than before and reported more frequently, said a ministry spokesman.
Autobahn 8 is particularly popular with racers. Again and again, drivers brake the traffic there to make room for themselves and use the free track for a race.
Last August, a dozen drivers were caught near Kirchheim unter Teck, three months earlier there were even 18 drivers on the A8 near Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular "racetrack"
On the A81, the police even registered more races than on any other federal highway.
With a speed limit there is an attempt to slow down the speeders on the particularly affected section between Engen and Geisingen.
The mostly high-priced and pimped-up sports and luxury cars often have Swiss license plates, because the drivers move to the lawn in Germany because of the high penalties for driving too fast and car racing in the neighboring country.
For the SPD, the speed limit must not be reduced to a few distances: "With a general speed limit of 130 kilometers per hour, we would get rid of this problem on motorways," says Martin Rivoir, the traffic expert of the SPD parliamentary group.
"The inhibition threshold for speeders would be significantly higher if one were not allowed to travel legally here and there at 200 kilometers per hour and more."
Rivoir thinks less of education or image campaigns: "Anyone who ignores all rules in such a way and puts not only their own lives, but also the lives of other road users at risk, can hardly be reached with reason."
ADAC demands stronger crackdown by the police
For the ADAC, however, this is not enough: "We assume that racers will not be deterred by the speed limits," says Holger Bach, Head of Transport and Environment at ADAC Württemberg.
He calls for additional and also tougher controls on the affected routes.
Not infrequently, the high-speed trial of strength turns into painful and momentous seriousness: Since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people across the country have died in the races, two of them uninvolved in a nightly crash in Stuttgart's city centre and one in Gerlingen.
Two young men are said to have delivered a car race there in November.
One of the vehicles came off the road, crashed into a garden wall and remained lying on the side, the 18-year-old co-driver died.
21 other people were injured in the races of the past two years.
However, in the opinion of Minister of the Interior Thomas Strobl, stricter penalties are not necessary: "Legislative action to sanction illegal motor vehicle races more severely is not seen," says the paper of the Ministry of the Interior.
Blue light from July 23: Thirsty burglar steals drinks from snack bar
Rohrdorf: A man broke into a snack bar in Rohrdorf (Calw district) on Thursday and stole drinks and cash.
A witness heard noises in the valley road around 3: 40 a.m. and ran in the direction of the snack bar.
There he noticed a man who helped himself with drinks at the fridge and then left the snack bar through a previously smashed entrance door.
The perpetrator fled in the direction of the meadows behind the snack bar.
According to the police, the burglar also served himself at a cash register and stole cash in the low three-digit range.
The suspect is described as follows: He is about 1.75 to 1.80 meters tall and of strong stature.
In fact, he was wearing a black hoodie, black trousers and light shoes.
The police accept further evidence from witnesses.
Ackermann sprints to victory on final stage at Sibiu Tour
Professional cyclist Pascal Ackermann has won his second stage victory on the final stage of the 10th Sibiu Tour.
The 26-year-old from the Palatinate from the Bora-hansgrohe team prevailed in the mass sprint on the 109-kilometre section with start and finish in Sibiu, after he had already won a stage on Saturday.
It was the season victories three and four for Ackermann.
In the overall classification, his Austrian team mate Gregor Mühlberger prevailed.
The 26-year-old had confidently won the mountain time trial in the morning and thus took the lead in the classification.
Only 104 riders had entered the final stage in the evening.
No less than 18 starters had fallen victim to the time limit in the mountain time trial.
"I'm really happy to start the new season with a win," said Ackermann after his success on Saturday.
"The sprint was really hectic," said the 26-year-old.
300 meters before the finish, he simply put on his sprint, "and it worked out perfectly."
According to the rules of the world association UCI, a corona test was carried out on all race participants and their companions six days before the start of the race.
During the entire tour, drivers and supervisors were separated from the organization team and the media in isolated hygiene bubbles.
Spectators at the start and finish were not allowed.
Control center gave instructions for lay resuscitation
Düsseldorf - Tragic accident on Sunday afternoon in Düsseldorf-Garath.
In an apartment building, a child (4) was suddenly lying lifeless in the water while bathing.
According to the fire brigade, the emergency call arrived shortly before 13 o'clock.
"A control center dispatcher immediately gave instructions for lay resuscitation," said a fire spokesman to BILD.
The arriving rescue workers took over the resuscitation measures a little later.
The child, who was in mortal danger, was transported to the university hospital under resuscitation.
Why it had an accident is unclear.
The police have routinely begun investigations into the course of the accident.
The fire spokesman: "We assume a tragic accident in the apartment."
Nuremberg: Unauthorized tuning meeting - Police intervene, 700 vehicles and around 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and at times over 1000 people participated Saturday night in a "tuning meeting" in the parking lot of a furniture store.
The police implemented their announcement to increase their control of such events.
A big tuning meeting took place on Saturday evening (25 July 2020) in the southern part of Nuremberg.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the police of Middle Franconia, around 10: 30 p.m., the Nuremberg traffic police found an increased number of vehicles in the area of a large parking lot in Ingolstädter Straße.
As a result, the police carried out a large number of vehicle inspections there.
Only recently, the police had announced that they wanted to take stronger action against so-called autoposers.
Illegal tuning meeting in Nuremberg: Only a small part of the "scene"
The officials counted at the top a good 700 vehicles and about 1100 people, reports the police.
Of this, however, only a small part of those present can be assigned to the "autoposer" and tuning scene.
Apparently, most of the relevant scene complied with the appeal of the police.
On the basis of the vehicles and persons located on site, it can be assumed that these were predominantly onlookers.
In addition, the vast majority of those present adhered to the applicable infection protection regulations, in particular compliance with the minimum distance and wearing a mouth-nose protection.
The control measures carried out on site were completed around 1: 00 am.
In total, the officials found such structural changes in 10 vehicles that the operating permit had expired.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No car races
There were no illegal car races.
"The police headquarters in Middle Franconia will continue to keep an eye on what is happening and will continue to carry out increased control measures, also in connection with the appearance of onlookers," it said.
The agency News5 spoke with Jürgen Schrödinger from the towing company involved: "They all have beautiful rims, we must not scratch them," says Schrödinger.
Special tapes would be used for this purpose.
Also because the cars are wider, the company must be careful not to cause any damage.
"After all, the young people should get their cars back unscathed."
Figures from the employment agency: 900 suspected cases of abuse in short-time work
Berlin - According to its own statement, the Federal Employment Agency (BA) is investigating around 900 suspected cases of abuse of short-time work allowances.
"This is extremely little for more than 880,000 companies that have reported short-time work," said Daniel Terzenbach, the executive board member responsible for operations, to the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung."
When, at the start of the COVID-19 crisis, many companies suddenly applied for short-time work, the BA had to react quickly.
Normally, the exam takes up to three weeks.
"So much time was not available to us in this hot phase.
We will take a closer look at the final accounts.
There will certainly be some more to come.
We're not naive and have a lot of staying power. "
Indications of abuse often come from the affected employees or trade unions.
In addition, the BA uses analysis software to detect abuse patterns.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is preparing for a possible wave of insolvency in the autumn.
"Will there be significantly more insolvencies than in the previous year?
The assessments differ, but we are preparing ourselves for the event of the case and are already training our employees in the employment agencies for processing applications for insolvency money. "
The figures are still inconspicuous, said Terzenbach.
World Heritage in Potsdam: Party in the New Garden dissolved
Potsdam - On Friday evening, about 40 young people celebrated a party in the New Garden.
The collection was dissolved at 20.48 by the district drivers of the Stiftung Preußische Schlösser und Gärten (SPSG), the foundation informed on PNN request.
The young people then left the park.
On Saturday evening, some young people would have played rugby in the New Garden.
The meadow had been cleared by district drivers, said SPSG spokesman Frank Kallensee on Sunday.
Again and again there are illegal celebrations in the parks
In the Foundation's parks, there are repeated accumulations in which the distance and hygiene rules of the COVID-19 Handling Ordinance are not observed.
At the end of June there was a celebration with about 300 people in the Park Babelsberg, a week later about 150 people celebrated in the New Garden.
Even without a corona ordinance, the parks are closed at nightfall.
Storage on the meadows is prohibited according to park regulations, there are only a few exceptions.
The foundation has been complaining for some time that visitors are leaving more and more rubbish behind and destroying protected biotopes.
In Berlin, illegal park parties have meanwhile reached another dimension.
In the Hasenheide in the district of Neukölln, 5000 people celebrated an illegal techno party on Sunday night.
The event was broken up by the police.
Austria: Mass tests after corona outbreak in tourist resort
Authorities have responded to a corona outbreak in the popular Upper Austrian tourist resort of St. Wolfgang with hundreds of tests.
The number of confirmed cases rose to 48, according to the state authorities in Linz.
More than 100 results were still outstanding in the evening.
Accordingly, many of the infected are young interns in tourism businesses, but at least one holiday guest was tested positive.
Residents, guests and tourism staff were asked to stay in their accommodations on Saturday night.
The curfew was set at 23 o'clock.
"There are cancellations and cancellations there and there" of bookings, said the head of the Wolfgangsee Tourism Association, Hans Wieser, to the dpa.
Sporadic guests also left early.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist resort in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 overnight stays last year.
In a normal season, around one third of the guests are Germans.
On Friday, the first infections became public knowledge.
The head of the district authority, Alois Lanz, defended on Saturday the behavior of the interns, who had celebrated in several restaurants and could have been infected there.
"We all enjoyed doing this in our youth," he told the radio station Ö1.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The tourism association launched an information campaign to raise awareness among young employees of the dangers of COVID-19.
Starting on Saturday, hundreds of employees, holidaymakers and locals were tested.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang from 15 July were contacted.
The outbreak evokes memories of the Austrian ski and party resort of Ischgl in Tyrol, which was a center of the spread of COVID-19 throughout Europe in the early stages of the pandemic.
In total, more than 1500 people in Austria are currently infected with the virus.
The focus of new infections is on Vienna and Upper Austria.
Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualified for Champions League
London (dpa) - The English football record champions Manchester United are returning to the Champions League after a year of absence.
The Red Devils secured third place in the league on the last day of the Premier League by a 2: 0 (0: 0) success against their direct competitor Leicester City.
The Foxes now have to be content with the Europa League, because FC Chelsea still passed by and also qualified for the premier class in fourth place.
In the fight against the descent, Aston Villa was allowed to cheer.
Manchester United took the lead with a penalty kick from Bruno Fernandes (71st minute).
After a red card for Leicester City in injury time, Jesse Lingard (90 + 8) scored to the final score.
Chelsea, in the Champions League round of 16 opponent of FC Bayern, won thanks to Mason Mount (45th + 1) and Olivier Giroud (45th + 4) in parallel with 2: 0 (2: 0) against the Wolverhampton Wanderers.
"That means a lot to me," said coach Frank Lampard, who in his first season as Chelsea coach is also in the FA Cup final against Arsenal.
Chelsea's victory against Wolverhampton also benefited Tottenham Hotspur, who passed the Wolves with a meagre 1: 1 (1: 0) at Crystal Palace and started sixth in the Europa League.
Aston Villa decided the long-distance duel with FC Watford and AFC Bournemouth for itself, but had to tremble for a long time for the league at West Ham United.
The late lead of Jack Grealish (84th) was immediately compensated by Andrej Yarmolenko (85th).
The 1: 1 (0: 0) was enough, however, because Watford lost 2: 3 (1: 3) to Arsenal.
The club, which lost three coaches in the season, is relegated after five first-league years.
Just like Bournemouth, which could no longer save itself by a 3: 1 (2: 1) at Everton FC.
In the end, one point was missing.
Liverpool FC, which has been the English champion since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3: 1 (1: 1) victory at Newcastle United.
99 points are the highest score the Reds have ever scored in a football season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp and his team narrowly missed the points record in English football.
Manchester City holds the record with 100 points in the 2017 / 18 season.
After the Newcastle lead in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38th), Divock Origi (59th) and Sadio Mané (89th) turned Sunday's game for Liverpool.
"It was an extraordinary season for this wonderful club," said goalscorer van Dijk after the game, "that should spur us on to defend the title.
It will be difficult. "
The Premier League bosses should also be satisfied in the end.
Due to the coronavirus crisis, football operations in England were interrupted from 13 March to 17 June.
In the meantime, it was even discussed about a premature termination or a holding of the remaining games on neutral ground.
Finally, however, the season could be played to the end without special incidents - but as in Germany without spectators in the stadiums.
Arrests and violence at demonstrations against Netanyahu
The protests in Israel against Prime Minister Netanyahu are becoming increasingly fierce.
During the night there were violent clashes.
The Israeli police took violent action on Sunday night in Jerusalem against participants in a demonstration against the right-wing conservative Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu.
Twelve people have been arrested for participating in riots, said police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld.
Among other things, the police used water cannons to disperse the rally.
According to media reports, a total of around 6,000 people gathered near Netanyahu's official residence on Saturday evening.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu's handling of the COVID-19 crisis.
The protesters beat drums, blew horns, and called on Netanyahu to resign.
Participants in a counter-demonstration who supported Netanyahu have also been arrested, reported the news website "ynet."
People also demonstrated in many other places in Israel, including in front of the head of government's private villa in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
According to the police, a man was arrested near Tel Aviv because he is suspected of having sprayed pepper spray from a moving car onto demonstrators on the roadside.
Another man was arrested after a stabbing attack on a demonstrator in the south of the country.
The demonstrator was slightly injured in the neck.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv there have recently been several demonstrations against Netanyahu.
The rallies accompany the corruption trial against the head of government.
Recently, Netanyahu has also been criticized for his handling of the COVID-19 crisis.
He is accused, among other things, of hasty easing and a lack of preparation for a second wave of COVID-19.
The COVID-19 crisis has hit the country's economy hard.
The unemployment rate recently stood at more than 20 percent.
The number of new infections with the coronavirus in Israel has recently risen to ever new record levels.
Accident near Ahlen (NRW) - Transporter crashes on car - nine injured - Ruhrgebiet - Bild.de
Ahlen - A rear-end collision demanded nine minor injuries on Saturday afternoon on the B58 near Ahlen.
A female driver was traveling with her two children (3, 5) in the direction of Beckum.
The police: "Presumably she had suddenly braked because she wanted to turn."
The driver of a Mercedes van, who was driving behind her, must have seen that too late.
He crashed into the back of the car.
In the accident, three occupants in the car and six in the van were slightly injured.
Several ambulances took her to a nearby hospital.
North Korea seals off border town after suspected corona case
So far, North Korea has seen its own measures to ward off the coronavirus as a "shining success."
The country is now reporting a suspected case for the first time.
Because of a first official suspected corona case in the country, North Korea has completely sealed off a major city for fear of a catastrophe.
Despite the strictest epidemiological defenses in the past six months, "the malignant virus may have been introduced into the country," the state media reported.
A state of emergency has been declared for the region around the border town of Kaesong.
The Communist leadership declared the highest level of alarm.
Should the suspected case be confirmed, it would be the first official case of infection with Sars-CoV-2 in the isolated country.
According to its own statements, North Korea has not yet registered a single infection and described its defensive measures as a "shining success."
The information was doubted abroad.
The disease symptoms were reportedly found in an "outlier" who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on July 19.
The person fled to South Korea three years ago and has now returned across the border.
There was initially no confirmation from South Korea for crossing the border within the four-kilometre-wide and for the most part still mined military buffer zone.
However, according to reports by the national news agency Yonhap, South Korea's military acknowledged the possibility of an illegal border crossing to North Korea as high.
Investigations were underway on some people.
According to its own statements, North Korea called an emergency meeting of the Workers' Party Politburo chaired by leader Kim Jong Un on Saturday because of the suspected case.
The "dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive catastrophe."
Kim had already ordered on Friday as a preventive measure to "completely block Kaesong and isolate every district and the region from others," it continued.
The person concerned, as well as all people in Kaesong who had had contact with her, were put under quarantine.
The central military commission of the party should therefore investigate the "runaway case" as well as the behavior of the responsible military unit and, if necessary, impose severe punishment.
It is estimated that around 300,000 people live in Kaesong.
Tension ahead of Council meeting: City East and noise protection are still under discussion before a big summer break
"In addition to environmental topics, the committee members will also vote on the development plan for the large-scale project Innenstadtentwicklung-Ost," it says rather casually in the middle section of the city's press release on the next city council meeting on Tuesday, July 28, at 4.30 pm in the Great Hall of the CongressCentrum Pforzheim.
Above all, the upgrading of the eastern city is controversially discussed until the end.
The majorities for this are scarce, most recently even negative in individual committees depending on attendance.
An appeal from business (construction, real estate, trade and IT) not to let the project developed by the citizens and then by the administration and the municipal council fail after almost ten years of preparation, criticized project opponent Reinhard Klein as an "extra-parliamentary opposition," "clueless," "speculation," "defamation" and "deliberate false statements."
"Everyone thinks they know better," says Klein, who has been a member of the municipal council for a year as the only representative of the citizens' list of Pforzheim.
In fact, after reading the contracts, he was in this position: "I know what I'm talking about."
The exit comes the city cheaper, the Technical Town Hall is contrary to statements of the city administration after subsidies, of whose existence Klein is convinced to renovate for 8.5 million euros.
The city will develop quite differently than one predicts in the town hall and on the part of the supporters from the economy.
Shaping the city by its own power and not an investor: That is his plan B. One day after Klein, the FDP / FW / UB / LED parliamentary group, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
Essentially, it also envisages the renovation of the Technical Town Hall, keeping the Schloßberg open, renting the Ex-Thales for administrative areas and a smaller-scale inner-city redesign, ideally with local sponsors.
Environmental issues play a central role
In addition, environmental issues in particular will play a central role.
Among other things, the local council will vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the population of Pforzheim from health noise pollution caused by road traffic, many of which include speed reductions.
In a press release, the local Verkehrsclub Deutschland welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30. However, the political leaders in the city are not innocent of the fact that this must come so, because they have only contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus noise through neglect of the regular bus service with thinned-out cycles and through little commitment to cycling, according to the VCD.
The municipal council also votes on the participation of the city of the Energy and Climate Protection Agency Pforzheim / Enzkreis.
The agenda also includes accession to the Climate Protection Pact of the state of Baden-Württemberg, the resetting of parental contributions in municipal day-care centres and the application for inclusion in the federal government's smart city funding.
Citizens are welcome, but must heed COVID-19 protections.
Tim Zimmermann starts the new season with a lot of delay
With a delay of almost half a year, Tim Zimmermann will start his debut season in the ADAC GT Masters on 31 July.
Before the league of super sports cars can start regular operation, the first test drives were due.
For Zimmermann, it was all about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3 better.
The corona crisis has long prevented Tim Zimmermann from tackling his first business trip in the new Lamborghini Huracan from Grasser Racing.
This was now possible under special hygiene conditions.
The 23-year-old from Langenargen completed his first laps at the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his debut in the GT3 car.
"There are already a few things that are different from the Porsche from the previous season," says Zimmermann.
"With the ABS, for example, you have to go into corners differently.
But it was really a lot of fun. "
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite being only 25 years old, the Dutchman is already experienced in GT racing and was able to help his new team-mate in many ways.
"I'm not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series also brings new challenges," says Zimmermann.
"Steijn and I understand each other brilliantly and we have also made enormous progress from session to session at the Lausitzring."
Exactly there - at the Lausitzring - the GT Masters will also host its first race.
From 31 July, the 33 super sports cars will race through Lusatia.
Zimmermann, who is one of 15 serial newcomers, knows the track though.
In 2015 he was most recently a guest at the Motodrom.
"It worked quickly and I didn't have much to get used to the track," says Zimmermann, who is starting for the Graf Zeppelin racing community in Friedrichshafen.
"The Lausitzring has many fast passages that you have to hit optimally to be fast."
How fast Zimmermann really is will be revealed in two weeks.
"Of course, the teams play poker a little during the tests," he says.
"In the end, however, we are very satisfied and look forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring."
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a tightly packed calendar.
Seven races are scheduled until the beginning of November.
The current status is that no spectators will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
Ex-Formula 1 driver Niko Hülkenberg will grab the GT steering wheel at the Nürburgring in mid-August.
British transport minister caught cold by quarantine decision
The British government's decision to put holidaymakers in Spain under quarantine for two weeks after their return has, according to press reports, caught the country's transport minister off guard.
Accordingly, Grant Shapps is currently on holiday in Spain, of all places, while his colleagues at home decided on the measure on Saturday.
Because of the rising corona numbers in Spain, the cabinet in London removed the country from the list of countries from which entry is possible without quarantine requirements.
The new regulation applies from today, Sunday, so Shapps will also have to be quarantined after his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returnees.
But the regulation applies to those who are just on holiday on the cut-off date, only from Saturday, August 1, and was not introduced overnight.
Incidentally, Spain is still regarded in Austria as one of the "safe countries" for which no quarantine in Austria is required.
"Many ministers may have known in advance that there is a possibility that a quarantine will be imposed on vacationers in Spain," commented Labour MP Diane Abbot.
"But apparently no one bothered to tell Grant Shapps."
Less than a month after the end of the COVID-19 emergency in Spain and the expiry of the strict curfew, infections in the country are rising again.
Virologists mainly blame the nightlife for the new spread.
Spain is one of the favourite holiday destinations of the British.
The British government currently advises against unnecessary travel to the Spanish mainland, the Canary Islands and Balearic Islands, which are particularly popular with British holidaymakers, are excluded from this.
So far, more than 272,000 infections with the novel coronavirus and more than 28,000 deaths have been registered in Spain.
Russia: Navy Day: Putin announces hypersonic weapons for warships
On the occasion of Navy Day in his country, Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced that warships will be equipped with state-of-the-art hypersonic weapons.
These weapons, which are unique in the world, would expand the combat capabilities of the Russian naval forces, Putin said on Sunday in St. Petersburg at the central naval parade.
According to the Interfax agency, the Ministry of Defence also informed about successful tests of the hypersonic rocket Zirkon, which was built for the navy.
The hypersonic weapons have a multiple of the speed of sound of around 343 metres per second.
They are considered weapons of the future.
Underwater tropedeo continues to be built
Construction will also continue on the atomic underwater torpedo Poseidon, it was said.
The planned sea drone is planned to destroy coastal targets.
The president, who himself also sailed a military boat, said that 40 new ships would be put into service with the individual fleet units of the largest country in the world this year alone.
Russia has such a large coastal area as no other country in the world.
The navy has been reliably protecting Russia for 300 years, Putin said on the day celebrated by sailors nationwide.
The naval forces also celebrated the Day of the Navy with parades in many other Russian coastal towns.
In Syria, where Russia is fighting alongside ruler Bashar al-Assad, the military demonstrated strength at a weapons show in the Mediterranean port of Tartus.
Ammunition was also fired there.
A video released by the Ministry of Defence showed not only warships, including a submarine, but also combat helicopters and jets.
Hurricane "Hanna" reaches Texas: Help made more difficult due to corona
Washington - The first hurricane of this year's season over the Atlantic has hit land in Texas.
Life-threatening floods, strong winds and heavy rainfall are now threatening parts of the US state, the National Hurricane Center of the US climate agency NOAA announced in the night to Sunday (local time).
Governor Greg Abbott declared a state of emergency for numerous districts.
The COVID-19 pandemic raging in Texas is making the helpers' work more difficult, Abbott continued, according to US media.
Evacuees called for caution
"Every hurricane is a huge challenge," Abbott said, according to the Houston Chronicle newspaper.
Referring to the Texas cyclone, he added, "This challenge is complicated and exacerbated when you consider it sweeping through an area that is the state's most COVID-19-affected area."
According to Johns Hopkins University, around 5,000 people have died in Texas alone as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Abbott called on people who had to leave their homes to be cautious.
They should not disregard practices "to which we have become accustomed," such as wearing masks, the governor said, according to CBS.
It was important that everyone kept their distance.
Therefore, hotel rooms have also been made available in some places.
In addition, corona should be tested in emergency shelters.
Damage had initially only been reported from the coastal town of Port Mansfield.
Storm warning withdrawn again
With wind speeds of up to 150 kilometers per hour, according to the authorities, "Hanna" was hit on land on the island of Padre Island just off the Texas coast.
The tropical storm had previously been upgraded to the lowest level one hurricane.
For the stretch of coast from Port Mansfield to Sargent, a storm surge warning was first issued and later withdrawn.
Authorities expected a slowdown, while "Hanna" moved further inland and headed for northeastern Mexico.
"Douglas" moves to Hawaii
In the Pacific, Hurricane "Douglas" was on its way to Hawaii in the night to Sunday with wind speeds of around 150 kilometres per hour.
The hurricane center, however, expected it to weaken further.
According to the forecast, it is expected to be near Hawaii's largest islands on Sunday (local time) - then as a storm just below the hurricane threshold.
Over the Atlantic, NOAA expected an above-average active hurricane season this year according to a forecast from May.
From June to the end of November, up to ten hurricanes are to be expected, of which up to six could be very strong cyclones, the authority had explained.
On average, there are six hurricanes per year over the Atlantic, three of which develop into storms of great strength.
In view of available climate data and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, the probability of a normal season is only 30 percent, that of a below-average even only ten percent, it was said at the time.
US President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that his administration is closely monitoring the storms and is in contact with the affected states.
Four goals denied: Video assistant "punished" Sassuolo
Sassuolos Filip Djuricic were denied two goals
Naples - Four goals scored, four goals denied: Sassuolo Calcio experienced a pitch-black evening at the 0: 2 (0: 1) at SSC Naples in the Italian football league Serie A - and was really angry with the referee's video assistant.
"A festival of ungiven goals for Sassuolo.
Never before has the VAR acted so hard against a team, "commented the" Corriere dello Sport. "
Host Napoli had gone into the lead with a goal from full-back Elseid Hisaj in the 8th minute, while Filip Djuricic cheered the equalizer in the 32nd minute.
The Video Assistant Referee (VAR) retracted the hit due to an offside position.
Five minutes later, Djuricic shot the ball into the net again - the VAR intervened again.
The referee team also took back the goals of attacker Francesco Caputo (50th) and Domenico Berardi (61st) after notice from the VAR.
In injury time, Allan made the 2-0 final for Naples and the bitter evening for Sassuolo perfect.
"The VAR is worse for Sassuolo than a radar trap on the road and punishes Sassuolo like no team before.
The new technology sets records, "writes the" Gazzetta dello Sport. "
FC Bayern München: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start into the hot preparation phase for the Champions League began for double winner FC Bayern with a setback.
Hansi Flick, who recovered "reasonably well" after a short vacation and a few days of training, already has to consider after the first team training how he can rebuild his successful defense after the injury of world champion Benjamin Pavard.
The Frenchman, who has the third most minutes of action behind captain Manuel Neuer and midfield boss Joshua Kimmich, suffered a band injury at the left foot root and threatens to be missing in decisive king-class duels.
In the Munich dirty weather, the right-wing defender broke off a training game and was driven off the field with a golf kart.
How long the unrestricted regular player has to pause in the fight for the title is an open question.
An appearance in the second leg of the round of 16 against FC Chelsea on 8 August should hardly be possible, the 24-year-old can hope for the final tournament starting in Lisbon on 12 August.
Bayern, however, do not want to be stopped by the mishap from training on Sunday.
In his personal triple formula, Flick named the three attributes he wants to see from his stars on their way to Portugal's capital.
Quality, intensity and concentration are to show his victory-hungry title collectors in the ideally following 28 days until the king-class final on August 23.
"We have mastered the mandatory tasks with championship and cup simply excellently.
Now it's time to create something special, "said Flick.
Until the Munich team can concretely deal with the final tournament and previously a training camp in the Algarve, however, the round of 16 obligation against FC Chelsea is due for the first time.
After the 3: 0 in the first leg before the corona break, the Londoners should not become a Bayern nightmare again in their home arena as in the lost "Finale dahoam" 2012.
"We have to go through the door first.
We want to win, create good conditions and gain confidence with a good game, "demanded Flick.
A test to get in the mood is scheduled for Friday against Olympique Marseille.
With a long speech, Flick had sworn his stars, who had 13 days of vacation after the double, to a unique August.
He welcomed 31 players to Säbener Straße, including the new players around Edel-Einkauf Leroy Sané, who met all new colleagues on the pitch for the first time after his move from Manchester City.
"Like all newcomers, Leroy has fitted in well," reported Flick.
But instead of talking about the new season, when Sané & amp; Co. are no longer only allowed to train, Flick preferred to talk about the current title project of the German series champion.
After days of individual and small-group training, it is now being trained in team strength for the Londoners, who, in contrast to the Flick ensemble, are in the rhythm of play.
After that, Munich could face a quarter-final against FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, in the semi-finals Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin are possible opponents.
A path to the final in Lisbon "is not quite so easy," stressed the head coach, who can rely on the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training from Tuesday onwards.
The World Cup record scorer Klose and Flick know of so many a joint tournament preparation, which is particularly important in the 0-on-100 attunement.
Working with his current team is "a pleasure," praised Flick.
The "focus on winning" is an impressive trait of his team.
The tournament with nine-man teams was also ambitious on Sunday.
All of the top performers were there, including Thiago, who is willing to emigrate, and defender David Alaba, whose whereabouts are not secured beyond the king-class season.
Formula 1 needs a special rule to choose its world champion.
Since it is not possible to drive on the required number of continents, the FIA has to improvise to award the World Championship titles.
All American races were cancelled.
Racing calendar is becoming more and more concrete
The racing calendar of the current Formula 1 season continues to take shape.
To the ten Grand Prix confirmed so far, three more race tracks were added during the week.
In October, the race will take place at the Nürburgring in Germany and in Portimão, Portugal.
On the first of November, Lewis Hamilton and Co. will fight for championship points on the traditional Italian race track in Imola.
According to the current status, the 2020 racing calendar thus comprises 13 races.
"We are pleased to continue to make great progress in completing our plans for the 2020 season," said Formula One boss Chase Carey.
A total of 15 to 18 races in the premier class of motorsport are to be completed in this extraordinary season.
Formula 1 wants to close its season in Asia.
The final race calendar is to be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
According to media reports, appearances in Vietnam and Malaysia could still take place at the end of November before the already officially targeted races in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December.
Regulations require races on three continents
However, the regulations of Formula 1 require at least races on three continents for the awarding of the World Championship.
Even if, as currently planned, it will only be driven on two continents, there will be a world champion.
With the help of a special rule, the FIA wants to award the titles citing "exceptional circumstances" due to the corona virus pandemic.
The traditional start to the season in Australia in March had to be cancelled at short notice due to the looming crisis.
A return to the continent this year is not an issue.
In addition, Formula 1 will not be a guest in America this year.
Cancellation meets with criticism in Brazil
Due to the tense corona situation, the races in Canada, the USA, Mexico and Brazil will not take place.
"We look forward to being with them again next season," Carey said.
The cancellation of the American races met with criticism, especially in Brazil: "The cancellation did not come as a surprise to us, but we cannot accept the reasons for this," said Tamas Rohonyi, promoter of the Grand Prix in São Paulo.
Infections in the São Paulo area are significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
The concerns of some teams not wanting to drive in Brazil would also not justify a cancellation.
One is prepared for the required security measures.
Greta Thunberg: Bad look against Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest in the well-known latenight show by Stephen Colbert via video and revealed in an interview what she had in mind during her encounter with Donald Trump.
Klimaatkivistin Greta Thunberg war per Videoschalte zu Gast in einer beliebten US-Latenacht-Show.
Among other things, she talked about her fight against the powerful of the world.
The teenager also talked about her famous "evil eye" during her encounter with Donald Trump.
New York City - Over the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has attracted attention with her tireless commitment to the "Fridays For Future" movement.
Now she spoke in a well-known late-night show about her plans for the future as well as her meeting with US President Donald Trump at the UN climate summit last year.
Latenight presenter Stephen Colbert welcomed the 17-year-old Thunberg in your show on Tuesday and conducted a longer interview with the Swede.
She spoke not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the world's powerful.
"There are some things that surprised me," she said.
"How far people go to steer the focus away from the climate crisis," she said.
"Everything from organized hate campaigns to threats just because a group of children is taking to the streets," she said.
Heads of state and leading politicians who scoff at them on social media or even try to silence them, she finds "funny" because the reactions show her "because they have no other answer."
It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview, when Greta Thunberg was asked about a well-known scene in which she cast a bitterly evil look after US President Trump.
At the UN Climate Summit 2019 in New York, for which the activist sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive gaze was captured by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
The short clip resulted in a GIF, an animated image that ultimately became one of the most frequently used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think about the US president at that moment?
To the relatively open question posed by Stephen Colbert, she answered only briefly and dryly: "To be honest, I think that needs no further explanation."
The experienced satirist Colbert had probably not reckoned with the quick-witted answer and disappeared briefly laughing from the picture.
With her "How dare you?" speech on the principles of climate protection, she was remembered by many at the climate conference.
Ex-Dortmunder Immobile mit Dreipack für Lazio Rom
Ciro Immobile is now on a par with Bavaria's Robert Lewandowski in the race for Europe's Golden Shoe.
The former Dortmund Ciro Immobile still has the best chances of becoming the top scorer in the Italian football championship.
The former BVB pro contributed three goals in the 5: 1 (1: 1) victory of Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona, including two converted penalties in the aftermath of both halves.
The 30-year-old from fourth in the standings now has 34 goals on his account two games before the end of the season - just as many were scored by Robert Lewandowski from FC Bayern Munich in the past Bundesliga season.
In Italy follows Cristiano Ronaldo with 30 goals so far, the Portuguese superstar met with the leader in the evening on Sampdoria Genoa.
Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green died
His life was like a rollercoaster ride: After a rapid ascent with Fleetwood Mac it went steeply downhill and then slowly uphill again.
Now blues rock guitarist Peter Green has died at the age of 73.
Ingenious guitarist, drug junkie, cult fan: The co-founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully in his sleep at the age of 73, family members announced on Saturday in an official statement, a further statement would be announced for the next few days.
Top musicians like Peter Frampton praised Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional reaction of a "monumental loss" for all past and present members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
The drummer Fleetwood and the guitarist Green had founded the now legendary band in London in 1967, his dreamy instrumental hit "Albatross" is still unforgotten today.
The musician's life ("The End Of The Game," "In The Skies") resembled a rollercoaster ride.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated their greatest successes but then without him.
There is said to have been a dispute, among other things, because Green wanted to donate all of the group's profits to charity.
He began to perform in wide robes and with a large crucifix.
Psychological problems are also said to have played a role.
Already three years after the foundation Green left the band in 1970.
A social decline followed.
The blues rock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, as biographers reported.
For a long time, Green was treated in psychiatry.
During much of the 1970s, the musician disappeared from the scene.
He is said to have temporarily lived on the street, worked as a cemetery gardener and spent some time in an Israeli kibbutz.
Green was born in 1946 to a Jewish working-class family in the London borough of Bethnal Green.
Already at a young age he was enthusiastic about US blues musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At the age of eleven he learned his first guitar grips.
At the age of 15, the teenager began to play guitar professionally and five years later got the chance to stand on stage as lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners.
A little later he was engaged as a replacement for his idol Eric Clapton at the Bluesbreakers.
In the middle of the blues boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967 together with his Bluesbreakers colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross" composed by Green gave the group their first number one hit in the winter of 1968 / 69 and catapulted them to the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid rise soon showed its downsides: Green could not cope with the media hype, his experiments with the drug LSD became more and more extreme.
He later commented on life between music and addiction in an interview: "The worst thing that happened to me in life is the drugs - the best thing was to land a number 1 hit."
Towards the end of the decade, Green surprisingly achieved a respectable success in 1979 with an album inspired by religious themes.
Meanwhile, Fleetwood Mac swam without him in a new formation on a wave of success.
Their 1977 album "Rumours" sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Despite various small solo successes, Green did not make a major comeback until he started again in 1996 with a group of musician friends.
The British "Daily Telegraph" spoke at the time of a rock star returning to earth.
Free of drugs, Green released several albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group until the band disbanded in 2004.
For music experts, he was already a blues legend during his lifetime - and with his gentle sound one of the most influential guitarists of the past decades.
