Biker reacts with lightning speed and prevents worse
On Friday evening, a traffic accident occurred on the road between Machtolsheim and Merklingen, in which a motorcyclist was only slightly injured thanks to his quick reaction.
Motorist overlooks biker
A 44-year-old driver wanted to turn left on the Landesstraße 1230 in the direction of Machtolsheim at around 9.30 pm with her VW coming from Merklingen.
She overlooked the 24-year-old motorcyclist coming from the direction of Nellingen, who had the right of way.
Hand and foot brake levers fly off in the collision
The biker tried to avoid the car, but still grazed it at the rear of the vehicle.
As a result of the grazing, the hand and foot brake levers on the Suzuki were torn off and the driver was no longer able to brake.
With presence of mind, he steered his motorcycle into the green pavement next to the road and let it roll out there without falling.
Biker suffers leg injury
Due to the collision with the car, the biker nevertheless suffered an injury to the abdomen and had to be treated in a clinic.
Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 harvest workers infected
After a corona mass infection on a large vegetable farm in Mamming, Lower Bavaria, almost 500 people are under quarantine and are no longer allowed to leave the farm.
A security service monitors the curfew.
A total of 174 harvest workers tested positive for the corona pathogen Sars-CoV-2 during the serial examination, as announced by the Dingolfing-Landau district office on Saturday evening.
"In order to avoid further spread, we unfortunately have to take this step to protect the population," explained district administrator Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Previously, seven employees had already been infected in the company - this was the reason for the series of tests.
The farm is a large vegetable farm that grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and beetroot - but the cucumbers are only for pickling jars.
Mamming is a rural community with just over 3,300 inhabitants not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW plant.
Bumeder appealed to citizens to remain calm: "According to our information, it is a closed circle of people."
On the farm, infected and non-infected employees were separated, and the area is now surrounded by a barrier fence.
The Greens and the SPD gave the state government co-responsibility.
The two opposition parties accused Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet of neglecting to monitor the accommodation of seasonal workers.
"This can have a bitter revenge if such local infections spread and regional lockdowns have to be ordered," said Jürgen Mistol, the parliamentary managing director of the Greens.
The SPD sees it very similarly: "After the corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof slaughterhouse in mid-May, we have already called for a special control program for farms with harvest workers," said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
"From our point of view, hygiene conditions in the workplace and living conditions in particular must be strictly controlled.
That obviously didn't happen."
The outbreak had come "with an announcement."
Aidenbachstraße U-Bahn station: Dangerous dispute: 19-year-old falls into the track bed after being pushed
During a dispute between two groups of youths at the Aidenbachstraße U-Bahn station, a 19-year-old fell down due to a push and slipped into the track bed.
Obersendling - On Friday, a fight broke out between two groups of youths at the Aidenbachstraße subway station at around 4:15 p.m.
A passer-by alerted the police, who arrived with several patrols.
According to initial investigations, a Munich man (17) pushed a 19-year-old to the ground.
The young man slipped over the edge of the platform and fell into the track bed.
People from the group of the 17-year-old helped the fallen man to climb out of the track.
There was no danger from an incoming train.
According to the police, there were further confrontations between the two individuals.
The 17-year-old initially fled the scene of the crime, but his personal details could be determined afterwards.
Accompanied by his father, he went to the police station 29.
The 17-year-old is being investigated for assault.
Report: Seehofer pushes for longer data retention
Data retention is currently suspended.
However, according to a media report, German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer is calling for an extension of the storage period.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
According to a media report, German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) is calling for extended data retention - half a year instead of the planned ten weeks.
As the "Bild am Sonntag" reports, Seehofer asked Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht (SPD) in a letter for a quick change in the law.
Seehofer wants to strengthen the measures against child abuse.
He believes it makes sense to "make urgently needed adjustments to the law now," the newspaper quotes from the letter.
Currently, data retention is suspended.
A decision by the ECJ on this is expected.
Seehofer, however, wants the changes before that, so that they could be applied immediately after a possible positive ruling, the report continues.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice told the newspaper that it could only be meaningfully examined whether legal adjustments were needed once the courts had ruled.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer, together with the interior ministers of the federal states, had already spoken out in June in favour of data retention.
NBA: Strip club trouble for Clippers star Lou Williams
Excitement in the NBA!
Lou Williams (33), professional basketball player of the Los Angeles Clippers, is said to have left the tournament quarters at Disney World in Orlando/Florida with permission for a funeral.
According to US media reports, he visited the strip club "Magic City" in Atlanta in the evening.
Williams, who is said to have admitted the visit according to ESPN, is back in isolation, is tested daily for Covid-19.
His reason for visiting: chicken wings.
In February of last year, "Sweet Lou," as he is known in the NBA, already expressed his love for these very wings.
The American wrote: "Magic City and Blue Flame (another strip club in Atlanta) have the best wings in town."
NBA insider Shams Charania announced Sunday on Twitter that the NBA has ordered a 10-day quarantine for Williams.
As a result, the Clippers star will miss the first two official games after the trial phase.
In Disney World, the NBA wants to play the Corona season.
Currently, the best 22 teams are preparing for the season finale, which starts on Friday night, with training matches.
Söder comments on corona situation after mass infection
Munich - Health Minister Melanie Huml (CSU) has already announced a test offensive for large farms on Sunday.
The press conference will be shown live on our homepage.
The case in Mamming in the district of Dingolfing-Landau has alarmed authorities and politicians.
Almost 500 harvest workers from several countries are currently working on the large vegetable farm, and more than a third have been infected with the corona pathogen.
The farm is now under quarantine and is cordoned off with a construction fence.
No one is allowed to leave the premises, food is delivered.
The authorities are now offering free coronavirus tests to the more than 3,300 residents of the community.
Since the harvesters had little contact with the local population, the district office so far assumes that the infections have not spread beyond the farm.
"Pangs of conscience": Confession of the alleged arsonist of Nantes
"My client has been cooperative," attorney Quentin Chabert told the newspaper.
The defence lawyer added: "He is very sorry for his actions, the confession was a release for him."
His mandate was "plagued by remorse and greatly affected by the extent of the destruction."
If convicted, the man faces ten years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros, according to the prosecutor's office.
The Gothic Cathedral of St. Peter and St. Paul in Nantes was severely damaged in a fire on the night of Saturday last week.
The fire had broken out in three widely separated places in the church.
Laboratory tests confirmed the suspicion of arson.
The suspect, who is now in custody, was arrested just a few hours after the fire.
He was released after one day.
The man works as a volunteer for the diocese of Nantes and was responsible for closing the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
Since there was no sign of forced entry into the church, he quickly came to the attention of investigators.
Discuss the abolition of the 50+1 rule
Former DFB president Reinhard Grindel has recommended that consideration be given to abolishing the 50+1 rule.
"German football should at least discuss setting conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates a fait accompli," Grindel told Bild am Sonntag.
He stressed: "For the clubs that are most likely to be dangerous to Bayern and Dortmund, the 50+1 rules do not work anyway: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, one cannot avoid the debate about whether it is not necessary to make it easier for clubs that want to break into this phalanx to involve investors."
However, he has doubts as to whether there is a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority shareholdings, which are prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50+1 rule.
"It remains a legal risk to draw investment fences around the Bundesliga as a business location in a European single market," said Grindel.
The former DFB boss sees the danger that "the attempts to ensure more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will ultimately only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but will not lead to more tension in the championship."
Even an equal distribution of TV money will not achieve a decisive effect.
"FC Bayern has a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund 500 million and RB Leipzig 300 million.
So the differences are already immense among the first three clubs alone.
The other 15 clubs have an average budget of 130 million," explained the 58-year-old.
Looking at the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Unfortunately, there were people who noticed this mistake and leaked it to the press instead of addressing me about it," said Grindel about the acceptance of an expensive watch, which had led to his resignation in April 2019.
"Personally, this has kept me very busy."
He had received the gift worth around 11,000 euros from a Ukrainian official.
"I committed a compliance violation, and it was right to draw the consequences," Grindel said.
"I handled the ominous watch gift in a completely transparent and guileless manner.
Many in the DFB knew about it."
He never "made a secret of the gift," the 58-year-old assured.
"One might call that naive, but in any case this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption."
"Black Lives Matter": Injured and one dead
The protests against police violence in the United States have escalated again due to Donald Trump's deployment of federal police officers in several cities.
On Saturday, there were clashes between protesters and police in various cities.
Three people were injured in Louisville and 16 people were arrested in Seattle.
In Austin, one person was killed by gunfire while a march was crossing an intersection.
Earlier, there had been clashes again in Portland during protests against racism and police violence.
The security forces, including officers from the federal police, used tear gas on Saturday night and violently dispersed demonstrators.
Hundreds of protesters, some armed, marched through Louisville, Kentucky, on Saturday, demanding that those responsible for the death of Breonna Taylor be held accountable.
The 26-year-old student was shot dead in March during a drug raid at her apartment in Louisville.
The target of the raid was someone else who did not even live there, and no drugs were found.
Three people were injured on Saturday when a member of a group calling itself the Armed Coalition of Black Americans fired a shot.
According to NBC, they were taken to the hospital.
None of their lives were in danger.
The police set up barricades because counter-protesters from a white militia had also formed.
In the end, the two groups did not meet.
In Austin, Texas, a person was shot and killed during a "Black Lives Matter" demonstration.
According to the police, a suspect was taken into custody.
She has not yet provided further details on the circumstances of the crime.
Mayor Steve Adler said he, like many in the city, was "heartbroken and stunned" by what happened, according to the New York Times.
Protesters also clashed with police in the American metropolis of Seattle on Saturday.
They set fire to construction trucks in front of a youth prison, and the police used stun grenades and pepper spray.
According to the Seattle Times, 16 people were arrested for resisting officers or assault.
In the city of Oakland, California, a courthouse was set on fire.
A small group of protesters smashed windows, shot off fireworks and blinded police officers with lasers, Oakland police said late Saturday night (local time).
The fire was quickly extinguished.
In Aurora, a suburb of Denver in Colorado, a car drove through a crowd of people demonstrating on a highway.
Police said one of the protesters fired a gun and at least one person was taken to hospital with injuries.
In addition, windows were smashed in a court there and a fire was set, according to the police.
An investigation has been launched.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historical costumes defy corona
Although the big party in the spa town was missing, visitors and performers enjoyed the Rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, performers and organisers: the Rakoczy weekend without the Rakoczy festival.
But: Even though the big party mile in the city center was missing, the crowds and program highlights such as Saale brennt, Rakoczy-Ball or Festzug, many got their money's worth with the Corona-compliant alternative program.
"I think we have succeeded in spreading Rakoczy flair," says spa director Sylvie Thormann.
The guests would have accepted it well.
In principle, one returns to the beginnings of the Rakoczy festival, when only the historical ones were the focus of the festival.
Pleasant atmosphere
Vesna Konhäuser and her husband have been visiting Bad Kissingen for the Rakoczy Festival for more than 25 years.
So also this time in the Corona year.
The couple has made themselves comfortable at the Luitpold Casino, watching the historic strolling and listening to the Cuban live music at the casino restaurant.
"I also find it very pleasant," says Konhäuser.
She misses the crowds, which otherwise do not belong to Rakoczy.
However, it lacks the usual programme highlights, above all Saale brennt on Friday evening as well as the historical pageant and the closing fireworks on Sunday evening.
"That's a shame.
The weather would have been perfect this year," she says.
Rakoczy riding tournament to be held again
For the performers of the historical spa guests, the alternative program sometimes meant more work.
For example, for Christina Gold, who in a normal year participates in the pageant and can be seen there on the carriage of the spa garden café.
This year she was on foot in the city on Saturdays and Sundays in costume.
"That's more strenuous, otherwise it's easier for us," she says.
The equestrian club had less to do, even if individual riders were out and about in the park.
"We very much hope that the equestrian quadrille will be allowed to take place again next year," says chairwoman Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that after a break of several years, a Rakoczy equestrian tournament will take place again in 2021.
28 coronavirus cases at Spanish second division club Fuenlabrada
The Spanish second division football club CF Fuenlabrada is sliding deeper and deeper into crisis due to a corona outbreak.
Since the newcomer from near Madrid flew to a game in the city of A Coruña on July 20 despite the first corona cases, one low blow follows the next.
By Sunday, 28 players or team members had tested positive, and one was hospitalized, the club announced.
Fuenlabrada, from the city of the same name south-west of Madrid, still had the chance to reach the promotion playoffs.
Now there is even the threat of relegation to the B group of the Second League.
The match against Deportivo La Coruña last Monday was cancelled at the last moment, the public prosecutor is investigating a possible crime against public health, the supreme sports authority CSD is considering the forced relegation of the club.
The players and other team members are in quarantine in a hotel.
"Until the sixth day of quarantine, they have not received a fresh towel and gel," wrote the sports newspaper "AS."
Photographs showed players hanging underwear and club clothes to dry in their hotel rooms after apparently having to wash them themselves.
The bed linen had also not been changed for five days.
Another problem is food.
It was neither good nor sufficient, wrote "AS."
The club management, on the other hand, announced that they were satisfied with the hotel.
The club's lawyer, Javier Tebas Llanas, rejected the accusation of deliberately endangering public health.
The son of the president of the Spanish Primera Division, Javier Tebas, stressed that they had not violated the Corona rules established by the Football Association, as reported by the news agency Europa Press and the sports newspaper "Marca."
Before the departure, there had been four infected people until 19 July, but they had all been isolated and had not travelled with them.
Immediately before the flight on Monday to A Coruña, all players and team members were tested again.
When the team was already in A Coruña, "five or six" other team members tested positive for corona.
The match was called off 60 minutes before kick-off, Tebas Llanas said.
Police have to catch runaway horses at Dampfach
Two animals were on the road.
The police led them back to their owner.
Shortly before 6 a.m. on Sunday morning, a road user reported two free-running horses on the feeder road between the Donnersdorf/Steinsfeld junction and the Theres motorway junction.
When the officers arrived, the horses were already back between the feeder and the village of Dampfach.
After the officers were able to gain the trust of the horses shortly before Dampfach, they each had a rope carried in the patrol car tied around them.
Professional cyclist Tony Martin: Career continuation conceivable
Time trial specialist Tony Martin is thinking about continuing his career.
Frankfurt/Main - Seven-time world time trial champion Tony Martin can certainly imagine continuing his cycling career.
"I am currently defining the framework conditions with the team as to how and in what form it could continue," the 35-year-old told the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung."
Martin is currently employed by the Dutch team Jumbo-Visma and had considered ending his career after this year before the Corona break.
The negotiations with his team are also about the number of race days, he said.
Or other problems that would plague him as a family man, Martin said.
He used to get up after a fall, and the first thought was: "Quickly back on the bike.
Today, as the father of a young daughter, I think: what if."
The professional cyclist admitted that there are certainly aspects with which he is increasingly struggling.
"But it was good for me to realize what I have in cycling and how much I enjoy it during the corona period."
The time trial specialist returns to competitive action at the Tour de l'Ain (5 to 9 August).
Bavaria: At least four dead on Bavaria's roads over the weekend
The beautiful weather attracts bikers to the streets in many places.
The motorcycle tour ends fatally for at least three people.
An 18-year-old pedestrian also dies.
Schönthal - Several people, mostly young people, died in accidents on Bavaria's roads over the weekend.
An 18-year-old female motorcyclist was hit by a car that crossed into the opposite lane on Saturday near Schönthal (district of Cham).
It was not immediately clear why the car veered into the opposite lane.
In Upper Bavaria on Saturday, a 22-year-old on his machine collided with a horse-drawn carriage.
According to the police, he was going downhill near Beilngries.
In a left turn, he crashed into the carriage.
His injuries were so severe that he died at the scene of the accident.
Of the twelve occupants of the carriage, one man was seriously injured and one man was slightly injured, the police announced.
In another fatal accident, an 18-year-old died in the Upper Palatinate town of Bad Kötzting.
He had laid down on a road on Sunday night and was run over by a 42-year-old motorist.
According to the police, the 18-year-old wanted to sleep.
The driver was unable to brake in time.
At Schönberg (district of Freyung-Grafenau) on Saturday, a 57-year-old biker crashed head-on into a car on a right-hand bend despite braking hard.
He died at the scene of the accident.
The 57-year-old driver suffered a shock, the other three people in the car were uninjured.
The safety of motorcyclists was addressed by Bavaria's Minister of Transport Kerstin Schreyer (CSU) on Saturday.
In a letter to the organizer of the biker protests against driving bans announced for August, Gabor Kovacs, the minister referred to extensive investments such as underride protection on guardrails and the mitigation of dangerous curves.
"We have achieved a lot for the safety of motorcyclists in recent years," the letter said.
"The number of motorized two-wheelers killed decreased by around 28 percent compared to 2011."
Kovac tests with Monaco against Frankfurt
Frankfurt/Main (dpa) - For football coach Niko Kovac, there will soon be a reunion with Eintracht Frankfurt with his new club AS Monaco.
The eight-time French champions will visit Hessen, the Croatian's former club, on 1 August (6 p.m.).
For the Bundesliga club, it is the first and only acid test before the second leg in the Europa League against FC Basel (6 August).
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the match will be played without spectators.
"We are particularly looking forward to this game.
It's always nice to come to Frankfurt and meet friends," said Kovac.
In sporting terms, this is an interesting test, said the 48-year-old.
Before his move to Bayern Munich, Kovac had coached Hesse from 2016 to 2018 and led them to victory in the DFB Cup.
"A top-class opponent like Monaco is a good test for us in view of the game against Basel.
Like everyone in Frankfurt, I'm looking forward to seeing Niko Kovac again," said Eintracht coach Adi Hütter.
The 50-year-old Austrian had taken over from the Croatian at Eintracht.
In March, the Frankfurt team lost the first leg of the round of 16 against Basel in their own stadium with 0:3.
Almost 50 new infections: Hof district narrowly avoids lockdown
In the district of Hof, the number of known new coronavirus infections continued to increase over the weekend: from 39 on Friday and 43 on Saturday (one person has recovered and is no longer included in these statistics) to 47 on Sunday.
In addition, there is a case in the town of Hof.
This means that the Hof area is approaching the critical mark of 50 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants in one week.
700 dead from monsoon rains in Southeast Asia
More than 9 million people have been affected by the severe flooding in Southeast Asia, mainly in Bangladesh, India and Nepal.
Due to the heavy monsoon rains, a total of 700 people were killed.
In Bangladesh, the Red Crescent tries to reach the isolated people in boats.
Entire villages are under water.
Farmers have lost their crops.
Rhinoceros in national park die due to landslides
In Kaziranga National Park, several of the 120 rhinos died in landslides.
They are protected and considered endangered.
This year, the floods are particularly bad, which scientists attribute to climate change.
According to the United Nations, Bangladesh is one of the countries most affected by global warming.
New apartments stand empty
In the town of Cox's Bazar in southern Bangladesh, the state has built homes for 650 people displaced by the floods.
So far, only a few have moved in.
It is difficult to get people to Cox's Bazar.
Enthusiasm is also high in Grenezn.
Those who used to have a house, no matter how small it was and resembled a hut, often do not want to spend their lives in a large block of flats.
Many apartments are empty, but - according to the government - will soon be occupied by those who lost their homes in the floods.

Argentina rejects creditors' counter-offer
The new demands could not be met, the Ministry of Economy in Buenos Aires announced on Saturday.
"This would not only be irresponsible, but also unjust," it said in a statement.
"While 50 percent of children in Argentina live in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors."
The debt of the second largest economy in South America is no longer sustainable under current conditions.
Therefore, Argentina is asking its private creditors to waive part of their claims of around 66 billion US dollars (around 59 billion euros).
If no agreement is reached, the country is once again threatened with bankruptcy.
It would be the ninth default in Argentina's history.
Most recently, the lenders had demanded higher interest rates on the government bonds and changes to some contractual clauses.
However, the Argentine government is sticking to its last offer and is not prepared to make any further concessions.
Argentina is in a serious financial and economic crisis.
The inflation rate was recently more than 50 percent.
For the current year, experts expect a decline in economic strength of around ten percent.
At the end of May, Argentina had not paid interest claims amounting to 503 million US dollars and had thus slipped into a limited default.
Arrived professionally - not yet in private life
"It's going super well" - this is the conclusion drawn by Dr. Stefanie Kramer after her first days at the notary's office in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything happened very quickly: in mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she would succeed Lutz Feller in the Eggenfelden notary's office.
Just six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the doctor of law started work, the normal day-to-day business has long been running at full speed.
"Privately, however, I have yet to arrive," she explains in an interview with the Rottaler Anzeiger and laughs.
Of course, the short lead time was not enough to completely relocate the center of life from Regensburg to Eggenfelden, reports the native of Dingolfing.
She and her husband, who is a judge at the regional court in Regensburg, are currently looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city.
At least her husband was able to apply for short-term parental leave in order to ensure the care of their two daughters (31⁄2 and 11⁄2 years old).
In order not to have to commute from Regensburg every day, she has a place to stay with her parents in Dingolfing for the time being, explains the 39-year-old.
Having grown up in the neighbouring district, the city of Eggenfelden has of course been familiar to her for a long time.
During visits to the area with her family in recent months, she has once again noted: "Eggenfelden is a really nice small town."
She was all the more pleased that she had made the running in the selection process for the vacancy.
Her native Lower Bavaria also plays a central role in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's professional career: After studying law in Passau, she completed her legal clerkship and the second state examination in Regensburg.
After several positions as a notary assessor, including in Rehau and Hof in Upper Franconia, Babenhausen in Unterallgäu and Regensburg - during this time she also "incidentally" completed her doctorate in labour law - she took up her first position as a notary in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau in 2012.
In 2016, she went on parental leave, which was followed by a move to Regensburg.
Since then, she has taken on representation services in various notary offices.
When the position in Eggenfelden was advertised due to the approaching retirement of Lutz Feller, she saw the right time for a full professional re-entry, explains the 39-year-old.
Dr. Stefanie Kramer has completely taken over the team of her predecessor, who will take over the holiday representation in the notary's office in the future - and immediately has praise for the team of the law firm: "It's going super well!"
The fact that she can rely on well-established processes here makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming relocation of the private center of life.
In terms of kindergarten or crèche places, she has already made contact with a local institution.
And if everything works out as desired, she hopes to be able to pursue her hobby here soon - and to get to know the most beautiful jogging trails of the Rottal.
BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not be even 20 percent full at the start of the season if fans return.
"Due to the distance regulation, which must be adhered to, we are currently planning for 12,000 to 15,000 spectators," Borussia Dortmund's managing director Carsten Cramer told the "Tagesspiegel."
Normally, the arena in the district town holds just over 81,000 spectators for Bundesliga games.
In the ghost games of last season caused by the corona pandemic, BVB lost around four million euros per game.
Cramer, who is responsible for marketing, digitization and internationalization at BVB, hopes that in addition to the normal spectator seats, some of the approximately 4000 seats in the hospitality area can be opened again: "It is of course a blow to the office if these revenues completely disappear."
In view of the ongoing corona crisis, everyone is currently "well advised to take a stable page length for the time being."
"If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people in Germany alone are in short-time work, then the need for entertainment is limited," Cramer explained.
The Dortmund marketing boss praised the BVB professionals for their partial salary waiver, which is intended to help overcome the crisis: "Of course, the players know that their salary waiver has a different effect than if we put 100 people who work in merchandising on short-time work."
Tiny miracles: Early start to life with a few hundred grams
Barely heavier than a pack of butter, just three tablespoons of blood in his entire body: That was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The boy is one of around 400 premature babies who are cared for at the Graz Children's Hospital every year.
A quarter of them weigh less than 1,500 grams, a few - like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael - are extreme lightweights with a birth weight of less than one kilogram.
They are born so small and so early that neither lungs, nor intestines, nor muscles are fully formed.
Their skin is sometimes so delicate that they could injure the electrodes of an ECG.
And they are so tiny that they sometimes wear doll clothes and mini diapers specially made for them.
But not so small that they don't have a voice - "and how," smiles Berndt Urlesberger.
"Even if they don't scream quite as loudly as big babies, of course."
When the whiteboard becomes a stage
Despite Corona Theater in the classroom: The 9th grade of the Sankt-Jakobus-Gymnasium in Abtsgmünd experienced the whiteboard as a stage shortly before the start of the holidays.
Actress Julia Sylvester from the Theater der Stadt Aalen presented the production "Das Heimatkleid" to the pupils - by video.
Afterwards, the pupils were able to discuss the play and the performance with the actress and director Winfried Tobias via Skype.
The idea for the performance format was born out of the current corona situation.
Teacher Teresa Nar was pleased with the enrichment of the lessons.
Even though all participants agreed at the end that the direct encounter in the theatre and stage space would offer additional stimuli, one can also see the potential for contact in the schools in the theatre.
"If we continue to improve the technical framework, this could be an interesting addition to the game operation," emphasized director Winfried Tobias.
First round draw: TSV 1860 would meet Eintracht Frankfurt in the DFB Cup
Should TSV 1860 qualify for the DFB Cup, the Lions will face Eintracht Frankfurt in the first round.
This was the result of the draw on Sunday.
Munich - Sixty's possible opponents in the first round of the DFB Cup have been decided.
The Lions would meet Eintracht Frankfurt in a successful qualification.
This was the result of the draw on Sunday evening in the ARD sports show.
Because the field of participants is not yet complete due to the corona pandemic, placeholders were used in the draw.
Due to the voluntary withdrawal of semi-final opponent FC Memmingen, TSV 1860 is already in the final of the Bavarian Toto Cup (4 or 5 September).
There, the Lions will face either Würzburger Kickers or Viktoria Aschaffenburg.
Should second-division promoted Würzburg reach the final, Sechzig would already be qualified for the first round of the DFB-Pokal.
Otherwise, the Giesingers would have to prevail in the final against regional league Aschaffenburg.
The first round of the DFB Cup will be played between 11 and 14 September, one week before the start of the third division.
"Gone with the Wind": Film legend Olivia de Havilland is dead
Film legend and Oscar winner Olivia de Havilland has died.
She died of natural causes on Sunday in Paris at the age of 104, her spokeswoman confirmed to the German Press Agency.
De Havilland was known for her role as Melanie Hamilton in the Southern epic "Gone with the Wind" (1939).
Born in Tokyo to British parents, Olivia de Havilland moved to California as a toddler.
The Austrian theatre man Max Reinhardt discovered the 19-year-old in the role of Hermia in Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream."
The film studio Warner Brothers immediately signed her to a seven-year contract and brought her to prominence alongside Eroll Flynn.
She made eight films with the heartbreaker.
In 1946, she won her first Oscar in the lead role of "To Each His Own."
The film was released in Germany under the title "Mutterherz."
Three years later came the award for best actress in William Wyler's "The Heiress."
She also received much recognition as a neurotic eccentric in "The Dark Mirror" and "The Snake Pit."
Daphne du Maurier suggested her for the lead role in the film adaptation of her novel "My Cousin Rachel" in 1952.
The play became a worldwide success.
She starred in "Lullaby for a Corpse" with her longtime friend Bette Davis.
Her marriage to the writer Marcus Goodrich (1946 to 1953) produced a son, Benjamin.
In Paris, de Havilland married the journalist Pierre Paul Galante and had the daughter Gisèle with him.
This marriage also broke up.
Rumors of an affair with former British Prime Minister Edward Heath, however, were never confirmed.
"Road to Timmendorf": Beach volleyball: Thole/Wickler miss final on comeback
World Championship runners-up Julius Thole and Clemens Wickler missed the finals of the "Road to Timmendorf" beach volleyball tournament.
At the meeting of the top teams in Düsseldorf, they lost in the semi-finals to their national team colleagues Nils Ehlers and Lars Flüggen with 1:2 (17:21, 21:17, 19:21).
Thole/Wickler last played at the World Tour Final in Rome in September last year.
In the final match on the Rhine, their conquerors Ehlers/Flüggen suffered a defeat against the surprise team Lukas Pfretschner and his interim partner Steven van de Velde with 0:2 (17:21, 17:21).
In addition to the show tournament, three starting places for the German championships at the beginning of September in Timmendorfer Strand were played out: Armin Dollinger/Simon Kulzer, Manuel Harms/Richard Peemüller and Simon Pfretschner/Milan Sievers secured the tickets.
Kalbitz expulsion from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "fig leaf"
From the point of view of the FDP, the exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is only a "fig leaf" and does not change the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the far right in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the tip of the iceberg of radicals in the AfD," FDP politician Benjamin Strasser told the dpa news agency in Berlin.
On Saturday in Stuttgart, after several hours of negotiations, the Federal Arbitration Court of the AfD confirmed the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Executive Board had decided by a majority in May.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD group in the Brandenburg state parliament.
"If the AfD really wanted to consistently remove right-wing extremists from their party, officials like Björn Höcke and his supporters would have been expelled long ago," said Strasser.
"However, there is no political will to do so in the AfD, because right-wing extremism is now part of the party."
CSU General Secretary Markus Blume expressed a similar view: "The fact that Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded says nothing and changes nothing," he told the "Welt am Sonntag."
"Rather, it speaks volumes how many frenetic supporters a right-wing extremist in the middle of the AfD still has."
Blume assumes that the AfD will again fall below five percent in elections in the future.
"The AfD's days in parliament are numbered."
Kalbitz was one of the spokesmen of the now officially disbanded "wing" around the Thuringian AfD state and parliamentary group chairman Björn Höcke; the Office for the Protection of the Constitution classifies the Strönung as a "secured right-wing extremist endeavor."
In May, the AfD's national executive board kicked Kalbitz out of the party.
As a reason, he stated that Kalbitz had not indicated a previous membership in the now banned right-wing extremist "Heimattreue Deutsche Jugend" (HDJ) and the Republicans when he joined the party.
Kalbitz denies membership in the HDJ.
The chairman of the left-wing faction in the Brandenburg state parliament, Sebastian Walter, also stressed that the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court does not change the character of the AfD: "The wolf has only eaten chalk.
The AfD remains a right-wing extremist party, with or without Kalbitz."
Neither the federal party nor the right wing will be weakened by this decision.
"The manoeuvre of the Meuthen force is transparent.
They want to avoid further observation by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution and are trying to slip under the radar," Walter said.
"The AfD can't get rid of the ghosts it summoned.
An expulsion does not change anything," commented the Brandenburg SPD General Secretary Erik Stohn on the decision in the Kalbitz case.
"This is where the AfD regional association and the parliamentary group have stood by their right-wing leader to this day."
The legal dispute over Kalbitz's membership in the AfD will continue.
He announced on Saturday that he would now take civil action against the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court.
North Sea wind farms deliver a good 21 percent more electricity
The wind power plants on the German North Sea have fed 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity into the grid in the first six months of the year.
This is a good 21 percent more than in the same period last year, announced the network operator Tennet in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of North Sea electricity to the mainland and its routing through the German power grid.
The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of Tennet's grid area, have fed in a further 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
This brings the total wind power from the North and Baltic Seas to 13.73 TWh, compared to just over 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind harvest at sea thus accounts for almost 19 percent of the total wind power in Germany; this is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms ensure higher generation capacities
In addition to the wind conditions, the increased contribution of offshore wind energy results from higher generation capacities, because new wind farms have been connected to the grid in the past twelve months.
If the 1270 wind power plants in the North Sea were all running at full power at the same time, they could generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient for this; according to Tennet, it is 7.1 gigawatts.
By 2030, it is expected to rise to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea.
"In Germany and the Netherlands, we are investing 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore grid connections by then," said Tennet Managing Director Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, wind farms can not exhaust their capacity even at sea, but reach about 40 percent.
The record day so far this year is 2 January, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind turbines produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, which is equivalent to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could supply almost seven million households with electricity.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the Gmünder Kunstverein.
It was almost a small celebration of the 130th anniversary.
Birthday of the Gmünder Kunstverein: The exhibition opening "Skirmish" with works by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold broke the usual framework after the corona break.
Many more art lovers than usual followed the dialogue between the artist and the chairman of the Kunstverein, Professor Dr. Klaus Ripper.
The musical equivalent was provided by the band "Defenders of the Universe" on the southern Kornhausplatz.
North of the gallery, the association "Sandtogether" got involved.
Freital: Windbergfest cancelled due to corona
The Windberg Festival will not take place this year.
The city of Freital has cancelled the three-day festival planned for September.
In other years, more than 30,000 people had attended this city festival.
"We really did not take this decision lightly and - aware of how difficult it is economically for those involved - hoped until the last minute," explained Lord Mayor Uwe Rumberg (non-partisan).
"But ultimately, as organisers, we are responsible for the health of many thousands of people."
Because if tens of thousands had streamed onto the festival grounds and into the marquee, minimum distances, hygiene regulations and contact tracing in accordance with the current coronavirus protection regulation could not have been adhered to.
Or the restrictions would have been so severe that there would not have been much left of a folk festival.
In addition, the organizational and monitoring effort would increase disproportionately many times over.
Rumberg consoled for next year.
Then the city of Freital will celebrate its 100th anniversary with the Winterberg Festival from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the Day of the Saxons from 10 to 12 September 2021.
Olympic dressage champion Werth cannot be beaten in Achleiten
Achleiten - Six-time Olympic champion Isabell Werth was the outstanding rider at the dressage tournament in Achleiten, Austria.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg had four wins in four starts at the weekend.
After winning a Grand Prix at the start with Weihegold and Quantaz, she was also unbeatable on Sunday in the Grand Prix Special and in the Freestyle.
On the 15-year-old mare Weihegold, Werth clearly prevailed over the Austrian Victoria Max-Theurer on Abegglen in the special on Sunday.
Also in the freestyle, the German was clearly ahead of her 34-year-old student Victoria Max-Theurer on Saturday on Quantaz.
Werth's winning horse Quantaz is owned by Max-Theurer.
The most successful dressage rider in the world is to establish the ten-year-old stallion in the Grand Prix.
For Quantaz it was the first freestyle ever.
At the first tournament in Achleiten three weeks ago, Werth had already won all four important tests.
The last of the three international tournaments is scheduled for 14 to 16 August.
More air traffic controllers in Worms in the future
The University of Worms continues to take to the skies: The "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" endows a professorship for "Air Traffic Management."
A corresponding contract between the university and DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially concluded for three years and will start in 2021.
With the professorship, it is possible to start studies not only in the summer, but also in the winter semester.
This means that twice as many students can be trained as before.
At the same time, the capacities of both the university and the air traffic control academy of DFS are evenly utilized.
DFS will advise the university on the establishment and appointment of the professorship.
Represented at the university since 2019
Since the summer semester of 2019, the first students have been in the Air Traffic Management course as part of their training as air traffic controllers at the University of Applied Sciences in Worms.
This year, nine students have already started.
So far, the experience of the DFS has been very positive, the performance of the students is excellent.
The combination of studies and pilot training contributes significantly to further increasing the attractiveness of the pilot profession.
"In these times, funding is not easy for us economically.
However, we firmly expect air traffic to recover and grow again in the long term.
In order to be able to fulfill our legal mandate in the future, we need highly qualified personnel," says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, Chairman and CEO of DFS at the signing of the contract.
"For DFS, the endowed professorship is a future-proof investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, interdisciplinary knowledge base in the long term.
We are therefore continuing our good cooperation with the university and at the same time reinforcing our attractiveness as an employer."
This is also underlined by Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of the University of Applied Sciences Worms: "The endowed professorship forms an important bridge between science and business.
With her, we would like to build on the already existing cooperation with DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practice partner for the dual bachelor's degree program in Air Traffic Management."
The trust of Deutsche Flugsicherung is both a motivation and an obligation for the Worms University of Applied Sciences to further expand its teaching and research expertise in the future fields of air transport.
In its commitment to the air traffic controllers of tomorrow, the university can set very special highlights and innovative focal points for its students with the first endowed professorship for a dual course of study.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary at the Ministry of Science, Further Education and Culture, emphasizes: "With its focus on air transport, the University of Worms has a unique selling point in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Today's signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the profile of the university."
Rescue helicopter lands on the A 45
The A 45 motorway in the direction of Aschaffenburg was fully closed for around 30 minutes on Saturday lunchtime, as the rescue helicopter was deployed after a traffic accident.
A 76-year-old man drove a Ford straight ahead around 12:40 p.m. at the Alzenau-Mitte exit in the curve and landed on the guardrail.
As a result of the impact, the front airbags deployed and the driver suffered minor facial injuries and had to be taken to hospital for treatment.
The injuries of the 72-year-old passenger were treated by the emergency doctor and the patient was then flown by rescue helicopter to a hospital.
At present, however, the police assume that there is no danger to life.
The damaged vehicle, which suffered damage of about 2000 euros, had to be towed away.
Heil wants to examine other sectors after the meat industry
The corona crisis once again brought to light the conditions in parts of the meat industry.
Tightening of the law is imminent.
But are they right - and will it stay that way?
Federal Labour Minister Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to review other sectors in accordance with the now planned strict regulations against abuses in the meat industry.
"We will look at industry by industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective industry if necessary," Heil told the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany's employers are already warning against restricting work contracts in general.
After the massive corona outbreak at the meat giant Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the federal cabinet wants to pass a law of salvation this Wednesday.
Large slaughterhouses should no longer be allowed to use third-party personnel for slaughtering, cutting and meat processing.
To this end, the use of contract and temporary workers is to be prohibited there.
Employers' association president Ingo Kramer told dpa: "Stay away from a general restriction of work contracts and temporary employment if you don't want to completely strangle the economy."
For example, for a wide range of trades, the construction industry and plant engineering, work contracts are necessarily the basis for their value creation for the customer.
"The misdeeds of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument."
Heil assured: "My goal is not to ban work contracts everywhere in the German economy."
Contracts for work and services make sense.
"If an industrial company commissions a craftsman to install a safety system, this is a completely normal work contract."
The German meat industry considers a ban on work contracts and temporary agency work in its sector alone to be unconstitutional.
It is not explainable why different labour law should apply to the portioning and packaging of cheese than to sausage in the future, according to a statement on the proposed legislation, as reported by the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Saturday).
A ban would therefore increase the consumer price by 10 to 20 percent per kilo and product.
According to the results of an audit by the NRW Occupational Safety and Health Administration, many Eastern European employees from work contract companies worked in the industry, sometimes 16 hours a day.
Often they did not have a break.
Wages were withheld for protective equipment or rent.
It was also noted that the situation regarding the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Heil said that a relatively strict law had already come into force for the meat industry in 2017.
However, these were circumvented by "tricky constructions."
"Now it has to be fundamentally cleaned up."
The politician announced: "The Occupational Health and Safety Act, which we want to pass in the cabinet at the end of July, also includes measures that do not only affect the meat industry - for example, higher inspection rates for occupational health and safety or clear criteria for shared accommodation."
The draft presented to the dpa includes amendments to the Act on the Protection of Workers' Rights in the Meat Industry and the Occupational Safety and Health Act.
Brandenburg's Minister of Consumer Protection Ursula Nonnemacher (Greens) considers more intensive controls necessary.
"I would like us to be able to do even more inspections in many supervisory areas: food inspections, animal welfare, everything possible, including animal transport, for example," Nonnemacher said on Sunday in the RBB program "Brandenburg aktuell."
But more controls also require more staff positions.
Three dead as ultralight plane crashes in Germany
According to the police, three people died when an ultralight aircraft crashed into an apartment building in Wesel in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia.
One child was slightly injured.
Two other people were rescued injured in the accident, said a spokesman for the Wesel district control center.
A parachute was found at the scene of the accident, police said.
The "Rheinische Post" reported, citing eyewitnesses, that the plane had collided with a hot air balloon before the crash.
The house is a one- or two-family house.
Further details were not immediately known.
Evacuation of Frankfurt's Opernplatz proceeds peacefully
One week after the riots in Frankfurt, the evacuation of the Opernplatz on Sunday night was also peaceful.
At last, a few dozen people were still in the square, but left it before the start of the curfew at 1 o'clock.
The police had been deployed with numerous officers since the early evening, and a larger police presence could be seen throughout the city.
For the first time this weekend, from midnight, there was a ban on entering the Opernplatz, where there had been riots a week ago.
Police officers had been attacked with bottles from the crowd of revelers.
According to police, at least five officers were injured and several police vehicles were damaged.
The night of Saturday had also remained calm.
Car overturns: Young woman seriously injured in accident on Bundesstraße 83 near Hofgeismar
A 21-year-old woman suffered serious injuries in an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme at around 1.25pm on Sunday.
She was taken to the Klinikum Kassel.
The fire brigade used thermal imaging cameras to search for possible passengers.
According to the police, the woman was driving on Bundesstraße 83 in the direction of her home town of Hümme when her car left the road for reasons that have not yet been clarified and overturned several times.
In order to save the victim, the fire brigade had to cut the roof of the car free.
Since it was unclear whether anyone else was in the vehicle, the adjacent cornfield was searched from the turntable ladder with a thermal imaging camera.
The drone squadron from Warburg, which also works with thermal imaging cameras, had also been ordered to search for people.
However, the emergency services did not find anyone among the tall corn plants.
The seriously injured woman was taken by ambulance to the hospital in Kassel for further care.
Nearly 50 firefighters from the Hofgeismar, Hümme and Schöneberg fire departments were on the scene.
The highway was closed for two hours due to the accident.
Juventus Turin champions in Italy
Turin - After a redemptive goal by Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin has secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in a row.
The team around the five-time world footballer completed the 36th Scudetto in the club's history with a 2-0 (1-0) win at home against Sampdoria Genoa on Sunday evening.
Ronaldo scored to make it 1-0 before half-time.
With 83 points, Turin, which competed without the recently long-injured ex-national player Sami Khedira, can no longer be ousted from first place two days before the end of the Serie A season.
Second-placed Inter Milan are seven points behind.
Juventus was harmless despite visual superiority in the first half, then Ronaldo scored after a free-kick variation with the last action.
The 35-year-old converted a pass from Miralem Pjanic from the edge of the penalty area with a low shot (45+7).
Against the now more offensive guests, Ronaldo was also involved in the 2-0, after his shot, Federico Bernardeschi (67th) dusted off.
This ensured the lackluster but decisive success.
The foul penalty that hit the crossbar in the 89th minute should only have annoyed Ronaldo himself with a view to the scorer's standings.
"It's complicated to stay mentally and physically on the ball for 90 minutes.
The games are strange, and the momentum changes very easily," explained coach Maurizio Sarri after the 1:2 at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Above all, the mental exhaustion of his players is great, said the Juve coach.
Because of the defeat, the Turin team had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
In the end, Juve's reassuring lead at the top of the table was mainly due to the weakness of their rivals.
Because in the eleven games before the match on Sunday, the Sarri team had only managed five victories.
Whether Ronaldo will also be the top scorer is questionable.
Because while the Portuguese superstar has scored 31 goals so far, the former Dortmund player Ciro Immobile has already scored 34 goals after his three-pack at 5:1 (1:1) of the fourth-placed Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to FC Bayern's title win.
The current Juve professional Gonzalo Higuaín holds the record in Italy.
The Argentine scored 36 goals for SSC Napoli in the 2015/2016 season.
In August, the next title opportunity awaits the "Old Lady" of Italian football.
Juventus are in the last 16 of the Champions League, but must overturn a 1-0 first-leg deficit against Olympique Lyon on 7 August to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next knockout round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would be waiting as opponents.
Baden-Württemberg: More than 250 illegal car races recorded
Stuttgart - Despite all the threatened penalties and court rulings, motorists continue to accelerate in countless illegal races on the roads of Baden-Württemberg: Last year and the first four months of this year, the police in the southwest have already registered more than 250 illegal car races.
There are no comparable figures for previous years, but the speeders are increasingly making work for the judicial authorities: In 2018, a total of 155 investigations into illegal races were conducted at the public prosecutor's offices between Konstanz and Mannheim, a year later there were already 252 and in the current year up to the beginning of June already 151.
The races were less about organized events, as can be seen from the response of the Ministry of the Interior to a request from the state parliament SPD.
In most cases, the drivers spontaneously competed against each other or they fled from the police - this is also reported as an illegal race.
The drivers were mainly German men between the ages of 18 and 60.
113 fines - 15 times imprisonment
Only in comparatively few cases are the speeders caught and also asked to pay: According to the Ministry of the Interior, a total of 113 fines and 15 prison sentences have been imposed since 2018.
However, there is no evidence that the number of illegal car races is actually increasing.
Rather, other drivers reacted more sensitively than before because of the numerous tragic accidents and trials of past years and indicated more frequently, said a ministry spokesman.
The Autobahn 8 is particularly popular with speeders. Again and again, motorists slow down the traffic there in order to gain space and use the free track for a race.
Last August, a dozen drivers were caught near Kirchheim unter Teck, three months earlier there were even 18 drivers on the A8 near Merklingen.
A81 is most popular "race track"
The police even register more races on the A81 than on any other federal motorway.
With a speed limit there is an attempt to slow down the speeders on the particularly affected section between Engen and Geisingen.
The mostly high-priced and souped-up sports and luxury cars often have Swiss license plates, because the drivers avoid Germany because of the high penalties for speeding and car races in the neighboring country.
For the SPD, the speed limit must not be reduced to a few routes: "With a general speed limit of 130 kilometres per hour, we would get rid of this problem on motorways," says Martin Rivoir, the traffic expert of the SPD parliamentary group.
"The threshold for speeders would be significantly higher if you weren't still legally allowed to drive at 200 kilometers per hour and more here and there."
Rivoir thinks less of education or image campaigns: "Anyone who flouts all the rules in such a way and risks not only their own life, but also the lives of other road users, is hardly reachable with reason."
ADAC calls for stronger police action
However, this is not enough for the ADAC: "We assume that speeders will not be deterred by the speed limits," says Holger Bach, Head of Traffic and Environment at the ADAC Württemberg.
He calls for additional and also tougher controls on the affected routes.
Not infrequently, the high-speed test of strength turns into painful and momentous seriousness: Since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people have died nationwide in the races, two of them bystanders in a nighttime crash in Stuttgart's city center and one in Gerlingen.
Two young men are said to have been involved in a car race there in November.
One of the vehicles came off the road, crashed into a garden wall and lay on its side, the 18-year-old passenger died.
21 other people were injured in the races of the past two years.
However, according to Interior Minister Thomas Strobl, harsher penalties are not necessary: "There is no need for legislative action to sanction illegal motor vehicle races more severely," according to the paper of the Ministry of the Interior.
Blue light of July 23: Thirsty burglar steals drinks from snack bar
Rohrdorf: A man broke into a snack bar in Rohrdorf (district of Calw) on Thursday and stole drinks and cash.
A witness heard noises in the valley road at around 3.40 a.m. and ran towards the snack bar.
There he noticed a man who helped himself to drinks from the fridge and then left the snack bar through a previously smashed front door.
The perpetrator fled in the direction of the meadows behind the snack bar.
According to the police, the burglar also used a cash register and stole cash in the low three-digit range.
The suspect is described as follows: He is about 1.75 to 1.80 meters tall and of strong stature.
He was wearing a black hooded jumper, black trousers and light-coloured shoes.
The police are taking further witness statements.
Ackermann sprints to victory on final stage of Sibiu Tour
Professional cyclist Pascal Ackermann claimed his second victory of the day on the final stage of the 10th Sibiu Tour.
The 26-year-old Palatine from the Bora-hansgrohe team prevailed in a bunch sprint on the 109-kilometre section with start and finish in Sibiu, having already won a stage on Saturday.
They were the third and fourth victories of the season for Ackermann.
His Austrian team mate Gregor Mühlberger prevailed in the overall standings.
The 26-year-old had confidently won the mountain time trial in the morning and thus took over the lead in the classification.
Only 104 riders were left in the evening for the final stage.
No less than 18 starters had fallen victim to the time limit in the mountain time trial.
"I'm really happy to start the season restart with a win," Ackermann said after his success on Saturday.
"The sprint was really hectic," said the 26-year-old.
With 300 meters to go, he simply tightened up his sprint, "and it worked out perfectly."
In accordance with the rules of the world association UCI, all race participants and their companions underwent a corona test six days before the start of the race.
During the entire tour, drivers and supervisors were separated from the organizing team and the media in isolated hygiene bubbles.
Spectators at the start and finish were not allowed.
Control center gave instructions for lay resuscitation
Düsseldorf - Tragic accident on Sunday afternoon in Düsseldorf-Garath.
In an apartment building, a child (4) suddenly lay lifeless in the water while taking a bath.
According to the fire department, the emergency call was received shortly before 1 p.m.
"A control room dispatcher immediately gave instructions for amateur resuscitation," a fire brigade spokesman told BILD.
The arriving rescue workers took over the resuscitation measures a little later.
The child, whose life was in danger, was transported to the university hospital under resuscitation.
It is unclear why it crashed.
The police have opened a routine investigation into the circumstances of the accident.
The fire brigade spokesman: "We assume a tragic accident in the apartment."
Nuremberg: Unauthorised tuning meeting - police intervene, 700 vehicles and around 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and at times more than 1,000 people took part in a "tuning meeting" in the parking lot of a furniture store on Saturday night.
The police followed through on their announcement to step up control of such events.
A large tuning meeting took place on Saturday evening (25 July 2020) in Nuremberg's Südstadt.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the Mittelfranken police, the Nuremberg traffic police detected an increased number of vehicles in the area of a large parking lot on Ingolstädter Straße at around 10:30 p.m.
The police then carried out a large number of vehicle checks there.
Only recently, the police had announced that they wanted to take more action against so-called autoposers.
Illegal tuning meeting in Nuremberg: Only a small part of the "scene"
The officers counted a good 700 vehicles and about 1100 people at the peak, according to the police.
Of these, however, only a small proportion of those present can be attributed to the "car poser" and tuning scene.
Apparently, the majority of the relevant scene complied with the police appeal.
Based on the vehicles and people on site, it can be assumed that these were mostly onlookers.
In addition, the vast majority of those present adhered to the applicable infection protection regulations, in particular the observance of the minimum distance and the wearing of a mouth and nose protection.
The control measures carried out on site were completed around 1:00 a.m.
In total, the officials found such structural changes in 10 vehicles that the operating permit had expired.
Four of these vehicles had to be seized.
No car racing
There were no illegal car races.
"The Central Franconia police headquarters will continue to keep an eye on the events and will continue to carry out increased control measures, also in connection with the appearance of onlookers," it said.
The News5 agency spoke to Jürgen Schrödinger from the towing company involved: "They all have nice rims, we must not scratch them," said Schrödinger.
Special tapes would be used for this.
Also because the cars are wider, the company has to be careful not to cause any damage.
"After all, the young people should get their cars back undamaged."
Figures from the employment agency: 900 suspected cases of abuse in short-time work
Berlin - According to its own statement, the Federal Employment Agency (BA) is investigating around 900 suspected cases of abuse of the short-time work allowance.
"With more than 880,000 companies that have reported short-time working, this is extremely low," Daniel Terzenbach, the board member responsible for operations, told the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung."
When a large number of companies suddenly applied for short-time work at the beginning of the corona crisis, the BA had to react quickly.
Normally, the examination takes up to three weeks.
"We didn't have that much time in this hot phase.
We will therefore take a closer look at the final accounts.
There will certainly be more to come.
We are not naïve and we have a lot of stamina."
Indications of abuse often come from the affected employees or trade unions.
In addition, the BA uses analysis software to detect patterns of abuse.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is preparing for a possible wave of insolvencies in the autumn.
"Will there be significantly more insolvencies than in the previous year?
Estimates vary, but we are preparing for the eventuality and are already training our employees in the employment agencies to process applications for insolvency benefits."
The figures are still unremarkable, said Terzenbach.
World Heritage in Potsdam: Party in the New Garden dissolved
Potsdam - On Friday evening, about 40 young people celebrated a party in the New Garden.
The gathering was broken up at 8:48 p.m. by the rangers of the Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation (SPSG), the foundation said in response to a request from PNN.
The youths then left the park.
On Saturday evening, some young people played rugby in the New Garden.
The meadow had been cleared by district drivers, said SPSG spokesman Frank Kallensee on Sunday.
Again and again there are illegal celebrations in the parks
In the parks of the foundation, there are always gatherings in which the distance and hygiene rules of Covid-19 regulations are not observed.
At the end of June, there was a celebration with about 300 people in Babelsberg Park, and a week later about 150 people celebrated in the New Garden.
Even without a coronavirus order, the parks will be closed at nightfall.
According to the park regulations, camping on the meadows is prohibited; there are only a few exceptions.
The foundation has been complaining for some time that visitors are leaving more and more rubbish behind and destroying protected biotopes.
In Berlin, meanwhile, illegal park parties have reached another dimension.
In Hasenheide in the district of Neukölln, 5,000 people celebrated an illegal techno party on Sunday night.
The event was broken up by the police.
Austria: Mass testing after corona outbreak in tourist resort
Authorities have responded to a corona outbreak in the popular Upper Austrian tourist resort of St. Wolfgang with hundreds of tests.
The number of confirmed cases rose to 48, according to the state authorities in Linz.
More than 100 results were still pending in the evening.
According to this, many of the infected are young interns in tourism companies, but at least one holiday guest has also tested positive.
Residents, guests and tourism workers were asked to stay in their accommodation on Saturday night.
The curfew was set at 11 p.m.
"There are cancellations and cancellations" of bookings here and there, the head of the Wolfgangsee tourism association, Hans Wieser, told dpa.
A few guests also left early.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist resort in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 overnight stays last year.
In a normal season, around a third of the guests are German.
The first infections were publicly announced on Friday.
The head of the district authority, Alois Lanz, defended on Saturday the behavior of the interns, who had partied in several restaurants and could have been infected there.
"We all liked to do that in our youth," he told the Ö1 radio station.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The tourist board launched an information campaign to make young employees aware of the dangers of Covid-19.
From Saturday, hundreds of employees, holidaymakers and locals were tested.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang from July 15 were contacted.
The outbreak brings back memories of the Austrian ski and party resort of Ischgl in Tyrol, which was a centre for the spread of corona throughout Europe in the initial phase of the pandemic.
In total, more than 1500 people are currently infected with the virus in Austria.
The focus of the new infections is Vienna and Upper Austria.
Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualify for Champions League
London (dpa) - English football's record champions Manchester United are returning to the Champions League after a one-year absence.
The Red Devils secured third place in the table on the final day of the Premier League with a 2-0 (0-0) victory over direct rivals Leicester City.
The Foxes now have to be content with the Europa League, because Chelsea FC still passed and also qualified for the premier class in fourth place.
In the fight against relegation, Aston Villa could celebrate.
Manchester United took the lead through a penalty from Bruno Fernandes (71st minute).
After a red card for Leicester City in injury time, Jesse Lingard (90th+8) scored the final goal.
Chelsea, Bayern's opponents in the Champions League round of 16, won 2-0 (2-0) against Wolverhampton Wanderers thanks to Mason Mount (45th+1) and Olivier Giroud (45th+4).
"This means a lot to me," said coach Frank Lampard, who in his first season as Chelsea coach is also in the final of the FA Cup against Arsenal.
Tottenham Hotspur also benefited from Chelsea's victory against Wolverhampton, edging past Wolves with a meagre 1:1 (1:0) at Crystal Palace and starting in sixth place in the Europa League.
Aston Villa won the long-distance duel with FC Watford and AFC Bournemouth, but had to tremble at West Ham United for a long time.
The late lead of Jack Grealish (84th) was immediately offset by Andrei Yarmolenko (85th).
The 1:1 (0:0) was enough, however, because Watford lost 2:3 (1:3) at Arsenal.
The club, which fired three coaches during the season, is relegated after five years in the first division.
Just like Bournemouth, who couldn't save themselves from a 3-1 (2-1) defeat at Everton.
In the end, one point was missing.
Liverpool FC, who have been confirmed as English champions since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3-1 (1-1) victory at Newcastle United.
99 points is the most the Reds have ever scored in a football season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp and his team narrowly missed out on the points record in English football.
The record is held by Manchester City with 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
After Newcastle took the lead in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38th), Divock Origi (59th) and Sadio Mané (89th) turned the game around for Liverpool on Sunday.
"It has been an exceptional season for this wonderful club," said goalscorer van Dijk after the game, "which should spur us on to defend the title.
It will be difficult."
The Premier League bosses are also likely to be satisfied in the end.
Due to the coronavirus crisis, football in England was suspended from 13 March to 17 June.
In the meantime, there were even discussions about an early cancellation or a staging of the remaining games on neutral ground.
In the end, however, the season could be played to the end without any particular incidents - but, as in Germany, without spectators in the stadiums.
Arrests and violence at anti-Netanyahu demonstrations
The protests in Israel against Prime Minister Netanyahu are becoming increasingly violent.
There were violent clashes during the night.
Israeli police violently cracked down on participants in a demonstration against right-wing conservative Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem on Sunday night.
Twelve people were arrested for participating in riots, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said.
The police used, among other things, water cannons to break up the rally.
According to media reports, a total of around 6,000 people had gathered near Netanyahu's official residence on Saturday evening.
They were protesting against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu's handling of the corona crisis.
The protesters beat drums, blew horns and called on Netanyahu to resign.
Participants in a counter-demonstration supporting Netanyahu were also arrested, the news site "ynet" reported.
People also demonstrated in many other places in Israel, including in front of the prime minister's private villa in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
A man was arrested near Tel Aviv on suspicion of spraying pepper spray from a moving car at protesters on the side of the road, police said.
Another man was arrested after a knife attack on a protester in the south of the country.
The protester was slightly injured in the neck.
There have been several demonstrations against Netanyahu in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv recently.
The rallies accompany the corruption trial against the head of government.
Most recently, Netanyahu has also been criticized for his handling of the corona crisis.
Among other things, he is accused of premature easing and a lack of preparation for a second corona wave.
The corona crisis has hit the country's economy hard.
The unemployment rate recently stood at more than 20 percent.
The number of new infections with the coronavirus in Israel recently rose to new record levels.
Accident near Ahlen (NRW) - Van crashes into car - nine injured - Ruhr area - Bild.de
Ahlen - A rear-end collision on the B58 near Ahlen on Saturday afternoon left nine people with minor injuries.
A motorist was driving with her two children (3, 5) in the direction of Beckum.
The police: "Presumably she had braked suddenly because she wanted to turn."
The driver of a Mercedes van, who was driving behind her, must have seen this too late.
He crashed into the back of the car.
Three passengers in the car and six in the van were slightly injured in the accident.
Several ambulances took them to a nearby hospital.
North Korea seals off border town after suspected coronavirus case
North Korea has so far seen its own measures to ward off the coronavirus as a "shining success."
Now the country is reporting a suspected case for the first time.
Due to a first official suspected case of coronavirus in the country, North Korea has completely sealed off a major city for fear of a catastrophe.
Despite the strictest epidemiological countermeasures over the past six months, "the malignant virus could have been introduced into the country," state media reported.
A state of emergency has been declared for the region around the border city of Kaesong.
The communist leadership declared the highest level of alert.
If the suspected case is confirmed, it would be the first official case of infection with Sars-CoV-2 in the isolated country.
North Korea had not registered a single infection so far, according to its own information, and described its defensive measures as a "shining success."
The information was doubted abroad.
The symptoms of the disease were reportedly detected in a "runaway" who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on July 19.
The person had defected to South Korea three years ago and had now returned across the border.
There was initially no confirmation from South Korea of the border crossing within the four-kilometre-wide and largely still mined military buffer zone.
South Korea's military, however, acknowledged the possibility of an illegal border crossing into North Korea as high, according to reports from the national news agency Yonhap.
There were investigations into a number of people.
According to North Korea, an emergency meeting of the Politburo of the Workers' Party, chaired by leader Kim Jong Un, was called on Saturday because of the suspected case.
The "dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive disaster."
As a preventive measure, Kim had already ordered on Friday to "completely block Kaesong and isolate each district and the region from others," it added.
The affected person, as well as all people in Kaesong who have had contact with her, have been quarantined.
The party's central military commission is to investigate the "outlier case" as well as the conduct of the responsible military unit and, if necessary, impose severe punishment.
It is estimated that about 300,000 people live in Kaesong.
Tension before council meeting: City East and noise protection are still up for discussion before the big summer break
"In addition to environmental issues, the committee members will also vote on the development plan for the large-scale project Innenstadtentwicklung-Ost," it says rather casually in the middle section of the municipal press release for the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, 28 July, at 4.30 pm in the Great Hall of the CongressCentrum Pforzheim.
The upgrading of the eastern part of the city in particular, however, will be the subject of controversy until the end.
The majorities in favour are narrow, most recently in some committees even negative, depending on the attendance.
An appeal from the economy (construction, real estate, trade and IT) not to let the project, which was developed out of the citizenry and then by the administration and the local council, fail after almost ten years of preparation, was criticized by project opponent Reinhard Klein as "extra-parliamentary opposition," "clueless," "speculation," "denigration" and "deliberate false statements."
"Everyone thinks they know better," said Klein, who has been a member of the municipal council for a year as the only representative of the Pforzheim citizens' list.
In fact, after reading the contracts, he is in this position: "I know what I am talking about."
The exit is cheaper for the city, the Technical Town Hall is, contrary to statements by the city administration, to be renovated for 8.5 million euros after subsidies, of whose existence Klein is convinced.
The city will develop quite differently from what is predicted in the town hall and by the proponents from the business community.
To shape the city through its own strength and not an investor: that is his plan B. One day after Klein, the FDP/FW/UB/LED group, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
It essentially also provides for the renovation of the Technical Town Hall, the opening of the Schloßberg, the rental of the Ex-Thales for administrative areas and a smaller-scale inner-city transformation, ideally with local agencies.
Environmental issues play a central role
In addition, environmental issues in particular will play a central role.
Among other things, the municipal council will vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the Pforzheim population from health-related noise pollution caused by road traffic, including speed reductions in many cases.
In a press release, the local Verkehrsclub Deutschland welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30. However, the political leaders in the city are not innocent of the fact that this has to happen, because they have only contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus noise by neglecting regular bus traffic with thinned cycles and by little commitment to cycling, according to the VCD.
The municipal council also votes on the city's participation in the Energy and Climate Protection Agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
Also on the agenda is the accession to the climate protection pact of the state of Baden-Württemberg, the revision of the parental contributions in the municipal day-care facilities and the application for inclusion in the federal Smart City funding.
Citizens are welcome, but must observe corona protection measures.
Tim Zimmermann starts the new season with a lot of delay
After a delay of almost half a year, Tim Zimmermann will start his debut season in the ADAC GT Masters on 31 July.
Before the league of super sports cars can start regular operations, the first test drives were now scheduled.
For Zimmermann, it was all about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3 better.
For a long time, the Corona crisis prevented Tim Zimmermann from taking his first official drive in the new Lamborghini Huracan of Grasser Racing.
This was now possible under special hygienic conditions.
The 23-year-old from Langenargen did his first laps at the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his debut in a GT3 car.
"There are already a few things that are different from the Porsche from the previous season," says Zimmermann.
"With the ABS, for example, you have to go into the corners differently.
But it was really a lot of fun."
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite being only 25 years old, the Dutchman is already experienced in GT racing and was able to help his new team-mate in many ways.
"I'm not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series brings new challenges," says Zimmermann.
"Steijn and I get on brilliantly and we have also made enormous progress from session to session at the Lausitzring."
It is exactly there - at the Lausitzring - that the GT Masters will also hold its first race.
From 31 July, the 33 supercars will race through Lusatia.
But Zimmermann, who is one of 15 newcomers to the series, knows the track.
He was last a guest at the Motodrom in 2015.
"It worked quickly and I didn't have to get used to the track very much," says Zimmermann, who competes for the Friedrichshafen racing association Graf Zeppelin.
"The Lausitzring has many fast sections that you have to hit perfectly in order to be fast."
We'll find out in two weeks how fast Zimmermann really is.
"Of course, the teams play a bit of poker during the tests," he says.
"In the end, however, we are very satisfied and are looking forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring."
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a tightly packed calendar.
There are seven races until the beginning of November.
The current status is that no spectators will be allowed - but there is a celebrity guest.
In mid-August at the Nürburgring, ex-Formula 1 driver Niko Hülkenberg will take to the GT steering wheel.
British transport minister caught cold by quarantine decision
The British government's decision to quarantine holidaymakers in Spain for two weeks after their return has caught the country's transport minister cold, according to press reports.
Accordingly, Grant Shapps is currently on holiday in Spain, of all places, while his colleagues at home decided on the measure on Saturday.
Due to the rising coronavirus numbers in Spain, the cabinet in London removed the country from the list of countries from which entry is possible without quarantine requirements.
The new rule applies from today, Sunday, so Shapps will also have to quarantine on his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returnees.
But the rule applies to those who are just on holiday on the deadline, only from Saturday, 1 August, and was not introduced overnight.
Incidentally, Spain is still considered one of the "safe countries" in Austria, for which no quarantine is required in Austria.
"Numerous ministers must have known in advance that there was a possibility of a quarantine being imposed on holidaymakers to Spain," commented Labour MP Diane Abbot.
"But apparently no one bothered to tell Grant Shapps."
Almost a month after the end of the corona emergency in Spain and the expiry of the strict curfew, the number of infections in the country is rising again.
Virologists blame the nightlife in particular for the renewed spread.
Spain is one of the favourite holiday destinations of the British.
The British government currently advises against non-essential travel to mainland Spain, with the exception of the Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands, which are particularly popular with British holidaymakers.
So far, more than 272,000 infections with the novel coronavirus and more than 28,000 deaths have been registered in Spain.
Russia: Navy Day: Putin announces hypersonic weapons for warships
On the occasion of Navy Day in his country, Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced that warships will be equipped with the most modern hypersonic weapons.
With these weapons, which are unique in the world, the combat capabilities of the Russian naval forces will be expanded, Putin said on Sunday in St. Petersburg at the central naval parade.
The Defense Ministry also informed the Interfax agency about successful tests of the Zircon hypersonic missile built for the Navy.
The hypersonic weapons have a multiple of the speed of sound of around 343 meters per second.
They are considered weapons of the future.
Underwater Tropedeo continues to be built
The nuclear-capable underwater torpedo Poseidon will also continue to be built, it said.
The planned sea drone is designed to destroy coastal targets.
The president, who himself rode on a military boat, said that this year alone, 40 new ships would be put into service with the individual fleet associations of the largest country in the world.
Russia has more coastline than any other country in the world.
For 300 years, the navy has reliably protected Russia, Putin said at the day celebrated by sailors nationwide.
The naval forces also celebrated Navy Day with parades in many other Russian coastal locations.
In Syria, where Russia is fighting on the side of ruler Bashar al-Assad, the military demonstrated its strength at a weapons show in the Mediterranean port of Tartus.
Ammunition was also fired there.
A video released by the Ministry of Defense showed not only warships, including a submarine, but also attack helicopters and jets.
Hurricane "Hanna" reaches Texas: Aid hampered by corona
Washington - The first hurricane of this year's Atlantic season has made landfall in Texas.
Life-threatening floods, strong winds and heavy rains are now threatening parts of the US state, the National Hurricane Center of the US climate agency NOAA announced on Sunday night (local time).
Governor Greg Abbott declared a state of emergency for numerous counties.
The coronavirus pandemic raging in Texas is making the work of aid workers more difficult, Abbott said, according to US media.
Evacuees urged to be cautious
"Every hurricane is a tremendous challenge," Abbott said, according to the Houston Chronicle.
Referring to the hurricane in Texas, he added: "This challenge is complicated and is compounded when you consider that it is sweeping through an area that is the most affected by Covid-19 in the state."
According to Johns Hopkins University, around 5,000 people have died in Texas alone as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.
Abbott urged people who had to leave their homes to be cautious.
They should not disregard practices "to which we have become accustomed," such as wearing masks, the governor said, according to CBS.
It was important that everyone kept their distance.
Therefore, hotel rooms were also provided in some places.
In addition, emergency shelters should be tested for corona.
Damage was initially reported only from the coastal town of Port Mansfield.
Storm warning withdrawn again
With wind speeds of up to 150 kilometers per hour, "Hanna" made landfall on Padre Island just off the Texas coast, according to authorities.
The tropical storm had previously been upgraded to the lowest level one hurricane.
A storm surge warning was initially issued for the coastal section from Port Mansfield to Sargent and was later withdrawn.
Authorities expected it to weaken as Hanna moved further inland and headed toward northeastern Mexico.
"Douglas" moves towards Hawaii
In the Pacific, Hurricane Douglas was heading towards Hawaii on Sunday night with wind speeds of around 150 kilometres per hour.
The hurricane center, however, expected it to weaken further.
According to the forecast, it should be near the largest islands of Hawaii on Sunday (local time) - then as a storm just below the hurricane threshold.
Over the Atlantic, NOAA expected an above-average active hurricane season this year, according to a forecast from May.
From June to the end of November, up to ten hurricanes are to be expected, of which up to six could become very strong hurricanes, the agency had declared.
On average, there are six hurricanes per year over the Atlantic, three of which develop into major storms.
In view of available climate data and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, the probability of a normal season is only 30 percent, and the probability of a below-average season is only 10 percent, it was said at the time.
US President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that his government was closely monitoring the storms and was in contact with the affected states.
Four goals disallowed: Video assistant "punishes" Sassuolo
Sassuolo's Filip Djuricic had two goals disallowed
Napoli - Four goals scored, four goals disallowed: Sassuolo Calcio experienced a pitch-black evening at 0:2 (0:1) at SSC Napoli in the Italian football league Serie A - and was really angry with the referee's video assistant.
"A festival of missed goals for Sassuolo.
Never before has VAR come down so hard on a team," commented Corriere dello Sport.
Hosts Napoli had taken the lead through a goal from full-back Elseid Hisaj in the 8th minute, with Filip Djuricic initially celebrating the equaliser in the 32nd minute.
The Video Assistant Referee (VAR) took the goal back because of an offside position.
Five minutes later, Djuricic shot the ball into the net again - again the VAR intervened.
Also the goals of attacker Francesco Caputo (50th) and Domenico Berardi (61st) were taken back by the refereeing team after advice from the VAR.
In injury time, Allan made the 2-0 final score for Napoli and the bitter evening for Sassuolo perfect.
"The VAR is worse for Sassuolo than a radar trap on the road and punishes Sassuolo like no team before.
The new technology is setting records," writes the "Gazzetta dello Sport."
FC Bayern Munich: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start of the hot preparation phase for the Champions League began with a setback for double winners FC Bayern.
Hansi Flick, who has recovered "fairly well" after a short holiday and a few days of training, has to consider after the first team training session how he can rebuild his successful defence after the injury of world champion Benjamin Pavard.
The Frenchman, who has the third most minutes behind captain Manuel Neuer and midfield boss Joshua Kimmich, suffered a ligament injury to the root of his left foot and is in danger of missing crucial top-class duels.
In Munich's filthy weather, the right-back abandoned a training match and was driven off the pitch in a golf cart.
How long the unrestricted regular has to pause in the fight for the title is open.
An appearance in the second leg of the round of 16 against Chelsea on 8 August is likely to be difficult, but the 24-year-old can hope for the final tournament, which begins on 12 August in Lisbon.
However, the Bavarians do not want to let the mishap from Sunday's training stop them.
In his personal triple formula, Flick named the three attributes he wants to see from his stars on their way to Portugal's capital.
Quality, intensity and concentration should show his victory-hungry title collectors in the ideally following 28 days until the premier class final on 23 August.
"We simply mastered the mandatory tasks with the championship and the cup excellently.
Now we have to create something special," said Flick.
Until the Munich team can concretely deal with the final tournament and before that a training camp in the Algarve, the first duty is the round of 16 against FC Chelsea.
After the 3-0 in the first leg before the Corona break, the Londoners should not become Bayern's nightmare again in their home arena as in the lost "Finale dahoam" in 2012.
"We have to go through the door first.
We want to win, create good conditions and gain confidence with a good game," demanded Flick.
A test to get in the mood will be on Friday against Olympique Marseille.
With a long speech, Flick had sworn his stars, who had 13 days of vacation after the double, to a unique August.
He welcomed 31 players to Säbener Straße, including the new players around Edel-Einkauf Leroy Sané, who met all his new colleagues on the pitch for the first time after his move from Manchester City.
"Like all newcomers, Leroy has fitted in well," reported Flick.
But instead of talking about the new season, when Sané & Co. are no longer only allowed to train, Flick preferred to talk about the current title project of the German series champion.
After days of individual and small group training, they are now training as a team for the Londoners, who, unlike the Flick ensemble, are in the rhythm of the game.
After that, Munich could face a quarter-final against FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, while Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus are possible opponents in the semi-finals.
A path to the final in Lisbon "is not so easy," stressed the head coach, who will be able to rely on the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training from Tuesday.
The World Cup record scorer Klose and Flick know from many a joint tournament preparation what is particularly important in the 0-to-100 attunement.
Working with his current team is "a pleasure," praised Flick.
The "focus on winning" is an impressive trait of his team.
The tournament with nine-man teams was also ambitious on Sunday.
Of the top performers, all were there, including Thiago, who wants to leave, and defender David Alaba, whose stay beyond the premier league season is not guaranteed.
Formula 1 needs a special rule to crown its world champion
Since it is not possible to race on the required number of continents, the FIA has to improvise in order to award the world titles.
All American races, however, were cancelled.
Race calendar becomes more and more concrete
The race calendar for the current Formula 1 season continues to take shape.
In addition to the ten Grand Prix confirmed so far, three more racetracks were added during the week.
In October, there will be races at the Nürburgring in Germany and in Portimão, Portugal.
On the first of November, Lewis Hamilton and Co. will fight for World Championship points at the traditional Italian race track in Imola.
As things stand, the 2020 racing calendar thus comprises 13 rounds.
"We are pleased that we continue to make great progress in finalising our plans for the 2020 season," said Formula 1 boss Chase Carey.
A total of 15 to 18 races in the premier class of motorsport are to be completed in this extraordinary season.
Formula 1 wants to finish its season in Asia.
The final race calendar is to be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
According to media reports, performances in Vietnam and Malaysia at the end of November could take place before the already officially targeted races in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December.
Regulations require races on three continents
However, the regulations of Formula 1 require at least races on three continents for the award of the world championship.
Even if, as currently planned, only two continents are raced on, there should be a world champion.
With the help of a special rule, the FIA wants to award the titles citing "extraordinary circumstances" due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The traditional start of the season in Australia in March had to be cancelled at short notice due to the impending coronavirus crisis.
A return to the continent this year is not an issue.
In addition, Formula 1 will not be in America this year.
Cancellation met with criticism in Brazil
Due to the tense corona situation, the races in Canada, the USA, Mexico and Brazil will not take place.
"We're looking forward to being back with them next season," Carey said.
The cancellation of the American races was met with criticism, especially in Brazil: "The cancellation did not come as a surprise to us, but we cannot accept the reasons for it," said Tamas Rohonyi, promoter of the Grand Prix in São Paulo.
For example, the number of infections in the São Paulo area is significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
In addition, the concerns of some teams about not wanting to race in Brazil would not justify a cancellation.
They are prepared for the required security measures.
Greta Thunberg: Evil eye against Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest on Stephen Colbert's well-known late-night show via video link and revealed in the interview what she had in mind when she met Donald Trump.
Climate activist Greta Thunberg was a guest on a popular US late-night show via video link.
Among other things, she told of her struggle against the powerful of the world.
The teenager also spoke about her famous "evil eye" during her encounter with Donald Trump.
New York City - In the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has attracted attention with her tireless work for the "Fridays For Future" movement.
Now she spoke in a well-known latenight show about her plans in the future as well as her encounter with US President Donald Trump at the UN climate summit last year.
Late-night host Stephen Colbert welcomed the 17-year-old Thunberg to his show on Tuesday and conducted a lengthy interview with the Swede.
She spoke not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the powerful of the world.
"There are some things that surprised me," she said.
She was shocked by "how far people go to shift the focus away from the climate crisis."
She has experienced "everything from organized hate campaigns to threats just because a group of children takes to the streets."
She finds heads of state and leading politicians who mock her on social media or even try to silence her "funny" because they show her the reactions "because they have no other answer to it."
It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was asked about a well-known scene in which she gave US President Trump a bitter look.
At the 2019 UN Climate Summit in New York, for which the activist sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive gaze was captured by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
The short clip was turned into a GIF, an animated image that eventually became one of the most frequently used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think of the US president at that moment?
To the relatively open question of Stephen Colbert, she answered only briefly and dryly: "To be honest, I don't think that needs any further explanation."
The experienced satirist Colbert had probably not expected the quick-witted answer and disappeared from the picture with a short laugh.
With her "How dare you?" speech about the principles of climate protection, she was remembered by many at the climate conference.
Ex-Dortmund player Immobile scores hat-trick for Lazio
Ciro Immobile is now level with Bayern's Robert Lewandowski in the race for Europe's Golden Boot.
Former Dortmund player Ciro Immobile still has the best chance of becoming the top scorer in the Italian football championship.
The former BVB player scored three goals in Lazio's 5-1 (1-1) win at Hellas Verona, including two converted penalties in injury time in both halves.
Two games before the end of the season, the 30-year-old from the fourth place in the table now has 34 season goals to his credit - the same number scored by Robert Lewandowski of FC Bayern Munich in the past Bundesliga season.
In Italy, Cristiano Ronaldo follows with 30 goals so far, the Portuguese superstar met with the leader in the evening against Sampdoria Genoa.
Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green has died
His life was like a roller coaster ride: after a rapid ascent with Fleetwood Mac, it went steeply downhill and then slowly up again.
Blues rock guitarist Peter Green has died at the age of 73.
Genius guitarist, drug junkie, cult follower: The co-founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully in his sleep at the age of 73, family members said in an official statement on Saturday, and a further statement would be announced in the next few days.
Top musicians such as Peter Frampton praised Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
In an emotional reaction, Mick Fleetwood spoke of a "monumental loss" for all past and present members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
Drummer Fleetwood and guitarist Green founded the now legendary band in London in 1967, and his dreamy instrumental hit "Albatross" remains unforgettable to this day.
The musician's life ("The End Of The Game," "In The Skies") was like a roller coaster ride.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a rapid rise - but the band celebrated its greatest successes without him.
Among other things, there is said to have been a dispute because Green wanted to donate all the group's profits to charity.
He began to appear in broad robes and with a large crucifix.
Mental health problems are also said to have played a role.
Just three years after forming, Green left the band in 1970.
This was followed by a social decline.
The blues-rock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, according to biographers.
For a long time, Green was treated in psychiatry.
For much of the 1970s, the musician disappeared from the scene.
He is said to have lived on the streets at times, worked as a cemetery gardener and spent some time in an Israeli kibbutz.
Green was born in 1946 to a working-class Jewish family in Bethnal Green, London.
From a young age, he was enthusiastic about US blues musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At the age of eleven, he learned his first guitar chords.
At the age of 15, the teenager began to play the guitar professionally and five years later got the chance to be on stage as lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners.
A little later he was hired as a replacement for his idol Eric Clapton in the Bluesbreakers.
In the midst of the blues boom, Green formed Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967 with fellow Bluesbreakers Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross," composed by Green, gave the group their first number 1 hit in the winter of 1968/69 and catapulted them to the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid rise soon showed its dark side: Green could not cope with the media hype, his experiments with the drug LSD became more and more extreme.
He later commented on life between music and addiction in an interview: "The worst thing that has happened to me in my life is the drugs - the best thing was to land a number 1 hit."
Towards the end of the decade, Green scored a surprise hit in 1979 with an album inspired by religious themes.
Meanwhile, Fleetwood Mac swam without him in a new formation on a wave of success.
Their 1977 album "Rumours" sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Despite various small solo successes, Green did not make a major comeback until he started again in 1996 with a group of musician friends.
At the time, the British "Daily Telegraph" spoke of a rock star returning to earth.
Free of drugs, Green released several albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group until the band broke up in 2004.
For music experts, he was already a blues legend during his lifetime - and with his gentle sound one of the most influential guitarists of the past decades.
