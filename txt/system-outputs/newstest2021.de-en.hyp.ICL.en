Biker reacts at lightning speed and prevents worse
On Friday evening, a traffic accident occurred on the country road between Machtolsheim and Merklingen, in which a motorcyclist was only slightly injured thanks to his quick reaction.
Driver overlooks bikers
A 44-year-old female driver wanted to turn left at around 9.30 p.m. with her VW coming from Merklingen onto Landesstraße 1230 in the direction of Machtolsheim.
Here she overlooked the 24-year-old motorcyclist with right of way coming from the direction of Nellingen.
Hand and foot brake levers fly away in the event of a collision
The biker still tried to avoid the car, but still touched it at the rear of the vehicle.
Due to the grazing process, the hand and foot brake levers on the Suzuki were torn off and the driver was no longer able to brake.
Mindfully, he steered his motorcycle in the green stiffeners next to the road and let it roll out there without falling.
Biker suffers leg injury
Due to the collision with the car, the biker nevertheless suffered an injury to the Beim and had to be treated in a clinic.
Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 harvest workers infected
Following a mass corona infection on a large vegetable farm in Mamming, Lower Bavaria, almost 500 people are under quarantine and are no longer allowed to leave the business.
A security service monitors the ban on going out.
A total of 174 harvest workers were tested positive for the corona pathogen Sars-CoV-2 during the screening, as the Dingolfing-Landau District Office announced on Saturday evening.
" In order to avoid further spread, we unfortunately have to take this step to protect the population, " explained District Administrator Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Previously, seven employees in the company had already been infected - this was the reason for the series test.
The farm is a large vegetable farm that grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and beetroot - but the cucumbers are only for jars.
Mamming is a rural community with a population of around 3,300, not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW plant.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to keep calm: " According to our information, this is a closed circle of people. "
On the farm, infected employees were separated from non-infected employees, and the site is now surrounded by a fence.
The Greens and the SPD gave joint responsibility to the state government.
The two opposition parties accused Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet of neglecting control over the accommodation of seasonal workers.
" This can take bitter revenge if such local infections take hold and regional lockdowns have to be ordered, " said Jürgen Mistol, the parliamentary executive director of the Greens.
The SPD takes a similar view: " Following the outbreak of corona in the Wiesenhof slaughterhouse in mid-May, we have already called for a special control programme for farms with harvest workers, " said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
" In our view, hygiene conditions in the workplace and living conditions in particular must be rigorously monitored.
Obviously that didn't happen. "
The outbreak came " with an announcement. "
Underground station Aidenbachstraße: Dangerous quarrel: 19-year-old falls into the track bed after Schubser
During an argument between two youth groups at the Aidenbachstraße underground station, a 19-year-old fell through a pusher and slipped into the track bed.
Obersendling - On Friday, around 4: 15 p.m., a quarrel broke out between two youth groups at the Aidenbachstraße underground station.
A passer-by alerted the police, who arrived with several patrols.
According to initial investigations, a resident of Munich (17) pushed a 19-year-old to the ground.
The young man slid over the edge of the platform and fell into the track bed.
People from the group of the 17-year-old helped the fallen man to climb off the track.
There was no danger of an approaching train.
According to the police, clashes broke out again between the two people.
The 17-year-old initially fled the scene, but his identity could be determined afterwards.
Accompanied by his father, he went to police station 29.
The 17-year-old is under investigation for bodily injury.
Report: Seehofer urges longer data retention
Data retention is currently suspended.
However, according to a media report, the Federal Minister of the Interior, Horst Seehofer, is calling for an extension of the storage period.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
According to a media report, the Federal Minister of the Interior, Horst Seehofer (CSU), is calling for data retention to be extended - for six months instead of the planned ten weeks.
As reported by " Bild am Sonntag, " Seehofer sent a letter to Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht (SPD) asking for a swift amendment to the law.
Seehofer wants to strengthen the measures against child abuse.
He believes it makes sense " to make urgently needed adjustments to the law now, " the newspaper quoted from the letter.
Data retention is currently suspended.
A decision by the European Court of Justice is expected.
Seehofer, however, wants the changes in advance so that they can be applied immediately following a possible positive judgement, the report continues.
A spokesperson for the Ministry of Justice told the newspaper that it would only make sense to examine whether legal adjustments were needed once the courts had decided.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer, together with the interior ministers of the federal states, had already spoken out in favour of data retention in June.
NBA: Stripclub-Ärger für Clippers-Star Lou Williams
Excitement in the NBA!
Lou Williams (33), professional basketball player for the Los Angeles Clippers, is said to have left the tournament quarters in Disney World in Orlando, Florida, with permission for a funeral.
According to US media reports, he visited the strip club " Magic City " in Atlanta in the evening.
Williams, who according to ESPN admitted the visit, is back in isolation, tested daily for COVID-19.
His reason for the visit: Chicken Wings.
In February last year, " Sweet Lou, " as he is known in the NBA, expressed his love for precisely these wings.
The American wrote: " Magic City and Blue Flame (another strip club in Atlanta) have the best wings in town. "
NBA insider Shams Charania announced on Twitter on Sunday that the NBA Williams has ordered a ten-day quarantine.
As a result, the Clippers star will miss the first two official games after the friendly phase.
In Disney World, the NBA wants to bring the corona season to an end.
The top 22 teams are currently playing training matches to prepare for the season finale, which begins on Friday night.
Söder comments on corona situation after mass infection
Munich - Health Minister Melanie Huml (CSU) announced a test campaign for large farms on Sunday.
The press conference will be shown live on our homepage.
The case in Mamming in the district of Dingolfing-Landau has alarmed authorities and politicians.
Almost 500 harvest workers from several countries are currently working on the large vegetable farm, and more than a third have been infected with the corona pathogen.
The farm is now under quarantine and is cordoned off with a construction fence.
No one is allowed to leave the premises, food is delivered.
The authorities are now offering the 3,300 residents of the community free corona tests.
Since the harvest workers had little contact with the local population, the district administration has so far assumed that the infections have not spread beyond the farm.
" Pangs of conscience ": Confession of the alleged arsonist of Nantes
" My client has shown himself to be cooperative, " lawyer Quentin Chabert told the newspaper.
The defence lawyer added: " He deeply regrets the actions, the confession was a release for him. "
His mandate is " plagued by pangs of conscience and deeply affected by the extent of the destruction. "
According to the public prosecutor's office, if convicted, the man faces ten years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros.
The Gothic St. Peter and Paul's Cathedral in Nantes was severely damaged in a fire on Saturday night last week.
The fire broke out in three distant places in the church.
Laboratory tests confirmed the suspicion of arson.
The suspect, who has now been detained, was arrested just a few hours after the fire.
However, he was released one day later.
The man works as a volunteer for the diocese of Nantes and was responsible for closing the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
Since there was no trace of a violent intrusion into the church, he quickly became the focus of the investigators' attention.
Discuss the abolition of the 50 + 1 rule
Former DFB President Reinhard Grindel has recommended that consideration be given to abolishing the 50 + 1 rule.
" German football should at least discuss laying down conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates a fait accompli, " Grindel told " Bild am Sonntag. "
He stressed: " For the clubs that are most likely to pose a threat to Bayern and Dortmund, the 50 + 1 rules don't work anyway: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, there is no getting around the debate as to whether it is not appropriate to make it easier for clubs that want to break into this phalanx to involve investors. "
However, he has doubts as to whether there is a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority participation, which is prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50 + 1 rule.
" It remains a legal risk to erect investment fences around the Bundesliga as a business location in a European internal market, " said Grindel.
The former DFB boss sees the danger that " the attempts to create a more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will ultimately only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs on a European level, but will not lead to more tension in the championship. "
Even an equal distribution of TV money will not have a decisive effect.
" FC Bayern have a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million.
The differences between the first three clubs alone are immense.
The other 15 clubs have an average budget of 130 million, " explained the 58-year-old.
Looking back at the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
" Unfortunately, there were people who noticed this mistake and leaked it to the press instead of talking to me about it, " said Grindel about the acceptance of an expensive watch, which led to his resignation in April 2019.
" On a human level, that has kept me very busy. "
He had received the gift worth around 11,000 euros from a Ukrainian official.
" I have committed a breach of compliance, and it was right to draw the consequences from this, " said Grindel.
" I handled the ominous watch gift in a completely transparent and unsuspecting manner.
Many in the DFB knew about it. "
He had never " made a secret of the gift, " the 58-year-old assured.
" You might call it naive, but this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption. "
" Black Lives Matter ": injured and one dead
Protests against police violence in the United States have come to a head again as a result of Donald Trump's deployment of federal police in several cities.
On Saturday clashes broke out between demonstrators and police officers in various cities.
Three people were injured in Louisville, and 16 people were arrested in Seattle.
In Austin, a person was shot and killed while a march was crossing an intersection.
Prior to this, clashes broke out again in Portland during protests against racism and police violence.
The security forces, including officers from the Federal Police, used tear gas on Saturday night and violently dispersed demonstrators.
Hundreds of demonstrators, some of them armed, marched through Louisville in Kentucky on Saturday, demanding that those responsible for the death of Breonna Taylor be held accountable.
The 26-year-old student was shot dead in March during a drug raid in her apartment in Louisville.
The target of the raid was someone else who did not live there, and no drugs were found.
When a member of a group that describes itself as an armed alliance of black Americans fired a shot on Saturday, three people were injured.
According to NBC, they were taken to hospital.
None of them was in mortal danger.
The police set up barricades because counter-demonstrators from a white militia had also formed.
In the end, the two groups did not come together.
In Austin, Texas, a person was shot and killed in the course of a " Black Lives Matter " demonstration.
According to their own statements, the police took a suspect into custody.
She has not yet provided any further details on the circumstances of the crime.
According to the " New York Times, " Mayor Steve Adler said that he, like many in the city, was " inconsolable and stunned " by what had happened.
Demonstrators also clashed with the police in the American metropolis of Seattle on Saturday.
They set fire to construction vehicles in front of a youth prison, and the police used stun grenades and pepper spray.
According to the " Seattle Times, " 16 people were arrested for resisting police officers or for bodily harm.
In the city of Oakland, California, a courthouse was set on fire.
A small group of demonstrators smashed windows, fired fireworks and blinded police officers with lasers, Oakland police announced late on Saturday evening (local time).
The fire was quickly extinguished.
In Aurora, a suburb of Denver in Colorado, a car drove through a crowd demonstrating on a highway.
According to the police, one of the demonstrators fired a weapon and at least one person was injured and taken to hospital.
In addition, windows were smashed in a court and a fire was set, according to the police.
Investigations have begun.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historical costumes defy Corona
Although there was no big party in the spa town, visitors and performers enjoyed the Rakoczy flair of the alternative programme.
It was unusual for visitors, performers and organisers: the Rakoczy weekend without the Rakoczy festival.
But: Even if the big party mile in the city center was missing, the crowds and program highlights such as Saale brennt, Rakoczy Ball or pageant, many got their money's worth with the Corona-compliant alternative program.
" I think we have succeeded in spreading Rakoczy flair, " says Kurdirektor Sylvie Thormann.
The guests had accepted it well.
In principle, they return to the beginnings of the Rakoczy festival, when the focus of the festival was solely on history.
Pleasant atmosphere
Vesna Konhäuser and her husband have been visiting Bad Kissingen for the Rakoczy Festival for more than 25 years.
This is also the case in the corona year.
The couple have made themselves comfortable at the Luitpold Casino, are watching history buffs stroll around, and are listening to live Cuban music at the casino restaurant.
" I also find it quite pleasant, " says Konhäuser.
She does not miss the crowds that otherwise belong to Rakoczy.
However, it lacks the usual programme highlights, above all Saale brennt on Friday evening as well as the historic pageant and the final fireworks display on Sunday evening.
" That's a shame.
The weather would have been perfect this year, " she says.
Rakoczy Equestrian Tournament to be held again
For the performers of the historic spa guests, the alternative programme sometimes meant more work.
For example, for Christina Gold, who takes part in the procession in a normal year and can be seen there in the carriage of the Kurgartencafé.
This year she walked around the city in costume on Saturdays and Sundays.
" That's more strenuous, otherwise we'll have it easier, " she says.
The equestrian club had less to do, even if individual riders were out and about in the park.
" We very much hope that the equestrian quadrille can take place again next year, " says the chairwoman, Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that after a break of several years, another Rakoczy equestrian tournament will take place in 2021.
28 corona cases at Spanish second division side Fuenlabrada
The Spanish second division football team CF Fuenlabrada is sliding deeper and deeper into crisis due to a corona outbreak.
Since the newcomer from near Madrid flew to a game in the city of A Coruña on 20 July, despite the first corona cases, one low blow has followed the next.
By Sunday, 28 players or team members had tested positive, and one was hospitalized, the club reported.
Fuenlabrada from the city of the same name, south-west of Madrid, still had the chance to reach the promotion playoffs.
Now there is even the threat of relegation to the B-group of the second league.
The match against Deportivo La Coruña last Monday was cancelled at the last minute, the public prosecutor's office is investigating a possible crime against public health, and the CSD, the highest sports authority, is considering the club's forced relegation.
Players and other team members are in quarantine in a hotel.
" They had not received a fresh towel or gel until the sixth day of the quarantine, " wrote the sports newspaper " AS. "
Photos show how players hung up underwear and club clothes to dry in their hotel rooms after they apparently had to wash them themselves.
Nor had the bed linen been changed for five days.
Another problem is the food.
It was neither good nor sufficient, wrote " AS. "
The club management, on the other hand, said that they were satisfied with the hotel.
The accusation of deliberately endangering public health was rejected by the club's lawyer, Javier Tebas Llanas.
The son of the President of the Spanish Primera Division, Javier Tebas, stressed that the corona rules established by the football association had not been violated, as reported by the news agency Europa Press and the sports newspaper " Marca. "
Before departure, there had been four people infected by 19 July, but they had all been isolated and had not travelled with them.
Directly before the flight to A Coruña on Monday, all players and team members were tested again.
When the team was already in A Coruña, the corona test was positive for " five or six " other team members.
The match was cancelled 60 minutes before kick-off, Tebas Llanas said.
Police must capture horses torn off at Dampfach
Two animals were on the road.
The police took her back to her owner.
Shortly before 6 a.m. on Sunday morning, a road user notified two free-range horses on the slip road between the Donnersdorf / Steinsfeld junction and the Theres motorway junction.
When the officers arrived, the horses were already back between the feeder road and the village of Dampfach.
Shortly before Dampfach, the officers were able to win the horses' trust, and they each had a rope carried in the patrol car put over them.
Professional cyclist Tony Martin: Career continuation conceivable
Time trial specialist Tony Martin is considering a continuation of his career.
Frankfurt / Main - Seven-time time time trial world champion Tony Martin can well imagine continuing his cycling career.
" I am currently working with the team to define the framework conditions for how and in what form things could continue, " the 35-year-old told the " Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung. "
Martin is currently employed by the Dutch team Jumbo-Visma and had considered ending his career after this year before the corona break.
Negotiations with his team are also about the number of race days, he said.
Or other problems that would plague him as a father, said Martin.
He used to get up after a fall, and his first thought was: " Get back on your bike quickly.
Today, as the father of a young daughter, I think: what if. "
The professional cyclist admitted that there are certainly aspects with which he is finding it increasingly difficult.
" But it was good for me to see from the Corona period what I like about cycling and how much I enjoy it. "
The time trial specialist will once again be competing in the Tour de l'Ain (5 to 9 August).
Bavaria: At least four dead on the streets of Bavaria at the weekend
The beautiful weather attracts bikers to the streets in many places.
For at least three people, the motorcycle tour ends fatally.
An 18-year-old pedestrian also dies.
Schönthal - Several people, mostly young people, died in accidents on Bavaria's roads over the weekend.
An 18-year-old motorcyclist was hit by a car on the opposite lane near Schönthal (district of Cham) on Saturday.
It was initially unclear why the car got into the opposite lane.
On Saturday, a 22-year-old collided with a horse-drawn carriage on his machine in Upper Bavaria.
According to the police, he was heading downhill near Beilngries.
He crashed into the carriage in a left-hand bend.
His injuries were so severe that he died at the scene of the accident.
Of the twelve passengers in the carriage, one man was seriously injured and one man was slightly injured, according to the police.
An 18-year-old died in another fatal accident in Bad Kötzting, Upper Palatinate.
He lay down on a street on Sunday night and was overrun by a 42-year-old car driver.
The police suspect that the 18-year-old wanted to sleep.
The driver was no longer able to brake in time.
Near Schönberg (district of Freyung-Grafenau) on Saturday, a 57-year-old biker collided head-on with a car in a right-hand bend despite emergency braking.
He died at the scene of the accident.
The 57-year-old driver suffered a shock, leaving the other three people in the car uninjured.
The safety of motorcyclists was discussed on Saturday by Bavaria's Minister of Transport, Kerstin Schreyer (CSU).
In a letter to the organiser of the biker protests against driving bans announced for August, Gabor Kovacs, the Minister referred to extensive investments such as underride protection on crash barriers and the defusing of dangerous bends.
" We have achieved a great deal for the safety of motorcyclists in recent years, " the letter said.
" The number of motorised two-wheelers killed fell by around 28 percent compared to 2011. "
Kovac tests with Monaco against Frankfurt
Frankfurt / Main (dpa) - Football coach Niko Kovac and his new club AS Monaco will soon be reunited with Eintracht Frankfurt.
The eight-time French champion will make a guest appearance on 1 August (6 p.m.) with the Hessians, the former club of the Croatian.
For the Bundesliga, it is the first and only endurance test before the second leg in the Europa League against FC Basel (6 August).
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the match will be played without spectators.
" We are particularly looking forward to this game.
It's always nice to come to Frankfurt and meet friends, " explained Kovac.
In terms of sport, this is an interesting test, said the 48-year-old.
Before moving to FC Bayern Munich, Kovac had coached the Hessians from 2016 to 2018 and led them to victory in the DFB Cup.
" A top-class opponent like Monaco is a good test for us with regard to the match against Basel.
Like everyone in Frankfurt, I am looking forward to seeing Niko Kovac again, " said Eintracht Frankfurt coach Adi Hütter.
The 50-year-old Austrian had succeeded the Croatian at Eintracht Frankfurt.
In March, the Frankfurt team lost 3-0 to Basel in their own stadium in the first leg of the round of 16.
Almost 50 new infections: Hof district narrowly misses lockdown
In the district of Hof, the number of known new corona infections increased further over the weekend: from 39 on Friday and 43 on Saturday (one person has recovered and is no longer included in these statistics) to 47 on Sunday.
In addition, there is a case in the town of Hof.
The Hof area is thus approaching the critical threshold of 50 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants per week.
700 dead due to monsoon rains in Southeast Asia
More than 9 million people have been affected by the severe floods in Southeast Asia, primarily in Bangladesh, India and Nepal.
A total of 700 people lost their lives due to the heavy monsoon rain.
In Bangladesh, the Red Crescent is trying to reach isolated people in boats.
Entire villages are under water.
The farmers have lost their crops.
Armored rhinoceroses in National Park die from landslides
In Kaziranga National Park, several of the 120 rhinoceroses were killed by landslides.
They are under protection and are considered to be at risk of extinction.
This year, the floods are particularly severe, which scientists attribute to climate change.
According to the United Nations, Bangladesh is one of the countries most affected by global warming.
New apartments are empty
In the village of Cox's Bazar in the south of Bangladesh, the state has built homes for 650 people displaced by the floods.
So far, only a few have moved in.
It is difficult to bring people to Cox's Bazar.
Enthusiasm also persists in Grenezn.
Anyone who used to have a house, no matter how small it was and resembled a hut, often does not want to spend their lives in a large apartment block.
Many homes are empty, but - as the government wants it - they will soon be occupied by those who have lost their homes as a result of the floods.

Argentina rejects creditors' counter-offer
The new demands could not be met, the Ministry of Economy in Buenos Aires announced on Saturday.
" That would not only be irresponsible, but also unfair, " it said in a statement.
" While 50 percent of children in Argentina live in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors. "
The debts of the second largest economy in South America are no longer sustainable under current conditions.
For this reason, Argentina is demanding that its private creditors waive part of their claims of around 66 billion US dollars (around 59 billion euros).
If no agreement is reached, the country is once again threatened with bankruptcy.
It would be the ninth default in Argentina's history.
Lenders recently called for higher interest rates on government bonds and changes to some contractual clauses.
However, the Argentine government is sticking to its latest offer and is not prepared to make any further concessions.
Argentina is in the midst of a severe financial and economic crisis.
The inflation rate recently stood at more than 50 percent.
For the current year, experts predict a decline in economic power of around ten percent.
At the end of May, Argentina had not settled interest claims amounting to 503 million US dollars and had thus slipped into a limited default.
Professionally arrived - privately not yet
" It's going really well " - this is the conclusion drawn by Dr Stefanie Kramer after her first days in the notary's office in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything went very quickly: in mid-May, Dr Stefanie Kramer learned that she was going to succeed Lutz Feller in the notarial office in Eggenfelden.
Just six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the doctor of law began work, and normal day-to-day business has long been in full swing.
" However, I still have to arrive privately, " she explains in an interview with the Rottaler Anzeiger and laughs.
Of course, the short lead time was not enough to completely relocate the centre of life from Regensburg to Eggenfelden, reports the Dingolfing native.
Together with her husband, who works as a judge at the Regional Court in Regensburg, she is currently looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city.
At least her husband was able to apply for parental leave at short notice in order to be able to take care of their two daughters (3 ½ and 1 ½ years old).
In order not to have to commute from Regensburg every day, the 39-year-old explains that for the time being she also has accommodation with her parents in Dingolfing.
Having grown up in the neighbouring district, she has of course long been familiar with the town of Eggenfelden.
During on-site visits with her family over the past few months, she has once again discovered that " Eggenfelden is a really beautiful small town. "
She was all the more pleased that she had won the race in the selection process for the vacant position.
Her native Lower Bavaria also plays a central role in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's professional career: After studying law in Passau, she completed her legal traineeship and the second state examination in Regensburg.
After several positions as a notary assessor, including in Rehau and Hof in Upper Franconia, Babenhausen in the Unterallgäu and Regensburg - during which time she also " incidentally " shouldered her doctorate in employment law - she took up her first position as a notary in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau in 2012.
In 2016 she took parental leave, which was followed by a move to Regensburg.
Since then she has taken over representation services in various notarial offices.
When the position in Eggenfelden was advertised due to the approaching retirement of Lutz Feller, the 39-year-old explained that the time had come for her full return to work.
The team of her predecessor, who will take over the holiday replacement in the notarial office in the future, has completely taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer - and immediately has praise for the firm's team: " It's going really well! "
The fact that she can rely on well-coordinated processes here makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming relocation of her private centre of life.
In terms of nursery and nursery places, she has already made contact with a local institution.
And if everything goes as planned, she hopes to be able to pursue her hobby here soon - and get to know the most beautiful jogging routes in the Rottal.
BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be 20 percent full at the start of the season if fans return.
" Due to the distance regulation, which must be adhered to, we are currently planning with 12,000 to 15,000 spectators, " said Borussia Dortmund's managing director Carsten Cramer to the " Tagesspiegel. "
Normally, the arena in the district town holds slightly more than 81,000 spectators for Bundesliga matches.
In the ghost games last season caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BVB lost around four million euros per game.
Cramer, who is responsible for marketing, digitalisation and internationalisation at BVB, hopes that in addition to the normal spectator seats, some of the approximately 4000 seats in the hospitality sector can also be opened again: " It is of course a blow to the office if these revenues are completely lost. "
In view of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, everyone is currently " well advised to take a stable page first. "
" If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people in Germany alone are on short-time work, then the need for entertainment is limited, " explained Cramer.
The head of marketing in Dortmund praised the BVB pros for their partial salary waiver, which is intended to help overcome the crisis: " Of course, the players know that their salary waiver has a different effect than if we put 100 people working in merchandising on short-time work. "
Tiny miracles: an early start to life with a few hundred grams
Hardly heavier than a packet of butter, just three tablespoons of blood in his entire body: that was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The boy is one of around 400 premature babies who are cared for at the children's hospital in Graz every year.
A quarter of them weigh less than 1,500 grams, and a few - such as Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael - are extremely light weights weighing less than one kilogram.
They are so small and so early born that neither lungs, nor intestines, nor muscles are fully developed.
Their skin is sometimes so soft that they could injure the electrodes of an ECG.
And they are so tiny that they sometimes wear doll clothes and mini diapers made especially for them.
But not so small that they don't have a voice - " and how, " smiles Berndt Urlesberger.
" Even if, of course, they don't scream quite as loudly as large babies. "
When the whiteboard becomes a stage
Despite Corona Theater in the classroom: Shortly before the start of the holidays, the 9th grade of the Sankt-Jakobus-Gymnasium in Abtsgmünd experienced the whiteboard as a stage.
Actress Julia Sylvester from the Theater der Stadt Aalen presented the pupils with the production " Das Heimatkleid " - via video.
Afterwards, the pupils were able to discuss the play and the performance with actress and director Winfried Tobias via Skype.
The idea for the performance format was born from the current corona situation.
Teacher Teresa Nar was delighted with the enrichment of the lessons.
Even if all those involved agreed in the end that the direct encounter in the theatre and the stage would offer additional stimuli, the potential for contact with the schools can also be seen in the theatre.
" If we continue to improve the technical framework, it could be an interesting addition to the programme, " emphasised director Winfried Tobias.
First round drawn: TSV 1860 would face Eintracht Frankfurt in the DFB Cup
Should TSV 1860 qualify for the DFB Cup, the Lions will face Eintracht Frankfurt in the first round.
This was the result of the draw on Sunday.
Munich - Sixty possible opponents in the first round of the DFB Cup have been determined.
The Lions would face Eintracht Frankfurt if they qualified successfully.
This was the result of the draw on Sunday evening in the ARD sports show.
Because the field of participants is not yet complete due to the COVID-19 pandemic, placeholders were used in the draw.
Due to the voluntary waiver of semi-final opponent FC Memmingen, TSV 1860 is already in the final of the Bavarian Toto Cup (4 or 5 September).
There the Lions will face either Würzburger Kickers or Viktoria Aschaffenburg.
Should second division climber Würzburg reach the final, Sixty would already be firmly qualified for the first round of the DFB Cup.
Otherwise, the team from Giesingen would have to beat Regional League side Aschaffenburg in the final.
The first round of the DFB Cup will take place between 11 and 14 September, one week before the third-league start.
" Gone with the wind ": film legend Olivia de Havilland is dead
Film legend and Oscar winner Olivia de Havilland is dead.
She died of natural causes in Paris on Sunday at the age of 104, confirmed her spokeswoman for the German Press Agency.
De Havilland was known for her role as Melanie Hamilton in the Southern epic " Gone with the Wind " (1939).
Born in Tokyo to British parents, Olivia de Havilland moved to California as an infant.
The Austrian theater man Max Reinhardt discovered the 19-year-old in the role of Hermia in Shakespeare's " Midsummer Night's Dream. "
The Warner Brothers film studio signed her for seven years and brought her to prominence alongside Eroll Flynn.
She made eight films with the heartbreaker.
In 1946 she won her first Oscar in the leading role of " To Each His Own. "
The film was shown in Germany under the title " Mutterherz. "
Three years later she received the award for best actress in William Wyler's " The Heiress. "
She also received a lot of recognition as a neurotic eccentric in " Der dunkle Spiegel " and " Die Schlangengrube. "
Daphne du Maurier suggested her in 1952 for the leading role in the film adaptation of her novel " My Cousin Rachel. "
The play was a worldwide success.
She played in " Lullaby for a Corpse " with her long-time friend Bette Davis.
His marriage to the writer Marcus Goodrich (1946 to 1953) produced his son Benjamin.
In Paris, de Havilland married the journalist Pierre Paul Galante and had his daughter Gisèle with him.
This marriage also broke up.
Rumors of an affair with former British Prime Minister Edward Heath have never been confirmed.
" Road to Timmendorf ": Beach volleyball: Thole / Wickler miss final on comeback
World Championship runners-up Julius Thole and Clemens Wickler missed the final of the beach volleyball tournament " Road to Timmendorf. "
At the meeting of the top teams in Dusseldorf they lost in the semi-final to their national team colleagues Nils Ehlers and Lars Flüggen with 1: 2 (17: 21, 21: 17, 19: 21).
Most recently, Thole / Wickler played at the World Tour Final in Rome in September of last year.
In the final on the Rhine, their conquerors Ehlers / Flüggen suffered a defeat 0: 2 (17: 21, 17: 21) against the surprise team Lukas Pfretschner and his interim partner Steven van de Velde.
In addition to the show tournament, three starting places for the German Championships were played out in Timmendorfer Strand at the beginning of September: Tickets were secured by Armin Dollinger / Simon Kulzer, Manuel Harms / Richard Peemüller and Simon Pfretschner / Milan Sievers.
Kalbitz's expulsion from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of " Feigenblatt "
From the point of view of the FDP, the expulsion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is just a " fig leaf " and does not change the character of the party.
" The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the far right in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the tip of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD, " FDP politician Benjamin Strasser told the dpa news agency in Berlin.
On Saturday in Stuttgart, after several hours of hearings, the Federal Arbitration Court of the AfD confirmed the expulsion of Kalbitz, which was decided by a majority of the Federal Executive Board in May.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD faction in the Brandenburg state parliament.
" If the AfD really wanted to consistently remove right-wing extremists from their party, functionaries such as Björn Höcke and his supporters would have been excluded long ago, " said Strasser.
" However, there is no political will in the AfD to do so, because right-wing extremism is now part of the party. "
CSU General Secretary Markus Blume expressed a similar view: " The fact that Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded says nothing and does not change anything, " he told " Welt am Sonntag. "
" It speaks volumes how many frenetic supporters a right-wing extremist in the midst of the AfD still has. "
Blume assumes that the AfD will again end up under five percent in future elections.
" The AfD's days in parliament are numbered. "
Kalbitz was one of the spokesmen of the now officially dissolved " wing " around the Thuringian AfD regional and parliamentary party chairman Björn Höcke; the Office for the Protection of the Constitution classifies the tone as a " certain right-wing extremist endeavor. "
In May, the AfD national executive threw Kalbitz out of the party.
The reason he gave was that when he joined the party, Kalbitz did not state that he had previously been a member of the now banned far-right " Heimattreue Deutsche Jugend " (HDJ) or of the Republicans.
Kalbitz denies membership in the HDJ.
The chairman of the left-wing parliamentary group in the Brandenburg state parliament, Sebastian Walter, also stressed that the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court did not change the character of the AfD: " The wolf has only eaten chalk.
The AfD remains a far-right party, with or without Kalbitz. "
This decision would neither weaken the federal party nor the right wing.
" The manoeuvre of the Meuthen troops is transparent.
They want to avoid further observation by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution and try to get through under the radar, " said Walter.
" The AfD cannot rid itself of the ghosts it has invoked.
Being kicked out won't change anything, " commented Brandenburg SPD General Secretary Erik Stohn on the decision in the Kalbitz case.
" Here, the AfD regional association and the parliamentary group have remained their right-wing leader to this day. "
The legal battle over Kalbitz's membership in the AfD will continue.
The latter announced on Saturday that he would now take civil action against the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court.
North Sea wind farms provide a good 21 percent more electricity
The wind power plants on the German North Sea fed 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity into the grid in the first six months of the year.
This is a good 21 percent more than in the same period last year, according to network operator Tennet in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of North Sea electricity to the mainland and its transmission through the German electricity grid.
The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of Tennet's grid area, have fed in a further 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
Overall, wind power from the North and Baltic Seas thus comes to 13.73 TWh, compared to a good 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind harvest at sea thus accounts for almost 19 percent of total wind power in Germany; that is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms ensure higher generation capacities
In addition to wind conditions, the increased contribution of offshore wind energy results from higher generation capacities because new wind farms have been connected to the grid over the past twelve months.
If the 1270 wind power plants in the North Sea were all running at full power at the same time, they could mathematically generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient for this, amounting to 7.1 gigawatts, according to Tennet.
It is expected to increase to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea by 2030.
" In Germany and the Netherlands, we will invest 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore grid connections by then, " said Tennet Managing Director Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, even at sea, wind farms cannot make full use of their capacity, reaching around 40 percent.
The previous record day this year is 2 January, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind turbines produce around 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, which corresponds to three to four nuclear power plants.
This would enable almost seven million households to be supplied with electricity.
Art " Skirmish " - an exhibition by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the Gmünder Kunstverein.
It was almost a small celebration of the 130th anniversary.
Birthday of the Gmünder Kunstverein: The exhibition opening " Skirmish " with works by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold went beyond the usual framework after the corona break.
Many more art lovers than usual followed the dialogue between the artist and the chairman of the Kunstverein, Professor Dr. Klaus Ripper.
The musical equivalent was provided by the band " Defenders of the Universe " on southern Kornhausplatz.
North of the gallery, the " Sandtogether " association was involved.
Freital: Windbergfest cancelled due to corona
The Windberg Festival will not take place this year.
The town of Freital has cancelled the three-day festival planned for September.
In other years, more than 30,000 people attended this city festival.
" We really did not make this decision easy for ourselves and - aware of how difficult it is economically for those involved - hoped until the last minute, " explained Mayor Uwe Rumberg (non-partisan).
" But ultimately, as organisers, we are responsible for the health of many thousands of people. "
If tens of thousands had flocked to the festival grounds and the marquee, it would not have been possible to comply with minimum distances, hygiene regulations and contact tracking in accordance with the current corona protection regulation.
Or the restrictions would have been so severe that not much would have been left of a folk festival.
In addition, the organisational and monitoring effort would increase disproportionately many times over.
Rumberg looked forward to next year.
The town of Freital will then be celebrating its 100th anniversary with the Winterberg Festival from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the Day of the Saxons from 10 to 12 September 2021, among other events.
Olympic Dressage Champion Werth unbeatable in Achleiten
Achleiten - Six-time Olympic champion Isabell Werth was the outstanding rider at the dressage tournament in Achleiten, Austria.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg scored four victories in four starts at the weekend.
After winning a Grand Prix at the start with Weihegold and Quantaz, she was also unbeatable in the Grand Prix Special and the Freestyle on Sunday.
On the 15-year-old mare Weihegold, Werth clearly prevailed in the Special on Sunday against the Austrian Victoria Max-Theurer on Abegglen.
The German was also clearly ahead of her 34-year-old pupil Victoria Max-Theurer in the freestyle on Quantaz on Saturday.
Werth's winning horse, Quantaz, belongs to Max-Theurer.
The most successful dressage rider in the world is to establish the ten-year-old stallion in the Grand Prix.
For Quantaz it was the first freestyle ever.
Werth had already won all four important tests at the first tournament in Achleiten three weeks ago.
The last of the three international tournaments is scheduled to take place there from 14 to 16 August.
More air traffic controllers in Worms in the future
Worms University continues to take to the skies: " DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung " endows a professorship for " Air Traffic Management. "
A corresponding contract between the university and DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially concluded for three years and will start in 2021.
The professorship makes it possible to start your studies not only in the summer semester, but also in the winter semester.
This means that twice as many students can be trained as before.
At the same time, capacities at both the university and the DFS Air Navigation Academy are being used to their full potential.
DFS will advise the university on the establishment and appointment of the professorship.
Represented at the university since 2019
Since the summer semester of 2019, the first students have been enrolled in the Air Traffic Management degree programme as part of their training as air traffic controllers at Worms University of Applied Sciences.
Nine students have already started this year.
So far, the experience of DFS has been very positive, and the achievements of the students are outstanding.
The combination of studies and pilot training makes a significant contribution to further increasing the attractiveness of the pilot profession.
" In these times, funding is not easy for us economically.
However, we firmly expect air traffic to recover and grow again in the long term.
In order to be able to fulfil our legal mandate in the future, we need highly qualified personnel, " said Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, Chairman and CEO of DFS, at the signing ceremony.
" For DFS, the endowed professorship is a future-proof investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, interdisciplinary knowledge base in the long term.
We are therefore continuing the good cooperation with the university and at the same time underpinning our attractiveness as an employer. "
This is also underlined by Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of Worms University of Applied Sciences: " The endowed professorship forms an important bridge between science and industry.
With it, we would like to build on the existing cooperation with DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual bachelor's programme in Air Traffic Management. "
The trust of German air traffic control is both a motivation and an obligation for Worms University of Applied Sciences to further expand its teaching and research expertise in the future-oriented fields of aviation.
Working for the air traffic controllers of tomorrow, the university can set very special highlights and innovative priorities for its students with the first endowed professorship for a dual course of study.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary in the Ministry of Science, Continuing Education and Culture, emphasises: " With its focus on aviation, Worms University of Applied Sciences has a unique selling point in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Today's signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the university's profile. "
Rescue screwdriver lands on the A45
The A45 motorway in the direction of Aschaffenburg was completely closed for around 30 minutes on Saturday afternoon, as the rescue helicopter was deployed following a traffic accident.
A 76-year-old drove a Ford straight ahead in the bend at the Alzenau-Mitte exit at around 12.40 and landed on the guardrail.
The impact triggered the front airbags, causing the driver to suffer minor facial injuries and having to be taken to a hospital for treatment.
The injuries to the 72-year-old co-driver were treated by an emergency doctor and the patient was then flown to a hospital by rescue helicopter.
At present, however, the police assume that there is no danger to life.
The damaged vehicle, which suffered damage of around 2,000 euros, had to be towed away.
Heil wants to examine other sectors after the meat industry
The COVID-19 crisis brought the situation in parts of the meat industry to light once again.
Tightening of laws is imminent.
But are they right - and will they remain so?
Following the now planned strict regulations against abuses in the meat industry, Federal Minister of Labour Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to examine other sectors as well.
" We will look at industry by industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective industry if necessary, " Heil told the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany's employers are already warning against restricting work contracts in general.
Following the mass outbreak of corona at meat giant Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet wants to pass a law by Heil this Wednesday.
Large-scale slaughterhouses should no longer be allowed to employ external personnel for slaughter, cutting and meat processing.
To this end, the use of contract and temporary workers is to be banned there.
Employer President Ingo Kramer told dpa: " Stay away from a general restriction on work contracts and temporary employment if you do not want to strangle the economy completely. "
Contracts for work and services are, for example, the essential basis for creating added value for customers in a wide range of trades, the construction industry and plant engineering.
" The mistakes of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument. "
Heil assured: " My aim is not to ban contracts for work and services everywhere in the German economy. "
Contracts for work and services make sense.
" If an industrial company commissions a tradesman to install a security system, this is a completely normal work contract. "
The German meat industry considers a ban on work contracts and temporary agency work to be unconstitutional in its sector alone.
According to a statement on the proposed law, the " Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung " (Saturday) reports that it is not possible to explain why different labour laws should apply to the portioning and packaging of cheese in the future than to sausages.
In the event of a ban, the consumer price would rise by 10 to 20 percent per kilo and product.
According to the results of an audit by the North Rhine-Westphalia Occupational Safety and Health Administration, many Eastern European employees from contractors worked in the sector, sometimes 16 hours a day.
They often had no rest.
Wages were withheld for protective equipment or rent.
It was also noted that the situation regarding the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Heil said that a relatively strict law for the meat industry had already come into force in 2017.
However, these have been circumvented by " tricky constructions. "
" A fundamental clean-up is now required. "
The politician announced: " The Occupational Safety and Health Act, which we want to pass in the Cabinet at the end of July, also includes measures that not only affect the meat industry - for example, higher examination rates for occupational safety and health or clear criteria for communal accommodation. "
The draft presented to dpa includes amendments to the Act on the Protection of Workers' Rights in the Meat Industry and the Occupational Health and Safety Act.
Brandenburg's consumer protection minister, Ursula Nonnemacher (Green Party), believes that more intensive controls are necessary.
" I would like us to be able to carry out even more checks in many supervisory areas: food inspections, animal welfare, everything possible, including animal transport, for example, " said Nonnemacher on Sunday in the RBB programme " Brandenburg aktuell. "
However, more personnel positions are also needed for more checks.
Three dead in microlight plane crash in Germany
According to the police, three people have died in the crash of a microlight aircraft on an apartment building in Wesel in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia.
One child was slightly injured.
Two other people were rescued injured in the accident, said a spokesman for the Wesel district control centre.
According to the police, a parachute was found at the scene of the accident.
Referring to eyewitnesses, the " Rheinische Post " reported that the plane had collided with a hot air balloon before the crash.
The house is a single- or two-family house.
Further details were not disclosed at first.
Frankfurt Opernplatz cleared peacefully
One week after the riots in Frankfurt, the evacuation of the Opernplatz during the night to Sunday also proceeded peacefully.
At last, there were a few dozen people on the square, but they left it before the closing time began at 1 a.m.
The police had been on duty with numerous officers since the early evening, and a larger police presence could be seen throughout the city.
For the first time this weekend, from midnight, there was a ban on entry to Opernplatz, where riots broke out a week ago.
Policemen had been attacked with bottles from among the crowd celebrating.
According to police reports, at least five officers were injured and several police vehicles were damaged.
The night leading up to Saturday was also quiet.
Car flips over: Young woman seriously injured in an accident on federal highway 83 near Hofgeismar
A 21-year-old suffered serious injuries in an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme on Sunday at around 1: 25 p.m.
She was taken to the hospital in Kassel.
The fire brigade used thermal imaging cameras to look for potential passengers.
According to the police, the woman was driving on federal highway 83 in the direction of her home town of Hümme when, for reasons yet unknown, her car drifted off the road and rolled over several times.
In order to save the accident victim, the fire brigade had to clear the roof of the car.
Since it was unclear whether anyone was still in the vehicle, the adjacent maize field was scanned from the turntable ladder with a thermal imaging camera.
The drone squadron from Warburg, which also works with thermal imaging cameras, had also been ordered to search for people.
However, the volunteers did not find anyone between the tall maize plants.
The seriously injured woman was taken by ambulance to the hospital in Kassel for further treatment.
Almost 50 firefighters from the Hofgeismar, Hümme and Schöneberg fire brigades were on site.
The main road was closed for two hours due to the accident.
Juventus Turin champions in Italy
Turin - After a redeeming goal by Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin has secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in a row.
The team around the five-time world football player completed the 36th Scudetto in the club's history with a score of 2: 0 (1: 0) on Sunday evening in their home game against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo scored 1-0 before half-time.
With 83 points, Turin, which competed without former international Sami Khedira, who was recently injured for a long time, can no longer be pushed out of first place two match days before the end of the Serie A season.
Inter Milan, second in the standings, is seven points behind.
Juventus were harmless despite their optical superiority in the first half, then Ronaldo scored with the final action after a free kick variant.
The 35-year-old scored a pass from Miralem Pjanic directly from the boundary of the penalty area with a flat shot (45 + 7).
Against the now more offensive guests, Ronaldo was also involved in the 2-0, with Federico Bernardeschi (67) gathering dust after his shot.
This ensured the lackluster but decisive success.
The foul in the 89th minute, which was missed to the bar, was probably only the fault of Ronaldo himself with regard to the goal scorer's score.
" It's complicated to stay mentally and physically at ball level for 90 minutes.
The games are strange, and momentum is changing very slightly, " explained coach Maurizio Sarri after the 1-2 win at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Above all, the mental exhaustion of his players is great, said the Juve coach.
Due to the defeat, the team from Turin had not yet been able to complete the championship.
In the end, Juve's reassuring lead at the top of the standings was mainly due to the weakness of his competitors.
In the eleven games leading up to Sunday's game, the Sarri team had only managed to score five wins.
Whether Ronaldo will also become the top scorer is questionable.
While the Portuguese superstar has so far scored 31 goals, the former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile has already scored 34 goals after his hat-trick in the 5: 1 (1: 1) of the table fourth Lazio Rome at the Hellas Verona - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the title win of FC Bayern.
The record in Italy is held by the current Juventus pro Gonzalo Higuaín.
The Argentinean scored 36 goals for SSC Napoli in the 2015 / 2016 season.
In August, the " old lady " of Italian football will have her next chance at winning the title.
Juventus are in the last 16 of the Champions League, but will have to make up for a 0-1 first-leg defeat against Olympique Lyon on 7 August in order to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next knockout round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would wait as opponents.
Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal car races recorded
Stuttgart - Despite all the threatened penalties and court rulings, drivers continue to step on the gas in countless illegal races on the roads of Baden-Württemberg: In the past year and the first four months of this year, the police in the south-west have already registered more than 250 illegal car races.
There are no comparable figures for previous years, but the speeders are increasingly making work for the judicial authorities: A total of 155 investigations into illegal races were conducted at the public prosecutor's offices between Konstanz and Mannheim in 2018, a year later there were already 252 and in the current year by the beginning of June 151.
The races were less about organised events, as can be seen from the response of the Ministry of the Interior to an inquiry by the Landtag-SPD.
In most cases, the drivers competed against each other spontaneously or fled from the police - this is also reported as an illegal race.
The drivers were mainly German men between the ages of 18 and 60.
113 fines - 15 times imprisonment
Only in comparatively few cases are speeders caught and asked to pay: According to the Ministry of the Interior, a total of 113 fines have been imposed and 15 prison sentences handed down since 2018.
However, there are no indications that the number of illegal car races is actually increasing.
On the contrary, other drivers reacted more sensitively than in the past due to the numerous tragic accidents and lawsuits, and reported more frequently, said a ministry spokesman.
Autobahn 8 is particularly popular with racers. Again and again, drivers brake the traffic there in order to make room for themselves and use the free track for a race.
Last August, a dozen drivers were caught near Kirchheim unter Teck; three months earlier, there were as many as 18 drivers on the A8 near Merklingen.
The A81 is the most popular " race track "
The police even register more races on the A81 than on any other federal motorway.
With a speed limit, an attempt is being made to slow down the speeders on the particularly affected section between Engen and Geisingen.
The mostly high-priced and pimped-up sports and luxury cars often have Swiss license plates because drivers resort to racing in Germany because of the high penalties for driving too fast and car racing in the neighbouring country.
For the SPD, the speed limit must not be reduced to a few routes: " With a general speed limit of 130 kilometres per hour, we would get rid of this problem on motorways, " says Martin Rivoir, the traffic expert for the SPD parliamentary group.
" The inhibition threshold for speeders would be significantly higher if you were not allowed to travel legally here and there at 200 kilometres per hour or more. "
Rivoir thinks less of education or image campaigns: " Anyone who ignores all the rules in this way and puts not only their own lives, but also the lives of other road users at risk, can hardly be reached with reason. "
ADAC calls for stronger police crackdown
However, this is not enough for the ADAC: " We assume that racers will not be deterred by the speed limits, " says Holger Bach, Head of Transport and Environment at ADAC Württemberg.
He is calling for additional and tougher checks on the affected routes.
Not infrequently, the high-speed trial of strength turns into painful and momentous seriousness: Since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people across the country have died in the races, two of them innocent bystanders in a night-time crash in the centre of Stuttgart and one in Gerlingen.
Two young men are said to have competed in a car race there in November.
One of the vehicles came off the road, crashed into a garden wall and stopped on its side, and the 18-year-old co-driver died.
21 other people have been injured in the races over the past two years.
However, in the opinion of Minister of the Interior Thomas Strobl, stricter penalties are not necessary: " There is no need for legislative action to sanction illegal motor vehicle races more severely, " says the paper of the Ministry of the Interior.
Blue light from 23 July: Thirsty burglar steals drinks from snack bar
Rohrdorf: A man broke into a snack bar in Rohrdorf (Calw district) on Thursday and stole drinks and cash.
A witness heard noises in Talstraße at around 3.40 a.m. and ran in the direction of the snack bar.
There he noticed a man who helped himself with drinks from the fridge and then left the snack bar through a previously smashed front door.
The perpetrator fled in the direction of the meadows behind the snack bar.
According to the police, the burglar also made use of a cash register and stole cash in the low three-digit range.
The suspect is described as follows: He is about 1.75 to 1.80 meters tall and of strong stature.
In fact, he was wearing a black hoodie, black trousers and light shoes.
The police will receive further evidence from witnesses.
Ackermann sprints to victory on the final stage of the Sibiu Tour
Professional cyclist Pascal Ackermann took his second day victory on the final stage of the 10th Sibiu Tour.
The 26-year-old from Palatinate from the Bora-hansgrohe team prevailed in a bunch sprint on the 109-kilometre section with start and finish in Sibiu, having already won a stage on Saturday.
These were season victories three and four for Ackermann.
His Austrian team mate Gregor Mühlberger came out on top in the overall standings.
The 26-year-old confidently won the mountain time trial in the morning, taking the lead in the classification.
Only 104 riders were left for the final stage in the evening.
No fewer than 18 starters had fallen victim to the time limit in the mountain time trial.
" I'm really happy to start the new season with a win, " Ackermann said after his success on Saturday.
" The sprint was really hectic, " said the 26-year-old.
With 300 metres to go, he simply put on his sprint, " and it worked out perfectly. "
In accordance with the rules of the UCI, all race participants and their companions underwent a corona test six days before the start of the race.
During the entire tour, drivers and carers were separated from the organisation team and the media in isolated hygiene bubbles.
Spectators at the start and finish were not allowed.
Control centre issued instructions for lay resuscitation
Düsseldorf - Tragic accident on Sunday afternoon in Düsseldorf-Garath.
In an apartment building, a child (4) suddenly lay lifeless in the water while bathing.
According to the fire brigade, the emergency call was received shortly before 1 p.m.
" A dispatcher from the control centre immediately gave instructions for amateur resuscitation, " a fire service spokesman told BILD.
The arriving rescue forces took over the resuscitation measures a little later.
The child, whose life was in danger, was transported to the university hospital under resuscitation.
It is unclear why the accident occurred.
The police have routinely started investigations into the course of the accident.
The fire service spokesman: " We are assuming a tragic accident in the apartment. "
Nuremberg: Unauthorised tuning meeting - police intervene, 700 vehicles and around 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and at times more than 1000 people took part in a " tuning meeting " on Saturday night in the parking lot of a furniture store.
The police implemented their announcement that they would increase their control of such events.
A major tuning meeting took place on Saturday evening (25 July 2020) in the south of Nuremberg.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the police of Middle Franconia, the Nuremberg traffic police noticed an increased number of vehicles in the area of a large car park in Ingolstädter Straße at around 10: 30 p.m.
As a result, the police carried out a large number of vehicle inspections there.
Only recently, the police announced that they would step up their efforts to combat so-called autoposers.
Illegal tuning meeting in Nuremberg: Only a small part of the " scene "
At the top of the list were around 700 vehicles and around 1100 people, according to the police.
Of these, however, only a small proportion of those present can be attributed to the " autoposer " and tuning scene.
Apparently, the majority of the relevant scene complied with the police's appeal.
On the basis of the vehicles and people on site, it can be assumed that these were mainly onlookers.
In addition, the vast majority of those present complied with the applicable infection protection regulations, in particular compliance with the minimum distance and wearing a mouth-nose protection.
The control measures carried out on site were completed at around 1: 00 a.m.
In total, the officials noticed such structural changes to 10 vehicles that the operating permit had expired.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No car races
There were no illegal car races.
" The police headquarters in Middle Franconia will continue to keep an eye on what is happening and will continue to carry out increased control measures, also in connection with the arrival of onlookers, " it said.
The News5 agency spoke to Jürgen Schrödinger from the towing company involved: " They all have beautiful rims, we must not scratch them, " says Schrödinger.
Special tapes are used for this purpose.
Also because the cars are wider, the company must take care not to cause any damage.
" After all, the young people should get their cars back undamaged. "
Employment Agency figures: 900 suspected cases of abuse of short-time work
Berlin - According to its own statement, the Federal Employment Agency (BA) is investigating around 900 suspected cases of misuse of short-time work allowances.
" With more than 880,000 companies reporting short-time work, this is extremely low, " said Daniel Terzenbach, the managing director responsible for operations, to the " Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. "
When, at the start of the COVID-19 crisis, a large number of companies suddenly applied for short-time work, the BA had to react quickly.
Normally, the examination can take up to three weeks.
" We didn't have that much time at our disposal in this critical phase.
We will therefore take a closer look at the final accounts.
There will certainly be a lot more to come.
We are not naive about this and have a lot of staying power. "
Indications of abuse often come from the affected employees or trade unions.
In addition, the BA uses analysis software to identify patterns of misuse.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is preparing for a possible wave of insolvency in the autumn.
" Will there be significantly more insolvencies than in the previous year?
The assessments differ, but we are preparing ourselves for the eventuality and are already training our employees in the employment agencies to process applications for insolvency money. "
The figures are still inconspicuous, said Terzenbach.
World Heritage in Potsdam: Party in the New Garden dissolved
Potsdam - On Friday evening, around 40 young people celebrated a party in the New Garden.
The collection was dissolved at 8: 48 p.m. by the district drivers of the Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation (SPSG), the foundation announced at PNN's request.
The young people then left the park.
On Saturday evening, some young people played rugby in the New Garden.
The meadow was cleared by district drivers, said SPSG spokesperson Frank Kallensee on Sunday.
Again and again there are illegal celebrations in the parks
In the Foundation's parks, there are frequent gatherings in which the distance and hygiene rules of the COVID-19 Handling Ordinance are not observed.
At the end of June there was a celebration with around 300 people in the Babelsberg Park, and a week later around 150 people celebrated in the New Garden.
Even without a corona ordinance, the parks are closed at nightfall.
Storage on the meadows is prohibited according to the park regulations, there are only a few exceptions.
The foundation has been complaining for some time that visitors are leaving behind more and more rubbish and destroying protected biotopes.
Meanwhile, illegal park parties in Berlin have taken on a different dimension.
On Sunday night, 5000 people celebrated an illegal techno party in Hasenheide in the district of Neukölln.
The event was broken up by the police.
Austria: Mass tests after corona outbreak in tourist resort
Authorities have responded to a corona outbreak in the popular Upper Austrian tourist resort of St. Wolfgang with hundreds of tests.
The number of confirmed cases rose to 48, according to the state authorities in Linz.
More than 100 results were still to come in the evening.
According to the study, many of those infected are young trainees in tourism businesses, but at least one holiday guest also tested positive.
Residents, guests and tourism staff were asked to stay in their accommodation on Saturday evening.
The curfew was set at 23: 00.
" There are cancellations and cancellations of bookings here and there, " the head of the Wolfgangsee Tourism Association, Hans Wieser, told dpa.
A few guests also left early.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist resort in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 overnight stays last year.
In a normal season, around one third of the guests are Germans.
The first infections became public knowledge on Friday.
On Saturday, the head of the district authority, Alois Lanz, defended the behaviour of the trainees, who had celebrated in several restaurants and could have been infected there.
" We all enjoyed doing this in our youth, " he told radio station Ö1.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The tourism association has launched an information campaign to raise awareness among young employees of the dangers of COVID-19.
Starting on Saturday, hundreds of employees, holidaymakers and locals were tested.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang from 15 July were contacted.
The outbreak evokes memories of the Austrian ski and party resort of Ischgl in Tyrol, which in the early stages of the pandemic was a centre for the spread of COVID-19 throughout Europe.
In total, more than 1500 people in Austria are currently infected with the virus.
The focus of new infections is on Vienna and Upper Austria.
Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualified for the Champions League
London (dpa) - The English football record champions Manchester United are returning to the Champions League after a year of absence.
On the final day of the Premier League, the Red Devils secured third place in the standings with a 2-0 (0-0) victory over their direct rivals Leicester City.
The Foxes will now have to settle for the Europa League, as Chelsea FC passed by and also qualified for the premier class in fourth place.
Aston Villa was able to cheer in the fight against relegation.
Manchester United took the lead with a penalty kick from Bruno Fernandes (71st minute).
After a red card for Leicester City in injury time, Jesse Lingard (90 + 8) scored the final score.
Chelsea, FC Bayern's opponent in the Champions League round of 16, won 2: 0 (2: 0) against Wolverhampton Wanderers in parallel thanks to Mason Mount (45th + 1) and Olivier Giroud (45th + 4).
" That means a lot to me, " said coach Frank Lampard, who in his first season as Chelsea coach is also up against Arsenal in the FA Cup final.
Chelsea's victory against Wolverhampton also benefited Tottenham Hotspur, who passed the Wolves with a meagre 1: 1 (1: 0) win at Crystal Palace and started sixth in the Europa League.
Aston Villa won the long-distance duel with Watford FC and AFC Bournemouth, but had to tremble for a long time for a place in the league at West Ham United.
Andrej Yarmolenko (85) immediately made up for the late lead of Jack Grealish (84).
However, the 1: 1 (0: 0) score was enough because Watford lost 2: 3 (1: 3) to Arsenal.
The club, which lost three coaches in the season, is relegated after five years in the premier league.
Just like Bournemouth, which could no longer save itself with a 3: 1 (2: 1) victory at Everton.
In the end, one point was missing.
Liverpool FC, who have been the English champions since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3: 1 (1: 1) victory at Newcastle United.
99 points is the highest score the Reds have ever scored in a football season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp and his team narrowly missed the points record in English football.
Manchester City holds the record with 100 points in the 2017 / 18 season.
After the Newcastle lead in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38th), Divock Origi (59th) and Sadio Mané (89th) turned the game for Liverpool on Sunday.
" It was an extraordinary season for this wonderful club, " said goalscorer van Dijk after the match, " which should spur us on to defend the title.
It will be difficult. "
The Premier League bosses should also be satisfied in the end.
Due to the coronavirus crisis, football operations in England were interrupted from 13 March to 17 June.
In the meantime, it has even been discussed whether the games should be abandoned prematurely or whether the remaining games should be played on neutral ground.
In the end, however, the season could be played to the end without any special incidents - albeit as in Germany without spectators in the stadiums.
Arrests and violence at demonstrations against Netanyahu
The protests in Israel against Prime Minister Netanyahu are becoming increasingly fierce.
Violent clashes broke out during the night.
The Israeli police took violent action in Jerusalem on Sunday night against participants in a demonstration against right-wing conservative Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu.
According to police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld, twelve people have been arrested for participating in riots.
Among other things, the police used water cannons to disperse the rally.
According to media reports, a total of around 6,000 people gathered near Netanyahu's official residence on Saturday evening.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu's handling of the COVID-19 crisis.
The protesters beat drums, blew horns and called on Netanyahu to resign.
Participants in a counter-demonstration who supported Netanyahu have also been arrested, reported the news website " ynet. "
People also demonstrated in many other places in Israel, including in front of the Prime Minister's private villa in the coastal town of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
According to the police, a man was arrested near Tel Aviv on suspicion of spraying pepper spray from a moving car on demonstrators on the side of the road.
Another man was detained following a stabbing attack on a demonstrator in the south of the country.
The demonstrator's neck was slightly injured.
There have recently been several demonstrations against Netanyahu in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.
The rallies accompany the corruption case against the head of government.
Recently, Netanyahu has also been criticized for his handling of the COVID-19 crisis.
Among other things, he is accused of hasty easing and a lack of preparation for a second wave of COVID-19.
The COVID-19 crisis has hit the country's economy hard.
The unemployment rate recently stood at more than 20 percent.
The number of new infections with the coronavirus in Israel has recently risen to new record levels.
Accident near Ahlen (North Rhine-Westphalia) - Van crashes into car - Nine injured - Ruhrgebiet - Bild.de
Ahlen - A rear-end collision on Saturday afternoon on the B58 near Ahlen resulted in nine minor injuries.
A female driver was travelling with her two children (3, 5) in the direction of Beckum.
The police: " Presumably she had suddenly braked because she wanted to turn. "
The driver of a Mercedes van driving behind her must have seen this too late.
He crashed into the back of the car.
Three passengers in the car and six in the van were slightly injured in the accident.
Several ambulances took her to a nearby hospital.
North Korea seals off border town following suspected case of corona
North Korea has so far seen its own measures to ward off the coronavirus as a " shining success. "
The country is now reporting a suspected case for the first time.
Due to a first official case of suspected corona in the country, North Korea has completely cordoned off a major city for fear of a catastrophe.
Despite the strictest epidemiological defence measures in the past six months, " the malignant virus could have been introduced into the country, " the state media reported.
A state of emergency has been declared for the region around the border town of Kaesong.
The communist leadership declared the highest level of alarm.
If the suspected case is confirmed, it would be the first official case of infection with Sars-CoV-2 in the isolated country.
According to its own statements, North Korea has not yet registered a single infection and has described its defence measures as a " shining success. "
The information was doubted abroad.
According to reports, the symptoms of the disease were found in an " outlier " who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on 19 July.
The person fled to South Korea three years ago and has now returned across the border.
For the time being, there was no confirmation from South Korea that the border had been crossed within the military buffer zone, which is four kilometres wide and for the most part still mined.
However, according to reports by the national news agency Yonhap, South Korea's military acknowledged the possibility of an illegal border crossing to North Korea as high.
Investigations have been carried out on a number of individuals.
According to its own statements, North Korea called an emergency meeting of the Workers' Party Politburo, chaired by leader Kim Jong Un, on Saturday because of the suspicion.
The " dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive catastrophe. "
As a preventive measure, Kim had already ordered on Friday that " Kaesong be completely blocked and that every district and region be isolated from others, " the statement went on.
The affected person, as well as all people in Kaesong who have had contact with them, have been put under quarantine.
Accordingly, the party's central military commission is to investigate the " runaway case " as well as the conduct of the responsible military unit and, if necessary, impose severe punishment.
It is estimated that around 300,000 people live in Kaesong.
Tension ahead of Council meeting: City East and noise protection to be discussed before the summer break
" In addition to environmental issues, the committee members will also vote on the development plan for the large-scale project Innenstadtentwicklung-Ost, " it says rather casually in the middle section of the city's press release on the next city council meeting on Tuesday, 28 July, at 4.30 p.m. in the Great Hall of the CongressCentrum Pforzheim.
However, the upgrading of the eastern part of the city is the subject of heated debate right up to the end.
The majorities for this are scarce, most recently even negative in individual committees, depending on attendance.
An appeal from industry (construction, real estate, trade and IT) not to let the project developed by the citizens and then by the administration and the local council fail after almost ten years of preparation was criticized by project opponent Reinhard Klein as an " extra-parliamentary opposition, " " unaware, " " speculation, " " defamation " and " deliberate false statements. "
" Everyone thinks they know better, " said Klein, who has been a member of the municipal council for a year as the only representative on the citizens' list in Pforzheim.
In fact, after reading the contracts, he was in this position: " I know what I'm talking about. "
The exit would be cheaper for the city, and contrary to statements by the city administration, the Technical Town Hall is looking for subsidies, the existence of which Klein is convinced will cost 8.5 million euros to renovate.
The development of the town will be very different from that predicted by the town hall and by supporters from the business community.
Shaping the city through his own efforts and not an investor: that is his plan B. One day after Klein, the FDP / FW / UB / LED faction, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
Essentially, it also provides for the renovation of the Technical Town Hall, keeping the Schloßberg open, renting the Ex-Thales for administrative areas and a smaller-scale redesign of the city centre, ideally with local sponsors.
Environmental issues play a central role
In addition, environmental issues in particular will play a central role.
Among other things, the local council will vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the population of Pforzheim from health-related noise pollution caused by road traffic, many of which include speed reductions.
In a press release, the local Verkehrsclub Deutschland welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30. However, the political leaders in the city are not innocent of the fact that this must happen, because they have only contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus noise by neglecting regular bus services with thinned-out cycles and little commitment to cycling, according to the VCD.
The town council will also vote on the city's participation in the Pforzheim / Enzkreis Energy and Climate Protection Agency.
The agenda also includes accession to the Climate Protection Pact of the state of Baden-Württemberg, the resetting of parental contributions in municipal day-care centres and the application for admission to federal smart city funding.
Citizens are welcome, but must take corona protection measures to heart.
Tim Zimmermann starts the new season with much delay
With a delay of almost six months, Tim Zimmermann will start his debut season in the ADAC GT Masters on 31 July.
Before the league of super sports cars can go into regular operation, it was time for the first test runs.
For Zimmermann, the main objective was to get to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3 better.
For a long time, the corona crisis prevented Tim Zimmermann from embarking on his first business trip in Grasser Racing's new Lamborghini Huracan.
This was now possible under special hygiene conditions.
The 23-year-old driver from Langenargen completed his first laps at the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his debut in a GT3 car.
" There are already a few things that are different from the Porsche from the previous season, " says Zimmermann.
" With the ABS, for example, you have to go into corners differently.
But it was really a lot of fun. "
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite being only 25 years old, the Dutchman is already experienced in GT racing and has been able to help his new team mate in many ways.
" I'm not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series brings with it new challenges, " says Zimmermann.
" Steijn and I understand each other brilliantly and we have also made enormous progress from session to session at the Lausitzring. "
It is precisely there - at the Lausitzring - that the GT Masters will hold its first race.
From 31 July, the 33 super sports cars will race through Lusatia.
However, Zimmermann, who is one of 15 newcomers to the series, knows the track.
In 2015 he was most recently a guest at the Motodrom.
" It worked out quickly and I didn't really have to get used to the track, " says Zimmermann, who is competing for the Graf Zeppelin racing team in Friedrichshafen.
" The Lausitzring has many fast sections that you have to hit optimally to be fast. "
How fast Zimmermann really is will be revealed in two weeks' time.
" Of course, the teams play poker a bit during the tests, " he says.
" Ultimately, however, we are very satisfied and are looking forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring. "
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a tightly packed calendar.
Seven races are scheduled until the beginning of November.
The current situation is that no spectators will be allowed - but there will be a prominent guest.
Ex-Formula One driver Niko Hülkenberg will take the GT steering wheel at the Nürburgring in mid-August.
British Minister of Transport caught off guard by quarantine decision
According to press reports, the British government's decision to put holidaymakers in Spain under quarantine for two weeks after their return has caught the country's Minister of Transport off guard.
According to the report, Grant Shapps is currently on holiday in Spain of all places, while his colleagues at home decided on the measure on Saturday.
Due to the rise in corona numbers in Spain, the cabinet in London removed the country from the list of countries from which entry is possible without quarantine requirements.
The new regulation will apply from today, Sunday, which means that Shapps will also have to go into quarantine after his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returnees.
But for those who are just on holiday on the cut-off date, the regulation only applies from Saturday, 1 August, and was not introduced overnight.
Incidentally, Spain is currently regarded in Austria as one of the " safe countries " for which no quarantine in Austria is required.
" Many ministers must have known in advance that there is a possibility that a quarantine will be imposed on holidaymakers in Spain, " commented Labour MP Diane Abbot.
" But apparently nobody bothered to let Grant Shapp know. "
Less than a month after the end of the COVID-19 emergency in Spain and the end of the strict curfew, infections in the country are on the rise again.
Virologists believe that nightlife is the main reason for the new spread.
Spain is one of Britain's favourite holiday destinations.
The British government currently advises against unnecessary travel to the Spanish mainland, with the exception of the Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands, which are particularly popular with British holidaymakers.
To date, more than 272,000 infections with the novel coronavirus and more than 28,000 deaths have been registered in Spain.
Russia: Navy Day: Putin announces hypersonic weapons for warships
On the occasion of Navy Day in his country, Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced that warships will be equipped with state-of-the-art hypersonic weapons.
These weapons, which are unique in the world, would expand the combat capabilities of the Russian naval forces, Putin said at the central naval parade in St. Petersburg on Sunday.
According to the Interfax agency, the Ministry of Defence also provided information on successful tests of the Zirkon hypersonic rocket built for the navy.
The hypersonic weapons have a multiple of the speed of sound of around 343 metres per second.
They are considered the weapons of the future.
Underwater tropedeo continues to be built
Construction will also continue on the atomic underwater torpedo Poseidon, it was said.
The planned sea drone is planned to destroy coastal targets.
The president, who himself also sailed a military boat, said that this year alone 40 new ships would be put into service with the individual fleet units of the largest country in the world.
Russia has a larger coastal area than any other country in the world.
The navy has been reliably protecting Russia for 300 years, Putin said on the day celebrated by sailors across the country.
The naval forces also celebrated Navy Day with parades in many other Russian coastal towns.
In Syria, where Russia is fighting alongside ruler Bashar al-Assad, the military demonstrated its strength at an arms show in the Mediterranean port of Tartus.
Ammunition was also fired there.
A video released by the Ministry of Defence showed not only warships, including a submarine, but also combat helicopters and jets.
Hurricane " Hanna " reaches Texas: Corona makes aid more difficult
Washington - The first hurricane of this year's season over the Atlantic has hit land in Texas.
Life-threatening floods, strong winds and heavy rainfall are now threatening parts of the US state, the National Hurricane Centre told the US climate agency NOAA on Sunday night (local time).
Governor Greg Abbott declared a state of emergency for many districts.
The COVID-19 pandemic that is raging in Texas is making the work of aid workers more difficult, Abbott continued, according to the US media.
Evacuees called upon to exercise caution
" Every hurricane is a huge challenge, " Abbott said, according to the Houston Chronicle newspaper.
Referring to the cyclone in Texas, he added, " This challenge is complicated, and is exacerbated when you consider that it is sweeping through an area that is the most affected by COVID-19 in the state. "
According to the Johns Hopkins University, around 5,000 people have died as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in Texas alone.
Abbott called on people who had to leave their homes to exercise caution.
They should not disregard practices " to which we have become accustomed, " such as wearing masks, the governor said, according to CBS.
It is important that everyone keeps their distance.
For this reason, hotel rooms have been made available in some places.
In addition, corona tests are to be carried out in emergency shelters.
Damage was initially only reported from the coastal town of Port Mansfield.
Storm warning withdrawn again
According to the authorities, with wind speeds of up to 150 kilometres per hour, " Hanna " hit land on the island of Padre Island just off the coast of Texas.
The tropical storm had previously been upgraded to a hurricane of the lowest level one.
A storm surge warning was first issued for the stretch of coast from Port Mansfield to Sargent and was later withdrawn.
Authorities expected a slowdown, while " Hanna " moved further inland and headed for northeastern Mexico.
" Douglas " moves towards Hawaii
In the Pacific, Hurricane " Douglas " was heading towards Hawaii during the night to Sunday with wind speeds of around 150 kilometres per hour.
However, the hurricane centre expected it to weaken further.
According to the forecast, it will be near Hawaii's largest islands on Sunday (local time) - then as a storm just below the hurricane threshold.
According to a forecast made in May, NOAA was expecting an above-average hurricane season over the Atlantic this year.
From June to the end of November, up to ten hurricanes are to be expected, of which up to six could be very strong cyclones, the authorities explained.
On average, there are six hurricanes per year over the Atlantic, three of which develop into storms of great magnitude.
In view of available climate data and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, the probability of a normal season is only 30 percent, and that of a below-average season is only ten percent, it was said at the time.
US President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that his administration is closely monitoring the storms and is in contact with the affected states.
Four goals denied: Video assistant " punishes " Sassuolo
Sassuolo's Filip Djuricic lost two goals
Naples - Four goals scored, four goals denied: Sassuolo Calcio experienced a pitch-black evening in the 0: 2 (0: 1) at SSC Naples in the Italian football league Serie A - and was really angry with the referee's video assistant.
" A festival of unfulfilled goals for Sassuolo.
Never before has the VAR acted so harshly against a team, " commented the " Corriere dello Sport. "
Host Naples took the lead with a goal from full-back Elseid Hisaj in the 8th minute, with Filip Djuricic cheering for the equalizer in the 32nd minute.
The Video Assistant Referee (VAR) retracted the hit due to an offside position.
Five minutes later, Djuricic shot the ball back into the net - and the VAR intervened again.
The referee team also withdrew the goals of attacker Francesco Caputo (50th) and Domenico Berardi (61st), following advice from the VAR.
In injury time, Allan completed the 2-0 final for Naples and the bitter evening for Sassuolo.
" For Sassuolo, the VAR is worse than a speed camera on the road and punishes Sassuolo like no other team before.
The new technology sets new records, " writes the " Gazzetta dello Sport. "
FC Bayern München: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start of the heated preparation phase for the Champions League began with a setback for double winners FC Bayern.
Having recovered " reasonably well " after a short holiday and a few training days, Hansi Flick has to think about how he can rebuild his successful defence after the injury of world champion Benjamin Pavard.
The Frenchman, who has the third most minutes of action behind captain Manuel Neuer and midfielder Joshua Kimmich, suffered a ligament injury to his left foot and threatens to miss out in decisive king-class duels.
In Munich's dirty weather, the right-back broke off a training match and was driven off the pitch in a golf kart.
How long the unrestricted regular player will have to take a break in the battle for the title remains to be seen.
An appearance in the second leg of the round of 16 against FC Chelsea on 8 August is unlikely to be possible, and the 24-year-old can look forward to the final tournament, which begins in Lisbon on 12 August.
However, Bayern do not want to be stopped by the mishap from training on Sunday.
In his personal triple formula, Flick named the three attributes he wants to see from his stars on their way to Portugal's capital.
Quality, intensity and concentration are to be demonstrated by his title collectors, who are hungry for victory, over the ideally following 28 days until the King's Class final on 23 August.
" We have simply excellently mastered the compulsory tasks with the championship and the trophy.
Now it's time to create something special, " said Flick.
Until the Munich team can deal with the final tournament and before that with a training camp in the Algarve, they will first be required to play the round of 16 against Chelsea FC.
After the 3-0 win in the first leg before the corona break, the Londoners should not once again become a Bayern nightmare in their home arena, as they did in the lost " final at home " in 2012.
" We first have to go through the door.
We want to win, create good conditions and build trust with a good game, " demanded Flick.
A test to get you in the mood is scheduled for Friday against Olympique Marseille.
With a long speech, Flick had sworn his stars, who had 13 days of holiday after the double, to a unique August.
He welcomed 31 players to Säbener Straße, including the new players around Edel-Einkauf Leroy Sané, who met all his new colleagues on the pitch for the first time after his move from Manchester City.
" Like all the newcomers, Leroy has fitted in well, " reported Flick.
But instead of talking about the new season, when Sané & Co. are no longer just allowed to train, Flick preferred to talk about the current title project of the German series champion.
After days of individual and small-group training, they are now training in team strength for the Londoners, who, in contrast to the Flick ensemble, are in the rhythm of play.
After that, Munich could face a quarter-final against FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, with potential opponents in the semi-final being Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin.
A path to the final in Lisbon " is not that easy, " emphasised the head coach, who will be able to rely on the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training from Tuesday.
World Cup record scorer Klose and Flick know from many joint tournament preparations what is particularly important in the 0-to-100 set-up.
Working with his current team is " a pleasure, " praised Flick.
The " focus on winning " is an impressive characteristic of his team.
The tournament with nine-man teams was also ambitious on Sunday.
All of the top performers were there, including Thiago, who wanted to leave, and defender David Alaba, whose whereabouts are not guaranteed beyond the king's class season.
Formula 1 needs a special rule to choose its world champion.
Since it is not possible to drive on the required number of continents, the FIA has to improvise to award the World Championship titles.
However, all American races were cancelled.
Race calendar is becoming more and more concrete
The racing calendar for the current Formula 1 season continues to take shape.
In addition to the ten confirmed Grand Prix so far, three further race tracks were added during the week.
In October, the race will take place at the Nürburgring in Germany and in Portimão, Portugal.
On the first of November, Lewis Hamilton and Co. will fight for championship points on the traditional Italian race track in Imola.
This means that the 2020 racing calendar currently comprises 13 races.
" We are delighted that we are continuing to make great strides in completing our plans for the 2020 season, " said Formula One boss Chase Carey.
A total of 15 to 18 races in the premier class of motorsport are to be completed in this extraordinary season.
Formula 1 wants to close its season in Asia.
The final race calendar is to be finalised and published in the coming weeks.
According to media reports, appearances in Vietnam and Malaysia could take place at the end of November before the already officially planned races in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December.
Regulations require races on three continents
However, the Formula 1 regulations require at least races on three continents for the awarding of the World Championship.
Even if, as currently planned, there will only be races on two continents, there will be a world champion.
With the help of a special rule, the FIA wants to award the titles with reference to " exceptional circumstances " due to the corona virus pandemic.
The traditional start to the season in Australia in March had to be cancelled at short notice due to the looming crisis.
A return to the continent before the end of this year is not an issue.
In addition, Formula 1 will not be a guest in America this year.
Cancellation meets with criticism in Brazil
Due to the tense corona situation, the races in Canada, the USA, Mexico and Brazil will not take place.
" We look forward to being with them again next season, " said Carey.
The cancellation of the American races met with criticism, particularly in Brazil: " The cancellation did not come as a surprise to us, but we cannot accept the reasons for this, " said Tamas Rohonyi, promoter of the Grand Prix in São Paulo.
Infections in the São Paulo region, for example, are significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
The concerns of some teams about not wanting to race in Brazil would also not justify a cancellation.
They are prepared for the required security measures.
Greta Thunberg: Evil eye against Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest on Stephen Colbert's well-known late-night show via video and revealed in an interview what she had in mind when she met Donald Trump.
Climate activist Greta Thunberg was a guest in a popular US late-night show via video.
Among other things, she talked about her fight against the powerful of the world.
The teenager also talked about her famous " evil eye " when she met Donald Trump.
New York City - Over the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has drawn attention to herself with her tireless commitment to the " Fridays For Future " movement.
Now she spoke in a well-known late-night show about her plans for the future and her meeting with US President Donald Trump at the UN climate summit last year.
Late-night presenter Stephen Colbert welcomed 17-year-old Thunberg to your programme on Tuesday and conducted a longer interview with the Swede.
She spoke not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the world's powerful.
" There are some things that surprised me, " she said.
" How far people are going to steer the focus away from the climate crisis, " she said, was shocking.
" Everything from organised hate campaigns to threats just because a group of children are taking to the streets, " she said.
Heads of state and leading politicians who scoff at her on social media or even try to silence her find her " funny " because the reactions show her " because they have no other answer. "
It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview, when Greta Thunberg was asked about a well-known scene in which she cast a bitterly angry look after US President Trump.
At the UN Climate Summit 2019 in New York, for which the activist sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive gaze was captured by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
The short clip resulted in a GIF, i.e. an animated image, which ultimately became one of the most frequently used images for Trump opponents.
But what was the 17-year-old thinking about the US president at that moment?
To the relatively open question posed by Stephen Colbert, she answered only briefly and dryly: " To be honest, I think that needs no further explanation. "
The experienced satirist Colbert had probably not reckoned with the quick-witted answer and disappeared from the picture with a brief laugh.
With her " How dare you? " speech on the principles of climate protection, she was remembered by many at the climate conference.
Ex-Dortmunder Immobile mit Dreierpack für Lazio Rom
Ciro Immobile is now on a par with Bavaria's Robert Lewandowski in the race for Europe's Golden Boot.
Former Dortmund player Ciro Immobile still has the best chance of becoming the top scorer in the Italian football championship.
The former BVB pro contributed three goals to the 5: 1 (1: 1) victory of Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona, including two converted penalties in the aftermath of both halves.
This means that the 30-year-old, who came fourth in the standings two games before the end of the season, now has 34 goals for the season on his account - just as many were scored by Robert Lewandowski of FC Bayern Munich in the last Bundesliga season.
In Italy, Cristiano Ronaldo has scored 30 goals so far, while the Portuguese superstar faced Sampdoria Genoa with the leader in the evening.
Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green has died

In an emotional reaction, Mick Fleetwood spoke of a " monumental loss " for all former and current members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
Drummer Fleetwood and guitarist Green founded the now legendary band in London in 1967, and his dreamy instrumental hit " Albatross " remains unforgotten to this day.
The musician's life (" The End Of The Game, " " In The Skies ") resembled a rollercoaster ride.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a rapid rise - but the band celebrated their greatest successes without him.
There is said to have been a dispute, among other things, because Green wanted to donate all of the group's profits to charity.
He began to perform in wide robes and with a large crucifix.
Psychological problems are also said to have played a role.
Just three years after their founding, Green left the band in 1970.
This was followed by a social decline.
The blues rock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, as biographers reported.
Green was treated in psychiatry for a long time.
During most of the 1970s, the musician disappeared from the scene.
He is said to have lived temporarily on the street, worked as a cemetery gardener and spent some time in an Israeli kibbutz.
Green was born in 1946 to a Jewish working-class family in the London district of Bethnal Green.
Even at a young age he was enthusiastic about US blues musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
He learned his first guitar chords at the age of eleven.
At the age of 15, the teenager began to play the guitar professionally and five years later got the chance to appear on stage as lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners.
A little later he was engaged by the Bluesbreakers to replace his idol Eric Clapton.
In the midst of the blues boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967 together with his Bluesbreakers colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song " Albatross, " composed by Green, brought the group their first number one hit in the winter of 1968 / 69 and catapulted them to the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid ascent soon showed its downsides: Green could not cope with the media hype, his experiments with the drug LSD became more and more extreme.
He later commented on life between music and addiction in an interview: " The worst thing that happened to me in my life was drugs - the best thing was to land a number one hit. "
Towards the end of the decade, Green achieved a surprising success in 1979 with an album inspired by religious themes.
Meanwhile, Fleetwood Mac swam without him in a new formation on a wave of success.
Their 1977 album " Rumours " sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Despite various small solo successes, Green did not make a major comeback until he started again in 1996 with a group of musician friends.
At the time, the British " Daily Telegraph " spoke of a rock star returning to earth.
Free of drugs, Green released several albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group until the band broke up in 2004.
For music experts, he was already a blues legend during his lifetime - and with his gentle sound he was one of the most influential guitarists of the past decades.
