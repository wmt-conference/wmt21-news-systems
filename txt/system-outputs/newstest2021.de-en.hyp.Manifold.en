Biker reacts lightning fast and prevents worse
On Friday evening, a traffic accident occurred on the road between Machtolsheim and Merklingen, in which a motorcyclist was only slightly injured thanks to his quick reaction.
Motorists overlook bikers
A 44-year-old car driver wanted to turn left with her VW coming from Merklingen on the state road 1230 in the direction of Machtolsheim.
She overlooked the 24-year-old motorcyclist coming from the direction of Nellingen.
In the event of a collision, hand and foot brake levers fly away
The biker still tried to avoid the car, but touched it at the rear of the vehicle.
As a result of the grazing process, the hand and foot brake levers on the Suzuki were torn off and the driver was no longer able to brake.
Mindfully, he steered his motorcycle in the green stiffeners next to the road and let it roll out there without falling.
Biker suffers leg injury
Due to the collision with the car, the biker suffered an injury on the Beim and had to be treated in a clinic.
Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 harvesters infected
After a corona mass infection on a large vegetable farm in Mamming, Lower Bavaria, almost 500 people are quarantined and are no longer allowed to leave the company.
A security service monitors the curfew.
A total of 174 harvesters were tested positive for the corona pathogen Sars-CoV-2 during the series examination, as reported by the Dingolfing-Landau district office on Saturday evening.
"In order to avoid further spread, we unfortunately have to take this step to protect the population," explained Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Seven employees had previously been infected in the company - this was the reason for the series test.
The farm is a large vegetable farm that grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and beetroot - the cucumbers, however, only for jars.
Mamming is a rural community with a good 3,300 inhabitants not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW plant.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to keep calm: "According to our information, it is a closed circle of people".
Infected and uninfected employees were separated on the farm and the site is now surrounded by a barrier fence.
The Greens and the SPD shared responsibility with the state government.
The two opposition factions accused Prime Minister Markus S ö der (CSU) and his cabinet of neglecting to control the housing of seasonal workers.
"This can take bitter revenge if such local infectious events take hold and regional lockdowns have to be ordered," said J ü rgen Mistol, the parliamentary managing director of the Greens.
The SPD takes a similar view: "After the Corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof slaughterhouse in mid-May, we have already called for a special control programme for farms with harvesters," said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
"From our point of view, hygiene conditions at the workplace and living conditions in particular must be tightly controlled.
That obviously did not happen. "
The outbreak came "with an announcement".
Underground station Aidenbachstra ß e: Dangerous dispute: 19-year-old falls into the track bed after Schubser
In a dispute between two youth groups at the subway station Aidenbachstra ß e, a 19-year-old fell through a shovel and slipped into the track bed.
Obersendling - On Friday, there was a dispute between two youth groups at the Aidenbachstra ß e underground station around 4.15 p.m.
A passer-by alerted the police, who approached with several stripes.
According to initial investigations, a 17-year-old from Munich pushed a 19-year-old to the ground.
The young man slipped over the platform edge and fell into the track bed.
People from the group of the 17-year-old helped the fallen man to climb off the track.
There was no danger of an approaching railway.
According to the police, there were further clashes between the two people.
The 17-year-old escaped from the scene, but his identity could be determined retrospectively.
Accompanied by his father, he went to Police Inspectorate 29.
The 17-year-old is under investigation for assault.
Report: Seehofer urges longer data retention
Data retention is currently suspended.
Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer, however, calls for an extension of the storage period according to a media report.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
According to a media report, Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer (CSU) is calling for an extended data retention period of six months instead of the planned ten weeks.
As the "Bild am Sonntag" reports, Seehofer Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht (SPD) asked in a letter for a quick change in the law.
Seehofer therefore wants to strengthen the measures against child abuse.
He believes it makes sense to "make urgently needed adjustments to the law now," the newspaper quotes from the letter.
Data retention is currently suspended.
A decision of the ECJ is expected.
Seehofer, however, wants the amendments in advance so that they can be applied immediately after a possible positive verdict, the report continues.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice told the newspaper that it would only be possible to meaningfully examine whether there was a need for legal adjustments once the courts had ruled.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer, together with the interior ministers of the L ä nder, had already advocated data retention in June.
NBA: Strip club trouble for Clippers star Lou Williams
Excitement in the NBA!
Lou Williams (33), professional basketball player for the Los Angeles Clippers, is said to have left the tournament grounds in Disney World in Orlando / Florida with permission for a funeral.
According to US media reports, he visited the strip club "Magic City" in Atlanta in the evening.
Williams, who is said to have admitted the visit according to ESPN, is back in Isloation, being tested daily on Covid-19.
His reason for visiting: Chicken Wings.
In February last year, "Sweet Lou", as he is called in the NBA, already expressed his love for these very wings.
The American wrote: "Magic City and Blue Flame (another strip club in Atlanta, D. R.) have the best wings in town".
NBA insider Shams Charania announced on Twitter on Sunday that the NBA has imposed a ten-day quarantine on Williams.
The Clippers star missed the first two official games after the test phase.
In Disney World, the NBA wants to finish the Corona season.
The top 22 teams are currently preparing for the season finale, which starts on Friday night.
S ö der comments on the corona situation after mass infection
Munich - Health Minister Melanie Huml (CSU) announced a test offensive for large farms on Sunday.
The press conference will be shown live on our homepage.
The case in Mamming in the district of Dingolfing-Landau has startled authorities and politicians.
Almost 500 harvesters from several countries are currently working on the large vegetable farm, and more than a third have been infected with the corona pathogen.
The farm is now under quarantine and is fenced off with a construction fence.
No one is allowed to leave the premises, food is delivered.
The authorities are now offering the 3,300 residents of the community free corona tests.
Since the harvesters had little contact with the local population, the district office has so far assumed that the infections have not spread beyond the farm.
"Remorse": Confession of the alleged arsonist of Nantes
"My client has been cooperative," lawyer Quentin Chabert told the newspaper.
The defense attorney added, "He deeply regrets the deeds, the confession was a liberation for him."
His mandate was "plagued by remorse and deeply affected by the extent of the destruction".
According to the prosecutor's office, if convicted, the man could face ten years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros.
The Gothic Cathedral of St. Peter and Paul in Nantes was severely damaged in a fire on Saturday night last week.
The fire broke out in three places far apart in the church.
Laboratory tests confirmed the suspicion of arson.
The suspect was arrested a few hours after the fire.
He was released after one day.
The man works as a volunteer for the diocese of Nantes and was responsible for the closure of the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
Since there was no trace of a violent intrusion into the church, he quickly came into the eye of the investigators.
Discussing the abolition of the 50 + 1 rule
Former DFB President Reinhard Grindel has recommended that consideration be given to abolishing the 50 + 1 rule.
"German football should at least discuss laying down conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates a fait accompli," Grindel told Bild am Sonntag.
He stressed: "For the clubs that are most likely to be dangerous in Bavaria and Dortmund, the 50 + 1 rules do not work anyway: See Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, there is no getting around the debate as to whether it is not advisable to facilitate the involvement of investors in clubs that want to break into this phalanx ".
However, he has doubts whether there is a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority participation, which is prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50 + 1 rule.
"It remains a legal risk to build investment fences around the Bundesliga as a business location in a European internal market," said Grindel.
The former head of the DFB sees the danger that "the attempts to ensure more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will ultimately only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but will not lead to more tension in the championship."
Even an equal distribution of TV money would not have a decisive effect.
"FC Bayern has a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund 500 million and RB Leipzig 300 million.
The differences between the first three clubs alone are immense.
The other 15 clubs have an average budget of 130 million, "explained the 58-year-old.
Looking back at the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Unfortunately, there have been people who have noticed this mistake and pierced the press instead of addressing me," Grindel said about the adoption of an expensive watch that led to his resignation in April 2019.
"That has already occupied me very much in human terms."
He had received the gift worth around 11,000 euros from a Ukrainian official.
"I committed a breach of compliance and it was right to draw the consequences," Grindel said.
"I handled the ominous watch gift completely transparently and innocently.
Many people in the DFB knew about it. "
He never "made a secret of the gift," the 58-year-old assured.
"This may be called naive, but this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption."
"Black Lives Matter": Injured and one dead

The target of the raid was someone else who didn't live there, and no drugs were found.
On Saturday, three people were injured when a member of a group calling itself an armed alliance of black Americans fired a shot.
According to NBC, they were taken to the hospital.
None of them were in mortal danger.
The police set up barricades because counter-demonstrators of a white militia had also formed.
The two groups ultimately did not meet.
In Austin, Texas, a person was shot and killed during a "Black Lives Matter" demonstration.
The police claimed to have arrested a suspect.
No further details of the circumstances of the attack have been provided.
Mayor Steve Adler, according to the New York Times, said he, like many in the city, was "heartbroken and stunned" by what had happened.
Demonstrators also clashed with the police in the American metropolis of Seattle on Saturday.
They set fire to construction vehicles in front of a youth prison, and the police used stun grenades and pepper spray.
According to the Seattle Times, 16 people were arrested for resisting police or assault.

According to the police, one of the demonstrators fired a gun and at least one person was taken to hospital injured.
In addition, windows were smashed in a court and a fire was set, according to the police.
Investigations have been launched.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historical costumes defy Corona
Although the big party was missing in the spa town, visitors and performers enjoyed the Rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, performers and organizers: The Rakoczy weekend without Rakoczy festival.
But: Even if the big party mile in the city center was missing, the crowds and program highlights such as Saale, Rakoczy-Ball or pageant, many got their money's worth with the Corona-compliant alternative program.
"I think we have succeeded in spreading Rakoczy flair," says spa director Sylvie Thormann.
The guests would have accepted it well.
In principle, one returns to the beginnings of the Rakoczy festival, when only the historical ones were in the focus of the festival.
Pleasant atmosphere
Vesna Konh ä user has been visiting Bad Kissingen with her husband for more than 25 years.
This time, too, in the Corona year.
The couple has made themselves comfortable at the Luitpold Casino, observes the historical while strolling and listens to the Cuban live music at the casino restaurant.
"I also find it quite pleasant," says Konh ä user.
She does not miss the crowds that otherwise belong to Rakoczy.
But it lacks the usual program highlights, above all Saale burns on Friday evening as well as the historic procession and the closing fireworks on Sunday evening.
"That's a pity.
The weather would have been great this year, "she says.
Rakoczy-equestrian tournament to take place again
For the performers of the historical spa guests, the alternative program sometimes meant more work.
For example, Christina Gold, who participates in the parade in a normal year and can be seen there on the carriage of the Kurgarten cafes.
This year she was walking around the city in costume on Saturdays and Sundays.
"That's more strenuous, otherwise we'll have it easier," she says.
The equestrian club had less to do, even if there were individual riders in the park.
"We very much hope that the equestrian quadrille can take place again next year," says Chairman Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that after a break of several years, a Rakoczy equestrian tournament will be held again in 2021.
28 Corona cases at Spanish second-division club Fuenlabrada
The Spanish football second division CF Fuenlabrada slides deeper and deeper into the crisis because of a corona outbreak.
Since the newcomer from the vicinity of Madrid flew to a game in the city of A Coruamonga on July 20, despite the first corona cases, one low blow follows the next.
By Sunday, 28 players or team members had been tested positive, and one was hospitalized, the club said.
Fuenlabrada from the city of the same name southwest of Madrid still had the chance to reach the promotion playoffs.
Now even the relegation to the B-group of the Second League threatens.
The match against Deportivo La Coruamonga last Monday was canceled at the last moment, the prosecutor's office is investigating a possible crime against public health, the supreme sports authority CSD is considering the forced relegation of the club.
Players and other team members are quarantined in a hotel.
"Until the sixth day of quarantine, they did not receive a fresh towel or gel," the sports newspaper "AS" wrote.
Photos show how players hung up underwear and club clothes in their rooms in the hotel to dry after they apparently had to wash them themselves.
The bed linen was not changed for five days.
Another problem is food.
It is neither good nor sufficient, wrote "AS".
The club management, on the other hand, said they were satisfied with the hotel.
The club's lawyer, Javier Tebas Llanas, rejected the accusation of deliberately endangering public health.
According to Javier Tebas, son of the President of the Spanish Primera Division, the Corona rules were not violated, as reported by the Europa Press news agency and the sports newspaper "Marca".
Before take-off, there had been four infected persons by 19 July, but they were all isolated and had not travelled with them.
Just before the flight on Monday to A Coruamonga, all players and team members had been tested again.
When the team was already in A Coruamonga, the corona test was positive for "five or six" other team members.
The game was cancelled 60 minutes before the kick-off, said Tebas Llanas.
Police must catch horses torn out of steam compartment

When the officers arrived, the horses were already back between the feeder and the village of Dampfach.
After the officers were able to gain the trust of the horses shortly before Dampfach, they had a rope put down in the patrol car.
Professional cyclist Tony Martin: Career continuation imaginable
Time trial specialist Tony Martin is thinking about continuing his career.
Frankfurt / Main - The seven-time world champion Tony Martin can well imagine continuing his cycling career.
"I am currently working with the team to define the framework conditions for how and in what form things could continue," said the 35-year-old to the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung".
Martin is currently employed by the Dutch team Jumbo-Visma and had considered ending his career after this year before the Corona break.
The negotiations with his team were also about the number of race days, he said.
Or about other problems that would plague him as a family man, Martin said.
He had previously stood up after a fall, and the first thought was: "Get back on the bike quickly.
Today, as the father of a little daughter, I think: What if ".
The professional cyclist admitted that there are aspects that he finds increasingly difficult to deal with.
"But it was good for me to remember what I enjoyed cycling and how much I enjoyed it, based on the Corona time."
The time trial specialist will return to the competition at the Tour de l'Ain (5 to 9 August).

The eight-time French champion will make a guest appearance at the Hesse, the former club of the Croat, on 1 August (6 p.m.).

Because of the coronavirus pandemic, the match is played without spectators.
"We are particularly looking forward to this game.
It's always nice to come to Frankfurt and meet friends, "Kovac explained.
The 48-year-old said that this was an interesting test in terms of sport.
Before joining FC Bayern Munich, Kovac had coached Hesse from 2016 to 2018 and led them to victory in the DFB Cup.
"A top-class opponent like Monaco is a good test for us with regard to the match against Basel.
Like everyone in Frankfurt, I'm looking forward to seeing Niko Kovac again, "said Eintracht coach Adi H ü tter.
The 50-year-old Austrian had succeeded the Croat at Eintracht.
In March, the Frankfurt team had lost the first round match against Basel in their own stadium 0-3.

Argentina rejects counteroffer from creditors
The new demands could not be met, the Ministry of Economy in Buenos Aires announced on Saturday.
"That would not only be irresponsible, but also unfair," a statement said.
"While 50 percent of children in Argentina live in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors".
The debt of the second largest economy in South America is no longer sustainable under current conditions.
Argentina is therefore asking its private creditors to forego some of their claims of around 66 billion US dollars (around 59 billion euros).
If no agreement is reached, the country is once again threatened with bankruptcy.
It would be the ninth default in Argentine history.
Most recently, lenders had called for higher interest rates on government bonds and changes to some contractual clauses.
However, the Argentine government is sticking to its last offer and is not prepared to make any further concessions.
Argentina is in a severe financial and economic crisis.
The inflation rate was recently more than 50 percent.
Experts expect economic power to decline by around ten percent in the current year.
By the end of May, Argentina had failed to settle interest claims amounting to $503 million and had slipped into a limited default.
Arrived at work - not yet privately
"Things are going super well" - this is the conclusion drawn by Dr. Stefanie Kramer after her first days at the notary's office in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything went very quickly: In mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she would succeed Lutz Feller at the Eggenfelden notary's office.
Just six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the doctor of law started work, and normal day-to-day business has long been running at full speed.
"Privately, however, I still have to arrive," she explains in an interview with the Rottaler Anzeiger and laughs.
Of course, the short lead time was not enough to completely relocate the center of life from Regensburg to Eggenfelden, reports the native of Dingolfing.
She and her husband, who works as a judge at the regional court in Regensburg, are currently looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city.
At least her husband was still able to apply for parental leave at short notice in order to be able to guarantee the care of the two daughters (3 gifted and 1 gifted).
In order not to have to commute every day from Regensburg, she also has an overnight stay with her parents in Dingolfing, explains the 39-year-old.
Growing up in the neighboring district, the city of Eggenfelden has of course long been known to her.
During visits on site with her family in recent months, she once again stated: "Eggenfelden is a really nice small town".
She was all the more pleased that she had won the competition for the vacancy.
Her native Lower Bavaria also plays a central role in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's professional career: After studying law in Passau, she completed her legal clerkship and the second state examination in Regensburg.
After several positions as a notary assessor, including in Rehau and Hof in Upper Franconia, Babenhausen im Unterallg ä u and Regensburg - during which time she also "incidentally" shouldered her doctorate in labour law - she took up her first position as a notary in Rotthalm ü nster in the district of Passau in 2012.
In 2016, she took parental leave and finally moved to Regensburg.
Since then, she has taken over representation services in various notarial offices.
When the position in Eggenfelden was advertised due to the approaching retirement of Lutz Feller, she saw the right time for a full return to work, explains the 39-year-old.
Dr. Stefanie Kramer has taken over the entire team of her predecessor, who will take over the holiday representation in the notary's office in the future - and immediately has praise for the team of the law firm: "Things are going super well!"
The fact that she can rely on well-rehearsed processes makes it easier for her to take care of the impending relocation of the private center of life.
She has already contacted a local institution regarding kindergarten and nursery places.
And if everything works out as desired, she hopes to be able to pursue her hobby here soon - and get to know the most beautiful jogging routes in the Rottal.
BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be 20 percent full at the start of the season in the event of a fan return.
"Due to the distance regulation, which must be complied with, we are currently planning with 12,000 to 15,000 spectators," Borussia Dortmund's managing director Carsten Cramer told the "Tagesspiegel".
Normally, the arena in the district city holds a little more than 81,000 spectators at Bundesliga games.
In the ghost games caused by the Corona pandemic last season, BVB lost around four million euros per game.
Cramer, who is responsible for marketing, digitisation and internationalisation at BVB, hopes that in addition to the normal spectator seats, some of the approximately 4,000 seats in the hospitality sector can also be opened again: "It is of course a blow to the office if these revenues completely disappear".
In view of the ongoing corona crisis, everyone is currently "well advised to take a stable page length for the time being".
"If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people are in short-time work in Germany alone, then the need for entertainment is limited," Cramer explained.
The head of marketing in Dortmund praised the BVB professionals for their partial salary waiver, which is intended to help overcome the crisis: "Of course, the players know that their salary waiver has a different effect than if we put 100 people who work in merchandising on short-time work."
Tiny miracles: Early start into life with a few hundred grams
Hardly heavier than a packer of butter, just three tablespoons of blood in his entire body: That was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The boy is one of about 400 premature babies who are cared for annually at the Grazer Kinderklinik.
A quarter of them weigh less than 1,500 grams, a few - like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael - are extremely lightweight with less than a kilogram of birth weight.
They are so small and born so early that neither lungs, nor intestines, nor muscles are fully developed.
Their skin is sometimes so tender that they could injure the electrodes of an ECG.
And they are so tiny that they sometimes wear doll clothes and mini diapers specially made for them.
But not so small that they wouldn't be in the voice - "and how", Berndt Urlesberger smiles.
"Even if they don't scream quite as loudly as big babies, of course."
When the whiteboard becomes a stage
Despite Corona theater in the classroom: The whiteboard as a stage experienced shortly before the start of the holiday the 9th grades of the Sankt-Jakobus-Gymnasium in Abtsgm ü nd.
Actress Julia Sylvester from the Theater der Stadt Aalen presented the production "Das Heimatkleid" to the students - via video.
Afterwards, the pupils were able to exchange views on the play and the performance with the actress and director Winfried Tobias via Skype.
The idea for the performance format was born from the current Corona situation.
Teacher Teresa Nar was pleased about the enrichment of the lessons.
Even if all participants agreed at the end that the direct encounter in the theater and stage space would offer additional stimuli, you can also see the potential for contact with the schools in the theater.
"If we continue to improve the technical framework, it could be an interesting addition to the running of the game," said director Winfried Tobias.
First round drawn: TSV 1860 would face Eintracht Frankfurt in the DFB-Pokal
Should TSV 1860 qualify for the DFB-Pokal, the Lions will face Eintracht Frankfurt in the first round.
This resulted in the draw on Sunday.
Munich - Sixty possible opponents in the first round of the DFB-Pokal have been determined.
The Lions would face Eintracht Frankfurt if they qualified successfully.
This resulted in the draw on Sunday evening in the ARD sports show.
Due to the Corona pandemic, the field is not yet complete, so placeholders were used in the draw.
Due to the voluntary waiver of semi-final opponents FC Memmingen, TSV 1860 is already in the final of the Bavarian Toto Cup (4 or 5 September).
There the lions meet either the W ü rzburg Kickers or Viktoria Aschaffenburg.
Should W ü rzburg reach the final, sixty would already be qualified for the first round of the DFB-Pokal.
Otherwise, the Giesinger would have to prevail in the final against Regionalligist Aschaffenburg.
The first round of the DFB-Pokal will be played between 11 and 14 September, one week before the start of the third division.

She died of natural causes in Paris on Sunday at the age of 104, confirmed her spokeswoman for the German Press Agency.
De Havilland was best known for her role as Melanie Hamilton in the southern epic Gone with the Wind (1939).
Born in Tokyo to British parents, Olivia de Havilland moved to California as an infant.
The Austrian playwright Max Reinhardt discovered the 19-year-old in the role of Hermia in Shakespeare's "Midsummer Night's Dream".
The film studio Warner Brothers signed her to a seven-year contract and released her alongside Eroll Flynn.
She made eight films with the heartbreaker.

Kalbitz expulsion from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "fig leaf"
The expulsion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is in the view of the FDP only a "fig leaf" and does not change the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the extreme right in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the tip of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD, "said FDP interior politician Benjamin Strasser to the news agency dpa in Berlin.
The Federal Arbitration Court of the AfD had confirmed on Saturday in Stuttgart after several hours of hearing the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Executive Board had decided by a majority in May.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD parliamentary group in the Brandenburg state parliament.
"If the AfD really wanted to consistently remove right-wing extremists from their party, officials like Bj ö rn H ö cke and his supporters would have been expelled long ago," Strasser said.
"However, there is no political will in the AfD because right-wing extremism is now part of the party."
Similarly, CSU General Secretary Markus Blume said: "The fact that Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded says nothing and does not change anything," he told the "Welt am Sonntag".
"It speaks volumes how many frenetic supporters a right-wing extremist in the middle of the AfD still has."
Blume assumes that the AfD will land below five percent in future elections.
"The days of the AfD in the parliaments are numbered".
Kalbitz was one of the spokesmen of the now officially dissolved "wing" around the Thuringian AfD state and parliamentary group chairman Bj ö rn H ö cke; the Verfassungsschutz classifies the coronation as a "secured right-wing extremist aspiration".
In May, the AfD federal executive had thrown Kalbitz out of the party.
As a reason, he stated that Kalbitz had not stated an earlier membership in the now banned right-wing extremist "Heimattreue Deutsche Jugend" (HDJ) and the Republicans when he joined the party.
Kalbitz denies membership in the HDJ.
The chairman of the Left faction in the Brandenburg state parliament, Sebastian Walter, also stressed that the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court did not change the character of the AfD: "The wolf has only eaten chalk.
The AfD remains a far-right party, with or without Kalbitz. "
Neither the federal party nor the right wing would be weakened by this decision.
"The maneuver of the mutineers is transparent.
They want to avoid further observation by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution and try to get through under the radar, "said Walter.
"The AfD can't get rid of the ghosts they called.
Expulsion does not change anything, "said Brandenburg SPD General Secretary Erik Stohn, commenting on the decision in the Kalbitz case.
"Here the AfD regional association and the fraction held to their right-wing leader until today".
The legal dispute over Kalbitz's membership in the AfD will continue.
He announced on Saturday that he would now take civil action against the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court.
North Sea wind farms deliver a good 21 percent more electricity
The wind power plants on the German North Sea fed 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity into the grid in the first six months of the year.
This is a good 21 percent more than in the same period of the previous year, said the network operator Tennet in Bayreuth.
TenneT is responsible for the transmission of the North Sea electricity to the mainland and the transmission through the German power grid.
The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of Tennet's grid area, have fed in a further 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
Overall, wind power from the North Sea and the Baltic Sea will reach 13.73 TWh, compared to a good 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind harvest at sea thus accounts for almost 19 percent of total wind power in Germany, which is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms ensure higher generation capacities
In addition to wind conditions, the increased contribution of offshore wind energy results from higher generation capacities, because new wind farms have been connected to the grid in the past twelve months.
If the 1270 wind power plants in the North Sea were all running at full power at the same time, they could generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient; according to Tennet, it is 7.1 gigawatts.
It is expected to increase to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea by 2030.
"In Germany and the Netherlands, we are investing 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore grid connections by then," said Tim Meyerj ü rgens, Managing Director of Tennet.
In reality, even at sea, wind farms are not able to exploit their capacity, but reach about 40 percent.
The record day so far this year is 2 January, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind turbines produce around 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, which corresponds to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could supply almost seven million households with electricity.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition of the Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the Gm ü nder Kunstverein.
It was almost a small jubilee celebration for the 130th anniversary.
Birthday of the Gm ü nder Kunstverein: The opening of the exhibition "Skirmish" with works by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold broke the usual framework after the Corona break.
Many more art lovers than usual followed the dialogue between the artist and the chairman of the Kunstverein, Professor Dr. Klaus Ripper.
The musical equivalent was provided by the band "Defenders of the Universe" on the southern Kornhausplatz.
North of the gallery the association "Sandtogether" was involved.
Freital: Windbergfest cancelled because of Corona
The Windbergfest will not take place this year.
The city of Freital has cancelled the three-day festival planned for September.
In other years, more than 30,000 people had attended this city festival.
"We truly did not make this decision easy for ourselves and - aware of how difficult it is economically for those involved - hoped until the last minute," said Lord Mayor Uwe Rumberg (non-partisan).
"But ultimately we are responsible for the health of many thousands of people here as organizers."
If tens of thousands had flocked to the festival grounds and the marquee, minimum distances, hygiene regulations and contact tracking in accordance with the current Corona Protection Regulation could not have been observed.
Or the restrictions would have been so strong that there wouldn't have been much left of a folk festival.
In addition, the organisational and monitoring effort would increase disproportionately.
Rumberg consoled for next year.
The city of Freital will then celebrate its 100th anniversary with the Winterberg Festival from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the Day of the Saxons from 10 to 12 September 2021.
Dressage Olympic Champion Werth in Achleiten not to beat
Achleiten - The six-time Olympic champion Isabell Werth was the outstanding rider at the dressage tournament in Achleiten, Austria.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg scored four victories in four starts this weekend.
After winning one Grand Prix each with Weihegold and Quantaz, she was unbeatable in the Grand Prix Special and in the Freestyle on Sunday.
On the 15-year-old mare Weihegold Werth clearly prevailed against the Austrian Victoria Max-Theurer on Abegglen in the Special on Sunday.
Also in the freestyle on Saturday, the German was clearly ahead of her 34-year-old student Victoria Max-Theurer.
Werth's winning horse Quantaz belongs to Max-Theurer.
The most successful dressage rider in the world is to establish the ten-year-old stallion in the Grand Prix.
For Quantaz it was the first freestyle ever.
Already at the first tournament in Achleiten three weeks ago Werth had won all four important tests.
The last of the three international tournaments is scheduled for 14 to 16 August.
More air traffic controllers in Worms in future
The University of Applied Sciences in Worms continues to take to the skies: DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung is donating a professorship for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the university and DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially concluded for three years and will start in 2021.
The professorship gives students the opportunity to start their studies not only in the summer semester, but also in the winter semester.
This means that twice as many students can be trained as before.
At the same time, capacities at both the university and the DFS Air Traffic Control Academy are utilised equally.
DFS will advise the university on setting up and filling the professorship.
Represented at the university since 2019
Since the summer semester of 2019, the first students have been enrolled in the Air Traffic Management program as part of their training as air traffic controllers at Worms University of Applied Sciences.
Nine students have already started this year.
So far, DFS 'experience has been very positive, and the students' performance has been outstanding.
The combination of studies and pilot training contributes significantly to further increasing the attractiveness of the pilot profession.
"In these times, funding is not easy for us economically.
However, we firmly expect air traffic to recover and grow again in the long term.
In order to continue to fulfil our legal mandate, we need highly qualified personnel, "says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, Chairman and CEO of DFS, at the signing of the contract.
"For DFS, the endowed professorship is a future-proof investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, interdisciplinary knowledge base in the long term.
We are therefore continuing our good cooperation with the university and at the same time underpinning our attractiveness as an employer. "
Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of the University of Applied Sciences Worms, also underlines this: "The endowed professorship forms an important bridge between science and business.
With it, we would like to build on the existing cooperation with DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual bachelor's degree programme in Air Traffic Management. "
The trust placed in Deutsche Flugsicherung is both a motivation and an obligation for the University of Applied Sciences Worms to further expand its teaching and research expertise in the future fields of air traffic.
In its commitment to the air traffic controllers of tomorrow, the university can set very special highlights and innovative focal points for its students with the first endowed professorship for a dual course of study.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary at the Ministry of Science, Continuing Education and Culture, emphasises: "With its focus on air transport, the University of Applied Sciences Worms has a unique selling point in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Today's signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the profile of the university. "
Rescue helicopter lands on the A 45
The A 45 motorway towards Aschaffenburg was fully closed for about 30 minutes on Saturday afternoon, as the rescue helicopter was in use after a traffic accident.
A 76-year-old drove a Ford around 12.40 pm in the exit Alzenau-Mitte in the curve straight ahead and landed at the guardrail.
The crash triggered the front airbags, the driver suffered minor injuries in the face and had to be taken to a hospital for treatment.
The injuries of the 72-year-old passenger were treated by the emergency doctor and the patient was then flown to a hospital by rescue helicopter.
At present, however, the police assume that there is no mortal danger.
The damaged vehicle, which was damaged by about 2000 euros, had to be towed away.
Heil wants to examine other industries after meat industry
The Corona crisis brought the situation in parts of the meat industry back to light.
Legislative tightening is imminent.
But are they rightful - and will they remain so
Federal Minister of Labour Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to review other sectors in accordance with the strict regulations now planned against maladministration in the meat industry.
"We will look at industry by industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective industry if necessary," said Heil of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany's employers are already warning against restricting work contracts in general.
After the massive corona outbreak at the meat giant T ö nnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet wants to pass a law of salvation this Wednesday.
Large slaughterhouses should no longer be allowed to employ external personnel for slaughter, cutting and meat processing.
For this purpose, the use of contract workers and temporary workers is to be prohibited there.
Employer President Ingo Kramer told the dpa: "Stay away from a general restriction of work contracts and hiring workers, if you do not want to completely strangle the economy".
Work contracts, for example, are mandatory for large areas of the trade, the construction industry and plant construction as the basis for their added value at the customer.
"The misdeeds of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument".
Heil assured: "My goal is not to ban work contracts everywhere in the German economy".
Work contracts are useful.
"When an industrial company commissions a tradesman to install a safety system, it is a normal contract."
The German meat industry considers a ban on work contracts and temporary agency work to be unconstitutional in its sector alone.
It is not possible to explain why different labour laws should apply to portioning and packaging cheese in the future than to sausages, according to a statement on the draft law, as reported by the "Neue Osnabr ü cker Zeitung" (Saturday).
A ban would therefore increase the consumer price by 10 to 20 percent per kilo and product.
According to the results of an audit by the NRW Occupational Safety and Health Administration, many Eastern European employees from work contract companies worked 16 hours a day in the industry.
They often had no break.
Wages were withheld for protective equipment or rent.
It was also noted that the situation with regard to the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Heil said that a relatively harsh law had already come into force for the meat industry in 2017.
However, these were circumvented by "tricky constructions".
"Now we have to clean up fundamentally".
The politician announced: "In the Occupational Safety and Health Act, which we want to pass in the cabinet at the end of July, there are also measures that do not only affect the meat industry - for example, higher inspection rates for occupational safety or clear criteria for community accommodation".
The draft submitted to the DPA includes amendments to the Act on the Protection of Workers' Rights in the Meat Industry and the Occupational Safety and Health Act.
Brandenburg's Consumer Protection Minister Ursula Nonnemacher (Greens) believes that more intensive controls are necessary.
"I would like us to be able to carry out even more controls in many areas of supervision: Food controls, animal welfare, everything possible, including animal transport, for example," said Nonnemacher on Sunday in the RBB programme "Brandenburg aktuell".
However, more staff positions are also needed for more controls.
Three dead in crash of ultralight aircraft in Germany
According to the police, three people died in the crash of an ultralight aircraft on an apartment building in Wesel in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia.
One child was slightly injured.
Two other people were injured in the accident, said a spokesman for the district control center Wesel.
According to the police, a parachute was found at the scene of the accident.
The "Rheinische Post" reported, citing eyewitnesses, that before the crash the plane had collided with a hot air balloon.
The house is a single or two-family house.
Further details were not disclosed at first.
Eviction of Frankfurt Opera Square proceeded peacefully
One week after the riots in Frankfurt, the evacuation of the Opernplatz took place peacefully overnight.
At last there were several dozen people on the square, but they left before the curfew at 1 o'clock.
The police had been in action since the early evening with numerous officers, and a larger police contingent could be seen throughout the city.
This weekend, for the first time since midnight, there was a ban on entering the Opernplatz, where riots had taken place a week ago.
Policemen had been attacked with bottles from the crowd of celebrities.
At least five officers were injured after police submissions, and several police vehicles were damaged.
The night to Saturday was also quiet.
Car overturns: Young woman seriously injured in accident on Bundesstra ß e 83 near Hofgeismar
In an accident between Sch ö neberg and H ü mme, a 21-year-old suffered serious injuries on Sunday at around 1: 25 p.m.
She was taken to the Kassel hospital.
The fire brigade used thermal imaging cameras to search for potential passengers.
According to the police, the woman was on the way to her place of residence H ü mme on Bundesstra ß e 83 when her car came off the road for an unexplained reason and flipped over several times.
In order to save the victims, the fire brigade had to clear the roof of the car.
Since it was unclear whether there was anyone else in the vehicle, the adjacent corn field was scanned by the rotary ladder with a thermal imager.
The drone squadron from Warburg, which also works with thermal imaging cameras, was also ordered to search for people.
However, the volunteers did not find anyone between the tall corn plants.
The seriously injured were taken by ambulance to the Kassel hospital for further treatment.
Almost 50 firefighters from the Hofgeismar, H ü mme and Sch ö neberg fire brigades were on site.
The highway was closed for two hours due to the accident.
Juventus Turin champion in Italy
Turin - After a redeeming goal by Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin has secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in a row.
The team around the five-time world footballer made the 36th Scudetto in the club's history perfect with a 2-0 (1-0) on Sunday evening in the home game against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo scored 1-0 before half time.
With 83 points, Turin, which competed without the last long-injured former international Sami Khedira, can no longer be ousted from first place two days before the end of the season of Serie A.
The runner-up Inter Milan is seven points behind.
Juventus was harmless despite optical superiority in the first half, then Ronaldo hit after a free-kick variant with the last action.
The 35-year-old exploited a match of Miralem Pjanic directly from the penalty box with a flat shot (45. + 7).
Against the now more offensive guests Ronaldo was also involved in the 2-0, after his shot Federico Bernardeschi (67.) dusted off.
This ensured the lackluster but decisive success.
The foul-penalty shot to the bar in the 89th minute probably only really annoyed Ronaldo himself with regard to the goalscorer rating.
"It's complicated to stay at ball level mentally and physically for 90 minutes.
The games are strange, and the momentum is changing very slightly, "explained coach Maurizio Sarri even after the 1-2 at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Above all, the mental exhaustion of his players is great, said the Juve coach.
Because of the defeat, the Turinese had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
In the end, Juve's reassuring lead at the top of the standings was mainly due to the weakness of the competitors.
In the eleven games before the game on Sunday, the Sarri-team had only managed five victories.
Whether Ronaldo will also become the top scorer is questionable.
While the Portuguese superstar has scored 31 goals so far, the former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile has already scored 34 goals after his three-pack in the 5-1 (1-1) of the fourth-placed Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the title win of FC Bayern.
The record in Italy is held by the current Juve pro Gonzalo Higuav ä hnnen.
The Argentine scored 36 goals for SSC Naples in the 2015 / 2016 season.
In August, the "old lady" of Italian football is waiting for the next chance to win the title.
Juventus is in the round of 16 of the Champions League, but will have to make up for a 0-1 defeat against Olympique Lyon on 7 August to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next knockout round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would wait as opponents.
Baden-W ü rttemberg: Over 250 illegal car races recorded
Stuttgart - Despite all the threats of punishment and court judgments, motorists continue to accelerate in countless illegal races on the roads of Baden-W ü rttemberg: Last year and the first four months of this year, the police in the southwest have already registered more than 250 illegal car races.
There are no comparative figures for the years before, but the rapists are increasingly making work of the judicial authorities: In 2018, a total of 155 investigations were conducted at the public prosecutors' offices between Constance and Mannheim for illegal races, one year later there were already 252 and in the current year until the beginning of June already 151.
The races were less about organized events, as can be seen from the response of the Interior Ministry to a request of the state parliament SPD.
In most cases, the drivers spontaneously competed against each other or fled from the police - this is also reported as an illegal race.
At the wheel were mainly German men between the ages of 18 and 60.
113 fines - 15 times imprisonment
Only in comparatively few cases are the racers caught and also asked to pay: According to the Interior Ministry, a total of 113 fines have been imposed since 2018 and 15 prison sentences have been pronounced.
However, there is no evidence that the number of illegal car races is actually increasing.
Rather, other motorists reacted more sensitively than before because of the many tragic accidents and trials in recent years and reported more frequently, a ministry spokesman said.
The Autobahn 8 is particularly popular with racers. Again and again, motorists slow down the traffic there in order to make room for themselves and to use the free track for a race.
Last August, a dozen drivers were caught near Kirchheim unter Teck, three months earlier there were even 18 drivers on the A8 near Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular "racetrack"
On the A81, the police register even more races than on any other federal highway.
A speed limit is used there to try to slow down the racers on the particularly affected section between Engen and Geisingen.
The mostly high-priced and pimped up sports and luxury cars often have Swiss license plates, because the drivers evade because of the high penalties for driving too fast and car racing in the neighboring country to the lawn to Germany.
For the SPD, the speed limit must not be reduced to a few routes: "With a general speed limit of 130 kilometers per hour, we would get rid of this problem on motorways," says Martin Rivoir, the transport expert of the SPD parliamentary group.
"The inhibition threshold for speedsters would be significantly higher if you were not allowed to travel legally here and there at 200 kilometers per hour or more."
Rivoir thinks less of education or image campaigns: "Anyone who defies all rules in this way and puts not only their own lives but also the lives of other road users at risk is hardly reachable with reason."
ADAC calls for stronger police crackdown
However, this is not enough for the ADAC: "We assume that speeders will not be deterred by the speed limits," says Holger Bach, Head of the Transport and Environment Department at the ADAC W ü rttemberg.
It calls for additional and tougher controls on the routes concerned.
Not infrequently, the high-speed test of strength becomes painful and serious: Since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people have died in the races nationwide, two of them uninvolved in a nightly crash in Stuttgart's city center and one in Gerlingen.
Two young men are said to have competed in a car race there in November.
One of the vehicles came off the road, crashed into a garden wall and remained on the side, the 18-year-old passenger died.
21 other people were injured in the races over the past two years.
In the opinion of Interior Minister Thomas Strobl, however, harsher penalties are not necessary: "There is no need for legislative action to impose tougher sanctions on illegal motor vehicle races," says the Interior Ministry's paper.
Blue light of 23 July: Thirsty burglar steals drinks from snack bar
Rohrdorf: A man broke into a snack bar in Rohrdorf (Calw district) on Thursday and stole drinks and cash.
A witness heard noises in the valley street around 3.40 a.m. and ran towards the snack bar.
There he noticed a man who was serving himself with drinks at the fridge and then left the snack bar through a previously smashed entrance door.
The perpetrator fled towards the meadows behind the snack bar.
According to the police, the burglar also used a cash register and stole cash in the low three-digit range.
The suspect is described as follows: He is about 1.75 to 1.80 meters tall and of strong stature.
In fact, he wore a black hoodie, black trousers and light shoes.
Further evidence is received by the police.
Ackermann sprints to victory on final stage at Sibiu Tour
Professional cyclist Pascal Ackermann has won his second day on the final stage of the 10th Sibiu Tour.
The 26-year-old Palatine from Team Bora-hansgrohe won the 109-kilometre section with start and finish in Sibiu in the mass sprint, after having already won a stage on Saturday.
It was the third and fourth seasons of the franchise.
In the overall classification, his Austrian teammate Gregor M ü hlberger prevailed.
The 26-year-old had confidently won the mountain time trial in the morning and thus took the lead in the classification.
Only 104 riders competed in the final stage that evening.
No less than 18 starters had fallen victim to the time limit in the mountain time trial.
"I'm really happy to start the new season with a win," Ackermann explained after his success on Saturday.
"The sprint was really hectic," said the 26-year-old.
With 300 meters to go, he simply put on his sprint, "and it worked perfectly."
In accordance with the rules of the UCI, a corona test was carried out on all participants and their companions six days before the start of the race.
During the entire tour, drivers and attendants were separated from the organising team and the media in insulated hygiene bubbles.
Spectators at the start and finish were not allowed.
Control center gave instructions for lay resuscitation
D ü sseldorf - Tragic accident on Sunday afternoon in D ü sseldorf-Garath.
In an apartment building, a child (4) suddenly lay lifeless in the water while bathing.
According to the fire brigade, the emergency call arrived shortly before 13: 00.
"A dispatcher immediately gave instructions for lay resuscitation," said a fire brigade spokesman to BILD.
The rescuers arrived a little later and took over the resuscitation measures.
The child in mortal danger was transported to the university hospital under resuscitation.
Why it crashed is unclear.
The police have routinely started investigating the accident.
The fire brigade spokesman: "We assume a tragic accident in the apartment".
Nuremberg: Unauthorized tuning meeting - police intervene, 700 vehicles and about 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and at times more than 1000 people took part in a "tuning meeting" on Saturday night in the parking lot of a furniture store.
The police implemented their announcement to intensify their control of such events.
A major tuning meeting took place on Saturday evening (25 July 2020) in Nuremberg's S ü dstadt district.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the police of Middle Franconia, an increased number of vehicles in the area of a large car park in Ingolst ä dter Stra ß e was detected by the Nuremberg traffic police around 10.30 pm.
The police then carried out a large number of vehicle inspections there.
Only recently, the police had announced that they wanted to step up their action against so-called autoposers.
Illegal tuning meeting in Nuremberg: Only a small part of the "scene"
The officers numbered a good 700 vehicles and about 1100 people at the top, according to the police.
However, only a small part of those present can be attributed to the "autoposer" and tuning scene.
Apparently, the majority of the relevant scene complied with the police's appeal.
On the basis of the vehicles and people on site, it can be assumed that these were mainly onlookers.
In addition, the majority of those present adhered to the applicable infection protection regulations, in particular the observance of the minimum distance and the wearing of a mouth-nose protection.
The control measures carried out on site were completed at around 1: 00 a.m.
In total, the officials noticed such structural changes in 10 vehicles that the operating license had expired.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No car racing
There were no illegal car races.
"The police headquarters in Middle Franconia will continue to keep an eye on what is happening and will continue to carry out enhanced control measures, also in connection with the emergence of onlookers," it said.
The agency News5 spoke with J ü rgen Schr ö dinger from the towing company involved: "They all have beautiful rims, we must not scratch them," says Schr ö dinger.
Special tapes would be used for this purpose.
Also because the cars are wider, the company must take care not to cause any damage.
"After all, the young people should get their cars back unscathed."
Employment Agency figures: 900 suspected cases of abuse in short-time work
Berlin - The Federal Employment Agency (BA) claims to be investigating around 900 suspected cases of abuse of short-time pay.
"With more than 880,000 companies reporting short-time work, this is extremely low," said Daniel Terzenbach, the Executive Board member responsible for operations, to the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung".
When, at the beginning of the Corona crisis, a large number of companies suddenly applied for short-time work, the BA had to react quickly.
The examination usually takes up to three weeks.
"We didn't have that much time in this hot phase.
We will look all the more closely at the final accounts.
There will certainly be more to come.
We are not naive and we have perseverance. "
Evidence of abuse would often come from the employees or trade unions concerned.
In addition, the BA uses analysis software to detect abuse patterns.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is preparing for a possible wave of insolvency in the autumn.
"Will there be significantly more insolvencies than in the previous year
The assessments differ, but we are preparing ourselves in the event of a case and are already training our employees in the employment agencies to process applications for insolvency money. "
The figures are still inconspicuous, said Terzenbach.
World Heritage in Potsdam: Party dissolved in the New Garden
Potsdam - On Friday evening, about 40 young people celebrated a party in the New Garden.
The collection was dissolved at 8.48 pm by the district drivers of the Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation (SPSG), the foundation announced on PNN request.
The young people then left the park.
On Saturday evening, some young people would have played rugby in the New Garden.
The meadow was cleared by district drivers, said SPSG spokesman Frank Kallensee on Sunday.
Again and again there are illegal celebrations in the parks
In the parks of the foundation, there are always accumulations in which the distance and hygiene rules Covid-19 are not observed.
At the end of June there was a celebration with about 300 people in the Babelsberg Park, a week later about 150 people celebrated in the New Garden.
Even without a corona ordinance, the parks are closed at nightfall.
Camping on the meadows is prohibited according to the park regulations, there are only a few exceptions.
The foundation has been complaining for some time that visitors are leaving more and more garbage and destroying protected biotopes.
Meanwhile, illegal park parties in Berlin have taken on a different dimension.
In the Hasenheide in the district of Neuk ö lln 5000 people celebrated an illegal techno party on Sunday night.
The event was disbanded by the police.
Austria: Mass tests after Corona outbreak in tourist resort
Authorities have responded to a corona outbreak in the popular Upper Austrian tourist resort of St. Wolfgang with hundreds of tests.
The number of confirmed cases rose to 48, as reported by the state authorities in Linz.
More than 100 results were still outstanding in the evening.
According to this, many of the infected are young interns in tourism companies, but at least one holiday guest was tested positive.
Residents, guests and tourism staff were asked to stay in their accommodation on Saturday evening.
The curfew was set at 23: 00.
"There are cancellations and cancellations here and there" of bookings, said the head of the tourism association Wolfgangsee, Hans Wieser, the dpa.
Some guests also left prematurely.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist resort in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 overnight stays last year.
In a normal season, about a third of the guests are Germans.
On Friday, the first infections had become public knowledge.
The head of the district authority, Alois Lanz, defended the behaviour of the interns on Saturday, who had celebrated in several restaurants and may have contracted the disease there.
"We all enjoyed doing that in our youth," he told the radio station Ö 1.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The tourism association launched an information campaign to raise awareness among young employees of the dangers of Covid-19.
Starting on Saturday, hundreds of employees, holidaymakers and locals were tested.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang from 15 July were contacted.
The outbreak evokes memories of the Austrian ski and party resort of Ischgl in Tyrol, which in the early phase of the pandemic was a center of corona spread throughout Europe.
In total, more than 1,500 people in Austria are currently infected with the virus.
The focal points of the new infections are Vienna and Upper Austria.
Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualified for Champions League
London (AP) - Record English football champion Manchester United returns to the Champions League after a year's absence.
The Red Devils finished third in the Premier League with a 2-0 win over Leicester City.
The Foxes now have to settle for the Europa League, because Chelsea FC was still passing by and also qualified for the premier league in fourth place.
In the fight against relegation, Aston Villa was able to cheer.
Manchester United took the lead with a penalty kick from Bruno Fernandes (71st minute).
After a red card for Leicester City in extra time, Jesse Lingard (90. + 8) scored the final score.
Chelsea, Bayern's opponent in the Champions League round of 16, won 2-0 (2-0) against Wolverhampton Wanderers thanks to Mason Mount (45th + 1) and Olivier Giroud (45th + 4).
"That means a lot to me," said coach Frank Lampard, who is also in the FA Cup final against Arsenal in his first season as Chelsea coach.
Chelsea's win over Wolverhampton also benefited Tottenham Hotspur, who passed the Wolves 1-1 (1-0) at Crystal Palace and finished sixth in the Europa League.
Aston Villa won the long-distance duel with Watford and Bournemouth, but had to tremble for a long time for West Ham United.
The late lead of Jack Grealish (84th) was immediately compensated by Andrei Yarmolenko (85th).
Watford lost 2-3 (1-3) at Arsenal.
The club, which fired three coaches in the season, is relegated after five years in the first division.
Just like Bournemouth, which could not save itself by a 3: 1 (2: 1) at Everton.
In the end, one point was missing.
Liverpool, who have been the English champions since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3-1 (1: 1) victory at Newcastle United.
99 points is the highest score the Reds have ever scored in a football season.
Coach J ü rgen Klopp and his team narrowly missed the point record in English football.
Manchester City holds the record with 100 points in the 2017 / 18 season.
After the Newcastle lead in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38.), Divock Origi (59.) and Sadio Mann (89.) turned the game on Sunday for Liverpool.
"It was an exceptional season for this wonderful club," said goalscorer van Dijk after the match, "which should spur us on to defend the title.
It will be difficult. "
In the end, the Premier League bosses should also be satisfied.
Due to the Coronavirus crisis, football operations in England were suspended from 13 March to 17 June.
In the meantime, there were even discussions about a premature termination or a staging of the remaining games on neutral ground.
In the end, however, the season could be played without special incidents - but as in Germany without spectators in the stadiums.
Arrests and violence at demonstrations against Netanyahu
The protests in Israel against Prime Minister Netanyahu are becoming increasingly violent.
During the night there were violent clashes.
On the night of Sunday, the Israeli police violently attacked participants in a demonstration against the right-wing conservative Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu.
Twelve people were arrested for participating in riots, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said.
Among other things, the police used water cannons to disperse the rally.
According to media reports, a total of around 6,000 people gathered near Netanyahu's office on Saturday evening.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu's handling of the Corona crisis.
The protesters beat drums, blew horns and called on Netanyahu to resign.
Participants in a counter-demonstration supporting Netanyahu were also arrested, the news site "ynet" reported.
People also demonstrated in many other places in Israel, including in front of the head of government's private villa in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
According to police reports, a man was arrested near Tel Aviv on suspicion of spraying pepper spray from a moving car on demonstrators on the roadside.
Another man was arrested after a stabbing attack on a demonstrator in the south of the country.
The demonstrator was slightly injured in the neck.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv there have recently been several demonstrations against Netanyahu.
The rallies accompany the corruption process against the head of government.
Most recently, Netanyahu has also been criticized for his handling of the Corona crisis.
Among other things, he is accused of premature easing and a lack of preparation for a second corona wave.
The Corona crisis has hit the country's economy hard.
The most recent unemployment rate was more than 20 percent.
The number of new coronavirus infections in Israel has recently risen to record levels.
Accident near Ahlen (NRW) - Transporter crashes on car - nine injured - Ruhr - Bild. De EN
Ahlen - A rear-end collision on Saturday afternoon on the B58 near Ahlen caused nine minor injuries.
A female driver was driving with her two children (3, 5) in the direction of Beckum.
The police: "Presumably she had suddenly slowed down because she wanted to turn."
The driver of a Mercedes van driving behind her must have seen this too late.
He crashed into the back of the car.
Three passengers in the car and six in the van were slightly injured in the accident.
Several ambulances took her to a nearby hospital.
North Korea seals off border town after Corona suspected case
North Korea has so far seen its own measures to ward off the coronavirus as a "shining success".
The country is now reporting a suspected case for the first time.
Because of a first official Corona suspicion in the country, North Korea has completely sealed off a large city for fear of a catastrophe.
Despite the most stringent epidemiological defenses in the past six months, "the malignant virus may have been introduced into the country," the state media reported.
A state of emergency has been declared for the region around the border town of Kaesong.
The Communist leadership declared the highest level of alarm.
If confirmed, it would be the first official case of infection with Sars-CoV-2 in the isolated country.
North Korea has not yet registered a single infection and described its defenses as a "shining success."
The information was doubted abroad.
The symptoms of the disease were reportedly detected in an "outlier" who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on July 19.
The person fled to South Korea three years ago and has now returned across the border.
South Korea initially did not confirm the crossing of the border within the military buffer zone, which is four kilometres wide and still largely mined.
According to the Yonhap National News Agency, South Korea's military acknowledged the possibility of an illegal border crossing to North Korea as high.
Investigations were carried out on a number of people.
North Korea claimed to have called an emergency meeting of the Workers' Party Politburo chaired by Kim Jong Un on Saturday on suspicion of the incident.
The "dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive catastrophe."
Kim had already ordered on Friday, as a preventive measure, "to completely block Kaesong and isolate each district and the region from others," it continued.
The person concerned, as well as all people in Kaesong who had had contact with her, had been quarantined.
The central military commission of the party is therefore to investigate the "outbreak" and the behavior of the responsible military unit and, if necessary, impose severe punishment.
It is estimated that there are about 300,000 people living in Kaesong.
Excitement ahead of Council meeting: City East and noise abatement are still up for discussion before a major summer break
"In addition to environmental issues, the committee members will also vote on the development plan for the major project Innenstadtentwicklung-Ost," it says rather casually in the middle part of the city press release for the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, July 28, at 4.30 pm in the large hall of the Congress Center Pforzheim.
In particular, the upgrading of the eastern city is controversial until the end.
The majorities in favour of this are scarce, and in some committees, depending on their attendance, they are even opposed.
An appeal from the economy (construction, real estate, trade and IT) not to let the project developed by the citizenry and then by the administration and local council fail after almost ten years of preparation, criticized project opponent Reinhard Klein as "extra-parliamentary opposition", "unsuspecting", "speculation", "denigration" and "deliberate false statements".
"Everyone thinks they know better," says Klein, who has been the only representative of the Pforzheim Citizens' List on the municipal council for the past year.
In fact, after reading the treaties, he was in this position: "I know what I am talking about".
The exit would be cheaper for the city, the Technical Town Hall would be renovated for 8.5 million euros, contrary to statements of the city administration after subsidies, of whose existence Klein is convinced.
The development of the city will be very different from what was predicted in the town hall and by the supporters of the economy.
To shape the city by one's own efforts and not by an investor: That is his plan B. One day after Klein, the FDP / FW / UB / LED faction, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
It also essentially provides for the renovation of the Technical Town Hall, the opening of the Schlo ß berg, the lease of the ex-Thales for administrative space and a small-scale inner-city redevelopment, ideally with local agencies.
Environmental issues play a central role
In addition, environmental issues will play a central role.
Among other things, the municipal council will vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the population of Pforzheim from health noise pollution caused by road traffic, including many speed reductions.
In a press release, the local traffic club Germany welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30. However, the political leaders in the city are not innocent of the fact that this must happen because they have only contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus noise by neglecting regular bus traffic with thinned cycles and by little commitment to cycling, according to the VCD.
The municipal council also votes on the participation of the city of the energy and climate protection agency Pforzheim / Enzkreis.
In addition, the agenda includes accession to the Climate Protection Pact of the State of Baden-W ü rttemberg, the reassessment of parental contributions in the municipal day care centers and the application for inclusion in the Smart City funding of the federal government.
Citizens are welcome, but must heed corona protection measures.
Tim Zimmermann starts the new season with a lot of delay
Tim Zimmermann starts his debut season in the ADAC GT Masters on 31 July with a delay of almost half a year.
Before the league of super sports cars can start regular operation, the first test drives were now scheduled.
For Zimmermann, it was all about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3 better.
For a long time, the Corona crisis prevented Tim Zimmermann from starting his first official race in the new Lamborghini Huracan of Grasser Racing.
This was now possible under special hygiene conditions.
The 23-year-old Langenargener completed his first laps at the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his debut in the GT3 car.
"There are a few things that are different from the Porsche from the previous season," says Zimmermann.
"With ABS, for example, you have to go into the corners differently.
But it was really great fun. "
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
The Dutchman is already experienced in GT sports despite his only 25 years and was able to help his new teammate in many things.
"I'm not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series also brings new challenges," says Zimmermann.
"Steijn and I get along brilliantly and we have also made enormous progress from session to session at the Lausitzring."
It is precisely there - at the Lausitzring - that the GT Masters will also be staging its first race.
From 31 July, the 33 supercars will race through Lusatia.
Zimmermann, who is one of 15 newcomers to the series, knows the track.
In 2015, he was the last guest at the Motodrom.
"It worked quickly and I didn't have to get used to the track very much," says Zimmermann, who competes for the Friedrichshafen racing community Graf Zeppelin.
"The Lausitzring has many fast passages that you have to hit optimally in order to be fast."
How fast Zimmermann really is will become clear in two weeks.
"Of course, the teams play a little poker during the tests," he says.
"In the end, however, we are very satisfied and look forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring."
The race in Brandenburg will be the prelude to a densely packed calendar.
Seven races are scheduled until the beginning of November.
The current situation is that no spectators will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
At the N ü rburgring in mid-August, former Formula 1 driver Niko H ü lkenberg will take up the GT steering wheel.
British Transport Minister caught cold by quarantine decision
The British government's decision to quarantine holidaymakers in Spain for two weeks after their return has, according to press reports, caught the country's transport minister cold.
Grant Shapps is currently on holiday in Spain, of all places, while his colleagues at home decided on the measure on Saturday.
Due to the increasing corona numbers in Spain, the Cabinet in London removed the country from the list of countries from which entry is possible without quarantine requirements.
The new regulation will apply from today, Sunday, so Shapps will also have to quarantine after his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returnees.
But the regulation applies to those who are only on holiday on the cut-off date, only from Saturday, 1 August, and was not introduced overnight.
Incidentally, Spain is still considered one of the "safe countries" in Austria for which quarantine is not required.
"Many ministers must have known in advance that there is a possibility of a quarantine being imposed on holidaymakers in Spain", commented Labour MEP Diane Abbot.
"But apparently nobody bothered to tell Grant Shapps."
Less than a month after the end of the Corona emergency in Spain and the end of the strict curfew, the number of infections in the country is rising again.
Virologists mainly blame the nightlife for the renewed spread.
Spain is one of the favourite holiday destinations of the British.
The British government is currently advising against unnecessary travel to the Spanish mainland, with the exception of the Canaries and Balearic Islands, which are particularly popular with British holidaymakers.
To date, more than 272,000 infections with the novel coronavirus and more than 28,000 deaths have been registered in Spain.
Russia: Navy Day: Putin announces hypersonic weapons for warships
Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced that he will equip warships with the most modern hypersonic weapons on Navy Day in his country.
These weapons, unique in the world, would expand the combat capabilities of the Russian navy, Putin said on Sunday in St. Petersburg at the central naval parade.
According to the Interfax agency, the Ministry of Defense also informed about successful tests of the Zircon hypersonic rocket built for the Navy.
The hypersonic weapons have a multiple of the speed of sound of about 343 meters per second.
They are considered weapons of the future.
Underwater tropedeo will be built further
Construction will continue on the atomically equipped underwater torpedo Poseidon, it was said.
The planned sea drone is planned to destroy coastal targets.
The President, who himself also sailed a military boat, said that this year alone 40 new ships would be put into service with the individual fleets of the largest country in the world.
Russia has such a large coastal area as no other country in the world.
For 300 years, the navy has been reliably protecting Russia, Putin said on the day celebrated by sailors nationwide.
In many other Russian coastal towns, the naval forces also celebrated the Day of the Navy with parades.
In Syria, where Russia is fighting alongside ruler Bashar al-Assad, the military demonstrated strength at a weapons show in the Mediterranean port of Tartu.
Ammunition was also fired.
A video released by the Ministry of Defence showed not only warships, including a submarine, but also combat helicopters and jets.
Hurricane "Hanna" reaches Texas: Help made more difficult because of Corona
Washington, DC - This year's first hurricane over the Atlantic has landed in Texas.
Life-threatening floods, strong winds and heavy rainfall now threatened parts of the US state, the National Hurricane Center of the US Climate Protection Agency (NOAA) announced on Sunday night (local time).
Governor Greg Abbott declared a state of emergency for many districts.
The Corona pandemic, which is rampant in Texas, is making the work of the helpers more difficult, Abbott continued, according to the US media.
Evacuees called for caution
"Every hurricane is a huge challenge," Abbott said, according to the Houston Chronicle.
With regard to the hurricane in Texas, he added, "This challenge is complicated and exacerbated by the fact that it is sweeping through an area that is the most affected by Covid-19 in the state."
According to John Hopkins University, about 5,000 people have died in Texas alone as a result of the corona pandemic.
Abbott called on people who had to leave their homes to be cautious.
They should not disregard practices "to which we have become accustomed," such as wearing masks, the governor said, according to CBS.
It was important that everyone kept their distance.
Therefore, hotel rooms were also provided in some places.
In addition, tests are to be carried out in emergency shelters on Corona.
Damage was initially reported only from the coastal town of Port Mansfield.
Storm warning withdrawn again
With wind speeds of up to 150 kilometers per hour, "Hanna" had hit the island of Padre Island directly off the Texas coast.
The storm had previously been upgraded to a low-level hurricane.
For the coastal section from Port Mansfield to Sargent, a storm surge warning was issued and later withdrawn.
Authorities expected a weakening, while "Hanna" moved further inland and headed for northeastern Mexico.
"Douglas" is moving towards Hawaii
In the Pacific, Hurricane Douglas was heading for Hawaii overnight on Sunday with wind speeds of around 150 kilometers per hour.
However, the hurricane center expected it to weaken further.
According to the forecast, it will be near the largest Hawaiian islands on Sunday (local time) - then as a storm just below the hurricane threshold.
Over the Atlantic, NOAA predicted an above-average hurricane season this year, according to a May forecast.
From June to the end of November, up to ten hurricanes are expected, of which up to six could become very strong hurricanes, the authority had declared.
On average, there are six hurricanes per year over the Atlantic, three of which develop into storms of great strength.
Given available climate data and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, the probability of a normal season is only 30 percent, and that of a below-average one is only ten percent, it was said at the time.
Us President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that his administration is closely monitoring the storms and is in contact with the affected states.
Four goals stripped: Video assistant "punished" Sassuolo
Sassuolo's Filip Djuricic were stripped of two goals
Naples - Four goals scored, four goals stripped: Sassuolo Calcio experienced a pitch-black evening at 0: 2 (0: 1) at SSC Naples in the Italian football league Serie A - and was really angry at the video assistant of the referee.
"A festival of ungiven goals for Sassuolo.
Never before has the VAR acted so harshly against a team, "commented the" Corriere dello Sport ".
Host Naples took the lead in the 8th minute with a goal from defender Elseid Hisaj, while Filip Djuricic cheered the equaliser in the 32nd minute.
The Video Assistant Referee (VAR) withdrew the hit due to an offside position.
Five minutes later, Djuricic kicked the ball back into the net - again the VAR intervened.
Also the goals of attackers Francesco Caputo (50.) and Domenico Berardi (61.) were taken back by the referee team after hint of the VAR.
In extra time, Allan made the 2-0 final score for Naples and the bitter evening for Sassuolo perfect.
"The VAR is worse for Sassuolo than a radar trap on the road and punishes Sassuolo like no other team before.
The new technology sets new records, "writes the" Gazzetta dello Sport ".
FC Bayern Munich: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start of the hot preparation phase for the Champions League began for double winner FC Bayern with a setback.
Hansi Flick, who recovered "reasonably well" after a short vacation and a few days of training, has to think about how he can rebuild his successful defense after the injury of world champion Benjamin Pavard.
The Frenchman, who has the third most minutes behind captain Manuel Neuer and midfielder Joshua Kimmich, suffered a ligament injury to his left foot and threatens to be absent in decisive premier class duels.
In the Munich muddy weather, the right defender broke off a training game and was driven off the court with a golf kart.
How long the unrestricted regular player has to pause in the fight for the title is open.
A match in the second round against Chelsea FC on 8 August should be difficult, the 24-year-old can hope for the final tournament starting on 12 August in Lisbon.
But the Bavarians don't want to be stopped by the mishap from Sunday's training.
In his personal triple formula, Flick named the three attributes he wants to see from his stars on their way to Portugal's capital.
Quality, intensity and concentration are to be shown by his victorious title collectors in the ideally following 28 days until the premier class final on 23 August.
"We simply mastered the mandatory tasks excellently with the championship and the cup.
Now it's time to create something special, "said Flick.
Until the Munich team can deal with the final tournament and a training camp in the Algarve, however, the eighth final obligation against Chelsea FC is pending.
After the 3-0 in the first leg before the Corona break, the Londoners should not become a Bavarian nightmare again in the home arena as in the lost "Finale dahoam" in 2012.
"We have to go through the door first.
We want to win, create good conditions and build trust with a good game, "demanded Flick.
A test to get in the mood is scheduled for Friday against Olympique Marseille.
With a long speech, Flick had sworn his stars, who had 13 days of vacation after the double, to a unique August.
He greeted 31 players on S ä bener Stra ß e, including the new players around Edel-Einkauf Leroy Sanst ä lter, who met all new colleagues on the pitch for the first time after his move from Manchester City.
"Leroy, like all the newcomers, fitted in well," Flick reported.
But instead of talking about the new season, when Sangorithm & Co. Are no longer only allowed to train, Flick preferred to talk about the current title project of the German series champion.
After days of individual and small group training, the team is now training for the Londoners, who, in contrast to the Flick ensemble, are in the rhythm of the game.
After that, Munich could face a quarter-final against FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, in the semi-finals Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin are possible opponents.
A way to the final in Lisbon "is not that easy", stressed the head coach, who can rely on the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training from Tuesday onwards.
The World Cup record scorer Klose and Flick know from many a joint tournament preparation, what is particularly important in the 0-on-100 setup.
Working with his current team is "a pleasure", Flick praised.
The "focus on winning" is an impressive trait of his team.
The tournament with nine teams was also ambitious on Sunday.
All of the top performers were there, including Thiago and defender David Alaba, whose whereabouts are not guaranteed beyond the premier class season.
Formula 1 needs a special rule to choose its world champion.
Since it is not possible to drive on the required number of continents, the FIA must improvise in order to award the World Championship titles.
All races in the United States were cancelled.
Race calendar is becoming more and more concrete
The racing calendar of the current Formula 1 season continues to take shape.
In addition to the ten confirmed Grand Prix so far, three more circuits were added during the week.
In October, the N ü rburgring in Germany and Portimo in Portugal will be used.
On the first of November Lewis Hamilton and Co. Will fight for World Championship points at the traditional Italian race track in Imola.
According to the current status, the 2020 racing calendar thus comprises 13 races.
"We are pleased to continue to make significant progress in completing our plans for the 2020 season," said Formula One boss Chase Carey.
A total of 15 to 18 races in the premier class of motorsport are to be completed in this extraordinary season.
Formula One wants to conclude its season in Asia.
The final race calendar is to be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
According to media reports, appearances in Vietnam and Malaysia could take place at the end of November before the already officially scheduled races in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December.
Regulations require races on three continents
However, the regulations of Formula 1 require at least races on three continents for the award of the World Championship.
Even if, as currently planned, there are only two continents, there should be a world champion.
With the help of a special rule, the FIA wants to award the titles on the basis of "exceptional circumstances" due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The traditional start of the season in Australia in March had to be cancelled at short notice due to the looming Corona crisis.
A return to the continent this year is not an issue.
In addition, Formula One will not be visiting America this year.
Rejection meets with criticism in Brazil
Due to the tense corona situation, the races will not take place in Canada, the USA, Mexico and Brazil.
"We look forward to being with them again next season," Carey said.
The cancellation of the American races met with criticism, especially in Brazil: "The cancellation did not come as a surprise to us, but we cannot accept the reasons for it", said Tamas Rohonyi, promoter of the Grand Prix in S ü dtirol o Paulo.
For example, the number of infections in the area of Shio o Paulo is significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
In addition, the concerns of some teams not wanting to drive in Brazil would not justify a cancellation.
They are prepared for the required security measures.
Greta Thunberg: Evil eye against Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest on Stephen Colbert's well-known late-night show and revealed in an interview what she had in mind when she met Donald Trump.
Climate expert Greta Thunberg was a guest on a popular US late-night show via video.
Among other things, she talked about her struggle against the powerful of the world.
The teenager also talked about her famous "evil eye" when she met Donald Trump.
New York City - Over the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has attracted attention with her tireless commitment to the Fridays For Future movement.
Now she spoke in a well-known late-night show about her plans for the future and her meeting with US President Donald Trump at the UN climate summit last year.
Late-night host Stephen Colbert welcomed 17-year-old Thunberg to your show on Tuesday and conducted a lengthy interview with the Swede.
She spoke not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the powerful of the world.
"There are some things that surprised me," she said.
"How far people go to steer the focus away from the climate crisis," she said.
"Everything from organized hate campaigns to threats just because a group of children takes to the streets," she said.
Heads of state and political leaders who scoff at her on social media, or even try to silence her, find her "funny" because the reactions show her "because they have no other answer".
It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was approached about a well-known scene in which she cast a bitterly evil eye after US President Trump.
At the UN Climate Summit 2019 in New York, for which the actress sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive gaze was captured by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
The short clip resulted in a GIF, an animated image that eventually became one of the most commonly used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think about the US president at that moment
To Stephen Colbert's relatively open question, she replied briefly and dryly: "To be honest, I don't think that needs any further explanation."
The experienced satirist Colbert had probably not expected the quick-witted answer and disappeared from the picture laughing for a moment.
With her "How dare you" speech on the principles of climate protection, she was remembered by many at the climate conference.
Ex-Dortmunder Immobile with threesome pack for Lazio Rome
Ciro Immobile is now on a par with Bavaria's Robert Lewandowski in the race for Europe's Golden Shoe.
The former Dortmund Ciro Immobile still has the best chances to become the top scorer in the Italian football championship.
The former BVB professional contributed three goals in the 5-1 (1: 1) victory of Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona, including two converted penalties in the extra time of both halves.
This means that the 30-year-old from fourth in the standings now has 34 goals in his account before the end of the season - the same number scored by Robert Lewandowski from FC Bayern Munich in the past Bundesliga season.
In Italy Cristiano Ronaldo follows with 30 goals so far, the Portuguese superstar met Sampdoria Genoa with the leader in the evening.
Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green died
His life was like a rollercoaster ride: After a rapid ascent with Fleetwood Mac, it went steeply downhill and then slowly up again.
Now blues rock guitarist Peter Green has died at the age of 73.
Ingenious guitarist, drug junkie, cult fan: The co-founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully in his sleep at the age of 73, family members announced in an official statement on Saturday that a further statement would be announced for the next few days.
Top musicians such as Peter Frampton praised Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional reaction of a "monumental loss" for all former and current members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
The drummer Fleetwood and the guitarist Green had founded the now legendary band in London in 1967, his dreamy instrumental hit "Albatross" is still unforgotten today.
The musician's life ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") resembled a roller coaster ride.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a rapid rise - but the band celebrated their greatest successes without him.
It is said that there was a dispute, among other things, because Green wanted to donate all the profits of the group to charity.
He began to appear in wide robes and with a large crucifix.
Psychological problems are also said to have played a role.
Three years later, Green left the band in 1970.
This was followed by a social decline.
The blues rock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, as biographers reported.
For a long time, Green was treated in psychiatry.
During much of the 1970s, the musician disappeared from the scene.
He is said to have lived temporarily on the street, worked as a cemetery gardener and spent some time in an Israeli kibbutz.
Green was born in 1946 to a Jewish working class family in Bethnal Green, London.
At a young age, he became interested in American blues musicians such as B. B. King and Muddy Waters.
At the age of eleven, he learned to play guitar.
At the age of 15, the teenager began playing guitar professionally and five years later got the chance to be the lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners on stage.
Shortly afterwards, he was hired by the Bluesbreakers to replace his idol Eric Clapton.
In the midst of the blues boom, Green formed Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967 with fellow bluesbreakers Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross", composed by Green, gave the group their first number one hit in the winter of 1968 / 69 and catapulted them to the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid rise soon showed its downsides: Green could not cope with the media hype, his experiments with the drug LSD became more and more extreme.
He later commented on the life between music and addiction in an interview: "The worst thing that happened to me in life is the drugs - the best thing was to land a number one hit".
Towards the end of the decade, Green surprisingly achieved a respectable success in 1979 with an album inspired by religious themes.
Meanwhile, Fleetwood Mac swam without him in a new formation on a wave of success.
Their 1977 album "Rumours" sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Despite several small solo successes, Green did not make a major comeback until 1996, when he restarted with a group of friendly musicians.
The British "Daily Telegraph" spoke at that time of a rock star who had returned to earth.
Free of drugs, Green released several albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group until the band disbanded in 2004.
For music experts, he was already a blues legend during his lifetime - and with his gentle sound one of the most influential guitarists of the past decades.
