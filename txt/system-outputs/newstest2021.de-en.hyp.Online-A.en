Biker reacts lightning fast and prevents worse
On Friday evening, a traffic accident occurred on the country road between Machtolsheim and Merklingen, in which a motorcyclist was only slightly injured thanks to his quick reaction.
Car driver overlooks biker
A 44-year-old driver wanted to turn around 21.30 clock with her VW coming from Merklingen to the left on the state road 1230 in the direction of Machtolsheim.
In doing so, she overlooked the 24-year-old motorcyclist coming from the direction of Nellingen, who had the right of way.
In the event of a collision, hand and foot brake levers fly away
The biker still tried to avoid the car, but still grazed it on the rear of the vehicle.
Due to the grazing process, the hand and foot brake levers on the Suzuki were torn off and the driver was no longer able to brake.
Mentally, he steered his motorcycle in the green stiff next to the road and let it roll out there without falling.
Biker suffers leg injury
Due to the collision with the car, the biker still suffered an injury to the Beim and had to be treated in a clinic.
Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 harvesters infected
After a corona mass infection on a large vegetable farm in Mamming, Lower Bavaria, almost 500 people are under quarantine and are no longer allowed to leave the farm.
A security service monitors the ban on going out.
A total of 174 harvest helpers were tested positive for the corona pathogen Sars-CoV-2 during the screening, as the district office Dingolfing-Landau announced on Saturday evening.
"In order to avoid further spread, we unfortunately have to take this step to protect the population," said District Administrator Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Previously, seven employees had already been infected in the company - this was the reason for the series test.
The farm is a large vegetable farm that grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and beetroot - but the cucumbers only for pickling jars.
Mamming is a rural community with a good 3300 inhabitants not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW plant.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to keep calm: "According to our information, it is a closed circle of people".
On the farm, infected from infected employees were separated, the site is now surrounded by a barrier fence.
The Greens and SPD gave the state government joint responsibility.
The two opposition factions accused Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet of neglecting the control of the accommodation of seasonal workers.
"This can take bitter revenge if such local infections take hold and regional lockdowns have to be ordered," said Jürgen Mistol, the parliamentary managing director of the Greens.
The SPD takes a very similar view: "After the corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof slaughterhouse in mid-May, we have already called for a special control program for farms with harvest helpers," said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
"From our point of view, hygiene conditions at the workplace and living conditions in particular must be strictly controlled.
That obviously didn't happen."
The outbreak had come "with announcement".
U-Bahn station Aidenbachstraße: Dangerous dispute: 19-Year-old falls after pusher in the track bed
In a dispute between two youth groups at the Aidenbachstraße underground station, a 19-year-old fell through a shove and slipped into the track bed.
Obersendling - On Friday, there was a dispute between two youth groups at the Aidenbachstraße underground station at around 4.15 p.m.
A passer-by alerted the police, who arrived with several stripes.
According to initial investigations, a Munich (17) pushed a 19-year-old to the ground.
The young man slipped over the edge of the platform and fell into the track bed.
People from the group of the 17-year-old helped to climb the fallen from the track.
There was no danger from an incoming railway.
As the police announced, it came afterwards again to clashes between the two people.
The 17-year-old initially fled the scene, but his personal details could be determined afterwards.
Accompanied by his father, he went to Police Inspectorate 29.
The 17-year-old is being investigated for bodily injury.
Report: Seehofer urges longer data retention
Data retention is currently suspended.
According to a media report, however, Federal Interior Minister Horst Seehofer is calling for an extension of the storage period.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
According to a media report, Federal Interior Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) is calling for extended data retention - half a year instead of the planned ten weeks.
As the "Bild am Sonntag" reports, Seehofer asked Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht (SPD) in a letter for a quick change in the law.
Seehofer wants to strengthen the measures against child abuse.
He considers it useful to "make urgently needed adjustments to the law now," the newspaper quotes from the letter.
Currently, data retention is suspended.
A decision by the ECJ is expected.
Seehofer, however, wants the changes beforehand, so that they could be applied immediately after a possible positive verdict, the report continues.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice told the newspaper that it could only be meaningfully examined whether there would be a need for legal adjustments once the courts had decided.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer, together with the interior ministers of the federal states, had already spoken out in June in favour of data retention.
NBA: Strip club trouble for Clippers star Lou Williams
Excitement in the NBA!
Lou Williams (33), professional basketball player of the Los Angeles Clippers, is said to have left the tournament quarters at Disney World in Orlando/Florida with permission for a funeral.
According to US media reports, he visited the strip club "Magic City" in Atlanta in the evening.
Williams, who is said to have admitted the visit, according to ESPN, is back in Isolation, is tested daily for Covid-19.
His reason for the visit: Chicken Wings.
In February of last year, "Sweet Lou", as he is called in the NBA, has already expressed his love for exactly these Wings.
The American wrote, "Magic City and Blue Flame (another strip club in Atlanta) have the best wings in town."
NBA insider Shams Charania announced on Twitter on Sunday that the NBA has ordered Williams to quarantine for ten days.
Thus, the Clippers star misses the first two official games after the test game phase.
At Disney World, the NBA wants to end the Corona season.
Currently, the best 22 teams are preparing with training matches for the season finale, which begins on Friday night.
Söder comments on the corona situation after mass infection
Munich - Health Minister Melanie Huml (CSU) announced a test offensive for large farms on Sunday.
The press conference will be shown live on our homepage.
The case in Mamming in the district of Dingolfing-Landau has alarmed authorities and politicians.
Almost 500 harvesters from several countries are currently working on the large vegetable farm, and more than a third have been infected with the corona pathogen.
The farm is now under quarantine and is cordoned off with a construction fence.
No one is allowed to leave the premises, food is delivered.
The authorities are now offering the more than 3300 residents of the community free corona tests.
Since the harvest helpers had little contact with the local population, the district office has so far assumed that the infections have not spread beyond the farm.
"Remorse": Confession of the alleged arsonist of Nantes
"My client has been cooperative," lawyer Quentin Chabert told the newspaper.
The defense lawyer added: "He regrets the deeds very much, the confession was a liberation for him".
His mandate was "plagued by remorse and very much afflicted by the extent of the destruction."
If convicted, the man faces ten years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros, according to the public prosecutor's office.
The Gothic St. Peter and Paul Cathedral in Nantes was severely damaged in a fire on Saturday night last week.
The fire had broken out in three far apart places in the church.
Laboratory tests confirmed the suspicion of arson.
The now detained suspect had been arrested just a few hours after the fire.
However, he was released after one day.
The man works as a volunteer for the Diocese of Nantes and was responsible for the closure of the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
Since there was no trace of a violent intrusion into the church, he quickly came into the focus of the investigators.
Discuss the abolition of the 50+1 rule
Former DFB President Reinhard Grindel has recommended considering abolishing the 50+1 rule.
"German football should at least discuss setting conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates a fait accompli," Grindel told Bild am Sonntag.
He stressed: "For the clubs that are most likely to be dangerous to Bayern and Dortmund, the 50+1 rules do not work anyway: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, one cannot avoid the debate as to whether it is not necessary to make it easier for associations that want to break into this phalanx to involve investors."
However, he has doubts as to whether there is a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority shareholdings, which are prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50+1 rule.
"It remains a legal risk to draw investment fences around the Bundesliga as a business location in a European internal market," said Grindel.
The former DFB boss sees the danger that "the attempts to ensure more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will ultimately only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but will not lead to more tension in the championship".
Even an equal distribution of TV money will not have a decisive effect.
"FC Bayern has a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million.
The differences are therefore already immense among the first three clubs alone.
The other 15 clubs have an average budget of 130 million," explained the 58-year-old.
Looking at the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Unfortunately, there have been people who have noticed this mistake and leaked it to the press instead of talking to me about it," Grindel said of accepting an expensive watch that led to his resignation in April 2019.
"That has already occupied me very much on a human level."
He had received the gift worth around 11,000 euros from a Ukrainian official.
"I committed a compliance violation, and it was right to draw the consequences from it," Grindel said.
"I dealt with the ominous watch gift completely transparently and innocently.
Many in the DFB knew about it."
He had never "made a secret of the gift," assured the 58-year-old.
"This may be called naïve, but at least this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption."
"Black Lives Matter": Injured and one dead
The protests against police violence in the United States have come to a head again due to Donald Trump's use of federal police in several cities.
On Saturday, there were clashes between demonstrators and police in various cities.
Three people were injured in Louisville and 16 people were arrested in Seattle.
In Austin, one person was killed by gunfire while a march was crossing an intersection.
Previously, there had been clashes in Portland during protests against racism and police violence.
The security forces, including officials of the Federal Police, used tear gas on Saturday night and forcibly dispersed demonstrators.
Hundreds of protesters, some armed, marched through Louisville, Kentucky, on Saturday, demanding that those responsible for Breonna Taylor's death be held accountable.
The 26-year-old student was shot dead in March during a drug raid on her apartment in Louisville.
The target of the raid was someone else who did not live there, and no drugs were found.
When a member of a group that describes itself as an armed alliance of Black Americans fired a shot on Saturday, three people were injured.
According to NBC, they were taken to the hospital.
None of them were in mortal danger.
The police set up barricades because counter-demonstrators of a white militia had also formed.
In the end, the two groups did not meet.
In Austin, Texas, one person was shot dead during a Black Lives Matter demonstration and died.
The police took a suspect into custody, according to their own statements.
She has not yet provided further details on the circumstances of the crime.
Mayor Steve Adler said he was, like many in the city, "heartbroken and stunned" by what had happened, according to the New York Times.
In the American metropolis of Seattle, demonstrators clashed with the police on Saturday.
They set fire to construction trucks in front of a juvenile prison, the police used stun grenades and pepper spray.
According to the Seattle Times, 16 people were arrested for resisting police officers or assault.
In the city of Oakland, California, a courthouse was set on fire.
A small group of protesters smashed windows, shot down fireworks and blinded police officers with lasers, Oakland police said late Saturday night (local time).
The fire was quickly extinguished.
In Aurora, a suburb of Denver, Colorado, a car drove through a crowd demonstrating on a highway.
Police said one of the protesters fired a gun and at least one person was taken to the hospital injured.
In addition, windows were smashed in a court and a fire was set, as the police announced.
Investigations have begun.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historical costumes defy Corona
Although the big party in the spa town was missing, visitors and performers enjoyed the Rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, performers and organizers: The Rakoczy weekend without Rakoczy festival.
But: Even if the big party mile in the city center was missing, the crowds and program highlights such as Saale, Rakoczy Ball or Parade is burning, many still got their money's worth with the Corona-compliant alternative program.
"I think we have succeeded in spreading Rakoczy flair," says spa director Sylvie Thormann.
The guests would have accepted it well.
In principle, one returns to the beginnings of the Rakoczy festival, when only the historical were the focus of the festival.
Pleasant atmosphere
Vesna Konhäuser and her husband have been visiting Bad Kissingen for more than 25 years for the Rakoczy Festival.
So also this time in the Corona year.
The couple has made themselves comfortable at the Luitpold Casino, watches the historical while strolling and listens to the Cuban live music at the casino restaurant.
"I also find it quite pleasant," says Konhäuser.
She does not miss the crowds that otherwise belong to Rakoczy.
But it lacks the usual program highlights, especially Saale burns on Friday evening as well as the historic procession and the closing fireworks on Sunday evening.
"That's a pity.
The weather would have been great this year," she says.
Rakoczy equestrian tournament to take place again
For the performers of the historical spa guests, the alternative program sometimes meant more work.
For example, for Christina Gold, who takes part in the procession in a normal year and can be seen there on the carriage of the Kurgartencafé.
This year she walked around the city on Saturdays and Sundays in costume.
"It's more exhausting, otherwise we'll have it easier," she says.
The equestrian club had less to do, even if individual riders were in the park.
"We very much hope that the Reiterquadrille will be able to take place again next year," says chairwoman Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that after a break of several years, a Rakoczy equestrian tournament will take place again in 2021.
28 corona cases at Spanish second division club Fuenlabrada
The Spanish second division football club CF Fuenlabrada is sliding deeper and deeper into the crisis due to a corona outbreak.
Since the newcomer from near Madrid flew to a game in the city of A Coruña on July 20 despite the first corona cases, one low blow follows the next.
By Sunday, 28 players or team members had tested positive, one came to the hospital, as the club announced.
Fuenlabrada from the city of the same name south-west of Madrid has so far had the chance to reach the promotion playoffs.
Now even the relegation to the B group of the Second League threatens.
The match against Deportivo La Coruña last Monday was cancelled at the last moment, the public prosecutor's office is investigating a possible crime against public health, the top sports authority CSD is considering the forced relegation of the club.
The players and other team members are in quarantine in a hotel.
"Until the sixth day of quarantine, they did not receive a fresh towel and gel," wrote the sports newspaper "AS".
Photos show how players hung up underwear and club clothes in their rooms in the hotel to dry after they apparently had to wash them themselves.
Also, the bed linen had not been changed for five days.
Another problem is the food.
It is neither good nor sufficient, wrote "AS".
The club management, on the other hand, said they were satisfied with the hotel.
The accusation of deliberately endangering public health was rejected by the club's lawyer, Javier Tebas Llanas.
The son of the president of the Spanish Primera Division, Javier Tebas, stressed that the corona rules established by the Football Association had not been violated, as the news agency Europa Press and the sports newspaper "Marca" reported.
Before departure, there had been four infected until July 19, but all of them were isolated and did not travel with them.
Right before the flight to A Coruña on Monday, all players and team members were tested again.
When the team was already in A Coruña, "five or six" other team members had a positive corona test.
The match was cancelled 60 minutes before kick-off, Tebas Llanas said.
Police must capture horses torn out at Dampfach
Two animals were on the road.
The police led her back to her owner.
On Sunday morning shortly before 6 a.m., a road user reported two free-running horses on the feeder between the junction Donnersdorf/Steinsfeld and the Theres motorway junction.
When the officials arrived, the horses were already back between the feeder and the village of Dampfach.
After the trust of the horses could be won by the officers shortly before Dampfach, they each had a rope carried in the patrol car folded down.
Professional cyclist Tony Martin: Career continuation conceivable
Time trial specialist Tony Martin is thinking about continuing his career.
Frankfurt/Main - Seven-time time trial world champion Tony Martin can certainly imagine continuing his cycling career.
"I am currently working with the team to set out the framework conditions for how and in what form it could continue," said the 35-year-old of the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung".
Martin is currently employed by the Dutch team Jumbo-Visma and had considered ending his career after this year before the Corona break.
The negotiations with his team are also about the number of race days, he said.
Or other problems that would plague him as a family man, Martin said.
He used to get up after a fall, and the first thought was: "Quickly back on the bike.
Today, as the father of a young daughter, I think: What if"
The professional cyclist admitted that there are certainly aspects with which he is increasingly struggling.
"But it was good for me to use the Corona period to realize what I have in cycling and how much fun it is for me."
The time trial specialist returns to the competition at the Tour de l'Ain (5 to 9 August).
Bavaria: At least four dead on Bavaria's roads at the weekend
The beautiful weather attracts bikers to the streets in many places.
For at least three people, the tour ends fatally by motorcycle.
An 18-year-old pedestrian also dies.
Schönthal - In accidents on Bavaria's roads, several, mostly young people died at the weekend.
An 18-year-old motorcyclist was hit on Saturday near Schönthal (cham district) by a car that came into the opposite lane.
Why the car got into the opposite lane was initially unclear.
In Upper Bavaria, a 22-year-old collided with a horse-drawn carriage on his machine on Saturday.
According to the police, he was traveling downhill near Beilngries.
In a left turn, he crashed into the carriage.
His injuries were so severe that he died at the scene of the accident.
Of the twelve occupants of the carriage, one man was seriously injured and one man slightly injured, police said.
In another fatal accident, an 18-year-old died in Bad Kötzting in Upper Palatinate.
He had laid down on a road on Sunday night and was run over by a 42-year-old driver.
According to the police, the 18-year-old wanted to sleep.
The driver could no longer brake in time.
Near Schönberg (Freyung-Grafenau district) on Saturday, a 57-year-old biker crashed head-on into a car in a right-hand bend despite emergency braking.
He died at the scene of the accident.
The 57-year-old driver suffered a shock, the remaining three people in the car remained uninjured.
The safety of motorcyclists was discussed on Saturday by Bavaria's Minister of Transport Kerstin Schreyer (CSU).
In a letter to the organizer of the biker protests against driving bans announced for August, Gabor Kovacs, the minister referred to extensive investments such as underrun protection on crash barriers and the defusing of dangerous curves.
"For the safety of motorcyclists, we have achieved a lot in recent years," the letter said.
"The number of motorized two-wheeler drivers killed fell by around 28 percent compared to 2011."
Kovac tests with Monaco against Frankfurt
Frankfurt/Main (dpa) - For football coach Niko Kovac, there will soon be a reunion with Eintracht Frankfurt with his new club AS Monaco.
The eight-time French champions will play on 1 August (18.00 hrs) at the Hessen, the former club of the Croatian.
For the Bundesliga club, it is the first and only endurance test before the second leg of the Europa League against FC Basel (6 August).
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the match will be played without spectators.
"We are especially looking forward to this game.
It's always nice to come to Frankfurt and meet friends," Kovac explained.
From a sporting point of view, this is an interesting test, said the 48-year-old.
Before his move to FC Bayern Munich, Kovac had coached the Hessians from 2016 to 2018 and led them to victory in the DFB Cup.
"A top-class opponent like Monaco is a good test for us in terms of the game against Basel.
Like all Frankfurters, I'm looking forward to seeing Niko Kovac again," said Eintracht coach Adi Hütter.
The 50-year-old Austrian had succeeded the Croatian at Eintracht.
In March, the Frankfurters had lost the first leg of the round of sixteen against Basel in their own stadium with 0:3.
Almost 50 new infections: Hof district just past lockdown
In the district of Hof, the number of known new corona infections has increased further over the weekend: from 39 on Friday and 43 on Saturday (one person has recovered and no longer falls into this statistic) to 47 on Sunday.
In addition, there is a case in the city of Hof.
This means that the Hof area is approaching the critical mark of 50 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants in one week.
700 dead by monsoon rains in Southeast Asia
More than 9 million people are affected by the severe floods in Southeast Asia, mainly in Bangladesh, India and Nepal.
Due to the heavy monsoon rains, a total of 700 people were killed.
In Bangladesh, the Red Crescent is trying to reach the isolated people in boats.
Entire villages are under water.
The farmers have lost their crops.
Rhinos in National Park die from landslides
In Kaziranga National Park, several of the 120 rhinos died from landslides.
They are under protection and are considered endangered by extinction.
This year, the floods are particularly bad, which scientists attribute to climate change.
According to the United Nations, Bangladesh is one of the countries most affected by global warming.
New apartments are empty
In the town of Cox's Bazar in the south of Bangladesh, the state has built apartments for 650 displaced by the floods.
So far, only a few have moved in.
It is difficult to bring people to Cox's Bazar.
The enthusiasm also persists in Grenezn.
Anyone who used to have a house, no matter how small it was and resembled a hut, often does not want to spend his life in a large apartment block.
Many apartments are empty, but - as the government wants - will soon be occupied by those who have lost their house due to the floods.

Argentina rejects creditors' counteroffer
The new demands could not be met, said the Ministry of Economy in Buenos Aires on Saturday.
"That would not only be irresponsible, but also unjust," it said in a statement.
"While 50 percent of children in Argentina live in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors."
The debt of the second-largest economy in South America is no longer sustainable under the current conditions.
That is why Argentina is demanding that its private creditors waive part of their claims of around 66 billion US dollars (around 59 billion euros).
If no agreement is reached, the country is again threatened with national bankruptcy.
It would be the ninth default in Argentine history.
Most recently, lenders had demanded higher interest rates on government bonds and changes to some contractual clauses.
However, the Argentine government is sticking to its last offer and is not prepared to make any further concessions.
Argentina is in a severe financial and economic crisis.
The inflation rate was recently more than 50 percent.
For the current year, experts expect a decline in economic power of around ten percent.
At the end of May, Argentina had failed to pay $503 million in interest receivables, slipping into a limited default.
Arrived professionally - privately not yet
"Things are going very well" - this is the conclusion drawn by Dr. Stefanie Kramer after her first days in the notary's department in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything went very quickly: In mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she would succeed Lutz Feller in the Eggenfelden notary's office.
Just six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the doctor of law began work, and normal day-to-day business has long been running at full speed.
"Privately, however, I still have to arrive," she explains in an interview with the Rottaler Anzeiger and laughs.
Of course, the short lead time was not enough to completely relocate the center of life from Regensburg to Eggenfelden, reports the native dingolfingerin.
She is currently looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city with her husband, who works as a judge at the regional court in Regensburg.
At least her husband was able to apply for parental leave at short notice in order to ensure the care of the two daughters (31/2 and 11/2 years old).
In order not to have to commute every day from Regensburg, she also has an overnight stay with her parents in Dingolfing for the time being, explains the 39-year-old.
Growing up in the neighbouring district, the city of Eggenfelden has of course long been known to her.
During visits to the site with her family in recent months, she again realized: "Eggenfelden is a really nice small town".
She was all the more pleased that she had won the race in the selection process for the vacancy.
Her native Lower Bavaria also plays a central role in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's professional career: After studying law in Passau, she completed her legal clerkship and the 2nd state examination in Regensburg.
After several positions as a notary assessor, including in Rehau and Hof in Upper Franconia, Babenhausen in the Unterallgäu and Regensburg - during this time she also shouldered her doctorate in employment law "on the side" - she took up her first position as a notary in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau in 2012.
In 2016, she went on parental leave, which was finally followed by the move to Regensburg.
Since then, she has taken over representation services in various notarial offices.
When the position in Eggenfelden was advertised because of Lutz Feller's approaching retirement, she saw the right time for full professional re-entry, explains the 39-year-old.
The team of her predecessor, who will take over the holiday replacement in the notary's office in the future, has taken over Completely by Dr. Stefanie Kramer - and immediately has praise for the team of the law firm: "It's going great!"
The fact that she can rely on well-rehearsed processes makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming relocation of her private center of life.
In terms of kindergarten and crèche places, she has already made contact with a local institution.
And if everything goes as desired, she hopes to be able to pursue her hobby here soon - and get to know the most beautiful jogging routes in the Rottal.
BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be 20 percent full at the start of the season in the event of a fan return.
"Due to the distance regulation, which must be adhered to, we are currently planning with 12,000 to 15,000 spectators," Borussia Dortmund's managing director Carsten Cramer told the "Tagesspiegel".
Normally, the arena in the district city holds just over 81,000 spectators at Bundesliga matches.
In last season's ghost games caused by the corona pandemic, BVB lost around four million euros per game.
Cramer, who is responsible for marketing, digitization and internationalization at BVB, hopes that in addition to the normal spectator seats, some of the approximately 4,000 seats in the hospitality sector can be opened again: "It is of course a blow to the office if these revenues break away completely."
In view of the ongoing corona crisis, everyone is currently "well advised to take a stable page-long time".
"If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people in Germany alone are on short-time work, then the need for entertainment is limited," explained Cramer.
The Dortmund marketing boss praised the BVB professionals for their partial salary waiver, which should help to overcome the crisis: "Of course, the players know that their salary waiver has a different effect than if we put 100 people who work in merchandising on short-time work".
Tiny miracles: Early start in life with a few hundred grams
Hardly heavier than a pack of butter, just three tablespoons of blood in his entire body: that was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The boy is one of around 400 premature babies who are cared for annually at the Graz Children's Hospital.
A quarter of them weigh less than 1,500 grams, a few - like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael - are extreme lightweights with less than a kilogram of birth weight.
They are so small and born prematurely that neither lungs, nor intestines, nor muscles are fully formed.
Their skin is sometimes so tender that they could injure the electrodes of an ECG.
And they are so tiny that they sometimes wear doll clothes and mini diapers made especially for them.
But not so small that they wouldn't be in their voices - "and how," smiles Berndt Urlesberger.
"Even if, of course, they don't scream quite as loudly as big babies."
When the whiteboard becomes a stage
Despite Corona Theater in the classroom: The whiteboard as a stage was experienced by the 9th graders of the Sankt-Jakobus-Gymnasium in Abtsgmünd shortly before the start of the holidays.
Actress Julia Sylvester from the Theater der Stadt Aalen presented the production "Das Heimatkleid" to the students - by video.
Afterwards, the students were able to exchange information about the play and the performance via Skype with the actress and the director Winfried Tobias.
The idea for the performance format was born from the current Corona situation.
Teacher Teresa Nar was pleased about the enrichment of the lessons.
Even if in the end all participants agreed that the direct encounter in the theatre and stage space would offer additional stimuli, one can also see the potential for contact in the schools in the theatre.
"If we continue to improve the technical framework, it could be an interesting addition to the game operation," emphasized director Winfried Tobias.
First round drawn: TSV 1860 would meet Eintracht Frankfurt in the DFB Cup
Should TSV 1860 qualify for the DFB Cup, the Lions will face Eintracht Frankfurt in the first round.
This was the result of the draw on Sunday.
Munich - Sixty's possible opponent in the first round of the DFB Cup has been determined.
The Lions would meet Eintracht Frankfurt if they qualify successfully.
This was the result of the draw on Sunday evening in the ARD sports show.
Because the field of participants is not yet complete due to the corona pandemic, placeholders were used in the draw.
Due to the voluntary renunciation of semi-final opponents FC Memmingen, TSV 1860 is already in the final of the Bavarian Toto Cup (4 or 5 September).
There the Lions meet either the Würzburger Kickers or Viktoria Aschaffenburg.
Should second-division promoted Würzburg reach the final, Sixty would already be qualified for the first round of the DFB Cup.
Otherwise, the Giesinger would have to prevail in the final against Regionalliga Aschaffenburg.
The first round of the DFB Cup will be played between 11 and 14 September, one week before the start of the third division.
"Gone with the Wind": Film legend Olivia de Havilland is dead
Film legend and Oscar winner Olivia de Havilland is dead.
She died on Sunday in Paris at the age of 104 of a natural death, confirmed her spokeswoman for the German press Agency.
De Havilland was known for her role as Melanie Hamilton in the Southern epic "Gone with the Wind" (1939).
Born in Tokyo to British parents, Olivia de Havilland moved to California as a toddler.
The Austrian theatre man Max Reinhardt discovered the 19-year-old in the role of Hermia in Shakespeare's "Midsummer Night's Dream".
The film studio Warner Brothers signed her for seven years and released her alongside Eroll Flynn.
She made eight films with the heartbreaker.
In 1946 she won her first Oscar in the leading role of "To Each His Own".
The film was shown in Germany under the title "Mutterherz".
Three years later came the award for best actress in William Wyler's "The Heiress".
She also received a lot of recognition as a neurotic eccentric in "The Dark Mirror" and "The Snake Pit".
Daphne du Maurier proposed her in 1952 for the leading role in the film adaptation of her novel "My Cousin Rachel".
The piece became a worldwide success.
With her long-time friend Bette Davis, she played in "Lullaby for a Corpse".
His marriage to the writer Marcus Goodrich (1946 to 1953) produced a son, Benjamin.
In Paris, de Havilland married the journalist Pierre Paul Galante and had a daughter Gisèle with him.
This marriage also broke up.
Rumors of an affair with former British Prime Minister Edward Heath, however, have never been confirmed.
"Road to Timmendorf": Beach volleyball: Thole/Wickler miss final on comeback
The World Cup runners-up Julius Thole and Clemens Wickler missed the final of the beach volleyball tournament "Road to Timmendorf".
At the meeting of the top teams in Düsseldorf, they lost in the semi-finals to their national team colleagues Nils Ehlers and Lars Flüggen with 1:2 (17:21, 21:17, 19:21).
Thole/Wickler last played at the World Tour Final in Rome in September of last year.
In the final on the Rhine, their conquerors Ehlers/Flüggen conceded a defeat against the surprise team Lukas Pfretschner and his interim partner Steven van de Velde with 0:2 (17:21, 17:21).
In addition to the show tournament, three starting places for the German Championships were played at the beginning of September in Timmendorfer Strand: The tickets were secured by Armin Dollinger/Simon Kulzer, Manuel Harms/Richard Peemüller and Simon Pfretschner/Milan Sievers.
Kalbitz expulsion from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "fig leaf"
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is from the point of view of the FDP only a "fig leaf" and does not change the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the right-wing extremists in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the tip of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD," fdp interior politician Benjamin Strasser told the dpa news agency in Berlin.
The Federal Arbitration Court of the AfD had confirmed on Saturday in Stuttgart after several hours of hearing the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Executive Board had decided in May by a majority.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD parliamentary group in the Brandenburg state parliament.
"If the AfD really wanted to consistently remove right-wing extremists from its party, functionaries like Björn Höcke and his supporters would have been excluded long ago," Strasser said.
"However, there is no political will in the AfD to do this, because right-wing extremism is now part of the party."
CSU General Secretary Markus Blume made a similar statement: "The fact that Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded says nothing and changes nothing," he told the "Welt am Sonntag".
"Rather, it speaks volumes how many frenetic supporters a right-wing extremist in the middle of the AfD still has."
Blume assumes that the AfD will end up below five percent in elections in the future.
"The days of the AfD in the parliaments are numbered."
Kalbitz was one of the spokesmen of the now officially dissolved "wing" around the Thuringian AfD state and parliamentary group chairman Björn Höcke; the Office for the Protection of the Constitution classifies the border as a "certain right-wing extremist aspiration".
In May, the AfD federal executive had thrown Kalbitz out of the party.
As a reason, he stated that Kalbitz had not indicated a previous membership in the now banned right-wing extremist "Heimattreue Deutsche Jugend" (HDJ) and the Republicans when he joined the party.
Kalbitz denies membership in the HDJ.
The chairman of the Left Party in the Brandenburg state parliament, Sebastian Walter, also stressed that the decision of the Federal Court of Arbitration did not change the character of the AfD: "The wolf has only eaten chalk.
The AfD remains a far-right party, with or without Kalbitz."
Neither the federal party nor the right wing will be weakened with this decision.
"The manoeuvre of the Meuthen troops is transparent.
You want to avoid further observation by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution and try to get through under the radar," said Walter.
"The AfD will not get rid of the ghosts it called.
An expulsion does not change anything," commented Brandenburg SPD General Secretary Erik Stohn on the decision in the Kalbitz case.
"Here, the AfD regional association and the parliamentary group held to their right-wing leader to this day."
The legal dispute over Kalbitz's membership in the AfD will continue.
He announced on Saturday that he would now take civil action against the decision of the Federal Court of Arbitration.
North Sea wind farms supply a good 21 percent more electricity
The wind power plants on the German North Sea fed 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity into the grid in the first six months of the year.
This is a good 21 percent more than in the same period of the previous year, said the network operator Tennet in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of North Sea electricity to the mainland and the transmission through the German power grid.
The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of Tennet's grid area, have fed in a further 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
Overall, wind power from the North Sea and Baltic Sea thus comes to 13.73 TWh, compared to a good 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind harvest at sea thus accounts for almost 19 percent of all wind power in Germany; that's about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms ensure higher generation capacities
In addition to the wind conditions, the increased contribution of offshore wind energy results from higher generation capacities because new wind farms have been connected to the grid in the past twelve months.
If the 1270 wind power plants in the North Sea were all running at full power at the same time, they could mathematically generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient for this; according to Tennet, it is 7.1 gigawatts.
By 2030, it is expected to rise to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea.
"In Germany and the Netherlands, we are investing 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore grid connections by then," said Tennet Managing Director Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, wind farms cannot exhaust their capacity even at sea, but reach about 40 percent.
The record day so far this year is January 2, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind turbines produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, which corresponds to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could supply almost seven million households with electricity.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the Gmünder Kunstverein.
That was almost a small anniversary celebration for the 130th anniversary.
Birthday of the Gmünder Kunstverein: The exhibition opening "Skirmish" with works by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold went beyond the usual framework after the Corona break.
Many more art lovers than usual followed the dialogue between the artist and the chairman of the Kunstverein, Professor Dr. Klaus Ripper.
The musical equivalent was provided by the band "Defenders of the Universe" on the southern Kornhausplatz.
North of the gallery, the association "Sandtogether" was involved.
Freital: Windbergfest cancelled due to Corona
The Windbergfest will not take place this year.
The city of Freital has cancelled the three-day festival planned for September.
In other years, over 30,000 people had visited this city festival.
"We really did not make this decision easy for ourselves and - aware of how difficult it is economically for those involved - hoped until the last minute," said Lord Mayor Uwe Rumberg (independent).
"But ultimately, as organizers, we are responsible for the health of many thousands of people."
If tens of thousands had flocked to the festival grounds and the marquee, minimum distances, hygiene regulations and contact tracing in accordance with the current corona protection regulation could not have been complied with.
Or the restrictions would have been so severe that not much would have remained of a folk festival.
In addition, the organisational and monitoring effort would increase disproportionately many times over.
Rumberg put off until next year.
Then the city of Freital will celebrate its 100th anniversary with the WinterbergFest from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the Day of the Saxons from 10 to 12 September 2021.
Dressage Olympic champion Werth in Achleiten not to be beaten
Achleiten - Six-time Olympic champion Isabell Werth was the outstanding rider at the dressage tournament in Achleiten, Austria.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg came to four victories in four starts at the weekend.
After winning a Grand Prix each with Weihegold and Quantaz at the start, she was also unbeatable on Sunday in the Grand Prix Special and in the freestyle.
On the 15-year-old mare Weihegold, Werth clearly prevailed in the special on Sunday against the Austrian Victoria Max-Theurer on Abegglen.
Also in the freestyle on Saturday on Quantaz, the German was clearly ahead of her 34-year-old student Victoria Max-Theurer.
Werth's winning horse Quantaz belongs to Max-Theurer.
The most successful dressage rider in the world is to establish the ten-year-old stallion in the Grand Prix.
For Quantaz it was the first freestyle ever.
Werth had already won all four important stages at the first tournament in Achleiten three weeks ago.
The last of the three international tournaments is scheduled for August 14-16.
More air traffic controllers in Worms in the future
The University of Applied Sciences in Worms continues to take to the skies: "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" (DFS German Air Traffic Control) is endowing a professorship for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the university and DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially concluded for three years and will start in 2021.
With the professorship, it is possible to start studies not only in the summer semester, but also in the winter semester.
This means that twice as many students can be trained as before.
At the same time, capacities at both the university and DFS's air traffic control academy are being used evenly.
DFS will advise the university on the establishment and appointment of the professorship.
Represented at the university since 2019
Since the summer semester of 2019, the first students have been enrolled in air traffic management as part of their training as air traffic controllers at Worms University of Applied Sciences.
This year, nine students have already started.
So far, DFS's experience has been very positive, and the students' achievements are outstanding.
The combination of studies and pilot training makes a significant contribution to further increasing the attractiveness of the pilot profession.
"In these times, funding is not easy for us economically.
However, we firmly expect air traffic to recover and grow again in the long term.
In order to be able to continue to fulfil our legal mandate in the future, we need highly qualified personnel," says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, Chairman of the Managing Board of DFS, at the signing of the contract.
"For DFS, the endowed professorship is a future-proof investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, interdisciplinary knowledge base in the long term.
We are therefore continuing the good cooperation with the university and at the same time underpinning our attractiveness as an employer."
This is also underlined by Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of Worms University of Applied Sciences: "The endowed professorship forms an important bridge between science and industry.
With it, we would like to build on the already existing cooperation with DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual bachelor's degree program in Air Traffic Management."
The trust of the German Air Traffic Control is both a motivation and an obligation for Worms University of Applied Sciences to further expand its teaching and research competence in the future fields of air traffic.
Working for the air traffic controllers of tomorrow, the university can set very special highlights and innovative priorities for its students with the first endowed professorship for a dual course of study.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary in the Ministry of Science, Further Education and Culture, emphasizes: "Worms University of Applied Sciences has a unique selling point in Rhineland-Palatinate with its focus on air transport.
Today's signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the profile of the university."
Rescue helicopter lands on the A 45
For about 30 minutes, the A 45 motorway was fully closed on Saturday afternoon in the direction of Aschaffenburg, as the rescue helicopter was in action after a traffic accident.
A 76-Year-old drove with a Ford around 12.40 clock in the exit Alzenau-Mitte in the curve straight ahead and landed at the guardrail.
As a result of the impact, the front airbags were triggered, the driver suffered minor injuries to the face and had to be taken to a hospital for treatment.
The injuries of the 72-year-old passenger were treated by the emergency doctor and the patient was then flown by rescue helicopter to a hospital.
Currently, however, the police assume that there is no danger to life.
The damaged vehicle, which suffered damage of about 2000 euros, had to be towed away.
Heil wants to test other industries after meat industry
The corona crisis brought the conditions in parts of the meat industry back to light.
Tightening of the law is imminent.
But are they legal - and will it stay that way?
Federal Labor Minister Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to check other industries after the now planned strict regulations against grievances in the meat industry.
"We will look at industry by industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective industry if necessary," Heil told the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany's employers are already warning against restricting work contracts in general.
After the mass corona outbreak at the meat giant Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet wants to pass a law by Heil this Wednesday.
Large slaughterhouses should no longer be allowed to use external personnel for slaughter, cutting and meat processing.
To this end, the use of contract workers and temporary workers is to be prohibited there.
Employer President Ingo Kramer told the dpa: "Stay away from a general restriction of work contracts and temporary employment, if you do not want to completely strangle the economy".
Work contracts, for example, are the basis for their added value at the customer for large areas of the trade, the construction industry and plant construction.
"The misdeeds of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument."
Heil assured: "My goal is not to ban work contracts everywhere in the German economy."
Contracts for work and services make sense.
"If an industrial company commissions a craftsman to install a security system, this is a completely normal contract for work."
The German meat industry considers a ban on work contracts and temporary work in its industry alone to be unconstitutional.
It is not explainable why different labor law should apply to portioning and packaging of cheese in the future than to sausage, according to a statement on the draft law, as the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Saturday) reports.
In the event of a ban, the consumer price would rise by 10 to 20 percent per kilo and product.
According to the results of an audit by the NRW Occupational Health and Safety Administration, many Eastern European employees from work contract companies worked in the industry for 16 hours a day.
Often they had no break.
Wages were withheld for protective equipment or rent.
It was also noted that the situation with the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Heil said that a relatively strict law had already come into force for the meat industry in 2017.
However, these were circumvented by "tricky constructions".
"Now we have to clean up fundamentally."
The politician announced: "In the Occupational Health and Safety Act, which we want to adopt in the cabinet at the end of July, there are also measures that do not only affect the meat industry - for example, higher inspection rates for occupational health and safety or clear criteria for shared accommodation".
The draft presented to dpa includes amendments to the Act on safeguarding workers' rights in the meat industry and the Occupational Health and Safety Act.
Brandenburg's Consumer Protection Minister Ursula Nonnemacher (Greens) believes that more intensive controls are necessary.
"I would like us to be able to carry out even more controls in many areas of supervision: food controls, animal welfare, all sorts of things, including animal transport," Nonnemacher said on Sunday in the RBB programme "Brandenburg aktuell".
But more controls also require more staff positions.
Three killed in crash of ultralight aircraft in Germany
In the crash of an ultralight aircraft on an apartment building in Wesel in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, three people have died, according to the police.
A child had been slightly injured.
Two other people were rescued injured in the accident, said a spokesman for the district control center Wesel.
At the scene of the accident, a parachute was found, according to the police.
The "Rheinische Post" reported, citing eyewitnesses, before the crash, the plane had collided with a hot air balloon.
The house is a one- or two-family house.
Further details were not known at first.
Evacuation of Frankfurt's Opernplatz peacefully
One week after the riots in Frankfurt, the evacuation of the Opernplatz in the night on Sunday was also peaceful.
Finally, a few dozen people were still on the square, but left it before the start of the curfew at 1 o'clock.
The police had been on duty since the early evening with numerous officers, in the entire city area a larger police contingent could be seen.
For the first time this weekend, from midnight, there was a ban on entering the Opernplatz, where riots had occurred a week ago.
Police officers had been attacked with bottles from the crowd of revelers.
At least five officers were injured after police input, several police vehicles were damaged.
The night to Saturday had also remained quiet.
Car rolls over: Young woman seriously injured in accident on Bundesstraße 83 near Hofgeismar
In an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme, a 21-Year-old has suffered on Sunday around 13.25 clock serious injuries.
She was taken to kassel Hospital.
With thermal imaging cameras, the fire brigade searched for possible passengers.
According to the police, the woman was on the bundesstraße 83 in the direction of her place of residence Hümme, when her car came off the road for a previously unexplained reason and rolled over several times.
In order to save the victim, the fire brigade had to cut the roof of the car free.
Since it was unclear whether there was anyone else in the vehicle, the adjacent corn field was searched from the turntable ladder with a thermal imaging camera.
The drone squadron from Warburg, which also works with thermal imaging cameras, had also been ordered for the search for people.
However, the emergency services did not find anyone between the tall maize plants.
The seriously injured was taken by ambulance to the Kassel hospital for further care.
Almost 50 firefighters from the Hofgeismar, Hümme and Schöneberg fire brigades were on site.
The main road was closed for two hours because of the accident.
Juventus Turin champions in Italy
Turin - After a redemptive goal by Cristiano Ronaldo, record champions Juventus Turin have secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in a row.
The team around the five-time world footballer made the 36th Scudetto in the club's history perfect with a 2-0 (1-0) on Sunday evening in the home game against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo scored to make it 1-0 before half-time.
With 83 points, Turin, which started without the recently long-injured ex-international Sami Khedira, can no longer be ousted from first place two matchdays before the end of the Serie A season.
Second in the table Inter Milan are seven points behind.
Juventus were harmless despite optical superiority in the first half, then Ronaldo scored after a free-kick variant with the last action.
The 35-year-old converted a feed from Miralem Pjanic directly from the edge of the penalty area with a flat shot (45.+7).
Against the now more offensive guests, Ronaldo was also involved in the 2-0, after his shot Federico Bernardeschi (67th) dusted off.
This ensured the lackluster but decisive success.
The foul penalty missed to the bar in the 89th minute should have only Ronaldo himself with a view to the scorer rating properly nailed.
"It's complicated to stay mentally and physically at ball level for 90 minutes.
The games are strange and the momentum changes very slightly," said coach Maurizio Sarri after the 2-1 draw at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Above all, the mental exhaustion of his players is great, said the Juve coach.
Because of the defeat, the Turin team had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
Juve's reassuring lead at the top of the table in the end was mainly due to the weakness of their competitors.
In the eleven games before Sunday's game, the Sarri team had only managed five victories.
Whether Ronaldo will also be top scorer is questionable.
While the Portuguese superstar has scored 31 goals so far, former Dortmund player Ciro Immobile already has 34 goals to his name after his three-pointer in the 5-1 (1-1) win of fourth-placed Lazio Roma at Hellas Verona - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to FC Bayern's title win.
The record in Italy is held by the current Juve professional Gonzalo Higuaín.
The Argentine scored 36 goals for SSC Napoli in the 2015/2016 season.
In August, the "Old Lady" of Italian football has the next chance to win the title.
Juventus are in the knockout stages of the Champions League, but will have to make up for a 1-0 first leg defeat against Olympique Lyon on 7 August to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next knockout round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would wait as opponents.
Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal car races recorded
Stuttgart - Despite all the threatened penalties and court rulings, motorists continue to step on the gas in countless illegal races on Baden-Württemberg's roads: Last year and the first four months of this year, the police in the southwest already registered more than 250 illegal car races.
Although there are no comparative values for the years before, the speeders are increasingly doing the judicial authorities work: In 2018, a total of 155 investigations were conducted at the public prosecutor's offices between Konstanz and Mannheim for illegal races, a year later there were already 252 and in the current year until the beginning of June already 151.
The races were less about organized events, as can be seen from the response of the Ministry of the Interior to a request from the SPD in the state parliament.
In most cases, the drivers spontaneously competed against each other or they fled from the police - this is also reported as an illegal race.
At the wheel were mainly German men between the ages of 18 and 60.
113 fines - 15 times imprisonment
Only in comparatively few cases are the speeders caught and also asked to pay: According to the Ministry of the Interior, a total of 113 fines have been imposed since 2018 and 15 prison sentences have been imposed.
However, there is no evidence that the number of illegal car races is actually increasing.
Rather, other motorists reacted more sensitively than before because of the numerous tragic accidents and processes of past years and reported more often, said a ministry spokesman.
The Autobahn 8 is particularly popular with speeders. Again and again, drivers slow down the traffic there in order to make room for themselves and use the free track for a race.
Last August, a dozen drivers were caught near Kirchheim unter Teck, three months earlier there were even 18 drivers on the A8 near Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular "race track"
On the A81, the police register even more races than on any other federal highway.
With a speed limit, an attempt is made to slow down the speeders on the particularly affected section between Engen and Geisingen.
The mostly high-priced and pimped-up sports and luxury cars often have Swiss license plates, because the drivers dodge to the lawn in Germany because of the high penalties for driving too fast and car racing in the neighboring country.
For the SPD, the speed limit must not be reduced to a few routes: "With a general speed limit of 130 kilometers per hour, we would solve this problem on motorways," says Martin Rivoir, the traffic expert of the SPD parliamentary group.
"The inhibition threshold for speeders would be significantly higher if you were not allowed to travel legally here and there at 200 kilometers per hour and more."
Rivoir thinks less of education or image campaigns: "Anyone who defies all the rules in this way and puts not only their own lives, but also the lives of other road users at risk, is hardly achievable with reason."
ADAC calls for stronger police crackdown
For the ADAC, on the other hand, this is not enough: "We assume that speeders will not be deterred by the speed limits," says Holger Bach, Head of the Transport and Environment Department at ADAC Württemberg.
He calls for additional and also tougher controls on the affected routes.
Not infrequently, the high-speed showdown turns into painful and momentous seriousness: Since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people have died nationwide in the races, two of them bystanders in a nightly crash in Stuttgart's city center and one in Gerlingen.
There, two young men are said to have delivered a car race in November.
One of the vehicles came off the road, crashed into a garden wall and remained on its side, the 18-year-old passenger died.
21 other people were injured in the races of the past two years.
However, according to Interior Minister Thomas Strobl, stricter penalties are not necessary: "The need for legislative action to sanction illegal motor vehicle races more harshly is not seen," says the paper of the Ministry of the Interior.
Blue light from July 23: Thirsty burglar steals drinks from snack bar
Rohrdorf: A man broke into a snack bar in Rohrdorf (Calw district) on Thursday and stole drinks and cash.
A witness heard noises in the valley road around 3.40 a.m. and ran in the direction of the snack bar.
There he noticed a man who helped himself to the refrigerator with drinks and then left the snack bar through a previously smashed front door.
The perpetrator fled in the direction of the meadows behind the snack bar.
According to the police, the burglar also helped himself to a cash register and stole cash in the low three-digit range.
The suspect is described as follows: He is about 1.75 to 1.80 meters tall and of strong stature.
At the time of the crime, he was wearing a black hoodie, black pants and light shoes.
Further witness information is received by the police.
Ackermann sprints to victory on final stage at Sibiu Tour
Professional cyclist Pascal Ackermann clinced his second victory of the day on the final stage of the 10th Sibiu Tour.
The 26-year-old Palatine from Team Bora-hansgrohe prevailed in the mass sprint on the 109-kilometre section with start and finish in Sibiu, having already won a stage on Saturday.
It was the season's victories three and four for Ackermann.
In the overall standings, his Austrian teammate Gregor Mühlberger prevailed.
The 26-year-old had confidently won the mountain time trial in the morning and thus took the lead in the standings.
Only 104 riders were left in the evening for the final stage.
No less than 18 starters had fallen victim to the time limit in the mountain time trial.
"I'm really happy to start the restart of the season with a victory," Ackermann said after his success on Saturday.
"The sprint was really hectic," said the 26-year-old.
300 meters before the finish he simply put on his sprint, "and it worked out perfectly".
In accordance with the rules of the UCI, a corona test was carried out on all race participants and their companions six days before the start of the race.
During the entire tour, drivers and caregivers were separated from the organization team and the media in isolated hygiene bubbles.
Spectators at the start and finish were not allowed.
Control center gave instructions for lay resuscitation
Düsseldorf - Tragic accident on Sunday afternoon in Düsseldorf-Garath.
In an apartment building, a child (4) suddenly lay lifeless in the water while bathing.
According to the fire department, the emergency call was received shortly before 1 p.m.
"A control center dispatcher immediately gave instructions for amateur resuscitation," a fire department spokesman told BILD.
The arriving rescue forces took over the resuscitation measures a little later.
The child, who was in mortal danger, was transported to the university hospital under resuscitation.
Why it crashed is unclear.
The police have routinely started the investigation into the accident.
The fire brigade spokesman: "We assume a tragic accident in the apartment".
Nuremberg: Unauthorized tuning meeting - police intervene, 700 vehicles and around 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and at times over 1000 people took part in a "tuning meeting" in the parking lot of a furniture store on Saturday night.
The police implemented their announcement to intensify control of such events.
A big tuning meeting took place on Saturday evening (25 July 2020) in Nuremberg's Südstadt.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the police of Middle Franconia, around 10.30 p.m., the Nuremberg traffic police found an increased number of vehicles in the area of a large parking lot in the Ingolstädter Straße.
As a result, the police carried out a large number of vehicle checks there.
Only recently, the police had announced that they wanted to take stronger action against so-called autoposers.
Illegal tuning meeting in Nuremberg: Only a small part of the "scene"
The officers counted at the top a good 700 vehicles and about 1100 people, the police balance.
Of these, however, only a small part of those present can be assigned to the "autoposer" and tuning scene.
Apparently, the majority of the relevant scene complied with the appeal of the police.
On the basis of the vehicles and persons on site, it can be assumed that these were mainly onlookers.
In addition, the majority of those present adhered to the applicable infection protection regulations, in particular compliance with the minimum distance and the wearing of mouth-nose protection.
The on-site inspection measures were completed around 1:00 a.m.
In total, the officials noticed such structural changes in 10 vehicles that the operating license had expired.
Four of these vehicles had to be seized.
No car races
There were no illegal car races.
"The police headquarters of Middle Franconia will continue to keep an eye on what is happening and will continue to carry out increased control measures, also in connection with the emergence of onlookers," it said.
The agency News5 spoke with Jürgen Schrödinger from the towing company involved: "They all have beautiful rims, we must not scratch them," says Schrödinger.
Special tapes would be used for this.
Also because the cars are wider, the company must take care not to make any damage.
"After all, the young people should get their cars back unscathed."
Figures from the Employment Agency: 900 suspected cases of abuse in short-time work
Berlin - The Federal Employment Agency (BA) is looking into around 900 suspected cases of abuse of short-time working allowance.
"With more than 880,000 companies that have reported short-time work, this is extremely little," Daniel Terzenbach, the board member responsible for operations, told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.
When, at the beginning of the corona crisis, a large number of companies suddenly applied for short-time work, the BA had to react quickly.
Normally, the exam takes up to three weeks.
"We didn't have that much time in this hot phase.
The more closely we will take a closer look at the final accounts.
There will certainly be a lot more to come.
We are not naïve and have staying power."
Indications of abuse often come from the affected employees or trade unions.
In addition, the BA uses analysis software to identify patterns of abuse.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is preparing for a possible wave of insolvency in the autumn.
"Will there be significantly more insolvencies than in the previous year?
The assessments differ, but we are preparing ourselves for the worst-case event and are already training our employees in the employment agencies to process applications for insolvency money."
The figures are still inconspicuous, said Terzenbach.
World Heritage in Potsdam: Party in the New Garden dissolved
Potsdam - On Friday evening, about 40 young people celebrated a party in the New Garden.
The collection had been dissolved at 8.48 p.m. by the district drivers of the Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation (SPSG), the foundation said on PNN request.
The young people then left the park.
On Saturday evening, some young people would have played rugby in the New Garden.
The meadow had been cleared by district drivers, said SPSG spokesman Frank Kallensee on Sunday.
Again and again there are illegal celebrations in the parks
In the parks of the foundation, there are always accumulations in which the distance and hygiene rules Covid-19 handling ordinance are not observed.
At the end of June, there was a celebration with about 300 people in the Babelsberg Park, a week later about 150 people celebrated in the New Garden.
Even without a corona regulation, the parks will be closed at nightfall.
Camping on the meadows is prohibited according to the park regulations, there are only a few exceptions.
The foundation has been complaining for some time that visitors leave more and more garbage and destroy protected biotopes.
In Berlin, meanwhile, illegal park parties have reached another dimension.
In the Hasenheide in the district of Neukölln, 5000 people celebrated an illegal techno party on Sunday night.
The event was broken up by the police.
Austria: Mass tests after corona outbreak in tourist resort
With hundreds of tests, authorities have responded to a corona outbreak in the popular Upper Austrian tourist resort of St. Wolfgang.
The number of confirmed cases rose to 48, as the state authorities in Linz announced.
More than 100 results were still pending in the evening.
Accordingly, many of the infected are young interns in tourism companies, but at least one holiday guest was tested positive.
Residents, guests and tourism staff were asked to stay in their accommodations on Saturday evening.
The curfew was set at 11 p.m.
"There are cancellations and cancellations here and there" of bookings, said the head of the tourism association Wolfgangsee, Hans Wieser, the dpa.
Also, isolated guests had left prematurely.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist resort in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 overnight stays last year.
In a normal season, around a third of the guests are Germans.
On Friday, the first infections had become publicly known.
The head of the district authority, Alois Lanz, defended on Saturday the behavior of the interns, who had celebrated in several restaurants and could have been infected there.
"We all liked to do that in our youth," he told the radio station Ö1.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The Tourism Board launched an information campaign to raise awareness among young employees of the dangers of Covid-19.
From Saturday, hundreds of employees, holidaymakers and locals were tested.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang from 15 July were contacted.
The outbreak brings back memories of the Austrian ski and party resort of Ischgl in Tyrol, which was a center of the corona spread throughout Europe in the early stages of the pandemic.
In total, more than 1500 people in Austria are currently infected with the virus.
The focus of new infections is on Vienna and Upper Austria.
Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualified for Champions League
London (dpa) - The English football record champion Manchester United returns to the Champions League after a year of absence.
The Red Devils secured third place in the table on the last matchday of the Premier League with a 2-0 (0-0) victory against direct rivals Leicester City.
The Foxes now have to settle for the Europa League, because Chelsea FC still passed and qualified for the premier class in fourth place.
In the fight against relegation, Aston Villa was allowed to celebrate.
Manchester United took the lead through a penalty kick from Bruno Fernandes (71st minute).
After a red card for Leicester City in injury time, Jesse Lingard (90.+8) scored the final score.
Chelsea, opponents of FC Bayern in the Champions League knockout round, won thanks to Mason Mount (45.+1) and Olivier Giroud (45.+4) in parallel with 2:0 (2:0) against Wolverhampton Wanderers.
"That means a lot to me," said coach Frank Lampard, who is also in the FA Cup final against Arsenal in his first season as Chelsea coach.
Chelsea's win over Wolverhampton also benefited Tottenham Hotspur, who moved past Wolves with a meagre 1-1 (1-0) win at Crystal Palace and start sixth in the Europa League.
Aston Villa won the long-distance duel with Watford FC and AFC Bournemouth, but had to tremble at West Ham United for a long time for the class retention.
The late lead of Jack Grealish (84th) was immediately compensated for by Andrei Yarmolenko (85th).
The 1:1 (0:0) was enough, because Watford lost 2:3 (1:3) at Arsenal.
The club, which had three coaches in the season, is relegated after five years in the first division.
Just like Bournemouth, who could not save themselves by a 3-1 (2-1) at Everton FC.
In the end, a point was missing.
Liverpool FC, who have been English champions since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3-1 (1-1) win at Newcastle United.
99 points is the highest the Reds have ever scored in a football season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp and his team narrowly missed the points record in English football.
Manchester City holds the record with 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
After the Newcastle lead in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38th), Divock Origi (59th) and Sadio Mané (89th) turned Sunday's game around for Liverpool.
"It's been an extraordinary season for this wonderful club," said goal scorer van Dijk after the game, "that should spur us on to defend the title.
It's going to be hard."
In the end, the Premier League bosses should also be satisfied.
Due to the coronavirus crisis, football operations in England had been suspended from 13 March to 17 June.
In the meantime, there was even discussion about a premature termination or a hosting of the remaining games on neutral ground.
In the end, however, the season could be played to the end without any special incidents - but as in Germany without spectators in the stadiums.
Arrests and violence at demonstrations against Netanyahu
The protests in Israel against Prime Minister Netanyahu are becoming increasingly violent.
During the night, there were violent clashes.
The Israeli police violently attacked participants in a demonstration against the right-wing conservative Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem on Sunday night.
Twelve people were arrested for participating in riots, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said.
The police used, among other things, water cannons to break up the rally.
According to media reports, a total of around 6,000 people had gathered near Netanyahu's official residence on Saturday evening.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu's handling of the corona crisis.
The protesters beat drums, blew horns and called on Netanyahu to resign.
Participants in a counter-demonstration who supported Netanyahu were also arrested, the news site "ynet" reported.
People also demonstrated in many other places in Israel, including in front of the prime minister's private mansion in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
A man was arrested near Tel Aviv, according to police, because is suspected of spraying pepper spray from a moving car on protesters on the side of the road.
Another man was arrested after a knife attack on a protester in the south of the country.
The demonstrator had been slightly injured in the neck.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, there have recently been several demonstrations against Netanyahu.
The rallies accompany the corruption trial against the head of government.
Recently, Netanyahu has also been criticized for his handling of the corona crisis.
Among other things, he is accused of premature easing and a lack of preparation for a second corona wave.
The corona crisis has severely damaged the country's economy.
The unemployment rate was recently more than 20 percent.
The number of new infections with the coronavirus in Israel has recently risen to new record levels.
Accident near Ahlen (NRW) - Van crashes into car - nine injured - Ruhr area - Bild.de
Ahlen - A rear-end collision on Saturday afternoon on the B58 near Ahlen claimed nine slightly injured.
A motorist was with her two children (3, 5) in the direction of Beckum on the way.
The police: "Presumably she had suddenly braked because she wanted to turn".
The driver of a Mercedes van driving behind her must have seen this too late.
He crashed into the back of the car.
In the accident, three occupants in the car and six in the van were slightly injured.
Several ambulances took her to a nearby hospital.
North Korea seals off border town after Corona suspected case
North Korea has so far seen a "shining success" in its own measures to ward off the coronavirus.
Now the country is reporting for the first time on a suspected case.
Because of a first official corona suspected case in the country, North Korea has completely sealed off a major city for fear of a catastrophe.
Despite the strictest epidemiological defenses in the past six months, "the malignant virus may have been introduced into the country," state media reported.
For the region around the border town of Kaesong, the state of emergency had been imposed.
The communist leadership declared the highest alert level.
If confirmed, it would be the first official case of infection with Sars-CoV-2 in the isolated country.
North Korea has not yet registered a single infection and described its defensive measures as a "shining success".
The information was doubted abroad.
The symptoms of the disease were reportedly found in an "outlier" who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on July 19.
The person had left for South Korea three years ago and has now returned across the border.
For the border crossing within the four kilometers wide and mostly still mined military buffer zone, there was initially no confirmation from South Korea.
South Korea's military, however, admitted the possibility of an illegal border crossing to North Korea as high, according to reports by the national news agency Yonhap.
Investigations were carried out on some people.
North Korea called an emergency meeting of the Politburo of the Workers' Party chaired by leader Kim Jong Un on Saturday because of the suspected case.
The "dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive catastrophe."
Kim had already ordered on Friday as a preventive measure to "completely block Kaesong and isolate each district and the region from others," it said.
The affected person, as well as all people in Kaesong who had had contact with her, had been quarantined.
The central military commission of the party should therefore investigate the "outlier case" as well as the behavior of the responsible military unit and, if necessary, impose harsh punishment.
According to estimates, about 300,000 people live in Kaesong.
Tension ahead of Council meeting: City-Ost and noise protection are still up for discussion before the big summer break
"In addition to environmental issues, the committee members will also vote on the development plan for the large-scale inner-city development-east project," it says rather casually in the middle section of the municipal press release for the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, July 28, at 4:30 p.m. in the Great Hall of the CongressCentrum Pforzheim.
Above all, the upgrading of the eastern city, however, is controversially discussed until the end.
The majorities for this are narrow, most recently in individual committees depending on the presence even negative.
An appeal from the economy (construction, real estate, trade and IT) not to let the project developed from the citizenry and then by the administration and the municipal council fail after almost ten years of preparation, criticized project opponent Reinhard Klein as "extra-parliamentary opposition", "clueless", "speculation", "denigration" and "deliberate false statements".
"Everyone thinks they know better," says Klein, who has been the only representative of the Pforzheim Citizens' List for a year now.
In fact, after reading the treaties, he is in this position: "I know what I'm talking about.".
The exit will be cheaper for the city, the Technical Town Hall is contrary to statements of the city administration after grants, of whose existence Klein is convinced, to renovate for 8.5 million euros.
The city will develop very differently than predicted in the town hall and on the part of the supporters from the economy.
To shape the city by his own strength and not an investor: That is his plan B. One day after Klein, the FDP/FW/UB/LED parliamentary group, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
It also essentially provides for the renovation of the Technical Town Hall, the keeping of the Schloßberg open, the rental of the Ex-Thal for administrative areas and a smaller-scale redesign of the city centre ideally with local sponsors.
Environmental issues play a central role
In addition, environmental issues in particular will play a central role.
Among other things, the municipal council will vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the population of Pforzheim from health noise pollution caused by road traffic, including often speed reductions.
In a press release, the local traffic club Germany welcomes the widespread introduction of 30 km/h. However, the political leaders in the city are not innocent of the fact that this must happen, because they have contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus the noise by neglecting the regular bus service with thinned out intervals and by little commitment to cycling, according to the VCD.
The municipal council also votes on the participation of the city of the Energy and Climate Protection Agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
In addition, the agenda includes membership of the climate protection pact of the state of Baden-Württemberg, the redefinition of parental contributions in the municipal day care centers and the application for inclusion in the smart city funding of the federal government.
Citizens are welcome, but must heed corona protection measures.
Tim Zimmermann starts the new season with a lot of delay
With a delay of almost half a year, Tim Zimmermann will start his debut season in the ADAC GT Masters on 31 July.
Before the league of super sports cars can start regular operation, the first test drives were now due.
For Zimmermann, it was all about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3 better.
For a long time, the corona crisis prevented Tim Zimmermann from embarking on his first business trip in grasser Racing's new Lamborghini Huracan.
Under special hygiene conditions, this was now possible.
The 23-year-old from Langenargen completed his first laps at the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his debut in the GT3 car.
"There are already a few things that are different from the Porsche from the previous season," says Zimmermann.
"With ABS, for example, you have to go into the curves differently.
But it was really a lot of fun."
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite being only 25 years old, the Dutchman is already experienced in GT racing and was able to help his new team-mate in many things.
"I'm not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series brings new challenges," says Zimmermann.
"Steijn and I get along brilliantly and we have made enormous progress at the Lausitzring from session to session."
It is precisely there - at the Lausitzring - that the GT Masters will also be holding its first race.
From 31 July, the 33 super sports cars will race through Lusatia.
Zimmermann, who is one of 15 newcomers to the series, knows the track.
In 2015 he was last a guest at the Motodrom.
"It worked quickly and I didn't have to get used to the track very much," says Zimmermann, who competes for the Friedrichshafen racing community Graf Zeppelin.
"The Lausitzring has many fast passages that you have to hit optimally to be fast."
How fast Zimmermann really is then, that turns out in two weeks.
"Of course, the teams play a little poker in the tests," he says.
"In the end, however, we are very satisfied and are looking forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring."
The race in Brandenburg will be the prelude to a densely packed calendar.
There are seven races until the beginning of November.
The current state of affairs is that no spectators will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
In mid-August at the Nürburgring, ex-Formula 1 driver Niko Hülkenberg will take the GT wheel.
British Transport Secretary caught cold by quarantine decision
The British government's decision to quarantine Spain holidaymakers for two weeks after their return has caught the country's transport minister off guard, according to press reports.
Accordingly, Grant Shapps is currently on vacation in Spain, of all places, while his colleagues at home decided on Saturday the measure.
Due to the rising corona numbers in Spain, the cabinet in London removed the country from the list of countries from which entry without quarantine requirements is possible.
The new regulation will apply from today, Sunday, so Shapps will also have to quarantine after his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returnees.
But for those who are just on vacation, the rule does not apply until Saturday, August 1, and was not introduced overnight.
By the way, Spain is still considered one of the "safe countries" in Austria for which no quarantine in Austria is required.
"Many ministers must have known in advance that there is a possibility of a quarantine being imposed on holidaymakers in Spain," commented Labour MP Diane Abbot.
"But apparently no one bothered to tell Grant Shapps."
Less than a month after the end of the corona emergency in Spain and the expiry of the strict curfew, the number of infections in the country is rising again.
Virologists blame the nightlife for the renewed spread.
Spain is one of the favourite holiday destinations of the British.
The British government currently advises against unnecessary travel to the Spanish mainland, with the exception of the Canary Islands and Balearic Islands, which are particularly popular with British holidaymakers.
So far, more than 272,000 infections with the novel coronavirus and more than 28,000 deaths have been recorded in Spain.
Russia: Navy Day: Putin announces hypersonic weapons for warships
Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced that on the day of the Navy in his country, warships will be equipped with state-of-the-art hypersonic weapons.
With these weapons, which are unique in the world, the combat capabilities of the Russian naval forces would be expanded, Putin said on Sunday in St. Petersburg at the Central Naval Parade.
According to the Interfax agency, the Ministry of Defense also informed about successful tests of the Zirkon hypersonic missile built for the Navy.
The hypersonic weapons have a multiple of the speed of sound of around 343 meters per second.
They are considered weapons of the future.
Underwater tropicaleo continues to be built
Construction will also continue on the nuclear-equipped underwater torpedo Poseidon, it said.
The planned sea drone is planned to destroy coastal targets.
The president, who also sailed a military boat himself, said that this year alone, 40 new ships would be put into service with the individual fleet units of the largest country on earth.
Russia has a coastal area as large as no other country in the world.
For 300 years, the navy has been reliably protecting Russia, Putin said at the day celebrated by sailors nationwide.
In many other Russian coastal towns, the naval forces also celebrated Navy Day with parades.
In Syria, where Russia is fighting alongside ruler Bashar al-Assad, the military demonstrated strength at a weapons show in the Mediterranean port of Tartus.
Ammunition was also fired there.
A video released by the Ministry of Defense not only included warships, including a submarine, but also attack helicopters and jets.
Hurricane "Hanna" reaches Texas: Help made more difficult due to Corona
Washington - The first hurricane of this year's season over the Atlantic has made landfall in Texas.
Life-threatening flooding, strong winds and heavy rains now threaten parts of the US state, said the National Hurricane Center of the US climate agency NOAA in the night on Sunday (local time).
Governor Greg Abbott declared a state of emergency for numerous counties.
The corona pandemic rampant in Texas is complicating the work of the helpers, Abbott said, according to US media.
Evacuees urged to be careful
"Every hurricane is a tremendous challenge," Abbott said, according to the Houston Chronicle.
Referring to the Texas cyclone, he added, "This challenge is complicated and exacerbated when you consider it sweeps through an area that is the most affected area of the state by Covid-19."
According to Johns Hopkins University, around 5,000 people have died so far in Texas alone as a result of the corona pandemic.
Abbott called on people who would have to leave their homes to be careful.
They should not disregard practices "to which we have become accustomed," such as wearing masks, the governor said, according to CBS.
It is important that everyone keep their distance.
Therefore, hotel rooms have also been provided in some places.
In addition, in emergency shelters should be tested for Corona.
Damage had initially only been reported from the coastal town of Port Mansfield.
Storm warning withdrawn
With wind speeds of up to 150 kilometers per hour, "Hanna" had made land on padre Island immediately off the Texas coast, according to authorities.
The tropical storm had previously been upgraded to the lowest level one hurricane.
For the coastal section from Port Mansfield to Sargent, a storm surge warning was first issued and later withdrawn.
Authorities expected a slowdown, while "Hanna" moved further inland and headed for northeastern Mexico.
"Douglas" moves towards Hawaii
In the Pacific, Hurricane Douglas was on its way to Hawaii on Sunday night with wind speeds of around 150 kilometers per hour.
However, the hurricane center expected it to weaken further.
According to the forecast, it should be on Sunday (local time) near the largest islands of Hawaii - then as a storm just below the hurricane threshold.
Over the Atlantic, NOAA expected an above-average active hurricane season this year, according to a may forecast.
From June to the end of November, up to ten hurricanes are to be expected, of which up to six could become very strong hurricanes, the authority had said.
On average, there are six hurricanes per year over the Atlantic, three of which develop into storms of great strength.
In view of available climate data and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, the probability of a normal season is only 30 percent, that of a below-average even only ten percent, it was said at the time.
US President Donald Trump wrote via Twitter that his government is closely monitoring the storms and is in contact with the affected states.
Four goals denied: Video assistant "punishes" Sassuolo
Sassuolo's Filip Djuricic were denied two goals
Napoli - Four goals scored, four goals denied: Sassuolo Calcio experienced a raven-black evening in the 0-2 (0-1) at SSC Napoli in the Italian football league Serie A - and was really angry at the video assistant of the referee.
"A festival of not given goals for Sassuolo.
Never before has the VAR been so tough on a team," commented the "Corriere dello Sport".
Hosts Napoli had taken the lead through a goal by full-back Elseid Hisaj in the 8th minute, in the 32nd minute Filip Djuricic initially celebrated the equaliser.
The Video Assistant Referee (VAR) took the goal back because of an offside position.
Five minutes later, Djuricic shot the ball into the net again - again the VAR intervened.
The goals of attacker Francesco Caputo (50th) and Domenico Berardi (61st) were also taken back by the referee team after the VAR had pointed out.
In injury time, Allan made the final score 2-0 for Napoli and the bitter evening for Sassuolo perfect.
"The VAR is worse for Sassuolo than a radar trap on the road and punishes Sassuolo like no team before.
The new technology sets records," writes the "Gazzetta dello Sport".
FC Bayern Munich: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start of the hot preparation phase for the Champions League began for double winner FC Bayern with a setback.
Hansi Flick, who recovered "reasonably well" after a short holiday and a few days of training, has to think about how he can rebuild his successful defence after the injury of world champion Benjamin Pavard after the first team training.
The Frenchman, who has the third most minutes behind captain Manuel Neuer and midfield boss Joshua Kimmich, suffered a ligament injury to the left foot root and threatens to be missing in decisive premier class duels.
In Munich's muddy weather, the right-back broke off a training game and was driven off the course with a golf kart.
How long the unrestricted regular player has to pause in the fight for the title is open.
A deployment in the second leg of the second round against Chelsea FC on 8 August is likely to be difficult, the 24-year-old can hope for the final tournament starting on 12 August in Lisbon.
However, Bayern do not want to be stopped by the mishap from training on Sunday.
In his personal triple formula, Flick named the three attributes he wants to see from his stars on their way to Portugal's capital.
Quality, intensity and concentration should show his victory-hungry title collectors in the ideally following 28 days until the royal class final on 23 August.
"We have mastered the mandatory tasks with championship and cup simply excellently.
Now it's time to create something special," said Flick.
Until the Munich can deal with the final tournament and before a training camp in the Algarve concretely, but first the knockout round obligation against FC Chelsea is due.
After the 3-0 win in the first leg before the Corona break, the Londoners should not become a Bayern nightmare again in the home arena as in the lost "Finale dahoam" in 2012.
"We have to go through the door first.
We want to win, create good conditions and regain confidence with a good game," Flick demanded.
A test to get in the mood is scheduled for Friday against Olympique Marseille.
With a long speech, Flick had sworn his stars, who had 13 days of vacation after the double, to a unique August.
He welcomed 31 players to Säbener Straße, including the new players around edel-Einkauf Leroy Sané, who met all new colleagues on the pitch for the first time after his move from Manchester City.
"Leroy, like all the newcomers, has adapted well," Flick reported.
But instead of talking about the new season, when Sané &amp; Co. are no longer allowed to train only, Flick much preferred to talk about the current title project of the German series champion.
After days of individual and small group training, training is now being done in team strength for the Londoners, who, in contrast to the Flick ensemble, are in the rhythm of playing.
After that, the Munich could face a quarter-final against FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, in the semi-finals Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin are possible opponents.
A way to the final in Lisbon "is not quite so easy," emphasized the head coach, who can rely on the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training from Tuesday.
The World Cup record scorer Klose and Flick know from many a joint tournament preparation, what is particularly important in the 0-to-100 attunement.
With his current team, working is "a pleasure," praised Flick.
The "focus on winning" is an impressive trait of his team.
At the tournament with teams of nine on Sunday, it was also ambitious to the point.
All of the top performers were there, including Thiago and defender David Alaba, whose whereabouts beyond the premier class season are not guaranteed.
Formula 1 needs a special rule to crown its world champion
Since it is not possible to drive on the required number of continents, the FIA has to improvise in order to award the world titles.
All American races, however, were cancelled.
Race calendar is becoming more and more concrete
The racing calendar of the current Formula 1 season continues to take shape.
In addition to the ten confirmed Grand Prix so far, three more racetracks were added during the week.
In October, the race will take place at the Nürburgring in Germany and in Portimão, Portugal.
On the first of November, Lewis Hamilton and Co. will fight for Championship points on the traditional Italian race track in Imola.
This means that the 2020 race calendar currently comprises 13 races.
"We are pleased that we continue to make great progress in completing our plans for the 2020 season," said Formula 1 boss Chase Carey.
A total of 15 to 18 races in the premier class of motorsport are to be completed in this extraordinary season.
Formula 1 wants to conclude its season in Asia.
The final race calendar is to be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
According to media reports, appearances in Vietnam and Malaysia could still take place at the end of November before the already officially targeted races in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December.
Regulations require races on three continents
However, the regulations of Formula 1 require at least races on three continents for the awarding of the World Championship.
Even if, as currently planned, only two continents will be driven, there should be a world champion.
With the help of a special rule, the FIA wants to award the titles, citing "extraordinary circumstances" due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The traditional start of the season in Australia in March had to be cancelled at short notice due to the looming corona crisis.
A return to the continent this year is not an issue.
In addition, Formula 1 will not be a guest in America this year.
Cancellation meets with criticism in Brazil
Due to the tense corona situation, the races in Canada, the USA, Mexico and Brazil will not take place.
"We look forward to being back with them next season," Carey said.
The cancellation of the American races was met with criticism, especially in Brazil: "The cancellation did not come as a surprise to us, but we cannot accept the reasons for it," said Tamas Rohonyi, promoter of the Grand Prix in São Paulo.
For example, the number of infections in the São Paulo area is significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
The concerns of some teams that they do not want to race in Brazil would also not justify a cancellation.
One is prepared for the required security measures.
Greta Thunberg: Evil eye against Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest on Stephen Colbert's well-known late-night show via video link and revealed in an interview what she had in mind when she met Donald Trump.
Climativist Greta Thunberg was a guest on a popular US late-night show via video link.
Among other things, she told of her fight against the powerful of the world.
The teenager also spoke about her famous "evil eye" during her encounter with Donald Trump.
New York City - Over the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has attracted attention with her tireless commitment to the Fridays For Future movement.
Now she spoke on a well-known late-night show about her plans for the future as well as her encounter with US President Donald Trump at the UN climate summit last year.
Latenight host Stephen Colbert welcomed 17-year-old Thunberg to your show on Tuesday and conducted a lengthy interview with the Swede.
She spoke not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the powerful of the world.
"There are some things that surprised me," she said.
"How far people are going to shift the focus away from the climate crisis," she said.
"Everything from organized hate campaigns to threats just because a group of children take to the streets," she said.
She finds heads of state and leading politicians who mock her on social media or even try to silence her "funny" because the reactions show her "because they have no other answer".
It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview, when Greta Thunberg was asked about a well-known scene in which she cast a bitter look after US President Trump.
At the 2019 UN climate summit in New York, for which the nude artist sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive gaze was captured by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
The short clip resulted in a GIF, an animated image that ultimately became one of the most commonly used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think about the US president at that moment?
To Stephen Colbert's relatively open question, she replied only briefly and dryly: "To be honest, I don't think this needs any further explanation".
The experienced satirist Colbert had probably not expected the quick-witted answer and disappeared from the picture laughing briefly.
With her "How dare you?" speech on the principles of climate protection, she was remembered by many at the climate conference.
Ex-Dortmund real estate with three-pack for Lazio Rome
Ciro Immobile is now on a par with Bayern's Robert Lewandowski in the race for Europe's Golden Boot.
Former Dortmund player Ciro Immobile still has the best chance of becoming the top scorer in the Italian football championship.
The former BVB professional contributed three goals in Lazio Roma's 5-1 (1-1) win at Hellas Verona, including two converted penalties in injury time on both halves.
This means that the 30-year-old now has 34 goals to his name from fourth in the table two games before the end of the season - Robert Lewandowski of FC Bayern Munich scored just as many in the past Bundesliga season.
In Italy, Cristiano Ronaldo follows with 30 goals so far, the Portuguese superstar met with the leader in the evening against Sampdoria Genoa.
Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green died
His life was like a roller coaster ride: after a rapid ascent with Fleetwood Mac, it went steeply downhill and then slowly up again.
Now the blues rock guitarist Peter Green has died at the age of 73.
Brilliant guitarist, drug junkie, cult follower: The co-founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully in his sleep at the age of 73, family members said in an official statement on Saturday, with another statement announced for the next few days.
Top musicians such as Peter Frampton praised Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional reaction of a "monumental loss" for all former and current members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
The drummer Fleetwood and the guitarist Green had founded the now legendary band in London in 1967, and his dreamy instrumental hit "Albatross" is still unforgotten today.
The life of the musician ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") resembled a roller coaster ride.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated their greatest successes but then without him.
Among other things, there was a dispute because Green wanted to donate all the profits of the group to charity.
He began to appear in wide robes and with a large crucifix.
Psychological problems are also said to have played a role.
Just three years after its formation, Green left the band in 1970.
A social decline followed.
The blues rock guitarist suffered from substance abuse and schizophrenia, biographers reported.
For a long time, Green was treated in psychiatry.
During much of the 1970s, the musician disappeared from the scene.
He is said to have lived on the streets for a time, worked as a cemetery gardener and spent some time in an Israeli kibbutz.
Green was born in 1946 to a Jewish working-class family in the London borough of Bethnal Green.
From a young age he was enthusiastic about American blues musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At the age of eleven he learned the first guitar handles.
At the age of 15, the teenager began playing guitar professionally and five years later got the chance to be the lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners on stage.
A little later he was hired as a replacement for his idol Eric Clapton with the Bluesbreakers.
In the midst of the blues boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967 together with his Bluesbreakers colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross" composed by Green gave the group their first number 1 hit in the winter of 1968/69 and catapulted them to the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid rise soon showed its downsides: Green could not cope with the media hype, his experiments with the drug LSD became more and more extreme.
He later commented on life between music and addiction in an interview: "The worst thing that has happened to me in life are the drugs - the best thing was to land a number 1 hit".
Towards the end of the decade, Green surprisingly achieved a respectable success in 1979 with an album inspired by religious themes.
Fleetwood Mac, meanwhile, swam without him in a new formation on a wave of success.
Their 1977 album "Rumours" sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Despite various small solo successes, Green did not manage a major comeback until he started in 1996 with a group of musician friends.
The British "Daily Telegraph" spoke at the time of a rock star who had returned to earth.
Free of Drugs, Green released several albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group until the band disbanded in 2004.
For music experts, he was already a blues legend during his lifetime - and with his soft sound one of the most influential guitarists of the past decades.
