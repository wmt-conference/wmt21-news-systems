Biker reacts quickly and prevents worse
On Friday evening there was a traffic accident on the road between Machtolsheim and Merklingen in which a motorcyclist was only slightly injured thanks to his quick reaction.
Car driver overlooks bikers
A 44-year-old car driver wanted to turn left in her VW from Merklingen at around 9:30 p.m. onto Landesstraße 1230 in the direction of Machtolsheim.
In doing so, she overlooked the 24-year-old motorcyclist with right of way coming from the direction of Nellingen.
In the event of a collision, the hand and foot brake levers fly away
The biker tried to avoid the car, but still brushed against the rear of the vehicle.
The hand and foot brake levers on the Suzuki were torn off during the grazing process and the driver was no longer able to brake.
With presence of mind, he steered his motorcycle into the green strait next to the road and let it roll to a stop without falling.
Biker suffers leg injury
Due to the collision with the car, the biker nevertheless suffered an injury to his leg and had to be treated in a clinic.
Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 harvest workers infected
After a mass corona infection on a large vegetable farm in Mamming, Lower Bavaria, almost 500 people are under quarantine and are no longer allowed to leave the company.
A security service monitors the ban on going out.
A total of 174 harvest workers tested positive for the corona pathogen Sars-CoV-2 during the series check, as the Dingolfing-Landau district office announced on Saturday evening.
"To avoid further spread, we unfortunately have to take this step to protect the population," said District Administrator Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Seven employees had previously been infected in the company - this was the reason for the series test.
The business is a large vegetable farm that grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and beetroot - but the cucumbers are only for jars.
Mamming is a rural community with a good 3300 inhabitants not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW plant.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to remain calm: "According to our information, this is a closed group of people".
In the yard, infected and uninfected employees were separated, and the area is now surrounded by a barricade fence.
The Greens and the SPD gave the state government joint responsibility.
The two opposition factions accused Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet of neglecting the control of the accommodations of seasonal workers.
"That can take bitter revenge if such local infection incidents take hold and regional lockdowns have to be ordered," said Jürgen Mistol, the parliamentary manager of the Greens.
The SPD sees it very similarly: "After the Corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof slaughterhouse in mid-May, we already called for a special control program for farms with harvest workers," said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
"From our point of view, the hygiene conditions at the workplace and the living conditions must be strictly monitored.
That obviously didn't happen ".
The outbreak came "with announcement".
Aidenbachstraße underground station: Dangerous dispute: 19-year-old falls into the track bed after being pushed
In a dispute between two youth groups at the Aidenbachstrasse subway station, a 19-year-old fell through a push and slipped into the track bed.
Obersendling - On Friday there was a dispute between two youth groups at Aidenbachstrasse underground station at around 4.15 p.m.
A passer-by alerted the police, who advanced with several patrols.
According to initial investigations, a man from Munich (17) pushed a 19-year-old to the ground.
The young man slipped over the edge of the platform and fell into the track bed.
People from the group of the 17-year-old helped the fallen victim to climb off the track.
There was no danger from an approaching train.
According to the police, there were then again clashes between the two people.
The 17-year-old initially fled the crime scene, but his personal details could be determined afterwards.
Accompanied by his father, he went to police station 29.
The 17-year-old is being investigated for assault.
Report: Seehofer is pushing for longer data retention
Data retention is currently suspended.
According to a media report, however, Federal Interior Minister Horst Seehofer calls for an extension of the storage period.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
According to a media report, Federal Interior Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) calls for extended data retention - instead of the planned ten weeks, six months.
As the "Bild am Sonntag" reports, Seehofer asked Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht (SPD) in a letter for a quick change in the law.
Seehofer therefore wants to strengthen the measures against child abuse.
He thinks it makes sense to "make urgently needed adjustments to the law now," the newspaper quotes from the letter.
Data retention is currently suspended.
A decision by the ECJ is expected.
But Seehofer wants the changes beforehand so that they can be applied immediately after a possible positive judgment, the report continues.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice told the newspaper that it would only be possible to meaningfully examine whether legal adjustments were necessary once the courts had decided.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer and the interior ministers of the federal states had already spoken out in favor of data retention in June.
NBA: Strip club trouble for Clippers star Lou Williams
Excitement in the NBA!
Lou Williams (33), professional basketball player for the Los Angeles Clippers, is said to have left the tournament quarters at Disney World in Orlando / Florida with permission for a funeral.
According to US media reports, he went to the "Magic City" strip club in Atlanta in the evening.
Williams, who is said to have admitted the visit according to ESPN information, is back in isolation and is tested daily for Covid-19.
His reason for visiting: chicken wings.
Last February, "Sweet Lou", as he is known in the NBA, already expressed his love for these wings.
The American wrote: "Magic City and Blue Flame (another strip club in Atlanta, editor's note) have the best wings in town".
NBA insider Shams Charania announced on Twitter on Sunday that the NBA Williams has ordered a ten-day quarantine.
This means that the Clippers star missed the first two official games after the test game phase.
In Disney World, the NBA wants to end the corona season.
The best 22 teams are currently preparing for the season finale, which begins on Friday night, with training matches.
Söder comments on the corona situation after a mass infection
Munich - Health Minister Melanie Huml (CSU) announced a test offensive for large farms on Sunday.
The press conference can be seen live on our homepage.
The case in Mamming in the Dingolfing-Landau district has alarmed authorities and politicians.
Almost 500 harvest workers from several countries are currently working on the large vegetable farm, and over a third have been infected with the corona pathogen.
The yard is now under quarantine and is cordoned off with a construction fence.
Nobody is allowed to leave the premises, food is being delivered.
The authorities are now offering free corona tests to the good 3,300 residents of the community.
Since the harvest workers had little contact with the local population, the district office has so far assumed that the infections have not spread beyond the courtyard.
"Remorse": Confession of the alleged arsonist of Nantes
"My client has shown itself to be cooperative," said lawyer Quentin Chabert of the newspaper.
The defense attorney added: "He deeply regrets the acts, the confession was a release for him".
His mandate was "plagued by remorse and deeply affected by the extent of the destruction."
If convicted, the man faces ten years imprisonment and a fine of 150,000 euros, according to the prosecutor.
The Gothic Saint Peter and Paul Cathedral in Nantes was badly damaged in a fire on Saturday night.
The fire had broken out in three widely separated places in the church.
Laboratory tests confirmed the suspicion of arson.
The now detained suspect was arrested a few hours after the fire.
However, he was released a day later.
The man works as a volunteer for the diocese of Nantes and was responsible for closing the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
Since there was no trace of a violent intrusion into the church, he quickly came into focus of the investigators.
Discuss the abolition of the 50 + 1 rule
Former DFB President Reinhard Grindel recommended thinking about abolishing the 50 + 1 rule.
"German football should at least discuss conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates a fait accompli," said Grindel of "Bild am Sonntag".
He emphasized: "For the clubs that are most likely to be dangerous for Bayern and Dortmund, the 50 + 1 rules do not work anyway: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, one cannot avoid the debate as to whether it is not advisable to facilitate the involvement of investors for associations that want to break into this phalanx ".
But he had doubts whether there was a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority holdings, which are prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50 + 1 rule.
"It remains a legal risk to draw investment fences around the Bundesliga as a business location in a single European market," said Grindel.
The former DFB boss sees the danger that "the attempts to ensure a more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will ultimately only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but will not lead to more tension in the championship".
Even an even distribution of TV money will not have a decisive effect.
"FC Bayern has a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million.
The differences between the first three clubs alone are immense.
The other 15 clubs have an average budget of 130 million, "said the 58-year-old.
Looking at the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Unfortunately, there have been people who have noticed this mistake and pierced the press instead of asking me about it," said Grindel about the acceptance of an expensive watch that led to his resignation in April 2019.
"I was very concerned about that as a human being."
He had received the gift worth around 11,000 euros from a Ukrainian official.
"I committed a compliance violation and it was the right thing to do with it," said Grindel.
"I handled the ominous watch present in a completely transparent and innocent manner.
Many in the DFB knew about it ".
He never "made a secret of the gift," assured the 58-year-old.
"One might call that naive, in any case this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption".
"Black Lives Matter": injured and one dead
The protests against police violence in the United States have come to a head in several cities with Donald Trump's deployment of federal police officers.
On Saturday there were clashes between demonstrators and police officers in various cities.
Three people were injured in Louisville and 16 people arrested in Seattle.
In Austin, a person was shot dead while a march was crossing an intersection.

Three people were injured when a member of a group that describes itself as the Black American Armed Alliance fired a shot on Saturday.
According to the broadcaster NBC, they were taken to the hospital.
None of them was in mortal danger.
The police put up barricades because counter-demonstrators from a white militia had also formed.
In the end, the two groups did not meet.
In Austin, Texas, a person was shot and killed during a "Black Lives Matter" demonstration.
The police said they took a suspect into custody.
So far, she has not given any further information on the circumstances of the crime.
Mayor Steve Adler said, according to the New York Times, that he was, like many in the city, "heartbroken and stunned" about what had happened.
In the American metropolis of Seattle, protesters clashed with the police on Saturday.
They set construction trailers on fire in front of a youth prison, and the police used stun grenades and pepper spray.
According to the Seattle Times, 16 people were arrested for resisting police officers or assaulting them.
A courthouse was set on fire in the city of Oakland, California.
A small group of protesters broke windows, shot down fireworks and blinded police officers with lasers, the Oakland police said late Saturday evening (local time).
The fire was quickly extinguished.
In Aurora, a suburb of Denver, Colorado, a car drove through a crowd demonstrating on a freeway.
Police said one of the protesters fired a gun and at least one person was injured and taken to hospital.
In addition, windows were broken in a courtroom and a fire was started, the police said.
Investigations have started.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: historical costumes defy Corona
Although there was no big party in the spa town, visitors and performers enjoyed the rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, performers and organizers: the Rakoczy weekend without the Rakoczy festival.
But: Even if the big party mile in the city center was missing, the crowds and program highlights such as the hall on fire, the Rakoczy Ball or the pageant, many got their money's worth with the Corona-compliant alternative program.
"I think we have succeeded in spreading Rakoczy flair," says spa director Sylvie Thormann.
The guests would have accepted it well.
In principle, one goes back to the beginnings of the Rakoczy festival, when the historical focus was also solely on the festival.
Pleasant atmosphere
Vesna Konhäuser and her husband have been visiting Bad Kissingen for the Rakoczy Festival for more than 25 years.
So this time in the Corona year.
The couple has made themselves comfortable at the Luitpold Casino, watching the historical while strolling and listening to live Cuban music at the casino restaurant.
"I also find it very pleasant," says Konhäuser.
You miss the crowds, who otherwise don't belong to Rakoczy.
But she misses the usual program highlights, especially the Saale burns on Friday evening and the historic pageant and the final fireworks on Sunday evening.
"That's a shame.
The weather would have been great this year, "she says.
Rakoczy horse show is to take place again
For the performers of the historical spa guests, the alternative program sometimes meant more work.
For Christina Gold, for example, who takes part in the pageant in a normal year and can be seen there on the carriage of the Kurgartencafé.
This year she walked around town in costume on Saturdays and Sundays.
"It's more strenuous, otherwise it will be easier for us," she says.
The riding club had less to do, even when individual riders were out and about in the park.
"We very much hope that the equestrian quadrille can take place again next year," says chairwoman Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that after a break of several years, a rakoczy horse show would take place again in 2021.
28 Corona cases at Spanish second division club Fuenlabrada
The Spanish second division soccer club CF Fuenlabrada is slipping deeper and deeper into the crisis due to a corona outbreak.
Since the newcomer from near Madrid flew to a game in the city of A Coruña on July 20, despite the first Corona cases, one low blow has followed the next.
By Sunday, 28 players or team members had tested positive, one came to the hospital, the club announced.
Fuenlabrada from the city of the same name south-west of Madrid still had the chance to reach the promotion playoffs.
Now there is even a risk of relegation to the B group of the second division.
The game against Deportivo La Coruña last Monday was canceled at the last moment, the public prosecutor's office is investigating a possible crime against public health, and the supreme sports authority CSD is considering the club's forced relegation.
The players and other team members are quarantined in a hotel.
"By the sixth day of quarantine, they did not receive a fresh towel or gel," wrote the sports newspaper "AS".
The photos show how players hung their underwear and club clothes to dry in their hotel rooms after they apparently had to wash them themselves.
The bed linen was also not changed for five days.
Another problem is the food.
"AS" wrote that it was neither good nor sufficient.
The club management announced, however, that they were satisfied with the hotel.
The club's lawyer, Javier Tebas Llanas, dismissed allegations of deliberately endangering public health.
The son of the president of the Spanish Primera Division, Javier Tebas, emphasized that the Europa Press news agency and the sports newspaper "Marca" reported that the corona rules set up by the football association were not violated.
Before departure, there were four infected people up to July 19, but they were all isolated and did not travel.
Immediately before the flight to A Coruña on Monday, all players and team members were tested again.
When the team was already in A Coruña, the corona test was positive for "five or six" other team members.
The game was canceled 60 minutes before kick-off, said Tebas Llanas.

Professional cyclist Tony Martin: career continuation imaginable
Time trial specialist Tony Martin is thinking about continuing his career.
Frankfurt / Main - The seven-time world time trial champion Tony Martin can certainly imagine continuing his cycling career.
"I am currently setting out the framework conditions with the team, how and in what form it could continue," said the 35-year-old of the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung".
Martin is currently employed by the Dutch team Jumbo-Visma and had considered ending his career after this year before the Corona break.
Negotiations with his team are also about the number of days of racing, he said.
Or other problems that would plague him as a family man, said Martin.
He used to get up after a fall and the first thought was: "Get back on your bike quickly.
Today, as the father of a little daughter, I think: what if ".
The professional cyclist admitted that there are certain aspects with which he is finding it increasingly difficult.
"But it was good for me to use the Corona period to see what I got about cycling and how much fun it was for me."
The time trial specialist will be back in competition at the Tour de l'Ain (August 5th to 9th).

Kovac tests with Monaco against Frankfurt
Frankfurt / Main (dpa) - For soccer coach Niko Kovac there will soon be a reunion with Eintracht Frankfurt with his new club AS Monaco.
The eight-time French champion will make a guest appearance on August 1 (6:00 p.m.) at the Hessians, the Croatian’s former club.
For the Bundesliga club, it is the first and only endurance test before the second leg in the Europa League against FC Basel (August 6).
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the encounter will be held without a spectator.
"We're particularly looking forward to this game.
It's always nice to come to Frankfurt and meet friends, "explained Kovac.
The 48-year-old said it was an interesting test from a sporting point of view.
Before moving to FC Bayern Munich, Kovac had coached the Hessians from 2016 to 2018 and led them to victory in the DFB Cup.
"A top-class opponent like Monaco is a good test for us with regard to the game against Basel.
Like everyone in Frankfurt, I'm looking forward to seeing Niko Kovac again, "said Eintracht coach Adi Hütter.
The 50-year-old Austrian had succeeded the Croatian at Eintracht.
In March, the Frankfurt team lost the first leg of the last 16 against Basel in their own stadium 3-0.

Argentina rejects counter-offer from creditors
The Ministry of Economics in Buenos Aires announced on Saturday that the new requirements could not be met.
"That would not only be irresponsible, but also unjust," it said in a statement.
"While 50 percent of the children in Argentina live in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors."
The debts of the second largest economy in South America are no longer sustainable under the current conditions.
Argentina is therefore calling on its private creditors to forego some of their claims of around 66 billion US dollars (around 59 billion euros).
If no agreement is reached, the country is threatened with bankruptcy again.
It would be the ninth payment default in Argentine history.
Most recently, the lenders had demanded higher interest rates on government bonds and changes to some contractual clauses.
The Argentine government is sticking to its last offer and is not prepared to make any further concessions.
Argentina is in a serious financial and economic crisis.
The inflation rate was recently more than 50 percent.
For the current year, experts anticipate a decline in economic power of around ten percent.
At the end of May, Argentina had failed to settle $ 503 million in interest receivable, slipping into a limited default.
Arrived professionally - not yet privately
"It's going really well" - this is the conclusion drawn by Dr. Stefanie Kramer after her first days at the notary's office in Eggenfelden.
In the end everything went very quickly: In mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer found out that she will succeed Lutz Feller in the Eggenfelden notary's office.
Just six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the doctor of law started work, and normal day-to-day business has long been in full swing.
"I still have to arrive privately," she explains in an interview with the Rottaler Anzeiger and laughs.
The short lead time was of course not enough to completely relocate the center of life from Regensburg to Eggenfelden, reports the native of Dingolfing.
She and her husband, who works as a judge at the regional court in Regensburg, are currently looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city.
At least her husband was able to apply for parental leave at short notice in order to be able to take care of the two daughters (3½ and 1½ years old).
In order not to have to commute from Regensburg every day, she also has an overnight stay with her parents in Dingolfing, explains the 39-year-old.
Growing up in the neighboring district, she has of course long been familiar with the city of Eggenfelden.
During visits on site with her family over the past few months, she said again: "Eggenfelden is a really beautiful small town".
She was all the more pleased that she won the competition for the vacancy in the selection process.
Also in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's professional career plays a central role in her home town of Lower Bavaria: after studying law in Passau, she completed her legal clerkship and the 2nd state examination in Regensburg.
After several positions as a notary assessor, including in Rehau and Hof in Upper Franconia, Babenhausen in Unterallgäu and Regensburg - during this time she also shouldered her doctorate in labor law "on the side" - she started her first position as a notary in Rotthalmünster in the Passau district in 2012 at.
In 2016 she took parental leave and finally moved to Regensburg.
Since then she has taken on representation services in various notary offices.
When the position in Eggenfelden was advertised due to the approaching retirement of Lutz Feller, she saw the right time for a full return to work, explains the 39-year-old.
The team of her predecessor, who will take over the vacation replacement in the notary's office in the future, has Dr. Stefanie Kramer has taken over completely - and has ready praise for the team at the law firm: "It's going really well!"
The fact that she can rely on well-rehearsed processes makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming relocation of the private center of life.
She has already contacted a local institution about kindergarten or daycare places.
And if everything goes as planned, she hopes to be able to pursue her hobby here soon - and get to know the most beautiful jogging routes in the Rottal.
BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be 20 percent full at the start of the season if fans return.
"Due to the distance regulation, which must be strictly observed, we are currently planning with 12,000 to 15,000 spectators," said Borussia Dortmund's managing director Carsten Cramer the "Tagesspiegel".
Normally, the arena in the Revierstadt holds a little more than 81,000 spectators for Bundesliga games.
In the ghost games caused by the corona pandemic last season, BVB lost around four million euros per game.
Cramer, who is responsible for marketing, digitization and internationalization at BVB, hopes that, in addition to the normal spectator seats, some of the approximately 4,000 seats in the hospitality area can be opened again: "Of course, it is a blow to the office if this income breaks down completely".
In view of the ongoing Corona crisis, everyone is currently "well advised to take a stable page first".
"If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people in Germany alone are on short-time work, then the need for entertainment is limited," explained Cramer.
The Dortmund marketing boss praised the BVB professionals for their partial salary waiver, which should help to overcome the crisis: "Of course, the players know that their salary waiver has a different effect than if we 100 people who work in merchandising, on Set short-time work ".
Tiny miracles: an early start in life with a few hundred grams
Hardly heavier than a packet of butter, just three tablespoons of blood in his entire body: That was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The boy is one of around 400 premature babies who are cared for every year at the Graz Children's Clinic.
A quarter of them weigh less than 1,500 grams, a few - like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael - are extremely lightweights with a birth weight of less than one kilogram.
They are so small and born so prematurely that neither the lungs, nor the intestines, nor the muscles are fully developed.
Your skin is sometimes so tender that it could damage the electrodes on an EKG.
And they are so tiny that they sometimes wear doll clothes and mini diapers made especially for them.
But not so small that they are out of tune - "and how", grins Berndt Urlesberger.
"Even if they don't scream as loudly as big babies, of course."
When the whiteboard becomes a stage
Despite Corona theater in the classroom: The 9th grade of the Sankt-Jakobus-Gymnasium in Abtsgmünd experienced the whiteboard as a stage shortly before the start of the holiday.
Actress Julia Sylvester from the theater of the city of Aalen presented the production "Das Heimatkleid" to the students - via video.
Afterwards, the students were able to talk to the actress and director Winfried Tobias about the play and the performance via Skype.
The idea for the performance format was born from the current Corona situation.
Teacher Teresa Nar was delighted with the enrichment of the class.
Even if in the end everyone involved agreed that direct encounters in the theater and stage would offer additional stimuli, the theater also shows the potential for contact with schools.
"If we continue to improve the technical framework, it could be an interesting addition to gaming operations," emphasized director Winfried Tobias.
First round drawn: TSV 1860 would meet Eintracht Frankfurt in the DFB Cup

"Road to Timmendorf": Beach volleyball: Thole / Wickler miss the final on comeback
The World Cup runners-up Julius Thole and Clemens Wickler missed the finals at the beach volleyball tournament "Road to Timmendorf".
At the meeting of the top teams in Düsseldorf they were defeated in the semifinals by their national team colleagues Nils Ehlers and Lars Flüggen with 1: 2 (17:21, 21:17, 19:21).
Thole / Wickler last played at the World Tour Final in Rome in September last year.

Kalbitz expulsion from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "fig leaf"
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is, from the FDP's point of view, only a "fig leaf" and does not change the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the right-wing extremists in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the tip of the radical iceberg in the AfD, "said FDP domestic politician Benjamin Strasser of the dpa news agency in Berlin.
The Federal Arbitration Court of the AfD had confirmed the exclusion of Kalbitz on Saturday in Stuttgart after several hours of negotiations, which the federal board had decided by a majority in May.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD parliamentary group in the Brandenburg state parliament.
"If the AfD really wanted to consistently remove right-wing extremists from their party, functionaries like Björn Höcke and his supporters would have long since been excluded," said Strasser.
"But there is no political will in the AfD because right-wing extremism is now part of the party."
CSU General Secretary Markus Blume expressed himself in a similar way: "The fact that Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded says nothing and does not change anything," he told the "Welt am Sonntag".
"Rather, it speaks volumes how many frenetic supporters a right-wing extremist in the middle of the AfD still has."
Blume assumes that the AfD will end up below five percent again in future elections.
"The days of the AfD in parliaments are numbered".
Kalbitz was one of the spokesmen for the officially disbanded "wing" around the Thuringian AfD state and parliamentary group leader Björn Höcke; the Office for the Protection of the Constitution classifies the denigration as "secured right-wing extremist efforts".
In May, the AfD national board had thrown Kalbitz out of the party.
The reason he gave was that when he joined the party, Kalbitz had not given a previous membership in the now banned right-wing extremist "Heimattreuen Deutschen Jugend" (HDJ) and the Republicans.
Kalbitz denies membership in the HDJ.
The chairman of the left-wing parliamentary group in the Brandenburg state parliament, Sebastian Walter, also emphasized that the decision of the federal arbitration court did not change anything in the character of the AfD: "The wolf only ate chalk.
The AfD remains a right-wing extremist party, with or without Kalbitz ".
Neither the federal party nor the right wing will be weakened by this decision.
"The maneuver of the Meuthen troop is transparent.
They want to avoid further observation by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution and try to get through under the radar, "said Walter.
"The AfD is not getting rid of the ghosts it called.
An expulsion doesn't change anything, "commented the Brandenburg SPD General Secretary Erik Stohn on the decision in the Kalbitz case.
"Here the AfD regional association and the parliamentary group up to this day stuck to their right-wing leader".
The legal dispute over Kalbitz's membership in the AfD will continue.
This announced on Saturday that he would now proceed against the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court under civil law.
North Sea wind farms deliver a good 21 percent more electricity
The wind power plants on the German North Sea fed 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity into the grid in the first six months of the year.
That is a good 21 percent more than in the same period of the previous year, announced the network operator Tennet in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of the North Sea electricity to the mainland and the transmission through the German power grid.
The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of the Tennet grid area, have fed in a further 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
Overall, wind power from the North Sea and Baltic Sea thus comes to 13.73 TWh, compared to a good 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind harvest at sea makes up almost 19 percent of the total wind power in Germany; that is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms ensure higher generation capacities
The increased contribution of offshore wind energy results from the wind conditions and from higher generation capacities because new wind farms have been connected to the grid in the past twelve months.
If the 1270 wind power plants in the North Sea were all running at full power at the same time, they could theoretically generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient for this; According to Tennet, it is 7.1 gigawatts.
It is expected to increase to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea by 2030.
"In Germany and the Netherlands we will invest 20 billion euros in the expansion of the offshore grid connections", said Tennet managing director Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, wind farms cannot fully utilize their capacity at sea either, but reach around 40 percent.
The record day so far this year is January 2, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind turbines produce around 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, which corresponds to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could supply almost seven million households with electricity.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the Gmünder Kunstverein.
That was almost a small anniversary celebration for the 130th
Birthday of the Gmünder Kunstverein: The opening of the exhibition "Skirmish" with works by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold went beyond the usual scope after the Corona break.
Much more art lovers than usual followed the dialogue between the artist and the chairman of the art association, Professor Dr. Klaus Ripper.
The musical equivalent was provided by the band "Defenders of the Universe" on the southern Kornhausplatz.
The association "Sandtogether" got involved to the north of the gallery.
Freital: Windbergfest canceled due to Corona
The Windbergfest does not take place this year.
The city of Freital has canceled the three-day festival planned for September.
In other years, over 30,000 people had attended this city festival.
"We really did not make this decision easy for ourselves and - knowing how difficult it is economically for those involved - we hoped until the last minute," said Mayor Uwe Rumberg (non-party).
"But in the end we as the organizer are responsible for the health of many thousands of people".
Because if tens of thousands had poured into the festival area and the marquee, minimum distances, hygiene regulations and contact tracking in accordance with the current corona protection ordinance would not have been able to be observed.
Or the restrictions would have been so severe that not much would have been left of a folk festival.
In addition, the organizational and monitoring effort would increase disproportionately many times over.
Rumberg put off until next year.
Then the city of Freital will celebrate its 100th anniversary with the Winterbergfest from May 7th to 9th, 2021 and the Saxon Day from September 10th to 12th, 2021
You can't beat the Olympic dressage champion Werth in Achleiten
Achleiten - The six-time Olympic champion Isabell Werth was the outstanding rider at the dressage tournament in Achleiten, Austria.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg had four wins in four starts at the weekend.
After winning a Grand Prix each with Weihegold and Quantaz at the start, she was unbeatable on Sunday in the Grand Prix Special and in the Freestyle.
On the 15-year-old mare Weihegold, Werth clearly beat the Austrian Victoria Max-Theurer on Abegglen in the special on Sunday.
In the freestyle on Saturday, the German was clearly ahead of her 34-year-old student Victoria Max-Theurer on Quantaz.
Werth's winning horse, Quantaz, belongs to Max-Theurer.
The most successful dressage rider in the world should establish the ten-year-old stallion in the Grand Prix.
For Quantaz it was the first freestyle ever.
At the first tournament in Achleiten three weeks ago, Werth had already won all four important tests.
The last of the three international tournaments is planned there for August 14th to 16th.
More air traffic controllers in Worms in future
The University of Applied Sciences in Worms continues to take off: The "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" is donating a professorship for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the university and DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially concluded for three years and will start in 2021.
The professorship gives you the opportunity to start your studies not only in the summer but also in the winter semester.
This means that twice as many students can be trained as before.
At the same time, the capacities at both the university and the DFS air traffic control academy are being used evenly.
The DFS will advise the university on establishing and filling the professorship.
Represented at the university since 2019
Since the summer semester of 2019, the first students have been studying air traffic management at the University of Worms as part of their training to become air traffic controllers.
Nine students have already started this year.
So far, the experiences at DFS have been very positive, the performance of the students is excellent.
The combination of studies and pilot training makes a significant contribution to further increasing the attractiveness of the pilot profession.
"In these times, funding is not easy for us economically.
However, we firmly anticipate that air traffic will recover and grow again in the long term.
In order to be able to continue to fulfill our legal mandate in the future, we need highly qualified staff, "says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, Chairman of the DFS Managing Director when signing the contract.
"For DFS, the endowed professorship is a future-proof investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, interdisciplinary knowledge base in the long term.
We are therefore continuing our good cooperation with the university and at the same time reinforcing our attractiveness as an employer ".
This is also underlined by Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of the University of Worms: "The endowed professorship forms an important bridge between science and business.
With her, we would like to build on the already existing cooperation with DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual bachelor's degree in Air Traffic Management ".
The trust of the German air traffic control system is both a motivation and an obligation for the University of Worms to further develop its teaching and research skills in the future fields of air traffic.
With the first endowed professorship for a dual course of study, the university can set very special highlights and innovative focal points for its students when working for the air traffic controllers of tomorrow.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary in the Ministry of Science, Further Education and Culture, emphasizes: "The University of Worms, with its focus on air traffic, has a unique selling point in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Today's signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the profile of the university ".
Rescue helicopter lands on the A 45
The A 45 motorway in the direction of Aschaffenburg was completely closed for around 30 minutes on Saturday afternoon, as the rescue helicopter was in action after a traffic accident.
A 76-year-old drove in a Ford at about 12.40 p.m. at the Alzenau-Mitte exit straight ahead in the curve and landed on the guardrail.
The front airbags were triggered by the impact, the driver suffered minor injuries to the face and had to be taken to a hospital for treatment.
The injuries of the 72-year-old passenger were treated by the emergency doctor and the patient was then flown to a hospital by rescue helicopter.
However, the police are currently assuming that there is no danger to life.
The damaged vehicle, which was damaged by around 2000 euros, had to be towed away.
After the meat industry, Heil wants to examine other industries
The Corona crisis brought the conditions in parts of the meat industry to light again.
Law tightening is imminent.
But are they legal - and will it stay that way?
Federal Labor Minister Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to review other industries according to the strict regulations now planned against abuses in the meat industry.
"We will look at each branch and then take appropriate measures for the respective branch if necessary," said Heil to the German press agency in Berlin.
Germany's employers are already warning against generally restricting work contracts.
After the massive corona outbreak at the meat giant Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the federal cabinet wants to pass a law of salvation this Wednesday.
Large slaughterhouses should no longer be allowed to use external personnel for slaughtering, cutting and meat processing.
For this purpose, the use of contract workers and temporary workers is to be prohibited there.
Employer President Ingo Kramer told the dpa: "Stay away from a general restriction of work contracts and temporary employment, if you do not want to completely stall the economy".
Contracts for work and services are, for example, the basis for creating value for customers in large areas of the trades, the construction industry and plant engineering.
"The misconduct of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument".
Heil assured: "My goal is not to ban contracts for work and services everywhere in the German economy".
Work contracts are useful.
"If an industrial company hires a craftsman to install a security system, it is a completely normal work contract".
The German meat industry considers a ban on work contracts and temporary work to be unconstitutional in its sector alone.
It cannot be explained why different labor laws should apply to portioning and packaging of cheese than to sausage, according to a statement on the proposed law, as reported by the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Saturday).
In the event of a ban, the consumer price would rise by 10 to 20 percent per kilo and product.
According to the results of an audit by the NRW occupational health and safety administration, many Eastern European employees from contract companies worked 16 hours a day in the industry.
Often they did not have a break.
Wages were withheld for protective equipment or rent.
It was also found that the housing situation for employees was often miserable.
Heil said that a relatively strict law came into force for the meat industry as early as 2017.
However, these were bypassed by "tricky constructions".
"Now we have to clean up fundamentally".
The politician announced: "In the labor protection law, which we want to pass in the cabinet at the end of July, there are also measures that not only affect the meat industry - for example higher inspection rates for occupational health and safety or clear criteria for shared accommodation".
The draft presented to the dpa includes changes to the law on safeguarding workers' rights in the meat industry and the law on occupational health and safety.
Brandenburg's consumer protection minister Ursula Nonnemacher (Greens) considers more intensive controls to be necessary.
"I would like to see that we can do even more controls in many areas of supervision: food controls, animal welfare, all sorts of things, including animal transport," said Nonnemacher on Sunday in the RBB program "Brandenburg aktuell".
But more staff positions are needed for more controls.
Three dead in an ultralight aircraft crash in Germany
According to the police, three people died when an ultralight aircraft crashed into an apartment building in Wesel in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia.
One child was slightly injured.
Two other people were saved injured in the accident, said a spokesman for the Wesel district control center.
A parachute was found at the scene of the accident, the police said.
The "Rheinische Post" reported, citing eyewitnesses, that the plane collided with a hot air balloon before the crash.
The house is a one- or two-family house.
Further details were not initially known.
Clearance of Frankfurter Opernplatz proceeded peacefully
A week after the riots in Frankfurt, the evacuation of the Opernplatz on Sunday night was peaceful.
Most recently, a few dozen people were still in the square, but left before curfew at 1 a.m.
The police had been on duty with numerous officers since the early evening, and a large number of police could be seen throughout the city.
For the first time this weekend from midnight there was a ban on entering the Opernplatz, where there had been riots a week ago.
Police officers were attacked with bottles from among the crowd.
At least five officers were injured according to police reports and several police vehicles were damaged.
The Saturday night had also remained quiet.
Car overturns: Young woman seriously injured in accident on federal highway 83 near Hofgeismar
In an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme, a 21-year-old suffered serious injuries on Sunday around 1:25 p.m.
She was brought to the Kassel Clinic.
The fire brigade looked for possible passengers with thermal imaging cameras.
According to the police, the woman was on the federal road 83 in the direction of her home town of Hümme when her car came off the road for an unexplained cause and rolled over several times.
In order to save the victim, the fire brigade had to cut open the roof of the car.
Since it was unclear whether someone was still in the vehicle, the adjacent corn field was searched from the turntable ladder with a thermal imaging camera.
The drone squadron from Warburg, which also works with thermal imaging cameras, was ordered to search for people.
However, the emergency services did not find anyone among the tall maize plants.
The seriously injured was taken to the Kassel Clinic for further treatment by ambulance.
Almost 50 emergency services from the Hofgeismar, Hümme and Schöneberg fire brigade were on site.
The federal highway was closed for two hours because of the accident.
Juventus Turin champions in Italy
Turin - After a redeeming goal from Cristiano Ronaldo, record champions Juventus Turin have secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in a row.
The team around the five-time world footballer made the 36th Scudetto in the club's history with a 2-0 (1-0) on Sunday evening in the home game against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo scored 1-0 before half-time.
With 83 points, Turin, which started without the ex-international Sami Khedira, who was recently injured for a long time, can no longer be displaced from first place two game days before the end of the Serie A season.
The table runner-up Inter Milan is seven points behind.
Juventus was harmless despite their visual superiority in the first half, then Ronaldo scored after a free kick variant with the last action.
The 35-year-old used a pass from Miralem Pjanic from the edge of the penalty area with a low shot (45th + 7th).
Against the more offensive guests, Ronaldo was also involved in the 2-0, after his shot Federico Bernardeschi dusted off (67th).
This ensured the lackluster but decisive success.
The foul penalty missed on the crossbar in the 89th minute should only have been corrected by Ronaldo himself with a view to the scorer rating.
"It's difficult to stay level with the ball for 90 minutes, mentally and physically.
The games are strange and the momentum changes very easily, "said coach Maurizio Sarri after the 2-1 draw at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Above all, the mental exhaustion of his players is great, said the Juve coach.
Because of the defeat, the Turin team had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
In the end, Juve owed its lead at the top of the table, mainly to the weakness of its competitors.
Because in the eleven games before the game on Sunday, the Sarri team had only managed five wins.
It is questionable whether Ronaldo will also be the top scorer.
Because while the Portuguese superstar has scored 31 goals so far, the former Dortmund Ciro Immobile has 34 goals on his account after his three-pack in the 5-1 (1-1) of fourth in the table Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona - as many as Robert Lewandowski to win the title of FC Bayern contributed.
The current Juve professional Gonzalo Higuaín holds the record in Italy.
The Argentine scored 36 goals for SSC Napoli in the 2015/2016 season.
In August, the "old lady" of Italian football has the next chance to win the title.
Juventus are in the last sixteen of the Champions League, but have to make up for a 0-1 first leg defeat against Olympique Lyon on August 7 to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next knockout round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would wait as opponents.
Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal car races recorded
Stuttgart - Despite all the threatened fines and court rulings, drivers continue to give gas in countless illegal races on the streets of Baden-Württemberg: In the past year and the first four months of this year, the police in the southwest have already registered more than 250 illegal car races.
There are no comparative values for the years before, but the speeders are making the judicial authorities more and more work: A total of 155 investigations into illegal races were conducted in the public prosecutor's offices between Konstanz and Mannheim in 2018, one year later there were already 252 and this year up to At the beginning of June already 151.
The races were less about organized events, as can be seen from the answer from the Interior Ministry to a request from the SPD in the state parliament.
In most cases, the drivers spontaneously competed against each other or they fled from the police - this is also reported as an illegal race.
Mainly German men between the ages of 18 and 60 sat at the wheel.
113 fines - 15 imprisonment
Only in comparatively few cases are the speeders caught and asked to pay: According to the Ministry of the Interior, a total of 113 fines and 15 prison sentences have been imposed since 2018.
But there is no evidence that the number of illegal car races is actually increasing.
Rather, other drivers reacted more sensitively than before because of the number of tragic accidents and processes in the past and reported more often, said a ministry spokesman.
The Autobahn 8 is particularly popular with racers. Drivers there slow down the traffic again and again in order to make room and use the free track for a race.
Last August, a dozen drivers were caught near Kirchheim unter Teck, three months earlier there were even 18 drivers on the A8 near Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular "racetrack"
The police even register more races on the A81 than on any other federal motorway.
With a speed limit, attempts are made there to slow down the speeders on the particularly affected section between Engen and Geisingen.
The mostly high-priced and souped-up sports and luxury cars often have Swiss license plates, because the drivers move to Germany because of the high penalties for driving too fast and car racing in the neighboring country.
For the SPD, the speed limit must not be reduced to a few routes: "With a general speed limit of 130 kilometers per hour, we would get rid of this problem on motorways," says Martin Rivoir, the traffic expert for the SPD parliamentary group.
"The inhibition threshold for speeders would be significantly higher if you weren't allowed to legally travel at 200 kilometers per hour and more here and there."
Rivoir thinks less of education or image campaigns: "Anyone who disregards all the rules in such a way and not only jeopardizes their own lives but also the lives of other road users can hardly be reached with common sense."
ADAC calls for stronger action from the police
For the ADAC, however, this is not enough: "We are assuming that the speed limits will not scare them off," says Holger Bach, Head of the Traffic and Environment Department at ADAC Württemberg.
He calls for additional and tougher controls on the affected routes.
The high-speed test of strength often turns into painful and serious seriousness: Since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people have died in the races across the country, two bystanders in a nightly crash in downtown Stuttgart and one in Gerlingen.
Two young men are said to have delivered a car race there in November.
One of the vehicles came off the road, hit a garden wall and lay on its side, the 18-year-old passenger died.
21 other people were injured in races over the past two years.
In the opinion of Interior Minister Thomas Strobl, however, stricter penalties are not necessary.

Ackermann sprints to victory on the final stage of the Sibiu Tour
Professional cyclist Pascal Ackermann won his second day's victory on the final stage of the 10th Sibiu Tour.
The 26-year-old from the Bora-hansgrohe team from Palatinate prevailed in the mass sprint on the 109-kilometer section with start and finish in Sibiu, having won a stage on Saturday.
It was the season three and four wins for Ackermann.
In the overall ranking, his Austrian team mate Gregor Mühlberger prevailed.
The 26-year-old had won the mountain time trial in the morning and thus took the lead in the standings.
Only 104 drivers started the final stage in the evening.
No fewer than 18 starters fell victim to the time limit in the mountain time trial.
"I'm really happy to start the new season with a win," said Ackermann after his success on Saturday.
"The sprint was really hectic," said the 26-year-old.
300 meters from the finish, he simply put on his sprint, "and it worked perfectly".
In accordance with the rules of the UCI, a corona test was carried out on all race participants and their companions six days before the start of the race.
During the entire tour, the driver and supervisor were separated from the organization team and the media in isolated hygiene bubbles.
Spectators at the start and finish were not allowed.
Control center gave instructions for lay resuscitation
Düsseldorf - tragic accident on Sunday afternoon in Düsseldorf-Garath.
In an apartment building, a child (4) suddenly lay lifeless in the water while bathing.
According to the fire brigade, the emergency call was received shortly before 1 p.m.
"A control center dispatcher immediately gave instructions on lay resuscitation," a fire department spokesman told BILD.
The arriving rescue workers took over the resuscitation measures a little later.
The child, who was in mortal danger, was transported to the university clinic under resuscitation.
Why it crashed is unclear.
The police have routinely started investigations into the course of the accident.
The fire department spokesman: "We are assuming a tragic accident in the apartment".
Nuremberg: unauthorized tuning meeting - police intervene, 700 vehicles and around 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and at times over 1000 people took part in a "tuning meeting" on Saturday night in the parking lot of a furniture store.
The police implemented their announcement to intensify control of such events.
A big tuning meeting took place on Saturday evening (July 25, 2020) in Nuremberg's Südstadt.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the Middle Franconia police, the Nuremberg traffic police discovered an increased number of vehicles in the area of a large car park in Ingolstädter Strasse at around 10.30 p.m.
The police then carried out a large number of vehicle checks there.
Only recently had the police announced that they would take action against so-called car victims.
Illegal tuning meeting in Nuremberg: Only a small part of the "scene"
The officers counted a good 700 vehicles and around 1100 people at the top, the police said.
Of this, however, only a small part of those present can be assigned to the "autoposer" and tuning scene.
Apparently, the majority of the relevant scene followed the police appeal.
Based on the vehicles and people on site, it can be assumed that these were mostly onlookers.
In addition, the majority of those present adhered to the applicable infection protection regulations, in particular compliance with the minimum distance and wearing mouth and nose protection.
The control measures carried out on site ended around 1:00 a.m.
In total, the officials found such structural changes in 10 vehicles that the operating permit had expired.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No car races
There were no illegal car races.
"The police headquarters in Middle Franconia will continue to keep an eye on what is happening and continue to carry out increased control measures, also in connection with the arrival of onlookers," it said.
The News5 agency spoke to Jürgen Schrödinger from the towing company involved: "They all have beautiful rims, we mustn't scratch them," says Schrödinger.
Special tapes would be used for this.
Also because the cars are wider, the company must be careful not to damage them.
"After all, the young people should get their cars back undamaged".
Employment agency figures: 900 suspected cases of abuse during short-time work
Berlin - According to its own statement, the Federal Employment Agency is investigating around 900 suspected cases of abuse of short-time allowance.
"With more than 880,000 companies that have reported short-time work, that is extremely little," said Daniel Terzenbach, the board member responsible for operational business, of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.
When a large number of companies suddenly applied for short-time work at the beginning of the Corona crisis, the BA had to react quickly.
The exam usually takes up to three weeks.
"We didn't have that much time in this hot phase.
We will take a closer look at the final accounts.
There will certainly be a lot more to come.
We are not naive and have a lot of staying power ".
References to abuse often come from the employees or trade unions concerned.
In addition, the BA uses analysis software to identify patterns of abuse.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is preparing for a possible wave of bankruptcies in the fall.
"Will there be significantly more bankruptcies than last year?
The assessments differ, but we are preparing for the worst and are already training our employees in the employment agencies to process applications for insolvency money ".
The numbers are still inconspicuous, said Terzenbach.
World Heritage in Potsdam: Party in the New Garden dissolved
Potsdam - On Friday evening, around 40 young people celebrated a party in the New Garden.
The collection was dissolved at 8.48 p.m. by the district drivers of the Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation (SPSG), the foundation announced on request from PNN.
The young people then left the park.
On Saturday evening, some young people would have played rugby in the new garden.
The meadow had been cleared by district drivers, said SPSG spokesman Frank Kallensee on Sunday.
There are always illegal celebrations in the parks
In the foundation's parks, there are frequent gatherings in which the distance and hygiene rules Covid-19 handling regulations are not observed.
At the end of June there was a celebration with around 300 people in the Babelsberg Park, a week later around 150 people celebrated in the New Garden.
Even without the corona ordinance, the parks are closed when it gets dark.
Storage in the meadows is prohibited according to the park regulations, there are only a few exceptions.
The foundation has been complaining for a long time that visitors are leaving more and more rubbish and destroying protected biotopes.
In the meantime, illegal park parties in Berlin have reached another dimension.
In the Hasenheide in the Neukölln district, 5000 people celebrated an illegal techno party on Sunday night.
The event was broken up by the police.
Austria: mass tests after corona outbreak in tourist resort
Authorities have reacted to a corona outbreak in the popular Upper Austrian tourist town of St. Wolfgang with hundreds of tests.
The number of confirmed cases rose to 48, as the state authorities in Linz announced.
More than 100 results were still pending in the evening.
According to this, many of the infected are young interns in tourism companies, but at least one holiday guest also tested positive.
Residents, guests and tourism workers were asked to stay in their accommodations on Saturday evening.
The curfew was set at 11 p.m.
"There are cancellations and cancellations" of bookings there and there, said the head of the Wolfgangsee tourism association, Hans Wieser, of the dpa.
A few guests also left early.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist destination in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 overnight stays last year.
In a normal season around a third of the guests are German.
The first infections became public on Friday.
The head of the district authority, Alois Lanz, defended the behavior of the interns on Saturday, who had celebrated in several bars and could have been infected there.
"We all enjoyed doing that in our youth," he told the radio station Ö1.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The tourism association started an information campaign to make young employees aware of the dangers of Covid-19.
From Saturday, hundreds of employees, vacationers and locals were tested.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang from July 15th were contacted.
The outbreak brings back memories of the Austrian ski and party resort Ischgl in Tyrol, which was a center of the corona spread throughout Europe in the initial phase of the pandemic.
In total, more than 1500 people are currently infected with the virus in Austria.
The focus of new infections is Vienna and Upper Austria.
Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualified for Champions League
London (AP) - The English soccer record champions Manchester United returns to the Champions League after a year of absence.
The Red Devils secured third place in the table on the last day of the Premier League with a 2-0 (0-0) win against their direct rivals Leicester City.
The Foxes now have to be content with the Europa League, because Chelsea still overtook them and qualified fourth for the premier class.
In the fight against relegation Aston Villa was allowed to cheer.
Manchester United took the lead with a penalty from Bruno Fernandes (71st minute).
After a red card for Leicester City in stoppage time, Jesse Lingard (90 + 8) scored the final score.
Chelsea, opponents of FC Bayern in the Champions League round of 16, won 2-0 (2-0) against Wolverhampton Wanderers thanks to Mason Mount (45th + 1) and Olivier Giroud (45th + 4).
"That means a lot to me," said coach Frank Lampard, who is also in the FA Cup final against Arsenal in his first season as Chelsea coach.
Tottenham Hotspur also benefited from Chelsea's win against Wolverhampton, who overtook Wolves with a meager 1-1 (1-0) at Crystal Palace and started sixth in the Europa League.
Aston Villa won the long-distance duel with Watford FC and Bournemouth AFC, but had to tremble for a long time at West Ham United for relegation.
The late lead from Jack Grealish (84th) equalized Andrej Jarmolenko (85th) immediately.
The 1: 1 (0: 0) was enough because Watford lost 2: 3 (1: 3) at Arsenal.
The club, which scored three coaches in the season, is relegated after five years in the first division.
Just like Bournemouth, which could not save itself with a 3-1 (2-1) at Everton FC.
In the end, one point was missing.
Liverpool FC, who have been English champions since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3-1 (1-1) win at Newcastle United.
99 points is the highest number the Reds have ever scored in any football season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp and his team narrowly missed the point record in English football.
Manchester City holds the record with 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
After the Newcastle lead in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38th), Divock Origi (59th) and Sadio Mané (89th) turned the game for Liverpool on Sunday.
"It's been an extraordinary season for this wonderful club," said goal scorer van Dijk after the game. "It should spur us on to defend the title.
It's going to be difficult".
In the end, the Premier League bosses should also be satisfied.
Because of the coronavirus crisis, football in England was interrupted from March 13th to June 17th.
In the meantime, there was even discussion of prematurely abandoning the game or staging the remaining games on neutral ground.
In the end, however, the season could be played to the end without any special incidents - but as in Germany without spectators in the stadiums.
Arrests and violence during demonstrations against Netanyahu
The protests in Israel against Prime Minister Netanyahu are becoming increasingly violent.
Violent clashes broke out during the night.
The Israeli police used violence on Sunday night in Jerusalem against participants in a demonstration against the right-wing conservative Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said twelve people were arrested for participating in riots.
The police used water cannons, among other things, to break up the rally.
According to media reports, around 6,000 people gathered near Netanyahu's official residence on Saturday evening.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu's handling of the corona crisis.
The protesters beat drums, blew horns and called on Netanyahu to resign.
There were also arrested participants in a counter-demonstration who supported Netanyahu, reported the news website "ynet".
People also demonstrated in many other places in Israel, including in front of the prime minister's private villa in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
A man was arrested near Tel Aviv, according to police, on suspicion of spraying pepper spray from a moving car on demonstrators on the side of the road.
Another man was arrested after a knife attack on a protester in the south of the country.
The protester was slightly injured in the neck.
There have recently been multiple demonstrations against Netanyahu in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.
The rallies accompany the corruption process against the head of government.
Most recently, Netanyahu was also criticized for his handling of the corona crisis.
Among other things, he is held responsible for premature loosening and a lack of preparation for a second corona wave.
The corona crisis hit the country's economy badly.
The unemployment rate was last at more than 20 percent.
The number of new infections with the corona virus in Israel has recently risen to new record levels.
Accident near Ahlen (North Rhine-Westphalia) - van crashes into car - nine injured - Ruhr area - Bild.de
Ahlen - A rear-end collision claimed nine slightly injured people on the B58 near Ahlen on Saturday afternoon.
A car driver was traveling with her two children (3, 5) in the direction of Beckum.
The police: "She probably suddenly braked because she wanted to turn."
The driver of a Mercedes van driving behind her must have seen that too late.
He crashed into the back of the car.
Three occupants in the car and six in the van were slightly injured in the accident.
Several ambulances took them to a nearby hospital.
North Korea seals off the border town after a suspected corona case
So far, North Korea has seen its own measures to ward off the corona virus a "shining success".
Now the country is reporting for the first time on a suspected case.
Because of a first official suspected corona case in the country, North Korea has completely cordoned off a large city for fear of a catastrophe.
Despite the strictest epidemiological countermeasures in the past six months, "the malicious virus may have been introduced into the country," reported the state media.
The state of emergency has been imposed for the region around the border town Kaesong.
The communist leadership declared the highest level of alert.
If the suspected case is confirmed, it would be the first official case of infection with Sars-CoV-2 in the isolated country.
According to its own statements, North Korea had not yet registered a single infection and described its defense measures as a "shining success".
The information was doubted abroad.
The symptoms of the disease were reportedly found in a "runaway" who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on July 19.
The person fled to South Korea three years ago and has now returned across the border.
There was initially no confirmation from South Korea for the border crossing within the four-kilometer-wide and largely still mined military buffer zone.
According to reports by the national news agency Yonhap, the South Korean military admitted the possibility of illegally crossing the border to North Korea as high.
Investigations were carried out on some people.
North Korea said it called an emergency meeting of the Politburo of the Labor Party chaired by ruler Kim Jong Un on Saturday because of the suspected case.
The "dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and devastating catastrophe".
As a preventive measure, Kim ordered "Kaesong to be completely blocked and every district and region to be isolated from others," it said.
The person concerned and all people in Kaesong who had contact with her were quarantined.
The party's central military commission is supposed to investigate the "outlier case" as well as the behavior of the responsible military unit and, if necessary, impose severe punishment.
It is estimated that around 300,000 people live in Kaesong.
Tension before the council meeting: City-Ost and noise protection are still up for discussion before the big summer break
"In addition to environmental issues, the committee members will also vote on the zoning plan for the major downtown development project," says the middle section of the municipal press release for the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, July 28th at 4.30 pm in the great hall of the CongressCentrum Pforzheim.
In particular, the upgrading of the eastern city is discussed controversially until the end.
The majorities for this are tight, most recently even negative in individual committees, depending on their presence.
Project opponent Reinhard Klein criticized an appeal from the economy (construction, real estate, trade and IT) not to let the project developed out of the citizenship and then by the administration and municipal council fail after almost ten years of preparation, criticized project opponent Reinhard Klein as an "extra-parliamentary opposition", "clueless", "speculation", "denigration" and "deliberate false statements".
"Everyone thinks they know better," said Klein, who has been a member of the municipal council for a year as the only representative of the Pforzheim citizens' list.
In fact, after reading the treaties, he was in this position: "I know what I'm talking about".
The exit comes the city cheaper, the technical town hall is contrary to statements of the city administration after grants, of the existence of which Klein is convinced, to renovate for 8.5 million euros.
The city will develop very differently than the city hall and proponents from the business community are predicting.
To shape the city by his own efforts and not by an investor: That is his plan B. One day after Klein, the FDP / FW / UB / LED parliamentary group, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
It essentially also provides for the redevelopment of the Technical City Hall, keeping the Schloßberg open, renting the Ex-Thales for administrative areas and, ideally, a smaller-scale redesign of the inner city with local sponsors.
Environmental issues play a central role
In addition, environmental issues in particular will play a central role.
Among other things, the municipal council will vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the Pforzheim population from health-related noise pollution caused by road traffic, including many speed reductions.
In a press release, the local Verkehrsclub Deutschland welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30. The politicians in the city are not innocent of the fact that this has to happen, because they have to do so by neglecting the regular bus service with reduced intervals and little commitment to cycling contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus noise, according to the VCD.
The municipal council also votes on the participation of the city of the energy and climate protection agency Pforzheim / Enzkreis.
Also on the agenda is joining the climate protection pact of the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, re-setting the parental contributions in the municipal day-care centers and the application for inclusion in the smart city funding of the federal government.
Citizens are welcome, but must heed Corona protective measures.
Tim Zimmermann starts the new season with a long delay
Tim Zimmermann will start his debut season in the ADAC GT Masters on July 31 with a delay of almost half a year.
Before the league of super sports cars can start regular operations, the first test drives were due.
For Zimmermann, the main thing was to get to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3 better.
The Corona crisis prevented Tim Zimmermann from starting his first business trip in the new Lamborghini Huracan from Grasser Racing for a long time.
This was now possible under special hygienic conditions.
The 23-year-old from Langenargen did his first laps at the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his debut in a GT3 car.
"There are a few things that are different than the Porsche from the previous season," says Zimmermann.
"With ABS, for example, you have to go into corners differently.
But it was really a lot of fun ".
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite his only 25 years of experience, the Dutchman is already experienced in GT racing and was able to help his new team-mate in many things.
"I'm not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series brings new challenges with it," says Zimmermann.
"Steijn and I get along great and we made enormous progress at the Lausitzring from session to session".
It is precisely there - at the Lausitzring - that the GT Masters will also have its first race.
From July 31, the 33 super sports cars will race through Lusatia.
But Zimmermann, who is one of 15 newcomers to the series, knows the track.
In 2015 he was last guest at the Motodrom.
"It worked quickly and I didn't have to get used to the track," says Zimmermann, who competes for the Graf Zeppelin racing community in Friedrichshafen.
"The Lausitzring has many fast passages that you have to hit optimally in order to be fast".
How fast Zimmermann really is then, that will find out in two weeks.
"Of course the teams play a little bit of poker in the tests," he says.
"In the end we are very satisfied and look forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring".
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a tightly packed calendar.
There are seven races up until the beginning of November.
The current state of affairs is that no spectators will be admitted - but there is a prominent guest.
In mid-August at the Nürburgring, ex-Formula 1 driver Niko Hülkenberg will grip the GT steering wheel.
British Transport Minister caught off guard by quarantine decision
The decision by the British government to quarantine holidaymakers in Spain for two weeks after their return has caught the country's transport minister off guard, according to press reports.
According to this, Grant Shapps is currently on vacation in Spain, of all places, while his colleagues at home decided on the measure on Saturday.
Because of the corona numbers rising again in Spain, the cabinet in London removed the country from the list of countries from which entry without quarantine requirements is possible.
The new regulation applies from today, Sunday, so Shapps will also have to be quarantined after his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returnees.
But for those who are just on vacation on the cut-off date, the rule only applies from Saturday, August 1st, and was not introduced overnight.
By the way, Spain is currently considered one of the "safe countries" in Austria for which no quarantine is required in Austria.
"Many ministers must have known in advance that there is a possibility that a quarantine would be imposed on holidaymakers in Spain," said Labor MP Diane Abbot.
"But apparently nobody bothered to let Grant Shapps know."
Less than a month after the end of the Corona emergency in Spain and the end of the strict curfew, the number of infections in the country is rising again.
Virologists blame the nightlife in particular for the renewed spread.
Spain is one of the most popular holiday destinations for the British.
The British government is currently advising against unnecessary travel to mainland Spain; the Canary Islands and Balearic Islands, which are particularly popular with British holidaymakers, are excluded from this.
So far, more than 272,000 infections with the novel corona virus and more than 28,000 deaths have been registered in Spain.
Russia: Navy Day: Putin announces hypersonic weapons for warships
On Navy Day, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that warships would be equipped with state-of-the-art hypersonic weapons.
With these weapons, which are unique in the world, the combat capabilities of the Russian naval forces would be expanded, Putin said on Sunday in St. Petersburg at the central naval parade.
The Ministry of Defense also informed the Interfax agency about successful tests of the zirconium hypersonic missile built for the Navy.
The hypersonic weapons have a multiple of the speed of sound of around 343 meters per second.
They are seen as the weapons of the future.
Unterwassertropedeo continues to be built
It was said that the Poseidon underwater torpedo, which can be equipped with nuclear weapons, will continue to be built.
The planned sea drone is planned to destroy coastal targets.
The president, who also drove a military boat himself, said that this year alone 40 new ships would be put into service with the individual naval associations of the largest country in the world.
Russia has such a large coastal area as no other country in the world.
The Navy has been protecting Russia reliably for 300 years, Putin said on the day, which is celebrated by sailors across the country.
The naval forces also celebrated Navy Day with parades in many other Russian coastal towns.
In Syria, where Russia is fighting alongside ruler Bashar al-Assad, the military demonstrated strength at a weapons show in the Mediterranean port of Tartu.
Ammunition was also fired there.
A video published by the Ministry of Defense showed not only warships, including a submarine, but also attack helicopters and jets.
Hurricane "Hanna" reaches Texas: Corona difficult
Washington - The first hurricane of this year's season over the Atlantic has hit land in Texas.
Life-threatening floods, strong winds and heavy rains now threatened parts of the US state, said the National Hurricane Center of the US climate agency NOAA on Sunday night (local time).
Governor Greg Abbott declared a state of emergency in numerous counties.
The corona pandemic, which is rampant in Texas, makes the work of the helpers more difficult, Abbott said according to the US media.
Evacuees called for caution
"Every hurricane is a tremendous challenge," Abbott said, according to the Houston Chronicle.
Turning to the Texas cyclone, he added, "This challenge is complicated and is made worse when you consider that it is sweeping through an area that is the most Covid-19 hit area in the state."
According to the Johns Hopkins University, around 5,000 people have died in Texas alone as a result of the corona pandemic.
Abbott cautioned people who would have to leave their homes.
You should not disregard practices "to which we have become used", such as wearing masks, said the governor, according to the broadcaster CBS.
It is important that everyone keeps their distance.
Therefore, hotel rooms have also been made available in some places.
In addition, emergency shelters should be tested for Corona.
Damage had initially only been reported from the coastal town of Port Mansfield.
Storm warning withdrawn
According to the authorities, "Hanna" hit land on the island of Padre Island just off the Texan coast with wind speeds of up to 150 kilometers per hour.
The tropical storm had previously been upgraded to the lowest level hurricane.
For the stretch of coast from Port Mansfield to Sargent, a storm surge warning was initially issued and later withdrawn.
Authorities expected a slowdown as "Hanna" moved further inland and headed for northeast Mexico.
"Douglas" is moving towards Hawaii
In the Pacific, hurricane "Douglas" was on its way to Hawaii on Sunday night with wind speeds of around 150 kilometers per hour.
However, the Hurricane Center expected it to continue to weaken.
According to the forecast, it will be near the largest islands in Hawaii on Sunday (local time) - then as a storm just below the hurricane threshold.
According to a forecast from May, NOAA was expecting an above-average hurricane season over the Atlantic this year.
From June to the end of November, up to ten hurricanes can be expected, of which up to six could become very strong cyclones, the authority had said.
On average there are six hurricanes over the Atlantic each year, three of which develop into storms of great strength.
In view of the available climate data and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, the probability of a normal season is only 30 percent, and that of a below-average season is only ten percent, it was said at the time.
US President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that his administration is closely monitoring the storms and is in contact with the affected states.
Four goals denied: video assistant "punishes" Sassuolo
Sassuolo's Filip Djuricic was denied two goals
Naples - four goals scored, four goals denied: Sassuolo Calcio experienced a pitch-black evening at 0: 2 (0: 1) at SSC Napoli in the Italian soccer league Serie A - and was really angry with the video assistant of the referee.
"A festival of no goals for Sassuolo.
The VAR has never acted so hard against a team ", commented the" Corriere dello Sport ".
Hosts Naples had taken the lead in the 8th minute with a goal from full-back Elseid Hisaj, while Filip Djuricic cheered the equalizer in the 32nd minute.
The Video Assistant Referee (VAR) withdrew the goal because of an offside position.
Five minutes later Djuricic shot the ball back into the net - again the VAR intervened.
The referee team also took back the goals of attackers Francesco Caputo (50th) and Domenico Berardi (61st) following information from the VAR.
In stoppage time Allan made the 2-0 final for Naples and the bitter evening for Sassuolo perfect.
"For Sassuolo the VAR is worse than a speed trap on the street and punishes Sassuolo like no other team before.
The new technology is setting records ", writes the" Gazzetta dello Sport ".
FC Bayern Munich: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start of the hot preparation phase for the Champions League began with a setback for double winners FC Bayern.
After a short vacation and a few days of training, Hansi Flick, who recovered "reasonably well", has to think about how he can rebuild his successful defense after the injury of world champion Benjamin Pavard after the first team training.
The Frenchman, who has the third most minutes played behind captain Manuel Neuer and midfielder Joshua Kimmich, suffered a ligament injury on his left tarsus and threatens to miss out on decisive top-flight duels.
In the dreadful weather in Munich, the right-back broke off a training game and was driven off the field in a golf kart.
How long the unrestricted regular player has to pause in the fight for the title is open.
It will be difficult to play in the second leg of the second leg against Chelsea on August 8, but the 24-year-old can hope for the final tournament that begins in Lisbon on August 12.
Bayern do not want to be stopped by the mishap from training on Sunday.
In his personal triple formula, Flick named the three attributes that he would like to see from his stars on the way to Portugal's capital.
Its victorious title collectors should show quality, intensity and concentration in the ideally following 28 days up to the premier class final on 23 August.
"We simply mastered the compulsory tasks with the championship and the trophy brilliantly.
Now it's time to create something special, "said Flick.
Until the Munich team can deal with the final tournament and a training camp in the Algarve beforehand, they will have to face the round of 16 against Chelsea.
After the 3-0 win in the first leg before the Corona break, the Londoners shouldn't turn into a Bayern nightmare again in their home arena, as they did in the lost "final at home" in 2012.
"We have to go through the door first.
We want to win, create good conditions and gain confidence with a good game, "demanded Flick.
An attunement test is scheduled against Olympique Marseille on Friday.
With a long speech, Flick had sworn his stars, who had 13 days of vacation after the double, on a one-off August.
He welcomed 31 players on Säbener Straße, including the new players around high-class purchasing Leroy Sané, who met all of his new colleagues on the pitch for the first time after moving from Manchester City.
"Like everyone else, Leroy has fitted in well," reported Flick.
But instead of talking about the new season, when Sané & Co. are no longer only allowed to train, Flick much preferred to talk about the current title project of the German series champion.
After days of individual and small group training, the Londoners are now training in team strength, who, in contrast to the Flick ensemble, are in the rhythm of the game.
After that, Munich could face a quarter-final against FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, while Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin are possible opponents in the semifinals.
The way to the final in Lisbon "is not that easy," emphasized the head coach, who can rely on the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training from Tuesday onwards.
World Cup record goal scorer Klose and Flick know from many a joint tournament preparation, which is particularly important in the 0-to-100 attunement.
Working with his current team is "a pleasure", praised Flick.
The "focus on winning" is an impressive trait of his team.
The tournament with teams of nine was also ambitious on Sunday.
All of the top performers were there, including Thiago who was willing to emigrate and defender David Alaba, whose whereabouts beyond the premier league season is not certain.
Formula 1 needs a special rule to choose its world champion
Since it is not possible to drive on the required number of continents, the FIA has to improvise in order to award the world title.
All America races have been canceled.
The racing calendar is becoming more and more specific
The racing calendar for the current Formula 1 season continues to take shape.
In addition to the ten confirmed Grand Prix, three more race tracks were added during the week.
In October, the Nürburgring in Germany and Portimão, Portugal will take place.
On November 1st, Lewis Hamilton and Co. will fight for championship points on the traditional Italian race track in Imola.
As things stand at the moment, the 2020 racing calendar includes 13 races.
"We are delighted that we continue to make great progress in completing our plans for the 2020 season," said Formula 1 boss Chase Carey.
A total of 15 to 18 races in the premier class of motorsport are to be completed in this extraordinary season.
Formula 1 wants to conclude its season in Asia.
The final racing calendar is to be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
Before the already officially targeted races in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December, according to media reports, appearances in Vietnam and Malaysia could take place at the end of November.
Regulations require races on three continents
The Formula 1 regulations require at least races on three continents for the World Championship to be awarded.
Even if, as currently planned, only two continents are driven, there should be a world champion.
With the help of a special rule, the FIA wants to award the titles on the basis of "exceptional circumstances" due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The traditional start of the season in Australia in March had to be canceled at short notice due to the impending corona crisis.
A return to the continent this year is not an issue.
In addition, Formula 1 will not be visiting America this year.
The rejection is met with criticism in Brazil
Due to the tense corona situation, the races in Canada, the USA, Mexico and Brazil will not take place.
"We look forward to being with them again next season," said Carey.
The cancellation of the American races met with criticism, especially in Brazil: "The cancellation did not come as a surprise to us, but we cannot accept the reasons for it," said Tamas Rohonyi, promoter of the Grand Prix in São Paulo.
The number of infections in the São Paulo area is significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
The concerns of some teams about not wanting to drive in Brazil would also not justify a cancellation.
One is prepared for the required security measures.
Greta Thunberg: Evil eye against Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest on Stephen Colbert's well-known late-night show via video and revealed in an interview what she had in mind when she met Donald Trump.
Klimatkivist Greta Thunberg was a guest on a popular US late night show via video switch.
Among other things, she told of her fight against the mighty of the world.
The teenager also spoke about her famous "evil eye" when she met Donald Trump.
New York City - Over the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has drawn attention to herself with her tireless commitment to the "Fridays For Future" movement.
Now she spoke on a well-known late-night show about her plans for the future and her encounter with US President Donald Trump at the UN climate summit last year.
Latenight presenter Stephen Colbert welcomed 17-year-old Thunberg to your show on Tuesday and conducted a lengthy interview with the Swede.
She not only talked about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the mighty powers of the world.
"There are some things that surprised me," she said.
"How far people go to direct the focus away from the climate crisis," she said.
"Everything from organized hate campaigns to threats just because a group of children takes to the streets," she said.
She is said to be "funny" by heads of state and leading politicians who mock her on social media or even try to silence her, because the reactions show her "because they have no other answer".
It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview, when Greta Thunberg was approached about a well-known scene in which she cast an angry look at US President Trump.
At the UN climate summit in New York in 2019, for which the activist sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive gaze was caught by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
A GIF was created from the short clip, an animated image that ultimately became one of the most frequently used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think about the US president at that moment?
To Stephen Colbert's relatively open question, she replied only briefly and dryly: "To be honest, I don't think that needs any further explanation."
The experienced satirist Colbert had probably not expected the quick-witted answer and disappeared from the picture with a laugh.
With her "How dare you?" Speech on the principles of climate protection, she was remembered by many at the climate conference.
Ex-Dortmund real estate with a pack of three for Lazio Rome
Ciro Immobile is now level with Bayern's Robert Lewandowski in the race for Europe's Golden Shoe.
The former Dortmund Ciro Immobile still has the best chance of becoming the top scorer in the Italian soccer championship.
The former BVB professional contributed three goals in the 5-1 (1-1) win of Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona, including two penalties converted into stoppage times for both halves.
The 30-year-old from fourth in the table now has 34 goals this season with two games to go - Robert Lewandowski from FC Bayern Munich scored just as many in the past Bundesliga season.
In Italy, Cristiano Ronaldo follows with 30 goals so far, the Portuguese superstar met with the leader in the evening on Sampdoria Genoa.
Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green has died
His life was like a roller coaster ride: After a rapid ascent with Fleetwood Mac, it went steeply downhill and then slowly up again.
Now the blues rock guitarist Peter Green has died at the age of 73.
Ingenious guitarist, drug junkie, cult supporter: the co-founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully in his sleep at the age of 73, family members said in an official statement on Saturday, and another statement would be announced for the next few days.
Top musicians like Peter Frampton recognized Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional reaction of a "monumental loss" for all past and present members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
The drummer Fleetwood and the guitarist Green founded the now legendary band in London in 1967, and his dreamy instrumental hit "Albatross" has not been forgotten to this day.
The musician's life ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") was like a rollercoaster ride.
With Fleetwood Mac Green experienced a rapid rise - but the band celebrated their greatest successes without him.
Among other things, there should have been a dispute because Green wanted to donate all of the group's profits to charity.
He began to appear in wide robes and with a large crucifix.
Psychological problems are also said to have played a role.
Just three years after it was founded, Green left the band in 1970.
Social decline followed.
The blues rock guitarist suffered from substance abuse and schizophrenia, biographers reported.
For a long time Green was treated in psychiatry.
During much of the 1970s, the musician disappeared from the scene.
He is said to have lived on the street at times, worked as a cemetery gardener and spent time in an Israeli kibbutz.
Green was born in 1946 to a Jewish working class family in Bethnal Green, London.
From a young age he was enthusiastic about US blues musicians such as BB King and Muddy Waters.
At the age of eleven he learned the first guitar fingerings.
The teenager began playing the guitar professionally at the age of 15 and five years later got the chance to take the stage as lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners.
A little later he was hired to replace his idol Eric Clapton with the Bluesbreakers.
In the midst of the blues boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967 together with his Bluesbreakers colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross" composed by Green gave the group their first number 1 hit in the winter of 1968/69 and catapulted them to the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid rise soon showed its downsides: Green couldn't cope with the media hype, his experiments with the drug LSD became more and more extreme.
He later commented on life between music and addiction in an interview: "The worst thing that has happened to me in life is the drugs - the best was to land a number 1 hit".
Towards the end of the decade, Green surprisingly achieved a respectable success in 1979 with an album inspired by religious themes.
Fleetwood Mac swam meanwhile without him in a new formation on a wave of success.
Her album "Rumors", released in 1977, sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Despite various small solo successes, Green did not make a major comeback until he started again in 1996 with a group of musician friends.
The British Daily Telegraph spoke of a rock star who had returned to earth.
Free of drugs, Green released a few albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group until the band split up in 2004.
For music experts he was already a blues legend during his lifetime - and with his smooth sound one of the most influential guitarists of the past decades.
