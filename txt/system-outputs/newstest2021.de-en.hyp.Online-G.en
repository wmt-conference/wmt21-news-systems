Biker reacts lightning fast and prevents worse
On Friday evening, a traffic accident occurred on the country road between Machtolsheim and Merklingen, in which a motorcyclist was only slightly injured thanks to his quick reaction.
Driver misses biker
A 44-year-old driver wanted to turn around 21.30 clock with her VW coming from Merklingen to the left on the state road 1230 in the direction of Machtolsheim.
She overlooked the 24-year-old, right-of-way motorcyclist coming from Nellingen.
In the collision, the hand and foot brake levers fly away
The biker still tried to avoid the car, but nevertheless grazed it at the rear of the vehicle.
As a result of the stripping process, the hand and foot brake levers were torn off on the Suzuki and the driver was no longer able to brake.
Mentally, he steered his motorcycle in the green stiffeners next to the road and let it roll out there without falling.
Biker suffers leg injury
Due to the collision with the car, the biker nevertheless suffered an injury on the Beim and had to be treated in a clinic.
Mamming: Corona-Mass infection: 174 harvest helpers infected
After a corona mass infection on a large vegetable farm in Mamming, Lower Bavaria, almost 500 people are quarantined and are no longer allowed to leave the farm.
A security service monitors the ban on going out.
A total of 174 harvest helpers were tested positive for the corona pathogen Sars-CoV-2 during the series examination, as the Dingolfing-Landau district office announced on Saturday evening.
"In order to avoid further spread, we unfortunately have to take this step to protect the population," explained District Administrator Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Previously, seven employees had already been infected in the company - this was the occasion of the series test.
The farm is a large vegetable farm that grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and beetroot - but the cucumbers are only for pickles.
Mamming is a rural municipality with a population of over 3,300 not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW plant.
Bumeder appealed to citizens to keep calm: "According to our information, it is a closed circle of people".
On the farm, infected people were separated from uninfected employees, the site is now surrounded by a barrier fence.
Greens and SPD gave the state government co-responsibility.
The two opposition groups accused Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet of neglecting the control of the accommodation of seasonal workers.
"This can take bitter revenge if such local infection events spread and regional lockdowns have to be ordered," said Jürgen Mistol, the parliamentary managing director of the Greens.
The SPD looks very similar:" After the corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof slaughterhouse in mid-May, we have already called for a special control program for farms with harvest helpers, " said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
"From our point of view, the hygiene conditions at the workplace and the living conditions must be strictly controlled.
This obviously did not happen".
The outbreak had come "with an announcement".

Report: Seehofer urges Longer data retention
Data retention is currently suspended.
However, Federal Interior Minister Horst Seehofer calls for an extension of the storage period after a media report.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
According to a media report, Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer (CSU) calls for an extended data retention - instead of the planned ten weeks half a year.
As the" Bild am Sonntag " reports, Seehofer Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht (SPD) asked in a letter for a quick change in the law.
Seehofer therefore wants to strengthen the measures against child abuse.
He believes it makes sense" to make urgently needed adjustments to the law already now, " the newspaper quotes from the letter.
Data retention is currently suspended.
A decision of the ECJ is expected.
But Seehofer wants the changes in advance so that they could be applied immediately after a possible positive judgment, the report continues.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice told the newspaper that it could only be meaningfully examined whether there was a need for legal adjustments once the courts had ruled.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer, together with the interior ministers of the Länder, had already spoken out in June in favour of data retention.
NBA: Strip club trouble for Clippers star Lou Williams
Excitement in the NBA!
Lou Williams (33), professional basketball player for the Los Angeles Clippers, allegedly left the tournament quarter at Disney World in Orlando/Florida with permission for a funeral.
According to US media reports, he visited the strip club "Magic City" in Atlanta in the evening.
Williams, who is said to have admitted the visit, according to ESPN, is back in isloation, being tested daily for Covid-19.
His reason for visiting: Chicken Wings.
In February last year, "Sweet Lou", as he is called in the NBA, has already expressed his love for these very Wings.
The American wrote: "Magic City and Blue Flame (another strip club in Atlanta, note. D. R.) have the best wings in town".
NBA insider Shams Charania announced Sunday on Twitter that the NBA has ordered Williams to undergo a 10-day quarantine.
Thus, the Clippers star missed the first two official games after the test match phase.
In Disney World, the NBA wants to end the Corona season.
Currently, the best 22 teams are preparing with training games for the season finale, which begins on the night of Friday.
Söder comments on corona situation after mass infekton
Munich-Health Minister Melanie Huml (CSU) has already announced a test offensive for large farms on Sunday.
The press conference will be live on our homepage.
The case in Mamming in the district of Dingolfing-Landau has shocked authorities and politicians.
Almost 500 harvest helpers from several countries are currently working on the large vegetable farm, and more than a third have been infected with the corona pathogen.
The farm is now under quarantine and is fenced off with a construction fence.
No one is allowed to leave the premises, food is delivered.
The authorities are now offering free corona tests to the more than 3,300 residents of the municipality.
Since the harvest helpers had little contact with the local population, the district office assumes so far that the infections have not spread beyond the farm.
"Remorse": confession of the suspected arsonist of Nantes
"My client has been cooperative," lawyer Quentin Chabert told the newspaper.
The defense lawyer added:"He deeply regrets the actions, the confession was a liberation for him".
His mandate was "tormented by remorse and deeply affected by the extent of the destruction".
If convicted, the man faces ten years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros, according to prosecutors.
The Gothic Saint Peter and Paul Cathedral in Nantes was badly damaged in a fire on Saturday night last week.
The fire had broken out in three places far apart in the church.
Laboratory tests confirmed the suspicion of arson.
The suspect, now in custody, had already been arrested a few hours after the fire.
He was released after one day.
The man works as a volunteer for the Diocese of Nantes and was responsible for the closure of the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
Since there was no sign of a violent intrusion into the church, he quickly came into the field of view of the investigators.
Discussing the abolition of the 50 + 1 rule
Former DFB President Reinhard Grindel has recommended thinking about abolishing the 50+1 rule.
"German football should at least discuss setting conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates a fait accompli, "Grindel told the"Bild am Sonntag".
He stressed: "For the clubs that are most likely to be dangerous Bayern and Dortmund, the 50+1 rules do not work anyway: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, one cannot avoid the debate whether it is not necessary to facilitate the involvement of investors in associations that want to break into this phalanx".
However, he had doubts whether there was a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority shareholdings, which are prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50+1 rule.
"It remains a legal risk to pull investment fences around the business location Bundesliga in a European internal market," said Grindel.
The former head of the DFB sees the danger that"the attempts to ensure more competitive balance in the Bundesliga ultimately only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but do not lead to more tension in the championship".
Even an equal distribution of TV money will not achieve a decisive effect.
"FC Bayern has a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million.
The differences are therefore already immense among the first three clubs alone.
The other 15 clubs have an average budget of 130 million," explained the 58-year-old.
Looking at the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Unfortunately, there have been people who have noticed this error and poked through to the press instead of addressing it to me," Grindel said of accepting an expensive watch that led to his resignation in April 2019.
"This has already occupied me very much from a human point of view."
He had received the gift, worth around 11,000 euros, from a Ukrainian official.
"I committed a compliance violation, and it was right to take the consequences," Grindel said.
"I handled the ominous watch gift completely transparently and innocently.
Many in the DFB knew about it".
He never "made a secret of the gift," assured the 58-year-old.
"This may be called naive, but this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption."
"Black Lives Matter": injured and one dead
Protests against police violence in the United States have intensified again due to Donald Trump's use of federal police officers in several cities.
On Saturday, there were clashes between protesters and police in various cities.
Three people were injured in Louisville and 16 people were arrested in Seattle.
In Austin, one person was killed by gunfire while a demonstration train was just crossing an intersection.
Previously, there had been clashes again in Portland during protests against racism and police violence.
The security forces, including federal police officers, used tear gas on Saturday night and violently dispersed protesters.
Hundreds of protesters, some armed, marched through Louisville, Kentucky, on Saturday demanding that those responsible for the death of Breonna Taylor be held accountable.
The 26-year-old student was shot during a drug raid in her Louisville apartment in March.
The target of the raid was someone else who did not live there, and no drugs were found.
When a member of a group calling itself an armed alliance of Black Americans fired a shot on Saturday, three people were injured.
According to NBC, they were taken to the hospital.
None of them were in mortal danger.
The police set up barricades because counter-demonstrators had also formed a white militia.
In the end, the two groups did not meet.
In Austin, Texas, a person was shot and died during a"black lives matter" demonstration.
The police said they took a suspect into custody.
She did not provide further details on the circumstances of the crime.
Mayor Steve Adler told the New York Times that he, like many in the city, was "heartbroken and stunned" by what had happened.
Protesters also clashed with police in the American metropolis of Seattle on Saturday.
They set fire to construction trucks in front of a youth prison, and the police used stun grenades and pepper spray.
According to the" Seattle Times", 16 people were arrested for resisting police or assault.
In the city of Oakland, California, a courthouse was set on fire.
A small group of protesters smashed windows, shot down fireworks and blinded police officers with lasers, Oakland Police said late Saturday night (local time).
The fire was quickly extinguished.
In Aurora, a suburb of Denver in Colorado, a car drove through a crowd demonstrating on a highway.
Police said one of the protesters fired a gun and at least one person was taken to hospital with injuries.
In addition, windows were smashed in a court there and a fire was set, according to the police.
Investigations have been launched.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historical costumes defy Corona
Although the spa town lacked the big buzz, visitors and performers enjoyed the rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, performers and organizers: the Rakoczy weekend without Rakoczy Festival.
But: Even if the big party mile in the city center was missing, the crowds and program highlights such as Saale burns, Rakoczy Ball or pageant, so many got their money's worth with the Corona-compliant alternative program.
"I think we have succeeded in spreading Rakoczy flair," says spa director Sylvie Thormann.
The guests would have accepted it well.
In principle, one returns to the beginnings of the Rakoczy festival, when only the historical ones were in the focus of the festival.
Pleasant atmosphere
Vesna Konhäuser has been visiting Bad Kissingen with her husband for more than 25 years.
So also this time in the Corona year.
The couple made themselves comfortable at the Luitpold Casino, watched the historic strolling and listened to the Cuban live music at the casino restaurant.
"I also find it so pleasant," says Konhäuser.
She does not miss the crowds that otherwise belong to Rakoczy.
But she lacks the usual program highlights, especially Saale burns on Friday evening as well as the historical pageant and the closing fireworks on Sunday evening.
"That's a pity.
The weather would have been great this year, " she says.
Rakoczy riding tournament to take place again
For the performers of the historical spa guests, the alternative program sometimes meant more work.
For example, for Christina Gold, who participates in the pageant in a normal year and can be seen there on the carriage of the Kurgartencafé.
This year she was walking in the city in costume on Saturdays and Sundays.
"This is more strenuous, otherwise we have it easier," she says.
The equestrian club had less to do, even if individual riders were traveling in the park.
"We very much hope that the equestrian Quadrille will be allowed to take place again next year," says Chairman Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that after a break of several years, a rakoczy riding tournament will also take place in 2021.
28 Corona cases at Spanish second division club Fuenlabrada
The Spanish football second division club CF Fuenlabrada slides deeper and deeper into the crisis due to a corona outbreak.
Since the newcomer from near Madrid flew to a game in the city of A Coruña on July 20, despite the first corona cases, one low blow follows the next.
By Sunday, 28 players or team members had tested positive, one was hospitalized, the club said.
Fuenlabrada from the city of the same name south-west of Madrid still had the chance to reach the promotion playoffs.
Now even the relegation to the B group of the Second League threatens.
The match against Deportivo La Coruña last Monday was canceled at the last moment, the prosecutor's office is investigating a possible offense against public health, the supreme sports authority CSD is considering the forced relegation of the club.
Players and other team members are quarantined in a hotel.
"Until the sixth day of quarantine, they did not receive a fresh towel and gel," wrote the sports newspaper "AS".
Photos show how players hung underwear and club clothes to dry in their rooms at the hotel after apparently having to wash them themselves.
The bed linen had not been changed for five days.
Another problem is the food.
Neither is it good nor sufficient, "AS" wrote.
The club management, however, said that they were satisfied with the hotel.
The accusation of wilfully endangering public health was denied by the club's lawyer, Javier Tebas Llanas.
The son of the president of the Spanish Primera Division, Javier Tebas, stressed that the corona rules set up by the Football Association had not been violated, as the news agency Europa Press and the sports newspaper "Marca" reported.
Before departure, there had been four infected people until 19 July, but they had all been isolated and had not travelled with them.
Right before the flight to A Coruña on Monday, all players and team members had been tested again.
When the team was already in A Coruña, the corona test was positive for" five or six " other team members.
The match was cancelled 60 minutes before kick-off, Tebas Llanas said.

Time trial specialist Tony Martin is considering a continuation of his career.
Frankfurt / Main - Seven-time world Time trial champion Tony Martin can certainly imagine continuing his cycling career.
"I am currently setting the framework conditions with the team, how and in what form it could continue," said the 35-year-old of the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung".
Martin is currently employed by the Dutch team Jumbo-Visma and had considered ending his career after this year before the Corona break.
Negotiations with his team are also about the number of race days, he said.
Or about other problems that would plague him as a family man, Martin said.
He used to get up after a fall, and the first thought was: "Quickly back on the bike.
Today, as the father of a young daughter, I think: what if".
The professional cyclist admitted that there are certainly aspects with which he is increasingly struggling.
"But it was good for me to notice from the Corona time what I have in cycling and how much fun it is for me".
The time trial specialist returns to competition at the Tour de l'ain (5 to 9 August).

Argentina rejects creditors ' counter-offer
The new demands could not be met, the Economy Ministry in Buenos Aires announced on Saturday.
"This would not only be irresponsible, but also unfair," it said in a statement.
"While 50 percent of children in Argentina live in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors".
The debt of the second largest economy in South America is no longer sustainable under current conditions.
That is why Argentina is asking its private creditors to waive some of their claims of about 66 billion US dollars (about 59 billion euros).
If no agreement is reached, the country is once again threatened with bankruptcy.
It would be the ninth default in Argentine history.
Most recently, lenders have demanded higher interest rates on government bonds and changes to some contractual clauses.
However, the Argentine government is sticking to its last offer and is not prepared to make any further concessions.
Argentina is experiencing a severe financial and economic crisis.
The inflation rate was more than 50 percent.
For the current year, experts expect a decline in economic power by about ten percent.
At the end of May, Argentina had failed to pay interest claims of $ 503 million, resulting in a limited default.
Professionally arrived-not yet privately
"It's going great" - this is the conclusion Dr. Stefanie Kramer draws after her first days in the notary's office in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything went very quickly: In mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she will succeed Lutz Feller in the Eggenfelden notary office.
Just six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the doctor of law started work, the normal daily business has long been running at full speed.
"Privately, however, I still have to arrive," she explains in conversation with the Rottaler Anzeiger and laughs.
Of course, the short lead time was not enough to completely move the center of life from Regensburg to Eggenfelden, reports the native Dingolfing woman.
She is currently looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city with her husband, who works as a judge at the regional court in Regensburg.
At least her husband was still able to apply for parental leave at short notice in order to be able to ensure the care of the two daughters (3½ and 1½ years old).
In order not to have to commute from Regensburg every day, she also has an overnight stay with her parents in Dingolfing, explains the 39-year-old.
Growing up in the neighboring district, the city of Eggenfelden has of course long been known to her.
During visits on site with her family in recent months, she said, "Eggenfelden is a really nice small town."
She was all the more pleased that she had made the race for the vacant position in the selection process.
Her homeland of Lower Bavaria also plays a central role in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's professional career: After studying law in Passau, she completed her legal traineeship and the 2nd state examination in Regensburg.
After several positions as a notary assessor, including in Rehau and Hof in Upper Franconia, Babenhausen in the Lower Allgäu and Regensburg - during this time she also "incidentally" shouldered the doctorate in labor law - she started her first job as a notary in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau in 2012.
In 2016, she took parental leave, followed by the move to Regensburg.
Since then, she has taken over representation services in various notarial offices.
When the job in Eggenfelden was advertised because of the approaching retirement of Lutz Feller, she saw the right time for the full professional re-entry, explains the 39-year-old.
Dr. Stefanie Kramer has completely taken over the team of her predecessor, who will take over the vacation representation in the notary's office in the future-and immediately has praise for the team of the law firm ready: "It's going super well!"
The fact that she can rely on well-established processes makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming relocation of the private center of life.
She has already made contact with a local institution regarding kindergarten or crèche places.
And if everything works as desired, she hopes to be able to pursue her hobby here soon - and get to know the most beautiful jogging routes of the Rottal.
BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be filled to 20 percent at the start of the season in the event of a fan return.
"Due to the distance regulation, which is mandatory to comply, we are currently planning with 12.000 to 15.000 spectators", said Borussia Dortmund's managing director Carsten Cramer the"Tagesspiegel".
Normally, the arena in the district city holds a little more than 81,000 spectators at Bundesliga matches.
In the ghost games of last season caused by the corona pandemic, BVB lost around four million euros per game.
Cramer, who is responsible for marketing, digitization and internationalization at BVB, hopes that in addition to the normal spectator seats, some of the approximately 4,000 seats in the hospitality area can be opened again: "It is of course a blow to the office if these revenues completely disappear".
In view of the ongoing corona crisis, everyone is currently "well advised to take a stable page length first".
"If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people are in short-time work in Germany alone, then the need for entertainment is limited," Cramer explained.
The Dortmund marketing boss praised the BVB professionals for their partial salary waiver, which should help overcome the crisis: "Of course, the players know that their salary waiver has a different effect than if we put 100 people who work in merchandising on short-time work".
Tiny miracles: early start to life with a few hundred grams
Hardly heavier than a packet of butter, just three tablespoons of blood in his entire body: that was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The boy is one of around 400 premature babies who are cared for annually at the Graz Children's Hospital.
A quarter of them weigh less than 1, 500 grams, a few - like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael - are extreme lightweights with not even a kilogram of birth weight.
They are so small and born so early that neither lungs, nor intestines, nor muscles are fully formed.
Your skin is sometimes so tender that you could injure the electrodes of an ECG.
And they are so tiny that sometimes they wear doll clothes and mini-diapers made especially for them.
But not so small that they would not be in voice - "and how," smiles Berndt Urlesberger.
"Even if, of course, they do not scream quite as loudly as big babies".
When the whiteboard becomes a stage
Despite Corona Theater in the classroom: The whiteboard as a stage experienced the 9th classes of the Sankt-Jakobus-Gymnasium in Abtsgmünd shortly before the start of the holiday.
Actress Julia Sylvester from the Theater der Stadt Aalen presented the students with the production "Das Heimatkleid" - by video.
Afterwards, the students were able to exchange ideas about the play and the performance via Skype with the actress and the director Winfried Tobias.
The idea for the performance format was born from the current corona situation.
Teacher Teresa Nar was delighted with the enrichment of the lesson.
Even if all participants agreed in the end that direct encounters in the theatre and stage space would offer additional stimuli, the theatre also shows the potential for contact in schools.
"If we continue to improve the technical framework, this could be an interesting addition to the game operation," emphasized director Winfried Tobias.
First round drawn: TSV 1860 would meet Eintracht Frankfurt in the DFB Cup
Should TSV 1860 qualify for the DFB Cup, the Lions will meet Eintracht Frankfurt in the first round.
This resulted in the draw on Sunday.
Munich-Sixty's possible opponent in the first round of the DFB Cup is certain.
The Lions would meet Eintracht Frankfurt in a successful qualification.
This resulted in the draw on Sunday evening in the ARD sports show.

There the Lions meet either the Würzburger Kickers or Viktoria Aschaffenburg.
If second division newcomers Würzburg reach the final, sixty would already be qualified for the first round in the DFB Cup.
Otherwise, the Giesinger would have to prevail in the final against Regionalligist Aschaffenburg.
The first round of the DFB-Pokal will take place between 11 and 14 September, one week before the start of the third division.

"Road to Timmendorf": Beach Volleyball: Thole/Wickler miss final at comeback
World Championship runners-up Julius Thole and Clemens Wickler missed the final at the beach volleyball tournament "Road to Timmendorf".
At the meeting of the top teams in Düsseldorf, they defeated their national team colleagues Nils Ehlers and Lars Flüggen in the semi-finals. 1:2 (17:21, 21:17, 19:21).
Thole / Wickler last played at the World Tour Final in Rome in September last year.

Kalbitz-Expulsion from AfD confirmed-FDP speaks of " Feigenblatt"
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is only a "fig leaf" from the point of view of the FDP and does not change the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the far right in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the tip of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD," said FDP interior politician Benjamin Strasser of the dpa news agency in Berlin.
The Federal Arbitration Court of the AfD had confirmed on Saturday in Stuttgart after several hours of negotiation the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the federal Executive Board had decided by a majority in May.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD group in the Brandenburg state parliament.
"If the AfD were really concerned with consistently removing right-wing extremists from their party, officials like Björn Höcke and his supporters would have been excluded long ago," said Strasser.
"However, there is no political will for this in the AfD, because right-wing extremism is now part of the party."
CSU General Secretary Markus Blume expressed a similar opinion:" The fact that Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded says nothing and does not change anything, "he told the"Welt am Sonntag".
"Rather, it speaks volumes how many frenetic supporters a right-wing extremist in the middle of the AfD still has."
Blume assumes that the AfD will again land below five percent in elections in the future.
"The days of the AfD in the parliaments are numbered".
Kalbitz was one of the spokesmen of the officially dissolved "wing" around the Thuringian AfD state and faction chairman Björn Höcke; the Constitutional protection classifies the Strönung as "secured right-wing extremist aspiration".
In May, the AfD federal executive threw Kalbitz out of the party.
As a reason, he stated that Kalbitz had not indicated a previous membership in the now banned right-wing extremist "Heimattreuen Deutschen Jugend" (HDJ) and among the Republicans when he joined the party.
Kalbitz denies membership in the HDJ.
The chairman of the left faction in the Brandenburg state parliament, Sebastian Walter, stressed that the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court does not change the character of the AfD: "The wolf has only eaten chalk.
The AfD remains a far-right party, whether with or without Kalbitz".
Neither the Federal Party nor the right wing will be weakened by this decision.
"The maneuver of the Meuthen troops is transparent.
You want to avoid further observation by the Verfassungsschutz and try to get through under the radar, " said Walter.
"The AfD does not get rid of the spirits it called.
A expulsion does not change anything, " commented the Brandenburg SPD General Secretary Erik Stohn the decision in the case of Kalbitz.
"Here the AfD-Landesverband and the faction held to this day to their right leader".
The legal dispute over Kalbitz's membership in the AfD will continue.
He announced on Saturday that he would now take civil action against the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court.
North Sea wind farms deliver a good 21 percent more electricity
The wind power plants on the German North Sea fed 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity into the grid in the first six months of the year.
This is a good 21 percent more than in the same period last year, said the network operator Tennet in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of North Sea electricity to the mainland and the transmission through the German power grid.
The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of Tennet's grid area, have fed in an additional 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
In total, wind power from the North Sea and the Baltic Sea comes to 13.73 TWh, compared to just over 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind harvest at sea thus accounts for almost 19 percent of the total wind power in Germany; this is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms increase generation capacity
In addition to the wind conditions, the increased contribution of offshore wind energy results from higher generation capacities, because new wind farms have been connected to the grid in the past twelve months.
If the 1,270 wind power plants in the North Sea were all running at full power at the same time, they could generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient for this; according to Tennet, it is 7.1 gigawatts.
By 2030, it is expected to increase to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea.
"In Germany and the Netherlands, we are investing 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore grid connections by then," said Tennet Managing Director Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, even at sea, wind farms are not able to use their capacity, but reach about 40 percent.
The record day so far this year is January 2, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind turbines produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, the equivalent of three to four nuclear power plants.
This could supply nearly seven million households with electricity.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition of the Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the Gmünder Kunstverein.
That was almost a small anniversary celebration for the 130.
Birthday of the Gmünder Kunstverein: The exhibition opening "Skirmish" with works by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold broke the usual framework after the corona break.
Many more art lovers than usual followed the dialogue between the artist and the chairman of the Kunstverein, Professor Dr. Klaus Ripper.
The musical equivalent was provided by the band "Defenders of the Universe" on the southern Kornhausplatz.
North of the gallery, the association "Sandtogether"was involved.
Freital: Windbergfest cancelled due to Corona
The Windbergfest will not take place this year.
The city of Freital has canceled the three-day festival planned in September.
In other years, over 30,000 people had attended this city festival.
"We really did not make this decision easy for ourselves and - aware of how difficult it is economically for those involved - hoped until the last minute," said Lord Mayor Uwe Rumberg (non-party).
"But ultimately, as organizers, we are responsible for the health of many thousands of people."
Because if tens of thousands had poured onto the festival grounds and into the marquee, minimum distances, hygiene regulations and contact tracking in accordance with the current corona Protection regulation could not have been complied with.
Or the restrictions would have been so strong that not much would have remained of a folk festival.
In addition, the organizational and monitoring effort would increase disproportionately many times.
Rumberg put off until next year.
Then the city of Freital celebrates its 100th anniversary with the Winterbergfest from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the Day of the Saxons from 10 to 12 September 2021.
Dressage Olympic champion Werth in Achleiten not to be beaten
Achleiten-Six-time Olympic champion Isabell Werth was the outstanding rider at the dressage tournament in Achleiten, Austria.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg came to four victories in four starts at the weekend.
After winning one Grand Prix at the start with Weihegold and Quantaz, she could not be beaten in the Grand Prix Special and in the freestyle on Sunday.
On the 15-year-old mare Weihegold, Werth clearly prevailed against the Austrian Victoria Max-Theurer on Abegglen in the special on Sunday.
Also in the freestyle on Saturday, the German was clearly ahead of her 34-year-old student Victoria Max-Theurer on Quantaz.
Werth's winning horse Quantaz belongs to Max-Theurer.
The most successful dressage rider in the world is to establish the ten-year-old stallion in the Grand Prix.
For Quantaz it was the first freestyle ever.
Already at the first tournament in Achleiten three weeks ago Werth had won all important four tests.
The last of the three international tournaments is scheduled for August 14-16.
More air traffic controllers in Worms in the future
The University of Worms continues to take to the skies: The "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" is donating a professorship for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the university and the DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially concluded for three years and will start in 2021.
With the professorship, it is possible to start studies not only in the summer semester, but also in the winter semester.
This means that twice as many students can be trained as before.
At the same time, the capacities of both the university and the DFS Air Navigation Academy are equally utilized.
The DFS will advise the university on the establishment and appointment of the professorship.
Represented at the university since 2019
Since the summer semester 2019, the first students have been enrolled in the Air Traffic Management program as part of their training as air traffic controllers at the University of Applied Sciences Worms.
This year, nine students have already started.
So far, the experiences of the DFS are very positive, the achievements of the students are excellent.
The combination of studies and pilot training makes a significant contribution to further increasing the attractiveness of the pilot profession.
"In these times, extraction is not easy for us economically.
However, we firmly expect air traffic to recover and grow again in the long term.
In order to continue fulfilling our legal mandate in the future, we need highly qualified personnel, " says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, Chairman and CEO of DFS at the signing of the contract.
"For DFS, the endowed professorship is a future-proof investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, interdisciplinary knowledge base in the long term.
We therefore continue the good cooperation with the university and at the same time underpin our attractiveness as an employer".
This is also underlined by Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of the University of Applied Sciences Worms: "The Endowed professorship forms an important bridge between science and industry.
With it, we would like to build on the already existing cooperation with DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual Bachelor's program Air Traffic Management."
The trust of German Air Traffic Control is both a motivation and an obligation for Worms University of Applied Sciences to further expand its teaching and research competence in the future fields of aviation.
With the first endowed professorship for a dual course of study, the university can set very special highlights and innovative focal points for its students in their work for the air traffic controllers of tomorrow.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary at the Ministry of Science, Further Education and Culture, emphasizes: "Worms University of Applied Sciences has a unique selling point in Rhineland-Palatinate with its focus on air transport.
Today's signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the university's profile".
Rescue helicopter lands on the A 45
The A 45 motorway was completely closed for around 30 minutes on Saturday afternoon in the direction of Aschaffenburg, as the rescue helicopter was on duty after a traffic accident.
A 76-year-old drove a Ford around 12.40 clock in the exit Alzenau-Mitte in the curve straight and landed on the guardrail.
The impact triggered the front airbags, the driver suffered minor injuries to his face and had to be taken to a hospital for treatment.
The injuries of the 72-year-old passenger were treated by the emergency doctor and the patient was then flown by rescue helicopter to a hospital.
At present, however, the police assume that there is no danger to life.
The damaged vehicle, which suffered damage of about 2000 euros, had to be towed.
Heil wants to check other industries after meat industry
The corona crisis brought the conditions in parts of the meat industry to light again.
Legislation is about to be tightened.
But are they right - and will they remain so?
Federal Labor Minister Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to check other industries after the now planned strict regulations against maladministration in the meat industry.
"We will look at industry by industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective industry if necessary," Heil told the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany's employers are already warning against restricting work contracts in general.
After the mass corona outbreak at the meat giant Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet wants to pass a law of salvation this Wednesday.
Large slaughterhouses should no longer be allowed to use external personnel for slaughter, cutting and meat processing.
For this purpose, the use of contract and temporary workers should be prohibited there.
Employer President Ingo Kramer told the dpa:"Stay away from a general restriction of work contracts and temporary employment, if you do not want to completely choke off the economy".
Contracts for work and services are, for example, for wide areas of the craft, construction industry and plant construction necessarily the basis for their value creation at the customer.
"The misdeeds of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument".
Heil assured:"My goal is not to ban work contracts everywhere in the German economy".
Work contracts make sense.
"When an industrial company commissions a craftsman to install a safety system, this is a normal contract for work."
The German meat industry considers a ban on work contracts and temporary work in its industry alone to be unconstitutional.
It is not explainable, why in the portioning and packaging of cheese should apply in the future different labor law than sausage, it says in a statement on the proposed law, as the" Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung " (Saturday) reports.
A ban would therefore increase the consumer price by 10 to 20 percent per kilo and product.
According to the results of an audit by the NRW Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Eastern European employees from work contract companies often worked in the industry, sometimes 16 hours a day.
Often they did not have a break.
Wages were withheld for protective equipment or rent.
It was also noted that the situation with the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Heil said a relatively sharp law had already come into force for the meat industry in 2017.
However, these were circumvented by" tricky constructions".
"Now we have to clean up fundamentally".
The politician announced:"In the Occupational Health and Safety Act, which we want to pass in the cabinet at the end of July, are also measures that affect not only the meat industry - for example, higher inspection rates for occupational health and safety or clear criteria for shared accommodation".
The draft of the dpa includes amendments to the Law on the Protection of Workers ' Rights in the Meat Industry and the Occupational Safety and Health Act.
Brandenburg's Consumer Protection Minister Ursula Nonnemacher (Greens) considers more intensive controls necessary.
"I would like us to be able to carry out even more inspections in many supervisory areas: food inspections, animal welfare, everything possible, including animal transport, "said Nonnemacher on Sunday in the RBB broadcast"Brandenburg aktuell".
But more controls would also require more staff positions.
Three dead in crash of ultralight aircraft in Germany
Three people have died in the crash of an ultralight aircraft on an apartment building in Wesel in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, according to police.
One child was slightly injured.
Two other people were rescued injured in the accident, said a spokesman for the district control center Wesel.
A parachute was found at the scene of the accident, according to the police.
The "Rheinische Post" reported, citing eyewitnesses, that before the crash the plane had collided with a hot air balloon.
The house is a one-or two-family house.
Further details were not disclosed at first.
Eviction of Frankfurt's Opernplatz proceed peacefully
One week after the riots in Frankfurt, the eviction of the Opernplatz on Sunday night was peaceful.
At last, a few dozen people remained in the square, but left it before the curfew began at 1 am.
The police had been on duty with numerous officers since the early evening, a larger police force was visible throughout the city.
For the first time this weekend, a ban on entering the Opera Square, where riots had occurred a week ago, was in force from midnight.
Police officers had been attacked with bottles from the crowd of revelers.
According to police reports, at least five officers were injured and several police vehicles were damaged.
The night of Saturday had also remained quiet.
Car overturns: Young woman seriously injured in accident on Bundesstraße 83 near Hofgeismar
In an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme, a 21-year-old suffered serious injuries at around 1.25 pm on Sunday.
She was taken to the Klinikum Kassel.
The fire brigade used thermal imaging cameras to search for possible passengers.
According to the police, the woman was traveling on the federal highway 83 in the direction of her place of residence Hümme, when her car came off the road for an unexplained reason and hit several times.
In order to save the injured, the fire brigade had to cut the roof of the car free.
Since it was unclear whether anyone was still in the vehicle, the adjacent corn field was searched from the turntable ladder with a thermal imaging camera.
The drone squadron from Warburg, which also works with thermal imaging cameras, had also been ordered for the search for people.
However, the emergency services did not find anyone among the tall corn plants.
The seriously injured woman was taken by ambulance to the Kassel hospital for further care.
Almost 50 emergency personnel from the fire brigade Hofgeismar, Hümme and Schöneberg were on site.
The federal road was closed for two hours because of the accident.
Juventus Turin Champions in Italy
Turin-After Cristiano Ronaldo's redeeming goal, record-breaking Juventus secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in a row.
The team around the five-time world footballer completed the 36th Scudetto in the club's history with a 2-0 (1-0) on Sunday night in the home game against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo scored 1:0 before half-time.
With 83 points, Turin, which competed without the recently long-injured ex-international Sami Khedira, can no longer be displaced from first place two days before the end of the Serie A season.
Inter Milan are seven points behind.
Juventus, despite optical superiority, was harmless in the first half, then Ronaldo, after a free-kick variant, hit with the last action.
The 35-year-old scored a goal from Miralem Pjanic directly from the penalty spot with a low shot (45.+7).
Against the now more attacking guests Ronaldo was also involved in the 2:0, after his shot dusted Federico Bernardeschi (67.).
This ensured the lackluster but decisive success.
The penalty shot on the crossbar in the 89th minute should only have really annoyed Ronaldo himself with a view to the scorers ' rating.
"It's complicated to stay at ball level mentally and physically for 90 minutes.
The games are strange, and the momentum changes very easily, " explained coach Maurizio Sarri even after the 1-2 draw at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Above all, the mental exhaustion of his players is great, said the Juve coach.
Because of the defeat, the Turin team had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
In the end, Juve's reassuring lead at the top of the table was mainly due to the weakness of their competitors.
Because in the eleven games before Sunday's game, the Sarri team had managed only five victories.
Whether Ronaldo will also become the top scorer is questionable.
While the Portuguese superstar has scored 31 goals so far, the former Dortmund Ciro Immobile has 34 goals on his account after his three - pack in the 5:1 (1:1) of the fourth-placed Lazio at Hellas Verona-as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the title win of FC Bayern.
The record in Italy is held by the current Juve professional Gonzalo Higuaín.
The Argentine scored 36 goals for SSC Naples in the 2015/2016 season.
In August, the next title chance awaits the "old lady" of Italian football.
Juventus are in the last 16 of the Champions League, but must make up for a 1-0 first leg defeat against Olympique Lyon on 7 August to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next knockout round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would wait as opponents.
Baden-Württemberg: More than 250 illegal car races recorded
Stuttgart-Despite all the threatened penalties and court rulings, motorists continue to accelerate in countless illegal races on the streets of Baden-Württemberg: Last year and the first four months of this year, the police in the southwest have already registered more than 250 illegal car races.
There are no comparable figures for the years before, but the speedsters are increasingly making work for the judicial authorities: In 2018, a total of 155 investigations for illegal races were conducted at the public prosecutor's offices between Konstanz and Mannheim, a year later there were already 252 and in the current year until the beginning of June already 151.
The races were less about organized events, as can be seen from the response of the Ministry of the Interior to a request from the Landtag SPD.
In most cases, the drivers spontaneously competed against each other or they fled the police - this is also reported as an illegal race.
At the wheel were mainly German men between the ages of 18 and 60.
113 Fines-15 times imprisonment
Only in comparatively few cases are the speeding drivers caught and also asked to pay: According to the Interior Ministry, a total of 113 fines have been imposed since 2018 and 15 prison sentences have been pronounced.
However, there is no evidence that the number of illegal car races is actually increasing.
Rather, other motorists reacted more sensitively than before because of the several tragic accidents and processes of past years and indicated more often, said a ministry spokesman.
The Autobahn 8 is particularly popular with racers. Drivers repeatedly slow down the traffic there in order to gain space and use the free track for a race.
Last August, a dozen drivers were caught near Kirchheim unter Teck, three months earlier there were even 18 drivers on the A8 near Merklingen.
A81 is most popular "racetrack"
On the A81, the police register even more races than on any other federal highway.
A speed limit is used there to try to slow down the speeders on the particularly affected section between Engen and Geisingen.
The usually high-priced and revamped sports and luxury cars often have Swiss license plates, because the drivers dodge to Germany because of the high penalties for driving too fast and car races in the neighboring country.
For the SPD, the speed limit must not be reduced to a few routes: "With a general speed limit of 130 kilometers per hour, we would get rid of this problem on highways," says Martin Rivoir, the transport expert of the SPD parliamentary group.
"The inhibition threshold for speeders would be significantly higher if you were not allowed to travel legally here and there with 200 kilometers per hour and more".
Rivoir thinks less of education or image campaigns: "Anyone who disregards all the rules in such a way and puts not only their own life but also the lives of other road users at risk is hardly achievable with reason".
ADAC calls for stronger police crackdown
However, this is not enough for ADAC: "We assume that speeding drivers will not be deterred by the speed limits," says Holger Bach, Head of the Transport and Environment department at ADAC Württemberg.
It calls for additional and also tougher controls on the affected routes.
Not infrequently, the high-speed showdown becomes more painful and serious: Since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people died in the races nationwide, two of them uninvolved in a night crash in Stuttgart's city center and one in Gerlingen.
Two young men are said to have run a car race there in November.
One of the vehicles came off the road, hit a garden wall and remained on its side, the 18-year-old passenger died.
21 other people were injured in the races of the past two years.
However, in the opinion of Interior Minister Thomas Strobl, tougher penalties are not necessary:" Legislative action to sanction illegal motor vehicle races harder is not seen, " says the Interior Ministry paper.

Ackermann sprints to victory on final stage at Sibiu Tour
Professional cyclist Pascal Ackermann won his second victory of the day on the final stage of the 10th Sibiu Tour.
The 26-year-old Palatine from the Bora-hansgrohe team prevailed in a mass sprint on the 109-kilometer section with start and finish in Sibiu, after he had already won a stage on Saturday.
It was the season victories three and four for Ackermann.

Nuremberg: Unauthorized tuning meeting-police intervene, 700 vehicles and about 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and at times over 1000 people took part in a "tuning meeting" in the parking lot of a furniture store on Saturday night.
The police implemented their announcement to increase control of such events.
A big tuning meeting took place on Saturday evening (25 July 2020) in Nuremberg's Südstadt.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the police of Middle Franconia, an increased volume of vehicles in the area of a large parking lot in Ingolstädter Straße was detected by the Nuremberg traffic police around 10.30 pm.
As a result, the police there carried out a variety of vehicle checks.
Only recently, the police had announced that they wanted to take more action against so-called autoposers.
Illegal tuning meeting in Nuremberg: Only a small part from the " scene"
The officers numbered a good 700 vehicles and about 1100 people, the police said.
However, only a small part of those present can be attributed to the "autoposer" and tuning scene.
Apparently, the majority of the relevant scene complied with the police's appeal.
On the basis of the vehicles and people present on site, it can be assumed that these were predominantly onlookers.
In addition, the majority of those present complied with the applicable infection protection regulations, in particular compliance with the minimum distance and wearing mouth-nose protection.
The control measures carried out on site were completed at about 1:00.
In total, the officials found such structural changes in 10 vehicles that the operating license was extinguished.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No car races
Illegal car racing did not exist.
"The Central Franconian Police Headquarters will continue to keep an eye on what is happening and continue to carry out increased control measures, including in connection with the emergence of onlookers," it said.
The News5 agency spoke to Jürgen Schrödinger from the towing company involved: "They all have beautiful rims, we must not scratch them," says Schrödinger.
Special tapes would be used for this.
Also because the cars are wider, the company must be careful not to damage them.
"The young people should finally get their cars back unharmed".
Figures from the Employment Agency: 900 suspected cases of abuse in short-time work
Berlin-According to its own statement, the Federal Employment Agency (BA) is investigating around 900 suspected cases of abuse of short-time work allowance.
"This is extremely low in the case of more than 880,000 companies that have reported short-time work, "said Daniel Terzenbach, Member of the Executive Board responsible for operating business, to the"Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung".
When, at the beginning of the corona crisis, many companies suddenly applied for short-time work, BA had to react quickly.
Normally, the exam lasts up to three weeks.
"So much time was not available to us in this hot phase.
The more closely we will look at the final accounts.
I'm sure there's a lot to come.
We are not naive and have a long breath".
Evidence of abuse often comes from the employees or unions concerned.
In addition, use the BA analysis software to detect patterns of abuse.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is preparing for a possible wave of insolvency in the fall.
"Will there be significantly more insolvencies than in the previous year?
The assessments differ, but we prepare ourselves for the event of the case and already train our employees in the employment agencies for processing applications for insolvency money".
The figures are still inconspicuous, said Terzenbach.

The head of the district authority, Alois Lanz, defended the behavior of the interns on Saturday, who had celebrated in several places and may have become infected there.
"We all liked to do that in our youth," he told radio station Ö1.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The tourist board launched an information campaign to raise awareness among young employees about the dangers of Covid-19.
From Saturday, hundreds of employees, holidaymakers and locals were tested.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang from 15 July were contacted.
The outbreak evokes memories of the Austrian ski and party resort of Ischgl in Tyrol, which was a center of corona spread throughout Europe in the initial phase of the pandemic.
In total, more than 1500 people are currently infected with the virus in Austria.
New infections are concentrated in Vienna and Upper Austria.
Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualify for Champions League
London (reuters) - Manchester United will return to the Champions League after a one-year absence.
The Red Devils secured third place in the table on the final day of the Premier League by a 2-0 (0-0) success against direct rivals Leicester City.
The Foxes must now be content with the Europa League, because Chelsea FC still passed by and qualified for the premier league as fourth.
In the fight against relegation, Aston Villa was allowed to cheer.
Manchester United took the lead through a penalty from Bruno Fernandes (71st minute).
After a red card for Leicester City in injury time Jesse Lingard (90.+8) hit the final score.
Chelsea, opponents of Bayern in the Champions League round of 16, won in parallel with 2:0 (2:0) against Wolverhampton Wanderers thanks to Mason Mount (45.+1) and Olivier Giroud (45.+4).
"It means a lot to me," said manager Frank Lampard, who is also in his first season as Chelsea coach in the FA Cup final against Arsenal.
Chelsea's victory against Wolverhampton also benefited Tottenham Hotspur, who still passed Wolves with a meager 1-1 (1-0) at Crystal Palace and will start sixth in the Europa League.
Aston Villa decided the long-distance duel with Watford and AFC Bournemouth for themselves, but had to tremble at West Ham United for a long time for class preservation.
The late lead of Jack Grealish (84.) equalized Andrei Jarmolenko (85.) immediately.
The 1:1 (0:0) was enough, however, because Watford lost with 2:3 (1:3) at Arsenal.
The club, which had three coaches in the season, is relegated after five first division years.
Just like Bournemouth, who could not save themselves by a 3:1 (2:1) at Everton.
In the end, one point was missing.
Liverpool, the English champions since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3-1 (1-1) victory at Newcastle United.
99 Points is the highest the Reds have ever scored in a football season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp and his team narrowly missed out on the points record in English football.
Manchester City hold the record with 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
After the Newcastle lead in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38.), Divock Origi (59.) and Sadio Mané (89.) turned the game on Sunday for Liverpool.
"It has been an exceptional season for this wonderful club, "said goalscorer van Dijk after the game," which should spur us on to defend the title.
It will be hard".
In the end, the Premier League bosses should also be satisfied.
Due to the coronavirus crisis, football operations in England were interrupted from 13 March to 17 June.
In the meantime, there was even discussion about an early termination or a staging of the remaining games on neutral ground.
Finally, the season could be played without any special incidents - but as in Germany without spectators in the stadiums.
Arrests and violence in demonstrations against Netanyahu
The protests in Israel against Netanyahu's government are becoming increasingly violent.
During the night there were violent clashes.
The Israeli police violently attacked participants in a demonstration against the right-wing conservative prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem on Sunday night.
Twelve people have been arrested for participating in riots, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said.
Among other things, the police used water cannons to disperse the rally.
According to media reports, around 6,000 people had gathered near Netanyahu's official residence on Saturday evening.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu's handling of the corona crisis.
The protesters beat drums, blew horns and called on Netanyahu to resign.
Participants of a counter-demonstration supporting Netanyahu were also arrested, the news site "ynet" reported.
People also demonstrated in many other places in Israel, including in front of the head of government's private villa in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
A man has been arrested near Tel Aviv on suspicion of spraying pepper spray on roadside protesters from a moving car, according to police.
Another man was arrested after a knife attack on a protester in the south of the country.
The protester was slightly wounded in the neck.
There have been several demonstrations against Netanyahu in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.
The rallies accompany the corruption trial against the head of government.
Most recently, Netanyahu was also criticized for his handling of the corona crisis.
Among other things, he is accused of hasty loosening and a lack of preparation for a second corona wave.
The corona crisis has severely affected the country's economy.
The unemployment rate recently stood at more than 20 percent.
The number of new infections with the coronavirus in Israel recently rose to new record levels.

North Korea seals off border town after Corona suspected case
North Korea has so far seen a "shining success"in its own measures to ward off the coronavirus.
Now the country reports for the first time about a suspected case.
Due to a first official corona suspected case in the country, North Korea has completely sealed off a major city for fear of a disaster.
Despite the strictest epidemiological defenses in the past six months, " the malignant virus may have been introduced into the country," the state media reported.
The state of emergency had been imposed for the region around the border town of Kaesong.
The communist leadership raised the highest level of alarm.
If confirmed, it would be the first official case of infection with Sars-CoV-2 in the isolated country.
According to North Korea, it had not registered a single infection so far and described its defensive measures as a "shining success".
The information was doubted abroad.
The symptoms of the disease were reportedly found in an "outlier" who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on July 19.
The person had left for South Korea three years ago and has now returned across the border.
There was initially no confirmation from South Korea of the border crossing within the four-kilometer-wide and largely still mined military buffer zone.
South Korea's military, however, acknowledged the possibility of an illegal border crossing into North Korea as high, according to reports by the national news agency Yonhap.
There were investigations on some people.
North Korea reportedly called an emergency meeting of the Politburo of the Workers ' Party chaired by leader Kim Jong Un on Saturday because of the suspected case.
The " dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive catastrophe."
Kim had already ordered on Friday, as a preventive measure," to completely block Kaesong and isolate each district and the region from others, " it added.
The person concerned and all people in Kaesong who had been in contact with her had been quarantined.
Accordingly, the central military commission of the party should investigate the "runaway case", as well as the behavior of the responsible military unit, and, if necessary, impose harsh punishment.
According to estimates, about 300,000 people live in Kaesong.
Tension before council meeting: City-Ost and noise protection are still up for discussion before the big summer break
"In addition to environmental issues, the committee members will also vote on the development plan for the large-scale project Innenstadtentwicklung-Ost," it says rather casually in the middle section of the municipal press release for the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, July 28, at 4.30 pm in the Great Hall of the Congresscentrum Pforzheim.
In particular, the upgrading of the eastern city is controversial until the end.
The majorities for this are narrow, most recently in individual committees, depending on the presence, even negative.
After almost ten years of preparation, project opponent Reinhard Klein criticized an appeal from the economy (construction, real estate, trade and IT) not to let the project developed by the citizenry and then by the administration and the municipal council fail now as "extra-parliamentary opposition", "clueless", "speculation", "denigration" and "deliberate false statements".
"Everyone thinks they know better," says Klein, who has been a member of the municipal council for a year as the only representative of the Pforzheim citizens ' list.
In fact, after reading the treaties, he is in this position:"I know what I am talking about".
The exit comes the city cheaper, the Technical town Hall is contrary to statements of the city administration after grants, of whose existence Klein is convinced, to renovate for 8,5 million euros.
The city will develop very differently than predicted in the city hall and by supporters from the economy.
One day after Klein, the FDP/FW/UB/LED group, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
It essentially also provides for the renovation of the Technical Town Hall, the keeping of the Schloßberg open, the leasing of the former for administrative areas and a more detailed inner city redesign, ideally with local carriers.
Environmental issues play a central role
In addition, environmental issues will play a central role.
Among other things, the municipal council will vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the population of Pforzheim from health-related noise pollution caused by road traffic, including speed reductions in many cases.
In a press release, the local transport club Germany welcomes the widespread introduction of 30 km / h. However, the political leaders in the city are not innocent of the fact that this has to happen, because they have contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus noise by neglecting the regular bus service with thinned bars and by little commitment to cycling, according to the VCD.
The municipal council also votes on the participation of the city of the Energy and Climate Protection Agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
In addition, the agenda includes the accession to the Climate Protection Pact of the State of Baden-Württemberg, the redefinition of parental contributions in the municipal day care facilities and the application for admission to the Smart City funding of the federal government.
Citizens are welcome, but must take corona protection measures to heart.
Tim Zimmermann starts the new season with a lot of delay
With a delay of almost half a year, Tim Zimmermann will start his first season in the ADAC GT Masters on 31 July.
Before the League of Super Sports cars can start regular operation, the first test drives were now on.
For Zimmermann, it was all about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3 better.
For a long time, the corona crisis prevented Tim Zimmermann from taking his first official ride in the new Lamborghini Huracan from Grasser Racing.
Under special hygiene conditions, this was now possible.
The 23-year-old Langenargener turned his first laps at the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his debut in the GT3 car.
"There are already a few things that are different from the Porsche from the previous season," says Zimmermann.
"With the ABS, for example, you have to go into the corners differently.
But it was really a lot of fun".
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite being only 25 years old, the Dutchman is already experienced in GT sports and was able to help his new team-mate in many things.
"I'm not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series brings new challenges," says Zimmermann.
"Steijn and I get along brilliantly and we have made enormous progress from session to session at the Lausitzring."
Right there - at the Lausitzring-the GT Masters will also host its first race.
From 31 July, the 33 supercars will race through Lusatia.
Zimmermann, who is one of 15 newcomers to the series, knows the route.
in 2015 he was a guest at the Motodrom.
"It worked quickly and I didn't have to get used to the track much," says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafen racing community Graf Zeppelin.
"The Lausitzring has many fast passages that you have to hit optimally to be fast".
How fast Zimmermann really is, it turns out in two weeks.
"Of course, the teams play poker a little during the tests," he says.
"In the end, however, we are very satisfied and look forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring".
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a crowded calendar.
There are seven races until the beginning of November.
The current state is that no spectators will be admitted - but there is a prominent guest.
In mid-August at the Nürburgring, former Formula 1 driver Niko Hülkenberg will take the GT steering wheel.
UK Transport minister caught cold by quarantine decision
The British government's decision to quarantine Spanish holidaymakers for two weeks after their return has caught the country's transport minister cold, according to press reports.
According to this, Grant Shapps is currently on vacation in Spain, while his colleagues at home decided on Saturday the measure.
Due to the rising corona numbers in Spain, the Cabinet in London removed the country from the list of countries from which entry without quarantine restrictions is possible.
The new rule will apply from today, Sunday, so Shapps will also have to be quarantined after his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returnees.
But the rule applies to those who are just on holiday on the deadline, only from Saturday, August 1, and was not introduced overnight.
By the way, Spain in Austria is still considered one of the "safe countries" for which quarantine in Austria is not required.
"Many ministers may have known in advance that there is a possibility that a quarantine will be imposed on holidaymakers in Spain," commented Labour MP Diane Abbot.
"But apparently no one bothered to tell Grant Shapps".
Almost a month after the end of the corona emergency in Spain and the expiration of the strict curfew, the infection numbers in the country are rising again.
Virologists mainly blame the nightlife for the renewed spread.
Spain is one of the favorite holiday destinations of the British.
The British government is currently advising against unnecessary travel to the Spanish mainland, excluding the Canary Islands and Balearic Islands, which are particularly popular with British holidaymakers.
So far, more than 272, 000 infections with the novel coronavirus and more than 28, 000 deaths have been recorded in Spain.
Russia: Navy Day: Putin announces hypersonic Weapons for Warships
Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced that warships will be equipped with state-of-the-art hypersonic weapons for the Day of the Navy in his country.
With these weapons, unique in the world, the combat capabilities of the Russian naval Forces would be expanded, Putin said on Sunday in St. Petersburg at the Central Naval Parade.

The planned sea drone is planned to destroy coastal targets.
The president, who himself also went on a military boat, said that this year alone, 40 new ships would be put into service with the individual fleet associations of the largest country on Earth.
Russia has such a large coastal area as no other country in the world.
For 300 years, the Navy has reliably protected Russia, Putin said at the day celebrated by sailors nationwide.
Also in many other Russian coastal resorts, the naval forces celebrated the Day of the Navy with parades.
In Syria, where Russia is fighting alongside Bashar al-Assad, the military demonstrated strength at a weapons show in the Mediterranean port of Tartus.
Ammunition was also fired there.
In a video released by the Ministry of Defense, not only warships, including a submarine, but also attack helicopters and jets, could be seen.
Hurricane "Hanna" reaches Texas: help made more difficult because of Corona
Washington-The first hurricane of this year's season across the Atlantic has made landfall in Texas.
Life-threatening floods, strong winds and heavy rains are now threatening parts of the US state, the National Hurricane Center told the US Climate Agency NOAA on Sunday night (local time).
Governor Greg Abbott declared a state of emergency for numerous districts.
The corona pandemic rampant in Texas complicates the work of aid workers, Abbott said, according to US media.
Evacuees urged to exercise caution
"Every hurricane is a tremendous challenge, "Abbott said, according to the Houston Chronicle.
Referring to the hurricane in Texas, he added, "This challenge is complicated and exacerbated when you consider that it is sweeping through an area that is the most affected by Covid-19 in the state".
According to the Johns Hopkins University, around 5000 people have died in Texas alone as a result of the corona pandemic.
Abbott called for caution for people who had to leave their homes.
They should not disregard practices "that we have become accustomed to," such as wearing masks, the governor said, according to CBS.
It was important that everyone kept their distance.
Therefore, hotel rooms have been provided in some places.
In addition, corona should be tested in emergency shelters.
Damage had initially only been reported from the coastal town of Port Mansfield.
Storm warning withdrawn
With wind speeds of up to 150 kilometers per hour, "Hanna" hit the island of Padre Island just off the Texas coast, according to authorities.
The tropical storm had previously been upgraded to the lowest level one hurricane.
For the coastal section from Port Mansfield to Sargent, a storm surge warning had been issued and later withdrawn.
Authorities expected a slowdown, while" Hanna " moved further inland and headed for northeastern Mexico.
"Douglas" moves to Hawaii
In the Pacific, Hurricane "Douglas" was heading for Hawaii on Sunday night with wind speeds of around 150 kilometers per hour.
However, the hurricane center expected it to weaken further.
According to the forecast, it should be near Hawaii's largest islands on Sunday (local time)-then just below the hurricane threshold as a storm.
Across the Atlantic, NOAA expected an above-average hurricane season this year, according to a May forecast.
From June to the end of November, up to ten hurricanes are expected, of which up to six could become very strong hurricanes, the authority had explained.
On average, there are six hurricanes per year over the Atlantic, three of which develop into storms of great strength.
In view of available climate data and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, the probability of a normal season is only 30 percent, that of a below-average even only ten percent, it was said at the time.
US President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that his government is closely monitoring the storms and is in contact with the affected states.

The new technology sets records," writes the "Gazzetta dello Sport".
FC Bayern Munich: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start of the hot preparation phase for the Champions League began for double winner FC Bayern with a setback.
After a short vacation and a few days of training, Hansi Flick recovered "reasonably well" and after the first team training has to think about how he can rebuild his successful defense after the injury of world champion Benjamin Pavard.

In the Munich dirty weather, the right-back broke off a training game and was driven off the course with a golf kart.
How long the unrestricted regular player has to pause in the fight for the title is open.

The Bavarians do not want to be stopped by the mishap from training on Sunday.
In his personal triple formula, Flick named the three attributes he wants to see from his stars on the way to Portugal's capital.
His victory-hungry title collectors should show quality, intensity and concentration in the ideally following 28 days until the King's Class final on 23 August.
"We have mastered the mandatory tasks with championship and cup simply outstanding.
Now we have to create something special," said Flick.
Until the Munich can deal with the final tournament and before a training camp in the Algarve concretely, but first the round of 16 duty against Chelsea is on.
After the 3:0 in the first leg before the Corona break, the Londoners should not be a Bayern nightmare again in the home arena as in the lost "Finale dahoam" 2012.
"We have to go through the door first.
We want to win, create good conditions and gain confidence with a good game," Flick demanded.

He welcomed 31 players to Säbener Strasse, including the new players around classy purchase Leroy Sané, who met all new colleagues on the pitch for the first time after his move from Manchester City.
"Leroy, like all the new guys, has fitted in well," Flick reported.
But instead of talking about the new season, when Sané & Co.are no longer only allowed to train, Flick much preferred to talk about the current title project of the German series champion.
After days of individual and small group training, team strength is now being trained for the Londoners, who, in contrast to the Flick ensemble, are in the rhythm of play.
After that, Munich could face a quarter-final against FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, in the semi-finals Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin are possible opponents.
A way to the final in Lisbon "is not quite so easy," stressed the head coach, who can rely on the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training from Tuesday.
The World Cup record goalscorer Klose and Flick know from many a joint tournament preparation, what is particularly important in the 0-to-100-attunement.
Working with his current team is "a pleasure", Flick praised.
The "focus on winning" is an impressive characteristic of his team.
The tournament with teams of nine was also ambitious on Sunday.
All of the top performers were there, including the willing to emigrate Thiago and defender David Alaba, whose whereabouts are not guaranteed beyond the royal class season.
Formula 1 needs a special rule to choose its world champion
Since it is not possible to race on the required number of continents, the FIA has to improvise in order to award the world championship titles.
However, all American races were cancelled.
Race calendar gets more and more concrete
The racing calendar of the current Formula 1 season continues to take shape.
In addition to the ten confirmed Grand Prix so far, three more race tracks were added during the week.
In October, it will be driven at the Nürburgring in Germany and in Portimão, Portugal.
On the first of November, Lewis Hamilton and Co. will fight for World Championship points on the traditional Italian circuit in Imola.
This means that the 2020 race calendar currently comprises 13 races.
"We are pleased to continue to make great progress in completing our plans for the 2020 season," said Formula one boss Chase Carey.
A total of 15 to 18 races in the premier class of motorsport are to be completed in this extraordinary season.
Formula 1 wants to conclude its season in Asia.
The final race calendar is to be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
According to media reports, performances in Vietnam and Malaysia could take place at the end of November before the officially planned races in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December.
Regulations require races on three continents
The regulations of Formula 1 require at least races on three continents for the awarding of the World Championship.
Even if, as currently planned, only two continents are driven, there should be a world champion.
With the help of a special rule, the FIA wants to award the titles citing "exceptional circumstances" due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The traditional start of the season in Australia in March had to be cancelled at short notice due to the impending corona crisis.
A return to the continent later this year is not an issue.

"We look forward to being back with them next season," Carey explained.
The cancellation of the American races met with criticism, especially in Brazil:" The cancellation came as no surprise to us, but we cannot accept the reasons for it, " said Tamas Rohonyi, promoter of the Grand Prix in São Paulo.
The infection numbers in the São Paulo area are significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
In addition, the concerns of some teams not wanting to race in Brazil would not justify a cancellation.
One is prepared for the required security measures.
Greta Thunberg: Evil eye against Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest on Stephen Colbert's well-known Latenight show via video link and revealed in an interview what she had in mind when she met Donald Trump.
Klimaatkivistin Greta Thunberg was a guest on a popular US Latenight show via video link.
Among other things, she told about her struggle against the powerful of the world.
The teenager also spoke about her famous "evil eye" during her encounter with Donald Trump.
New York City-Over the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has drawn attention to herself with her tireless commitment to the "Fridays For Future"movement.
Now she spoke on a well-known Latenight show about her plans in the future, as well as her meeting with US President Donald Trump at the UN climate summit last year.
Latenight host Stephen Colbert welcomed 17-year-old Thunberg to your show on Tuesday and conducted a longer interview with the Swede.
She spoke not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the world's powerful.
"There are some things that surprised me," she said.
"How far people go to steer the focus away from the climate crisis," she said.
"Everything from organized hate campaigns to threats just because a group of children takes to the streets," she said.
Heads of state and leaders who mock her on social media, or even try to silence her, find her "funny", as the reactions show her, "since they have no other answer to it".
It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was asked about a well-known scene in which she cast a bitter look behind US President Trump.
At the 2019 UN Climate Summit in New York, for which the actvist sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive gaze was caught by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
The short clip turned into a GIF, that is, an animated image, which ultimately became one of the most used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think about the US president at that moment?
To Stephen Colbert's relatively open question, she answered only briefly and dryly:"To be honest, I don't think that needs any further explanation".
The experienced satirist Colbert probably did not expect the quick-witted answer and briefly disappeared from the picture laughing.
With their " How dare you?"- Speech on the principles of climate protection, she was remembered by many at the climate conference.
Ex-Dortmund Immobile with three-pack for Lazio Rome
Ciro Immobile is now on a par with Bavaria's Robert Lewandowski in the race for Europe's Golden Shoe.
The former Dortmund Ciro Immobile still has the best chances to become top scorer in the Italian football championship.
The former BVB professional contributed three goals in Lazio's 5-1 (1-1) win at Hellas Verona, including two converted penalties in the aftermath of both halves.
Thus, the 30-year - old from the fourth in the table two seasons before the end now has 34 season goals on his account-just as many scored Robert Lewandowski from FC Bayern Munich in the past Bundesliga season.
In Italy, Cristiano Ronaldo follows with 30 goals so far, the Portuguese superstar met with the leader in the evening still on Sampdoria Genoa.
Fleetwood Mac Co-Founder Peter Green Dies
His life was like a rollercoaster ride: after a rapid ascent with Fleetwood Mac, it went steeply downhill and then slowly uphill again.
Now the blues rock guitarist Peter Green has died at the age of 73.
Brilliant guitarist, drug junkie, cult follower: the co-founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully in his sleep at the age of 73, family members said in an official statement on Saturday, another statement would be announced for the next few days.
Top musicians such as Peter Frampton recognized Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
In an emotional response, Mick Fleetwood spoke of a" monumental loss " for all former and current members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
Drummer Fleetwood and guitarist Green had founded the now legendary band in London in 1967, his dreamy instrumental hit "Albatross"is still unforgotten today.
The life of the musician ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") resembled a roller coaster ride.
With Fleetwood Mac Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated their greatest successes but then without him.
Among other things, there was a dispute because Green wanted to donate all the profits of the group to charity.
He began to perform in wide robes and with a large crucifix.
Psychological problems are also said to have played a role.
Green left the band in 1970, just three years after the band's formation.
A social decline followed.
The blues rock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, as biographers reported.
For a long time, Green was treated in psychiatry.
During much of the 1970s, the musician disappeared from the scene.
He is said to have lived on the streets for a time, worked as a cemetery gardener and spent time in an Israeli kibbutz.
Green was born in 1946 to a Jewish working-class family in the London borough of Bethnal Green.
From a young age he was enthusiastic about US blues musicians such as B. B. King and Muddy Waters.
At the age of eleven he learned the first guitar handles.
At the age of 15, the teenager began to play the guitar professionally, and five years later got the chance to perform on stage as the lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners.
A little later, he was hired as a replacement for his idol Eric Clapton with the Bluesbreakers.
In the middle of the blues boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967 together with his Bluesbreakers colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross", composed by Green, gave the group their first number one hit in the winter of 1968/69 and catapulted them to the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid rise soon showed its dark sides: Green could not cope with the media hype, his experiments with the drug LSD became more and more extreme.
He later commented on life between music and addiction in an interview: "The worst thing that happened to me in life is the drugs - the best thing was to land a number 1 hit".
Towards the end of the decade, Green achieved a surprising success in 1979 with an album inspired by religious themes.
Fleetwood Mac, meanwhile, swam without him in a new formation on a wave of success.
Her 1977 album "Rumours" sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Despite various small solo successes, Green did not make a major comeback until 1996, when he started again with a group of friendly musicians.
The British "Daily Telegraph" spoke at the time of a rock star returned to Earth.
Free from Drugs, Green released several albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group until the band disbanded in 2004.
For music experts, he was already a blues legend during his lifetime-and with his soft sound one of the most influential guitarists of the past decades.
