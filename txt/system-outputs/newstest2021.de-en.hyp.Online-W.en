Biker reacts in a flash and prevents worse
On Friday evening, a traffic accident occurred on the country road between Machtolsheim and Merklingen, in which a motorcyclist was only slightly injured thanks to his quick reaction.
Car driver overlooks biker
At around 9:30 p.m., a 44-year-old driver of a VW coming from Merklingen wanted to turn left onto the state road 1230 in the direction of Machtolsheim.
In doing so, she overlooked the 24-year-old motorcyclist coming from Nellingen, who had the right of way.
In the collision hand and foot brake lever fly away
The biker tried to avoid the car, but still hit the rear of the vehicle.
As a result of the grazing action, the hand and foot brake levers on the Suzuki were torn off and the driver was no longer able to brake.
Quick-witted, he steered his motorcycle into the green strip next to the roadway and let it roll out there without falling.
Biker suffers leg injury
By the collision with the car the Biker suffered nevertheless an injury at the Beim and had to be treated in a hospital.
Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 harvesters infected
After a Corona mass infection on a large vegetable farm in Mamming, Lower Bavaria, almost 500 people are under quarantine and are no longer allowed to leave the farm.
A security service is monitoring the curfew.
A total of 174 harvesters tested positive for the corona pathogen Sars-CoV-2 during the serial examination, as the district office Dingolfing-Landau announced on Saturday evening.
"In order to prevent further spread, we unfortunately have to take this step to protect the population," explained District Administrator Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Previously, seven employees had already been infected at the plant - this was the reason for the row test.
The farm is a large vegetable farm that grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and beet - but only the cucumbers for pickling jars.
Mamming is a rural community with a good 3300 inhabitants not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW plant.
Bumeder appealed to citizens to remain calm: "According to our information, it is a closed circle of people."
Infected and non-infected employees have been separated on the farm, and the area is now surrounded by a barrier fence.
The Greens and the SPD placed joint responsibility on the state government.
The two opposition factions accused Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet of neglecting to control the accommodation of seasonal workers.
"This can take bitter revenge if such local infection events spread and regional lockdowns have to be ordered," said Jürgen Mistol, the parliamentary manager of the Green Party.
The SPD has a similar view: "We have already called for a special control program for farms with harvest workers as well after the Corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof slaughterhouse in mid-May," said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
"Especially the hygiene conditions at the workplace and the living conditions must be sharply controlled from our point of view.
This obviously did not happen."
The outbreak had come "with notice," he said.
Aidenbachstraße subway station: Dangerous altercation: 19-year-old falls into railroad bed after being shoved
During an argument between two groups of young people at the Aidenbachstraße subway station, a 19-year-old fell down after being pushed and slid into the track bed.
Obersendling - At around 4:15 p.m. on Friday, an argument broke out between two groups of young people at the Aidenbachstraße subway station.
A passerby alerted the police, who arrived with several patrols.
According to initial investigations, a Munich resident (17) pushed a 19-year-old to the ground.
The young man slipped over the edge of the platform and fell into the track bed.
People from the group of the 17-year-old helped the fallen man to climb out of the track.
There was no danger from an arriving train.
According to the police, the two people then got into a fight again.
The 17-year-old initially fled the scene, but his personal details were subsequently established.
Accompanied by his father, he went to police station 29.
The 17-year-old is being investigated for assault.
Report: Seehofer pushes for longer data retention period
Data retention is currently suspended.
However, according to a media report, German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer is calling for an extension of the retention period.
He wants to use it to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
According to a media report, German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) is calling for an extended data retention period - half a year instead of the planned ten weeks.
As reported by Bild am Sonntag, Seehofer asked Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht (SPD) in a letter for a quick change in the law.
According to the letter, Seehofer wants to use it to strengthen measures against child abuse.
He considers it sensible to "make urgently needed adjustments to the law already now," the newspaper quotes from the letter.
Currently, data retention is suspended.
A decision by the ECJ on the matter is expected.
Seehofer, however, wants the changes beforehand so that they could be applied immediately after a possible positive ruling, the report continues.
A Justice Ministry spokesman told the newspaper that it would only be possible to meaningfully examine whether legal adjustments were needed once the courts had ruled.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer, together with the interior ministers of the states, had already spoken out in June in favor of data retention.
NBA: Strip club trouble for Clippers star Lou Williams
Excitement in the NBA!
Lou Williams (33), basketball professional of the Los Angeles Clippers, is said to have left the tournament quarters at Disney World in Orlando/Florida with permission for a funeral.
According to U.S. media reports, however, he still visited the strip club "Magic City" in Atlanta in the evening.
Williams, who is said to have admitted the visit according to ESPN, is back in Isloation, being tested daily for Covid-19.
His reason for the visit: chicken wings.
Last February, "Sweet Lou", as he is known in the NBA, already expressed his love for these very wings.
The American wrote: "Magic City and Blue Flame (another strip club in Atlanta, ed.) have the best wings in town."
NBA insider Shams Charania announced on Twitter on Sunday that the NBA has imposed a ten-day quarantine on Williams.
This means that the Clippers star will miss the first two official games after the test game phase.
At Disney World, the NBA wants to finish the Corona season.
Currently, the best 22 teams are preparing for the season finale, which begins Friday night, with practice games.
Söder comments on Corona situation after mass infection
Munich - Health Minister Melanie Huml (CSU) has already announced a test offensive for large farms on Sunday.
The press conference will be live on our homepage.
The case in Mamming in the district of Dingolfing-Landau has startled authorities and politicians.
Almost 500 harvest workers from several countries are currently working on the large vegetable farm, and more than a third have become infected with the Corona pathogen.
The farm is now under quarantine and is cordoned off with a construction fence.
No one is allowed to leave the premises, and food is being delivered.
The authorities are now offering free Corona tests to the 3300 or so residents of the community.
Since the harvesters had little contact with the local population, the district office so far assumes that the infections have not spread beyond the farm.
"Pangs of conscience": confession of suspected Nantes arsonist.
"My client has been cooperative," lawyer Quentin Chabert told the newspaper.
The defense lawyer added: "He deeply regrets the acts, the confession was a release for him."
He added that his client was "racked by remorse and very taken by the scale of the destruction."
If convicted, the man faces ten years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros, according to the prosecutor's office.
The Gothic Cathedral of Saint Peter and Saint Paul in Nantes was badly damaged in a fire on Saturday night last week.
The fire had broken out in three widely separated places in the church.
Laboratory tests confirmed the suspicion of arson.
The suspect, who is now in custody, had already been arrested a few hours after the fire.
However, he was released after one day.
The man works as a volunteer for the diocese of Nantes and was responsible for closing the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
Since there was no evidence of forced entry into the church, he quickly came to the attention of investigators.
Discuss abolition of the 50+1 rule
Former DFB President Reinhard Grindel has recommended thinking about abolishing the 50+1 rule.
"German soccer should at least discuss setting conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates a fait accompli," Grindel told Bild am Sonntag.
He stressed, "For the clubs that are most likely to pose a threat to Bayern and Dortmund, the 50+1 rules don't work anyway: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, there is no getting around the debate as to whether it is not necessary to make it easier for clubs that want to break into this phalanx to involve investors."
But he said he doubted whether there was a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority stakes, which are prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50+1 rule.
"It remains a legal risk to draw investment fences around the Bundesliga as a business location in a single European market," Grindel said.
The former DFB boss sees a danger that "attempts to ensure more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will only end up weakening the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but will not lead to more excitement in the championship."
Even an equal distribution of TV money would not achieve a decisive effect, he said.
"FC Bayern makes a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million.
So the differences are already immense among the top three clubs alone.
The other 15 clubs have an average budget of 130 million," the 58-year-old explained.
Looking at the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Unfortunately, there have been people who noticed this mistake and leaked it to the press instead of addressing me about it," Grindel said of accepting an expensive watch that led to his resignation in April 2019.
"That has already bothered me a lot on a human level".
He had received the gift, worth around 11,000 euros, from a Ukrainian official.
"I committed a compliance violation, and it was right to draw the consequences," Grindel said.
"I dealt with the ominous watch gift in a completely transparent and guileless manner.
After all, many people in the DFB knew about it."
He never "made a secret of the gift," the 58-year-old assured.
"You might call that naive, but in any case this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption."
"Black Lives Matter": injured and one dead
Protests against police violence in the United States have come to a head again due to Donald Trump's use of federal police officers in several cities.
On Saturday, clashes broke out between protesters and police officers in several cities.
Three people were injured in Louisville and 16 people were arrested in Seattle.
In Austin, one person was killed by gunfire while a demonstration procession was crossing an intersection.
Earlier, clashes again broke out in Portland during protests against racism and police violence.
Security forces, including federal police officers, used tear gas and violently dispersed demonstrators Saturday night.
Hundreds of protesters, some armed, marched through Louisville, Kentucky, on Saturday demanding that those responsible for the death of Breonna Taylor be held accountable.
The 26-year-old college student had been shot and killed in March during a drug raid at her Louisville apartment.
The target of the raid was someone else who did not live there at all, and no drugs were found.
Three people were injured Saturday when a member of a group calling itself an armed alliance of black Americans fired a shot.
They were taken to the hospital, according to NBC.
None of them was in danger of death.
Police set up barricades because counter-demonstrators of a white militia had also formed.
In the end, the two groups did not clash.
In Austin, Texas, one person was shot and died in the course of a "Black Lives Matter" demonstration.
Police said they had taken a suspect into custody.
It did not provide further details on the circumstances of the crime so far.
According to the New York Times, Mayor Steve Adler said he, like many in the city, was "heartbroken and stunned" by what had happened.
Protesters also clashed with police in the American metropolis of Seattle on Saturday.
They set fire to construction trailers outside a juvenile detention center, and police used stun grenades and pepper spray.
According to the Seattle Times, 16 people were arrested for resisting police officers or assault.
In the city of Oakland, California, a courthouse was set on fire.
A small group of protesters smashed windows, launched fireworks and blinded police officers with lasers, Oakland police said late Saturday night (local time).
The fire was quickly put out.
In Aurora, a Denver suburb in Colorado, a car drove through a crowd of people demonstrating on a highway.
Police said one of the protesters fired a gun and at least one person was taken to the hospital injured.
In addition, windows were smashed and a fire was set in a courthouse there as well, police said.
Investigations have been launched.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historical costumes defy corona
Although the big bash in the spa town was missing, visitors and performers enjoyed the Rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, performers and organizers: the Rakoczy weekend without Rakoczy-Fest.
But: even though the big party mile in the city center was missing, the crowds and program highlights like Saale burns, Rakoczy Ball or pageant, many got their money's worth at the Corona-compliant alternative program.
"I think we succeeded in spreading Rakoczy flair," says spa director Sylvie Thormann.
Guests have taken to it well, she adds.
In principle, one returns to the beginnings of the Rakoczy Festival, when also the historical alone were the focus of the festival.
Pleasant atmosphere
Vesna Konhäuser and her husband have been visiting Bad Kissingen for the Rakoczy Festival for more than 25 years.
So also this time in the Corona year.
The couple has made themselves comfortable at the Luitpold Casino, watching the historians stroll by and listening to the live Cuban music at the casino restaurant.
"I find it quite pleasant as it is," Konhäuser says.
She doesn't miss the crowds that usually accompany Rakoczy.
But she misses the usual program highlights, first and foremost Saale brennt on Friday evening, as well as the historical pageant and the closing fireworks on Sunday evening.
"That's a shame.
The weather would have been great this year," she says.
Rakoczy horse show to take place again
For the performers of the historical spa guests, the alternative program sometimes meant more work.
For example, for Christina Gold, who in a normal year participates in the pageant and can be seen there on the carriage of the Kurgarten Café.
This year, she was in costume on foot in the city on Saturdays and Sundays.
"It's already more exhausting, otherwise we have it easier," she says.
The equestrian club had less to do, although individual riders were out and about in the park.
"We very much hope that the equestrian quadrille will be allowed to take place again next year," says chairwoman Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that after a break of several years, a Rakoczy horse show will also be held again in 2021.
28 Corona cases at Spanish second-division club Fuenlabrada
Spanish second-division soccer club CF Fuenlabrada is sliding deeper into crisis because of a Corona outbreak.
Since the newcomer from near Madrid flew to the city of A Coruña for a match on July 20 despite the first cases of corona, one low blow has followed the next.
By Sunday, 28 players or team members had tested positive, with one hospitalized, according to the club.
Fuenlabrada, from the town of the same name southwest of Madrid, still had a chance to reach the promotion playoffs until now.
Now it is even threatened with relegation to the B group of the Second Division.
The match against Deportivo La Coruña last Monday was canceled at the last moment, the public prosecutor's office is investigating a possible crime against public health, and the supreme sports authority CSD is considering the club's forced relegation.
The players, as well as other team members, are sitting in quarantine in a hotel.
"Until the sixth day of quarantine, they have not received a fresh towel or gel," the sports newspaper AS wrote.
Photos showed players hanging underwear and club clothes to dry in their rooms at the hotel after apparently having to wash them themselves, it said.
Also, the bed linen had not been changed for five days.
Another problem was the food.
It was neither good nor sufficient, wrote "AS".
The club management, on the other hand, said they were satisfied with the hotel.
The accusation of deliberately endangering public health was rejected by the club's lawyer, Javier Tebas Llanas.
They had not violated the Corona rules established by the Football Federation, stressed the son of the president of the Spanish Primera Division, Javier Tebas, as reported by the news agency Europa Press and the sports newspaper "Marca".
Before the departure, there had been four infected people until July 19, but they were all isolated and did not travel.
Just before Monday's flight to A Coruña, all players and team members had been tested again.
When the team was already in A Coruña, "five or six" other team members tested positive for Corona.
The game was canceled 60 minutes before kickoff, Tebas Llanas said.
Police have to catch runaway horses near Dampfach
Two animals were on the road.
The police led them back to their owner.
On Sunday morning shortly before 6 o'clock, a road user reported two horses running loose on the feeder road between the Donnersdorf/Steinsfeld junction and the Theres freeway junction.
When the officers arrived, the horses were already between the feeder road and the village of Dampfach.
After the officers were able to gain the horses' trust shortly before Dampfach, they each had a rope tied around them that was carried in the patrol car.
Professional cyclist Tony Martin: Career continuation conceivable
Time trial specialist Tony Martin is thinking about continuing his career.
Frankfurt/Main - Seven-time time trial world champion Tony Martin can certainly imagine continuing his cycling career.
"I am currently defining the framework conditions with the team as to how and in what form it could continue," the 35-year-old told the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung."
Martin is currently employed by Dutch team Jumbo-Visma and had considered ending his career after this year before the Corona break.
Negotiations with his team were also about the number of racing days, he said.
Or about other problems that would plague him as a family man, Martin said.
In the past, he said, he would get up after a crash and the first thought would be, "Quickly get back on the bike.
Today, as the father of a young daughter, I think, "What if?
The professional cyclist admitted that there were definitely aspects that he was increasingly struggling with.
"But it did me good to realize, based on the Corona time, what I have in cycling and how much I enjoy it."
The time trial specialist returns to competitive action at the Tour de l'Ain (Aug. 5-9).
Bavaria: At least four deaths on Bavaria's roads over the weekend
The beautiful weather attracts bikers in many places on the roads.
For at least three people, the tour with the motorcycle ends fatally.
An 18-year-old pedestrian also dies.
Schönthal - Several, mostly young people died in accidents on Bavaria's roads over the weekend.
An 18-year-old motorcyclist was hit on Saturday near Schönthal (district of Cham) by a car that came into the opposite lane.
Why the car moved into the opposite lane was initially unclear.
In Upper Bavaria, a 22-year-old collided with a horse-drawn carriage on his bike on Saturday.
According to police, he was traveling downhill near Beilngries.
In a left-hand bend, he crashed into the carriage.
His injuries were so severe that he died at the scene.
Of the twelve occupants of the carriage, one man was seriously injured and one man was slightly injured, according to police.
In another fatal accident, an 18-year-old died in Bad Kötzting in the Upper Palatinate.
He had laid down on a road in the night to Sunday and was run over by a 42-year-old car driver.
According to police, the 18-year-old wanted to sleep.
The car driver could not brake in time.
Near Schönberg (Freyung-Grafenau district), a 57-year-old biker collided head-on with a car in a right-hand bend on Saturday, despite full braking.
He died at the scene of the accident.
The 57-year-old driver suffered shock, the other three people in the car were uninjured.
The safety of motorcyclists was addressed on Saturday by Bavaria's Transport Minister Kerstin Schreyer (CSU).
In a letter to the organizer of the biker protests against driving bans announced for August, Gabor Kovacs, the minister referred to extensive investments such as underride protection on crash barriers and the defusing of dangerous curves.
"For the safety of motorcyclists, we have thus achieved a lot in recent years," the letter said.
"The number of motorized two-wheeler riders killed was reduced by about 28 percent compared to 2011."
Kovac tests with Monaco against Frankfurt
Frankfurt/Main (dpa) - For soccer coach Niko Kovac, his new club AS Monaco will soon have a reunion with Eintracht Frankfurt.
The eight-time French champions will be guests of the Hessians, the Croatian's former club, on August 1 (6 p.m.).
For the Bundesliga club, it is the first and only acid test before the second leg in the Europa League against FC Basel (August 6).
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the encounter will be played without spectators.
"We are particularly looking forward to this game.
It's always nice to come to Frankfurt and meet friends," Kovac explained.
In sporting terms, it will be an interesting test, the 48-year-old said.
Before his move to FC Bayern Munich, Kovac had coached Hessen from 2016 to 2018 and led them to victory in the DFB Cup.
"A top-class opponent like Monaco is a good test for us in view of the game against Basel.
Like all Frankfurt players, I'm looking forward to the reunion with Niko Kovac," said Eintracht coach Adi Hütter.
The 50-year-old Austrian had succeeded the Croatian at Eintracht.
In March, Frankfurt had lost the round of 16 first leg against Basel 0:3 in their own stadium.
Nearly 50 new infections: Hof county narrowly misses lockdown
In Hof County, the number of known new Corona infections increased further over the weekend, from 39 on Friday and 43 on Saturday (one person has recovered and is no longer included in these statistics) to 47 on Sunday.
In addition, there is one case in the city of Hof.
Thus, the Hof area is approaching the critical mark of 50 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants in one week.
700 dead from monsoon rains in Southeast Asia
Severe flooding in Southeast Asia has affected more than 9 million people, mainly in Bangladesh, India and Nepal.
Due to the heavy monsoon rains, a total of 700 people lost their lives.
In Bangladesh, the Red Crescent is trying to reach the isolated people in boats.
Entire villages are under water.
Farmers have lost their crops.
Armored rhinos in national park die in landslides
In Kaziranga National Park, several of the 120 armored rhinos died due to landslides.
They are protected and considered endangered.
This year, the floods are particularly bad, which scientists attribute to climate change.
Bangladesh is one of the countries hardest hit by global warming, according to the United Nations.
New homes stand empty
In the town of Cox's Bazar in southern Bangladesh, the government has built apartments for 650 people displaced by the floods.
So far, only a few have moved in.
It is difficult to get people to Cox's Bazar.
Also, enthusiasm is holding up in Grenezn.
Those who used to have a house, however small and resembling a shack, often do not want to spend their lives in a large apartment block.
Many apartments stand empty, but are soon to be occupied - or so the government wants - by those who lost their homes in the floods.

Argentina rejects creditors' counteroffer
The new demands could not be met, the Ministry of Economy in Buenos Aires announced on Saturday.
"This would not only be irresponsible, but also unfair," it said in a statement.
"While 50 percent of children in Argentina live in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors."
The debt of the second-largest economy in South America is no longer sustainable under current conditions.
That is why Argentina is demanding that its private creditors waive part of their claims of around 66 billion U.S. dollars (about 59 billion euros).
If no agreement is reached, the country will once again be threatened with national bankruptcy.
It would be the ninth default in Argentina's history.
Most recently, the lenders had demanded higher interest rates on the government bonds and changes to some of the contract clauses.
However, the Argentine government is sticking to its last offer and is not prepared to make any further concessions.
Argentina is in the midst of a severe financial and economic crisis.
The inflation rate recently exceeded 50 percent.
For the current year, experts expect the economy to shrink by around ten percent.
At the end of May, Argentina had failed to settle interest claims amounting to 503 million U.S. dollars and had thus slipped into a limited payment default.
Professionally arrived - privately not yet
"It's going super well" - this is the conclusion Dr. Stefanie Kramer draws after her first days at the notary's office in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything happened very quickly: In mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she would be succeeding Lutz Feller in the Eggenfelden notary's office.
Just six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the doctor of law started work, and normal day-to-day business has long been running at full speed.
"Privately, however, I still have to arrive," she explains in conversation with the Rottaler Anzeiger and laughs.
Of course, the short lead time was not enough to move the center of her life completely from Regensburg to Eggenfelden, reports the native of Dingolfingen.
Currently, she and her husband, who works as a judge at the district court in Regensburg, are looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city.
At least her husband was able to apply for parental leave at short notice in order to be able to take care of their two daughters (3½ and 1½ years old).
In order not to have to commute from Regensburg every day, she also has a place to stay with her parents in Dingolfing for the time being, explains the 39-year-old.
Having grown up in the neighboring district, she has of course long been familiar with the town of Eggenfelden.
During visits to the town with her family over the past few months, she has recently discovered that "Eggenfelden is a really beautiful small town.
She was all the more pleased that she had won the race for the vacant position in the selection process.
Her native Lower Bavaria also plays a central role in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's professional career: After studying law in Passau, she completed her legal clerkship and the second state examination in Regensburg.
After several stations as a notary public, among others in Rehau and Hof in Upper Franconia, Babenhausen in Unterallgäu as well as Regensburg - during this time she also shouldered her doctorate in labor law "on the side" - she took up her first position as a notary public in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau in 2012.
In 2016, she took parental leave, which was followed by a move to Regensburg.
Since then, she has taken on substitute services in various notarial offices.
When the position in Eggenfelden was advertised due to the approaching retirement of Lutz Feller, she saw the right time for her full professional re-entry, explains the 39-year-old.
Dr. Stefanie Kramer has completely taken over the team of her predecessor, who in the future will be taking over the notary's office as a vacation replacement - and immediately has praise for the team at the office: "It's going super well!"
The fact that she can rely on well-rehearsed processes here makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming relocation of her private center of life.
She has already contacted a local facility about kindergarten and daycare places.
And if everything goes as planned, she hopes to be able to pursue her hobby here soon - and to get to know the most beautiful jogging routes in the Rottal.
BVB plans maximum 15,000 spectators for league start
Dortmund Germany's largest soccer stadium in Dortmund will not even be 20 percent full at the start of the season if fans return.
"Due to the distance regulations, which are mandatory, we are planning on 12,000 to 15,000 spectators as things stand," Borussia Dortmund's managing director Carsten Cramer told the Tagesspiegel newspaper.
Normally, the arena in the Revierstadt holds just over 81,000 spectators for Bundesliga matches.
In last season's ghost games caused by the Corona pandemic, BVB lost around four million euros per game.
Cramer, who is responsible for marketing, digitization and internationalization at BVB, hopes that some of the 4,000 or so seats in the hospitality area can be reopened in addition to the normal spectator seats: "It is of course a blow to the bottom line if these revenues are completely lost."
In view of the ongoing Corona crisis, everyone is currently "well advised to take a stable side-length for the time being".
"When many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people are on short-time work in Germany alone, the need for entertainment is limited," Cramer explained.
Dortmund's marketing boss praised BVB's professionals for their partial salary sacrifice to help overcome the crisis: "Of course, the players know that their salary sacrifice has a different effect than if we put 100 people who work in merchandising on short-time work."
Tiny miracles: Early start in life with a few hundred grams
Hardly heavier than a packet of butter, just three tablespoons of blood in his entire body: That's what Gabriel was when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The boy is one of around 400 premature babies who are cared for at the Children's Hospital in Graz every year.
A quarter of them weigh less than 1,500 grams, a few - like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael - are extreme lightweights with a birth weight of less than one kilogram.
They are so small and born so early that neither lungs, nor intestines, nor muscles are fully formed.
Their skin is sometimes so delicate that they could injure the electrodes of an EKG.
And they are so tiny that they sometimes wear doll clothes and mini diapers made especially for them.
But not so small that they wouldn't be in voice - "and how," Berndt Urlesberger grins.
"Even if, of course, they don't scream quite as loudly as big babies."
When the whiteboard becomes a stage
Despite Corona theater in the classroom: The 9th classes of the Sankt-Jakobus-Gymnasium in Abtsgmünd experienced the whiteboard as a stage shortly before the start of the vacations.
Actress Julia Sylvester from the Theater der Stadt Aalen presented the production "Das Heimatkleid" to the students - via video.
Afterwards, the students were able to talk about the play and the performance with the actress and the director Winfried Tobias via Skype.
The idea for the performance format was born out of the current Corona situation.
Teacher Teresa Nar was pleased about the enrichment of the lessons.
Even if at the end all participants agreed that the direct encounter in the theater and stage space would offer additional attractions, one sees in the theater also the potentials for contact in the schools.
"If we continue to improve the technical framework, this could become an interesting addition to the play," emphasized director Winfried Tobias.
First round draw: TSV 1860 would face Eintracht Frankfurt in the DFB Cup.
If TSV 1860 qualifies for the DFB Cup, the Lions will meet Eintracht Frankfurt in the first round.
This was the result of the draw on Sunday.
Munich - Sechzig's possible opponent in the first round of the DFB Cup has been determined.
The Lions would meet Eintracht Frankfurt if they successfully qualify.
This was the result of the draw on Sunday evening in the ARD sports show.
Because the field of participants is not yet complete due to the Corona pandemic, wild cards were used in the draw.
Due to the voluntary waiver of semi-final opponent FC Memmingen, TSV 1860 is already in the final of the Bavarian Toto Cup (September 4 or 5).
There, the Lions will face either Würzburger Kickers or Viktoria Aschaffenburg.
Should Würzburg, promoted from the second division, reach the final, Sechzig would already be qualified for the first round of the DFB Cup.
Otherwise, the Giesinger team would have to beat regional league side Aschaffenburg in the final.
The first round of the DFB Cup will be played between September 11 and 14 and thus one week before the start of the third division.
"Gone with the Wind": Film legend Olivia de Havilland is dead
Film legend and Oscar winner Olivia de Havilland is dead.
She died of natural causes in Paris on Sunday at the age of 104, her spokeswoman confirmed to Deutsche Presse-Agentur.
De Havilland was known for her role as Melanie Hamilton in the Southern epic "Gone with the Wind" (1939).
Born in Tokyo to British parents, Olivia de Havilland moved to California while still a toddler.
Austrian theater man Max Reinhardt discovered the 19-year-old in the role of Hermia in Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream."
The Warner Brothers film studio immediately signed her for seven years and brought her to fame alongside Eroll Flynn.
She shot eight films with the heartbreaker.
In 1946, she won her first Oscar in the lead role of "To Each His Own."
The film was released in Germany under the title "Mutterherz."
Three years later came the award for best actress in William Wyler's "The Heiress."
She also received much recognition as a neurotic eccentric in "The Dark Mirror" and "The Snake Pit."
Daphne du Maurier suggested her for the leading role in the film adaptation of her novel "My Cousin Rachel" in 1952.
The play became a worldwide success.
With her longtime friend Bette Davis, she starred in "Lullaby for a Corpse."
Her marriage to writer Marcus Goodrich (1946 to 1953) produced their son Benjamin.
In Paris, de Havilland married the journalist Pierre Paul Galante and had a daughter Gisèle with him.
This marriage also broke up.
Rumors of an affair with former British Prime Minister Edward Heath, meanwhile, were never confirmed.
"Road to Timmendorf": Beach volleyball: Thole/Wickler miss final on comeback
World Championship runners-up Julius Thole and Clemens Wickler missed the final at the "Road to Timmendorf" beach volleyball tournament.
At the meeting of the top teams in Düsseldorf, they lost in the semifinals to their national team colleagues Nils Ehlers and Lars Flüggen with 1:2 (17:21, 21:17, 19:21).
Thole/Wickler last played at the World Tour Final in Rome in September last year.
In the final on the Rhine, their vanquishers Ehlers/Flüggen conceded a 0:2 (17:21, 17:21) defeat to surprise team Lukas Pfretschner and his interim partner Steven van de Velde.
In addition to the show tournament, three starting places for the German Championships were played out in Timmendorfer Strand at the beginning of September: Armin Dollinger/Simon Kulzer, Manuel Harms/Richard Peemüller and Simon Pfretschner/Milan Sievers secured the tickets.
Kalbitz expulsion from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "fig leaf".
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is, in the view of the FDP, only a "fig leaf" and does not change the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the far-right in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the tip of the iceberg of radicals in the AfD," FDP interior politician Benjamin Strasser told the dpa news agency in Berlin.
The Federal Arbitration Court of the AfD had confirmed the exclusion of Kalbitz on Saturday in Stuttgart after several hours of hearing, which the Federal Executive Committee had decided by a majority in May.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD parliamentary group in the Brandenburg state parliament.
"If the AfD were really concerned with consistently removing right-wing extremists from its party, functionaries like Björn Höcke as well as his supporters would have been expelled long ago," Strasser said.
"However, there is no political will in the AfD to do this, because right-wing extremism is now part of the party."
CSU Secretary General Markus Blume expressed a similar view: "The fact that Andreas Kalbitz now remains excluded says nothing and changes nothing," he told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper.
"Rather, it speaks volumes about how many frenetic supporters a right-wing extremist still has in the middle of the AfD."
Blume expects the AfD to end up below five percent again in future elections.
"The AfD's days in parliaments are numbered," he said.
Kalbitz was one of the spokesmen for the officially now disbanded "wing" around Thuringia AfD state and parliamentary group leader Björn Höcke; the Office for the Protection of the Constitution classifies the strand as a "secured right-wing extremist effort."
In May, the AfD federal executive committee had thrown Kalbitz out of the party.
The reason it gave was that Kalbitz had not declared previous membership of the now-banned far-right "Heimattreue Deutsche Jugend" (HDJ) and the Republicans when he joined the party.
Kalbitz denies membership in the HDJ.
Sebastian Walter, chairman of the left-wing parliamentary group in Brandenburg's state parliament, also stressed that the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court does not change the character of the AfD: "The wolf has only eaten chalk.
The AfD remains an extreme right-wing party, with or without Kalbitz."
Neither the federal party is weakened with this decision, nor the right wing, he said.
"The maneuver of the Meuthen troops is transparent.
They want to escape further observation by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution and are trying to get through under the radar," Walter said.
"The AfD will not get rid of the ghosts it called.
An expulsion still changes nothing," commented Brandenburg SPD Secretary General Erik Stohn on the decision in the Kalbitz case.
"Here, the AfD state association and the parliamentary group stood by their right-wing leader until today."
The legal dispute over Kalbitz's membership in the AfD will continue.
This announced on Saturday, he would now take civil action against the decision of the Federal arbitration court.
North Sea wind farms deliver a good 21 percent more electricity
In the first six months of the year, wind farms on the German North Sea fed 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity into the grid.
This is a good 21 percent more than in the same period last year, the grid operator Tennet announced in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for transmitting North Sea electricity to the mainland and forwarding it through the German power grid.
Wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of Tennet's grid area, fed in another 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
In total, wind power from the North Sea and Baltic Sea thus comes to 13.73 TWh, compared to just over 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
Wind harvesting at sea thus accounts for almost 19 percent of total wind power in Germany; that's about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms provide higher generation capacity
In addition to wind conditions, the increased contribution of offshore wind power results from higher generation capacities because new wind farms have been connected to the grid in the past twelve months.
If the 1270 wind farms in the North Sea were all running at full power at the same time, they could mathematically generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient for this; according to Tennet, it is 7.1 gigawatts.
By 2030, it is expected to increase to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea.
"In Germany and the Netherlands, we are investing 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore grid connections by then," said Tennet Managing Director Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, wind farms can't reach their full capacity even offshore, but reach about 40 percent.
The record day so far this year is Jan. 2, when North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, North Sea wind turbines produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, the equivalent of three to four nuclear power plants.
This could supply almost seven million households with electricity.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition of the Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the Gmünder Kunstverein.
This was almost a small anniversary celebration of the 130.
Birthday of the Gmünder Kunstverein: The exhibition opening "Skirmish" with works of the Leipzig artist Christian Bold broke the usual frame after the Corona break.
Many more art lovers than usual followed the dialogue between the artist and the chairman of the Kunstverein, Professor Dr. Klaus Ripper.
The musical equivalent was provided by the band "Defenders of the Universe" on the southern Kornhausplatz.
North of the gallery, the association "Sandtogether" got involved.
Freital: Windbergfest cancelled because of Corona
The Windbergfest will not take place this year.
The city of Freital has canceled the three-day festival planned for September.
In other years, over 30,000 people had attended this city festival.
"We truly did not take this decision lightly and - aware of how difficult it is economically for those involved - hoped until the last minute," explained Mayor Uwe Rumberg (non-party).
"But ultimately we are responsible here as organizers for the health of many thousands of people".
Because if tens of thousands had streamed onto the festival grounds and into the marquee, it would not have been possible to maintain minimum distances, hygiene regulations and contact tracking in accordance with the current Corona Protection Ordinance.
Or the restrictions would have been so severe that not much would have remained of a folk festival.
In addition, the organizational and monitoring effort would increase disproportionately by a multiple.
Rumberg put off until next year.
Then the city of Freital will celebrate its 100th anniversary with, among other things, the Winterberg Festival from May 7 to 9, 2021, and the Day of the Saxons from September 10 to 12, 2021.
Olympic dressage champion Werth unbeatable in Achleiten
Achleiten - Six-time Olympic champion Isabell Werth was the outstanding rider at the dressage tournament in Achleiten, Austria.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg came to four victories in four starts at the weekend.
After winning a Grand Prix each with Weihegold and Quantaz at the start, she was also unbeatable in the Grand Prix Special and the Freestyle on Sunday.
Riding the 15-year-old mare Weihegold, Werth clearly beat the Austrian Victoria Max-Theurer on Abegglen in the Special on Sunday.
The German was also clearly ahead of her 34-year-old pupil Victoria Max-Theurer in the freestyle on Saturday on Quantaz.
Werth's winning horse Quantaz belongs to Max-Theurer.
The world's most successful dressage rider is to establish the ten-year-old stallion in the Grand Prix.
For Quantaz it was the first freestyle ever.
Already at the first tournament in Achleiten three weeks ago, Werth had won all the important four tests.
The last of the three international shows is scheduled there for August 14 to 16.
More air traffic controllers in Worms in the future
The University of Worms continues to take to the skies: "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" endows a professorship for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the university and DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially concluded for three years and will start in 2021.
The professorship will enable students to start their studies not only in the summer semester, but also in the winter semester.
This means that twice as many students can be trained as before.
At the same time, capacities at both the university and the DFS Air Navigation Services Academy will be evenly utilised.
DFS will advise the university on establishing and filling the professorship.
Represented at the university since 2019
Since the summer semester of 2019, the first students have been on the Air Traffic Management course at Worms University as part of their training to become air traffic controllers.
Nine students already started this year.
So far, the experience of DFS has been very positive, and the performance of the students is excellent.
The combination of studies and air traffic controller training is making a significant contribution to further enhancing the attractiveness of the air traffic controller profession.
"In these times, funding is not easy for us economically.
However, we firmly expect air traffic to recover and grow again in the long term.
In order to be able to continue fulfilling our legal mandate in the future, we need highly qualified personnel," said Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, Chairman and CEO of DFS, at the signing of the agreement.
"For DFS, the endowed professorship is a future-proof investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, interdisciplinary knowledge base in the long term.
We are therefore continuing our good cooperation with the university and at the same time underpinning our attractiveness as an employer."
This is also emphasized by Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of Worms University of Applied Sciences: "The endowed professorship forms an important bridge between science and industry.
With this professorship, we would like to build on the existing cooperation with DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual bachelor's degree program in Air Traffic Management."
The trust placed in us by Deutsche Flugsicherung is both a motivation and an obligation for Worms University of Applied Sciences to further expand its teaching and research expertise in the future fields of air traffic.
In its commitment to the air traffic controllers of tomorrow, the university can set very special highlights and innovative focal points for its students with the first endowed professorship for a dual course of study.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary in the Ministry of Science, Further Education and Culture, emphasized: "With its focus on aviation, Worms University of Applied Sciences has a unique selling point in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Today's signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the university's profile."
Rescue helicopter lands on the A 45
For about 30 minutes, the A 45 highway was fully closed at noon on Saturday in the direction of Aschaffenburg, because the rescue helicopter was in action after a traffic accident.
A 76-year-old man drove a Ford straight ahead in the curve at the Alzenau-Mitte exit at around 12:40 p.m. and landed on the guard rail.
The impact caused the front airbags to deploy, the driver suffered minor injuries to his face and had to be taken to hospital for treatment.
The injuries to the 72-year-old female passenger were treated by the emergency physician and the patient was subsequently flown to a hospital by rescue helicopter.
At present, however, the police assume that there is no danger to life.
The damaged vehicle, to which a damage of approximately 2000 euro resulted, had to be towed away.
Heil to examine other industries after meat industry
The Corona crisis again brought to light the conditions in parts of the meat industry.
Tightening of the law is imminent.
But are they legal - and will they remain so?
Federal Labor Minister Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to review other industries after the strict regulations against abuses in the meat industry that are now planned.
"We will look at industry by industry and then take appropriate measures for each industry if necessary," Heil told the Deutsche Presse-Agentur in Berlin.
Germany's employers are already warning against restricting work contracts in general.
Following the mass corona outbreak at meat giant Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the federal cabinet plans to pass a bill by Heil this Wednesday.
Large slaughterhouses should no longer be allowed to use outside personnel for slaughtering, cutting and meat processing.
In addition, the use of contract workers and temporary workers is to be banned there.
Employers' President Ingo Kramer told dpa: "Hands off a general restriction of work contracts and temporary workers if you don't want to completely strangle the economy."
Contracts for work and services are, for example, for large areas of the skilled trades, the construction industry and plant engineering compellingly the basis for their value creation at the customer.
"The misconduct of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument."
Heil assured, "My goal is not to ban work contracts everywhere in the German economy."
He added that work contracts make sense.
"If an industrial company commissions a craftsman to install a security system, that is a perfectly normal contract for work and services."
The German meat industry considers a ban on work contracts and temporary work in its sector alone to be unconstitutional.
It is inexplicable why different labor laws should apply in the future to portioning and packaging cheese than to sausage, it says in a statement on the proposed law, as reported by the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Saturday).
According to the statement, a ban would increase the consumer price by 10 to 20 percent per kilo and product.
In many cases, Eastern European employees from work contract companies worked in the industry, according to the results of an audit by the NRW labor protection administration, sometimes 16 hours a day.
Often they had no breaks.
Wages were withheld for protective equipment or rent.
It was also found that the situation regarding housing for employees was often miserable.
Heil said a relatively harsh law had already come into force for the meat industry in 2017.
However, "tricky constructions" had circumvented it.
"Now it must be fundamentally cleaned up".
The politician announced, "In the Occupational Health and Safety Act, which we want to pass in the cabinet at the end of July, there are also measures that not only affect the meat industry - for example, higher inspection quotas for occupational health and safety or clear criteria for shared accommodation."
The draft submitted to dpa includes amendments to the law on safeguarding employee rights in the meat industry and to the Occupational Safety and Health Act.
Brandenburg's Consumer Protection Minister Ursula Nonnemacher (Greens) believes more intensive controls are necessary.
"I would like us to be able to do even more controls in many supervisory areas: Food controls, animal welfare, all kinds of things, for example, animal transports," Nonnemacher said Sunday on the RBB program "Brandenburg aktuell."
But for more controls also more personnel places are necessary.
Three dead in ultralight plane crash in Germany
Three people died when an ultralight aircraft crashed into an apartment building in Wesel in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, police said.
One child was slightly injured, they said.
Two other people were rescued injured in the accident, a spokesman for the Wesel district control center said.
A parachute was found at the accident site, police said.
The "Rheinische Post" reported, citing eyewitnesses, that before the crash the plane had collided with a hot air balloon.
The house was said to be a one- or two-family house.
Further details were not disclosed at first.
Clearance of Frankfurt Opera Square proceeded peacefully
A week after the riots in Frankfurt, the evacuation of the Opera Square on Sunday night also passed peacefully.
At last, a few dozen people were still on the square, but left before the curfew began at 1 o'clock.
The police had been on duty with numerous officers since the early evening, and a larger police contingent could be seen throughout the city.
For the first time this weekend, a ban on entering the Opera Square, where riots had occurred a week ago, was in effect from midnight.
Police officers were attacked with bottles from the crowd of revelers.
According to police reports, at least five officers were injured and several police vehicles were damaged.
The night to Saturday had also remained quiet.
Car overturns: Young woman seriously injured in accident on Bundesstrasse 83 near Hofgeismar
In an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme, a 21-year-old woman suffered serious injuries at around 1:25 p.m. on Sunday.
She was taken to the Kassel hospital.
With thermal imaging cameras, the fire department searched for possible passengers.
According to police, the woman was on the Bundesstraße 83 in the direction of her home Hümme on the way, when her car for as yet unexplained cause from the road and overturned several times.
To rescue the victim, the fire department had to cut the roof of the car free.
Since it was unclear whether anyone was still in the vehicle, the adjacent cornfield was searched from the turntable ladder with a thermal imaging camera.
The drone squadron from Warburg, which also works with thermal imaging cameras, had also been ordered to search for people.
However, the emergency services did not find anyone among the tall corn plants.
The seriously injured woman was taken by ambulance to Kassel Hospital for further treatment.
Almost 50 emergency personnel from the Hofgeismar, Hümme and Schöneberg fire departments were on the scene.
The federal highway was closed for two hours because of the accident.
Juventus Turin champions in Italy
Turin - After a redeeming goal by Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin has secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in a row.
The team around the five-time world footballer made the 36th Scudetto in club history perfect with a 2-0 (1-0) win over Sampdoria Genoa at home on Sunday evening.
Ronaldo scored to make it 1-0 before halftime.
With 83 points, Torino, which was without former international Sami Khedira, who has been injured for a long time lately, can no longer be ousted from first place in Serie A two matchdays before the end of the season.
Inter Milan, second in the table, is seven points behind.
Juventus was harmless in the first half despite visual superiority, then Ronaldo scored with the last action after a free kick.
The 35-year-old converted a pass from Miralem Pjanic directly with a low shot from the edge of the penalty area (45.+7).
Against the now more offensive guests Ronaldo was also involved in the 2-0, after his shot Federico Bernardeschi (67th) dusted off.
This ensured the lackluster, but decisive success.
The penalty kick in the 89th minute, which hit the crossbar, may have only really irked Ronaldo himself in terms of the goalscoring standings.
"It's complicated to stay on the ball mentally and physically for 90 minutes.
The games are strange and the momentum changes very easily," said coach Maurizio Sarri still after the 1-2 defeat at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Above all, the mental exhaustion of his players was great, said the Juve coach.
Because of the defeat, the Turin team had not yet been able to clinch the championship.
In the end, Juve owed its reassuring lead at the top of the table primarily to the weakness of its rivals.
In the eleven games before Sunday's match, Sarri's team had only managed five victories.
Whether Ronaldo will also be the top scorer is questionable.
While the Portuguese superstar has scored 31 goals so far, former Dortmund player Ciro Immobile has 34 goals to his name after his treble in Lazio Roma's 5:1 (1:1) win over Hellas Verona - as many as Robert Lewandowski scored in FC Bayern's title win.
The record in Italy is held by current Juve pro Gonzalo Higuaín.
The Argentine scored 36 goals for SSC Napoli in the 2015/2016 season.
The next title opportunity awaits the "Old Lady" of Italian soccer in August.
Juventus are through to the last 16 of the Champions League, but must overturn a 1-0 first-leg defeat to Olympique Lyon on August 7 to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
Real Madrid or Manchester City would be waiting as opponents in the next knockout round.
Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal car races recorded
Stuttgart - Despite all the threatened penalties and court rulings, drivers continue to step on the gas in countless illegal races on Baden-Württemberg's roads: last year and in the first four months of this year, police in the southwest have already recorded more than 250 illegal car races.
There are no comparative figures for previous years, but the speeders are increasingly making work for the judicial authorities: at the public prosecutor's offices between Constance and Mannheim, a total of 155 preliminary proceedings were conducted for illegal racing in 2018, a year later there were already 252 and in the current year up to the beginning of June already 151.
The races were less about organized events, according to the Interior Ministry's response to a question from the state parliamentary SPD.
In most cases, the drivers spontaneously competed against each other or fled from the police - which is also reported as an illegal race.
At the wheel were mainly German men between the ages of 18 and 60.
113 fines - 15 times imprisonment
Only in comparatively few cases are the speeders caught and also asked to pay: According to the Ministry of the Interior, a total of 113 fines have been imposed and 15 prison sentences handed down since 2018.
However, there is no evidence that the number of illegal car races is actually increasing.
Rather, because of the quite a few tragic accidents and lawsuits in past years, other motorists are reacting more sensitively than before and are reporting more frequently, a ministry spokesman said.
Highway 8 is particularly popular with speeders, who repeatedly slow down traffic there to make room and use the open stretch for a race.
Last August, a dozen drivers were caught doing this near Kirchheim unter Teck, and three months earlier there were as many as 18 drivers on the A8 near Merklingen.
A81 is most popular "race track
On the A81, the police even register more races than on any other federal highway.
An attempt is being made there with a speed limit to slow down the speeders on the particularly affected section between Engen and Geisingen.
The mostly high-priced and pimped-out sports and luxury cars often have Swiss license plates, because the drivers escape to Germany to speed because of the high penalties for speeding and car racing in the neighboring country.
For the SPD, the speed limit should not be limited to a few stretches of road: "With a general speed limit of 130 kilometers per hour, we would get rid of this problem on highways," says Martin Rivoir, the traffic expert for the SPD's state parliamentary group.
"The inhibition threshold for speeders would be significantly higher if you weren't still legally allowed to drive here and there at 200 kilometers per hour and more."
Rivoir thinks less of education or image campaigns: "Anyone who flouts all the rules in such a way and puts not only their own life but also the lives of other road users at risk can hardly be reached with reason.
ADAC calls for stronger police action
For the ADAC, however, this is not enough: "We assume that speeders will not be deterred by the speed limits," says Holger Bach, head of the traffic and environment department at ADAC Württemberg.
He calls for additional and also tougher controls on the affected routes.
Not infrequently, the high-speed trial of strength turns into painful and momentous seriousness: since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people have died nationwide in the races, two of them bystanders in a nighttime crash in Stuttgart's city center and one in Gerlingen.
There, two young men allegedly engaged in a car race in November.
One of the vehicles went off the road, crashed into a garden wall and came to rest on its side, killing the 18-year-old passenger.
21 other people were injured in the races over the past two years.
Stricter penalties, however, are not necessary, according to Interior Minister Thomas Strobl: "Legislative need for action to sanction illegal motor vehicle racing more severely is not seen," the Interior Ministry paper says.

Further witness information is accepted by the police.
Ackermann sprints to victory on final stage at Sibiu Tour
Professional cyclist Pascal Ackermann has claimed his second stage win on the final stage of the 10th Sibiu Tour.
The 26-year-old from the German Palatinate of Team Bora-hansgrohe prevailed in a bunch sprint on the 109-kilometer section with start and finish in Sibiu after he had already won a stage on Saturday.
It was wins three and four for Ackermann this season.
In the overall standings, his Austrian team-mate Gregor Mühlberger came out on top.
The 26-year-old had won the mountain time trial in the morning and thus took the lead in the classification.
Only 104 riders had started the final stage in the evening.
No fewer than 18 starters had fallen victim to the time limit in the mountain time trial.
"I'm really happy to start the new season with a victory," Ackermann had declared after his success on Saturday.
"The sprint was really hectic," said the 26-year-old.
With 300 meters to go, he had simply tightened his sprint, "and it also worked out perfectly."
In accordance with the rules of the world governing body UCI, a Corona test was carried out on all race participants and their companions six days before the start of the race.
During the entire tour, riders and support staff were separated from the organizing team and the media in isolated hygiene bubbles.
Spectators at the start and finish were not allowed.
Control center gave instructions for layman reanimation
Düsseldorf - Tragic accident on Sunday afternoon in Düsseldorf-Garath.
In a multi-family house a child (4) lay suddenly lifeless in the water while bathing.
According to the fire department, the emergency call was received shortly before 1 pm.
"A control center dispatcher immediately gave instructions for lay resuscitation," a fire department spokesman told BILD.
The arriving rescue forces took over the resuscitation measures a little later.
The child, whose life was in danger, was transported to the university hospital under resuscitation.
It is unclear why the accident occurred.
The police have routinely started the investigation into the accident.
The fire department spokesman: "We assume a tragic accident in the apartment".
Nuremberg: Unauthorized tuning meeting - police intervene, 700 cars and about 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and at times over 1000 people took part in a "tuning meeting" on Saturday night in the parking lot of a furniture store.
The police implemented their announcement to control such events more intensively.
A large tuning meeting occurred on Saturday night (July 25, 2020) in Nuremberg Südstadt.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the Central Franconia police, at around 10:30 p.m., Nuremberg traffic police noticed an increased volume of vehicles in the area of a large parking lot in Ingolstädter Straße.
The police then carried out a large number of vehicle checks there.
Only recently, the police had announced that they wanted to take stronger action against so-called car posers.
Illegal tuning meeting in Nuremberg: only a small number from the "scene
The officers counted a good 700 vehicles and about 1100 people at the peak, the police reported.
Of these, however, only a small part of those present could be assigned to the "car poser" and tuning scene.
Apparently, the majority of the relevant scene complied with the appeal of the police.
On the basis of the vehicles and people on site, it can be assumed that these were mainly onlookers.
In addition, the vast majority of those present complied with the applicable infection control regulations, in particular the observance of the minimum distance and the wearing of a mouth-nose protection.
The control measures carried out on site were completed at around 1:00 am.
In total, the officers found such structural changes in 10 vehicles that the operating license had expired.
Four of these vehicles had to be impounded.
No car races
Illegal car racing had not taken place.
"The Central Franconia police headquarters will continue to keep an eye on what is happening and will continue to carry out increased control measures, also in connection with the emergence of onlookers," it said.
The News5 agency spoke to Jürgen Schrödinger of the towing company involved: "They all have nice rims, we must not scratch them," Schrödinger said.
Special tapes would be used for that.
Also, because the cars are wider, the company has to be careful not to damage them, he said.
"After all, the young people should get their cars back undamaged".
Labor Agency figures: 900 suspected cases of abuse of short-time work
Berlin - The Federal Employment Agency (BA) says it is investigating around 900 suspected cases of misuse of short-time working benefits.
"With more than 880,000 companies reporting short-time work, that is extremely few," Daniel Terzenbach, the board member responsible for operations, told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper.
When at the beginning of the Corona crisis suddenly very many companies had applied for short-time work, the BA had to react quickly.
Normally, the examination takes up to three weeks.
"We did not have that much time in this hot phase.
We will look all the more closely at the final accounts.
There will certainly be some more to come.
We are not naive and have staying power."
Indications of abuse often come from the employees concerned or from trade unions.
In addition, the BA uses analysis software to identify patterns of abuse.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is preparing for a possible wave of insolvencies in the fall.
"Will there be significantly more insolvencies than last year?
Estimates differ, but we are arming ourselves for the worst-case scenario and are already training our employees in the employment agencies to process applications for insolvency benefits."
The figures are still unremarkable, said Terzenbach.
World Heritage in Potsdam: Party in the New Garden broken up
Potsdam - On Friday evening, about 40 young people celebrated a party in the New Garden.
The accumulation had been dissolved at 20.48 o'clock by the precinct drivers of the Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation (SPSG), the Foundation told PNN inquiry.
The young people had then left the park.
On Saturday evening, some young people had then played rugby in the New Garden.
The meadow had been cleared by precinct drivers, said SPSG spokesman Frank Kallensee on Sunday.
Again and again it comes to illegal celebrations in the parks
In the parks of the foundation it comes again and again to accumulations, with which the distance and hygiene rules Covid-19-Umgangsverordnung are not kept.
At the end of June, there was a celebration with about 300 people in the Babelsberg Park, and a week later about 150 people celebrated in the New Garden.
Even without a Corona ordinance, the parks are closed at nightfall.
According to the park regulations, camping on the meadows is prohibited, and there are only a few exceptions.
The foundation has been complaining for some time that visitors were leaving more and more trash behind and destroying protected biotopes.
In Berlin, meanwhile, illegal park parties have reached another dimension.
In the Hasenheide in the Neukölln district, 5000 people celebrated an illegal techno party on Sunday night.
The event was broken up by the police.
Austria: Mass tests after Corona outbreak in tourist resort
Authorities have responded to a Corona outbreak in the popular Upper Austrian tourist resort of St. Wolfgang with hundreds of tests.
The number of confirmed cases rose to 48, according to provincial authorities in Linz.
More than 100 results were still pending in the evening.
According to the report, many of those infected are young trainees in tourism businesses, but at least one vacation guest also tested positive.
Residents, guests and tourism employees were asked to stay in their accommodations on Saturday evening.
The curfew was set at 11 p.m.
"There are cancellations and cancellations here and there" of bookings, the head of the Wolfgangsee tourism association, Hans Wieser, told dpa.
There have also been isolated guests who have left early, he said.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist destination in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 overnight stays last year.
In a normal season, about a third of the guests are German.
On Friday, the first infections had become public knowledge.
The head of the district authority, Alois Lanz, defended on Saturday the behavior of the trainees, who had celebrated in several pubs and may have been infected.
"We all liked to do that in our youth," he told radio station Ö1.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The tourism board launched an information campaign to make young employees aware of the dangers of Covid-19.
Hundreds of employees, vacationers and locals were then tested starting Saturday.
Additionally, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang as of July 15 were contacted.
The outbreak brings back memories of the Austrian ski and party resort of Ischgl in Tyrol, which was a center of Corona spread throughout Europe during the early stages of the pandemic.
In total, more than 1500 people are currently infected with the virus in Austria.
The main areas of new infections are Vienna and Upper Austria.
Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualified for Champions League
London (dpa) - English soccer record champions Manchester United are returning to the Champions League after a year's absence.
The Red Devils secured third place in the table on the final matchday of the Premier League with a 2-0 (0-0) win over direct rivals Leicester City.
The Foxes will now have to settle for the Europa League because Chelsea FC passed them by and also qualified for the top flight in fourth place.
In the battle against relegation, Aston Villa was able to celebrate.
Manchester United took the lead through a penalty kick by Bruno Fernandes (71st minute).
After a red card for Leicester City in injury time, Jesse Lingard (90.+8) scored the final goal.
Chelsea, FC Bayern's opponent in the Champions League round of 16, won 2-0 (2:0) against Wolverhampton Wanderers in parallel thanks to Mason Mount (45.+1) and Olivier Giroud (45.+4).
"It means a lot to me," said coach Frank Lampard, who is also in the FA Cup final against Arsenal in his first season as Chelsea coach.
Also benefiting from Chelsea's win over Wolverhampton was Tottenham Hotspur, which edged past Wolves with a meager 1-1 (1-0) draw at Crystal Palace to start sixth in the Europa League.
Aston Villa won the long-distance duel with Watford FC and AFC Bournemouth, but had to tremble for a long time at West Ham United.
Jack Grealish's late lead (84th) was immediately cancelled out by Andrej Jarmolenko (85th).
The 1:1 (0:0) was enough, however, because Watford lost 2:3 (1:3) at Arsenal.
The club, which fired three coaches during the season, is relegated after five first division years.
Just like Bournemouth, which could not save itself with a 3:1 (2:1) at Everton FC.
In the end, they were one point short.
Liverpool FC, which has been the English champion since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3-1 (1-1) win at Newcastle United.
99 points are the highest the Reds have ever scored in a soccer season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp and his team just missed the points record in English soccer.
The best mark is held by Manchester City with 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
After Newcastle took the lead in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38th), Divock Origi (59th) and Sadio Mané (89th) turned the game around for Liverpool on Sunday.
"It's been an extraordinary season for this wonderful club," scorer van Dijk said after the game, "that should spur us on to defend the title.
It will be difficult."
Satisfied should also be the Premier League bosses in the end.
Due to the coronavirus crisis, soccer operations in England were interrupted from March 13 to June 17.
In the meantime, there were even discussions about premature termination or playing the remaining games on neutral ground.
In the end, however, the season was played to a close without any particular incidents - albeit, as in Germany, without spectators in the stadiums.
Arrests and violence at demonstrations against Netanyahu
Protests in Israel against head of government Netanyahu are becoming more violent.
Violent clashes have occurred during the night.
Israeli police violently cracked down on participants in a demonstration against the right-wing conservative head of government Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem on Sunday night.
Twelve people were arrested for participating in riots, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said.
Among other things, the police used water cannons to break up the rally.
A total of about 6,000 people had gathered near Netanyahu's official residence on Saturday evening, according to media reports.
They were protesting unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu's handling of the Corona crisis.
The protesters beat drums, blew horns and called on Netanyahu to resign.
Participants in a counter-demonstration who supported Netanyahu were also arrested, the news site "ynet" reported.
People also demonstrated in many other locations in Israel, including outside the head of government's private villa in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
One man was arrested near Tel Aviv on suspicion of spraying pepper spray from a moving car at protesters on the side of the road, according to police.
Another man was arrested after a knife attack on a demonstrator in the south of the country.
The demonstrator had been lightly wounded in the neck.
There have been several demonstrations against Netanyahu in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv recently.
The rallies accompany the corruption trial against the head of government.
Recently, Netanyahu has also been criticized for his handling of the Corona crisis.
Among other things, he has been accused of hasty easing and a lack of preparation for a second Corona wave.
The Corona crisis has taken a heavy toll on the country's economy.
The unemployment rate recently exceeded 20 percent.
The number of new infections with the corona virus in Israel recently rose to ever new record levels.
Accident near Ahlen (NRW) - Transporter crashes into car - nine injured - Ruhrgebiet - Bild.de
Ahlen - A rear-end collision caused nine light injuries on Saturday afternoon on the B58 near Ahlen.
A car driver was traveling with her two children (3, 5) in the direction of Beckum.
The police: "Presumably she had braked suddenly because she wanted to turn".
The driver of a Mercedes transporter, who was driving behind her, must have seen this too late.
He crashed into the back of the van.
Three occupants in the car and six in the van were slightly injured in the accident.
Several ambulances took them to a nearby hospital.
North Korea seals off border town after Corona suspect case
North Korea has so far considered its own measures to ward off the corona virus a "shining success."
Now, for the first time, the country is reporting a suspected case.
Because of a first official suspected corona case in the country, North Korea has completely sealed off a major city for fear of disaster.
Despite the strictest epidemiological defense measures over the past six months, "the malignant virus may have been introduced into the country," state media reported.
A state of emergency had been declared for the region around the border city of Kaesong.
The communist leadership declared the highest level of alert.
If the suspected case is confirmed, it would be the first official case of infection with Sars-CoV-2 in the isolated country.
North Korea said it had not registered a single infection so far and described its defensive measures as a "shining success."
The claims were doubted abroad.
The disease symptoms were reportedly detected in a "runaway" who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on July 19.
The person had absconded to South Korea three years ago and had now returned across the border.
There was initially no confirmation from South Korea of the border crossing within the four-kilometer-wide military buffer zone, most of which is still mined.
South Korea's military, however, acknowledged the possibility of an illegal border crossing into North Korea as high, according to reports by the national news agency Yonhap.
Investigations were running to this to some persons.
North Korea said it called an emergency meeting of the Workers' Party Politburo, chaired by strongman Kim Jong Un, on Saturday over the suspicion.
The "dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive disaster."
Kim had already ordered on Friday as a preventive measure to "completely blockade Kaesong and isolate each district and the region from others," the statement added.
The person involved, as well as all people in Kaesong who had had contact with him, had been quarantined, it said.
According to the statement, the party's central military commission will investigate the "runaway case" as well as the behavior of the military unit responsible and impose harsh punishment if necessary.
According to estimates, about 300,000 people live in Kaesong.
Tension ahead of council meeting: City East and noise abatement up for discussion before big summer break
"In addition to environmental topics, the committee members will also vote, among other things, on the development plan for the major project City Center Development East," it says rather casually in the middle section of the municipal press release for the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, July 28, at 4:30 p.m. in the Great Hall of the CongressCentrum Pforzheim.
Above all the upgrading of the eastern city center is discussed controversially to the end.
The majorities for it are scarce, last in individual committees depending upon attendance even rejecting.
An appeal from the business community (construction, real estate, trade and IT) not to let the project, which was developed from the citizenry and then by the administration and the city council, fail now after almost ten years of preparation, was criticized by project opponent Reinhard Klein as "extra-parliamentary opposition", "clueless", "speculation", "disparagement" and "deliberate false statements".
"Everyone thinks they know better," said Klein, who has been a member of the local council for a year as the sole representative of the Bürgerliste Pforzheim.
In fact, he said, after reading the contracts, he is in this position: "I know what I'm talking about."
The exit comes the city cheaper, the technical city hall is contrary to statements of the city administration after subsidies, of whose existence Klein is convinced, for 8.5 million euros to redevelop.
The city will develop quite differently than is predicted in the city hall and by the supporters from the business community.
To shape the city by its own power and not an investor: That was his plan B. One day after Klein, the FDP/FW/UB/LED faction, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
In essence, it also provides for the renovation of the Technical City Hall, keeping the Schloßberg open, renting the ex-Thale for administrative space and a small-scale inner city redevelopment, ideally with local sponsors.
Environmental issues play a central role
In addition, environmental issues will play a central role.
Among other things, the municipal council will vote on the noise action plan.
This contains various measures for the protection of the population of Pforzheim from health-related noise pollution caused by road traffic, including in many cases speed reductions.
In a press release, the local German Transport Club welcomes the widespread introduction of 30 km/h. However, the politically responsible people in the city are not innocent of the fact that this must come about in this way, because they have contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus noise by neglecting the regular bus service with thinned-out intervals and by little commitment to bicycle traffic, says the VCD.
Likewise the local council votes on the participation of the city of the energy and climatic protection agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
Also on the agenda is the accession to the climate protection pact of the state of Baden-Württemberg, the redefinition of parental contributions in the municipal day care centers and the application for inclusion in the Smart City funding of the federal government.
Citizens are welcome, but must heed Corona protections.
After much delay, Tim Zimmermann starts the new season
After a delay of almost half a year, Tim Zimmermann will start his premiere season in the ADAC GT Masters on July 31.
Before the league of super sports cars can start regular operations, the first test drives were now scheduled.
For Zimmermann, the main focus was on getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3 better.
For a long time, the Corona crisis prevented Tim Zimmermann from tackling his first service drive in the new Lamborghini Huracan from Grasser Racing.
Under special hygienic conditions this was now possible.
The 23-year-old from Langenargen did his first laps at the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his premiere in the GT3 car.
"There are already a few things that are different from the Porsche from the previous season," says Zimmermann.
"With the ABS, for example, you have to take the corners differently.
But it was really a lot of fun."
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite being only 25 years old, the Dutchman is already experienced in GT racing and was able to help his new teammate in many ways.
"After all, I'm not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series also brings new challenges," Zimmermann says.
"Steijn and I get on brilliantly and we also made enormous progress from session to session at the Lausitzring."
That's exactly where - at the Lausitzring - the GT Masters will also hold its first race.
Starting on July 31, the 33 supercars will race through the Lausitz.
Zimmermann, who is one of 15 series newcomers, knows the track, however.
He was last a guest at the Motodrom in 2015.
"It worked out quickly and I didn't have to get used to the track very much," says Zimmermann, who competes for the Friedrichshafen-based Graf Zeppelin racing team.
"The Lausitzring has many fast passages that you have to hit perfectly to be fast."
How fast Zimmermann really is then will be revealed in two weeks.
"Of course, the teams play a little poker during the tests," he says.
"In the end, however, we are very satisfied and are looking forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring."
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a packed calendar.
Seven races are scheduled between now and the beginning of November.
The current status is that no spectators will be allowed - but there will be a celebrity guest.
In mid-August at the Nürburgring, ex-Formula 1 driver Niko Hülkenberg will take to the GT wheel.
British transport minister caught cold by quarantine decision
The British government's decision to quarantine holidaymakers in Spain for two weeks after their return has, according to press reports, caught the country's transport minister cold.
According to the report, Grant Shapps is currently on vacation in Spain, of all places, while his colleagues at home decided on the measure on Saturday.
Because of the Corona numbers rising again in Spain, the Cabinet in London deleted the country from the list of those countries from which entry is possible without quarantine requirements.
The new regulation applies from today, Sunday, so Shapps will also have to quarantine after his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returnees.
But the regulation applies to those who are just on the deadline vacation, only from Saturday, August 1, and was not introduced overnight.
Spain, by the way, is considered in Austria until now as one of the "safe countries" for which no quarantine is needed in Austria.
"Numerous ministers may have known in advance that there was a possibility that a quarantine would be imposed on holidaymakers Spain," commented Labour MP Diane Abbot.
"But apparently no one bothered to let Grant Shapps know".
Less than a month after the end of the Corona emergency in Spain and the expiration of the strict curfew, the infection figures in the country are rising again.
Virologists blame nightlife in particular for the renewed spread.
Spain is one of the favorite vacation destinations of the British.
From not necessary Reisens on the Spanish mainland the British government advises at present, the Canaries and Balearen particularly popular with British holiday-makers are excluded from it.
To date, more than 272,000 infections with the novel coronavirus and more than 28,000 deaths have been recorded in Spain.
Russia: Navy Day: Putin announces hypersonic weapons for warships
Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced on the occasion of his country's Navy Day that warships will be equipped with state-of-the-art hypersonic weapons.
These weapons, unique in the world, would expand the combat capabilities of Russia's naval forces, Putin said Sunday in St. Petersburg at the central naval parade.
The Defense Ministry also provided information on successful tests of the Zirkon hypersonic missile built for the Navy, according to the Interfax agency.
The hypersonic weapons have a speed of sound many times greater than the speed of sound, about 343 meters per second.
They are considered weapons of the future.
Underwater tropedeo continues to be built
Construction also continues on the Poseidon nuclear-tipped underwater torpedo, it said.
The planned naval drone is designed to destroy coastal targets.
The president, who himself also rode in a military boat, said that 40 new ships would be commissioned this year alone at the various fleet units of the world's largest country.
Russia has a coastal area larger than any other country in the world.
For 300 years, the navy has reliably protected Russia, Putin said at the day celebrated by sailors nationwide.
Naval forces in many other Russian coastal locations also celebrated Navy Day with parades.
In Syria, where Russia is fighting alongside strongman Bashar al-Assad, the military demonstrated strength at an arms display in the Mediterranean port of Tartus.
Ammunition was also fired there.
On display in a video released by the Defense Ministry were not only warships, including a submarine, but also combat helicopters and jets.
Hurricane "Hanna" reaches Texas: Help hampered because of Corona
Washington - The first hurricane of this season over the Atlantic has made landfall in Texas.
Life-threatening flooding, strong winds and heavy rains now threatened parts of the U.S. state, the National Hurricane Center of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced Sunday night (local time).
Governor Greg Abbott declared a state of emergency for numerous counties.
The Corona pandemic rampant in Texas complicates the work of aid workers, Abbott said further, according to U.S. media.
Evacuees urged to use caution
"Any hurricane is a tremendous challenge," Abbott said, according to the Houston Chronicle newspaper.
Referring to the hurricane in Texas, he added, "That challenge is complicated and exacerbated when you consider that it is sweeping through an area that is the most Covid-19-affected area in the state."
According to Johns Hopkins University, about 5,000 people have died so far in Texas alone as a result of the Corona pandemic.
Abbott urged people who would have to leave their homes to be cautious.
They should not disregard practices "we have become accustomed to," such as wearing masks, the governor said, according to the CBS network.
It was important for everyone to keep their distance, he said.
For that reason, he said, hotel rooms have been made available in some locations.
In addition, it should be tested in emergency shelters on Corona, he said.
Damage had initially been reported only from the coastal town of Port Mansfield.
Storm warning withdrawn again
With wind speeds of up to 150 kilometers per hour, "Hanna" had made landfall on Padre Island just off the Texas coast, according to authorities.
The tropical storm had previously been upgraded to the lowest level one hurricane.
A storm surge warning had initially been issued for the coastal section from Port Mansfield to Sargent and was later withdrawn.
Authorities expected weakening as "Hanna" moved further inland and headed toward northeastern Mexico.
"Douglas" moves toward Hawaii
In the Pacific Ocean, Hurricane "Douglas" was headed toward Hawaii Sunday night with winds of about 150 kilometers per hour.
However, the hurricane center expected it to weaken further.
According to the forecast, it should be near Hawaii's largest islands on Sunday (local time) - then as a storm just below the hurricane threshold.
Over the Atlantic, NOAA expected an above-average active hurricane season this year, according to a May forecast.
From June to the end of November, up to ten hurricanes can be expected, of which up to six could become very strong hurricanes, the agency had said.
On average, there are six hurricanes per year over the Atlantic, three of which develop into major storms.
Given available climate data and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and Caribbean, the probability of a normal season is only 30 percent, and that of a below-average season is only 10 percent, it said at the time.
U.S. President Donald Trump wrote via Twitter that his administration was closely monitoring the storms and was in contact with the affected states.
Four goals disallowed: Video assistant "punishes" Sassuolo
Sassuolo's Filip Djuricic was disallowed two goals at once
Naples - Four goals scored, four goals disallowed: Sassuolo Calcio experienced a pitch black evening in the 0:2 (0:1) at SSC Napoli in the Italian Football League Serie A - and was really angry with the video assistant referee.
"A festival of not given goals for Sassuolo.
Never before has the VAR been so harsh on a team," commented the "Corriere dello Sport".
Host Napoli had taken the lead through a goal from full-back Elseid Hisaj in the 8th minute, and Filip Djuricic initially celebrated the equalizer in the 32nd minute.
The Video Assistant Referee (VAR) took the goal back because of an offside position.
Five minutes later, Djuricic shot the ball into the net again - again the VAR intervened.
The goals of attacker Francesco Caputo (50th) and Domenico Berardi (61st) were also taken back by the referee team after the VAR pointed it out.
In stoppage time, Allan made the final score 2-0 for Napoli and the bitter evening for Sassuolo perfect.
"The VAR is worse for Sassuolo than a speed trap on the road and punishes Sassuolo like no team before.
The new technology is setting records," writes the "Gazzetta dello Sport".
FC Bayern Munich: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start of the hot preparation phase for the Champions League began for double winners FC Bayern with a setback.
Hansi Flick, who recovered "reasonably well" after a short vacation and a few days of training, will have to think about how to rebuild his successful defense after the first team training session after the injury of world champion Benjamin Pavard.
The Frenchman, who has the third most minutes of action behind captain Manuel Neuer and midfield boss Joshua Kimmich, suffered a ligament injury to his left ankle and is in danger of missing crucial top-flight duels.
In Munich's mucky weather, the right-back broke off a training match and was driven off the pitch in a golf cart.
It remains to be seen how long the unrestricted regular will have to take a break in the fight for the title.
A deployment in the round of 16 second leg against Chelsea FC on August 8 is likely to be difficult, the 24-year-old can hope for the final tournament starting on August 12 in Lisbon.
The Bavarians, however, do not want to let the mishap from training on Sunday stop them.
In his personal triple formula, Flick named the three attributes he wants to see from his stars on the road to Portugal's capital.
Quality, intensity and concentration are what his victory-hungry title collectors are expected to show in what would ideally be the 28 days between now and the final of the Champions League on August 23.
"We have mastered the compulsory tasks with the championship and cup simply outstanding.
Now it is a matter of creating the special still," said Flick.
However, before the Munich team can get to grips with the final tournament and a training camp in the Algarve beforehand, they first have to play Chelsea FC in the round of 16.
After the 3-0 in the first leg before the Corona break, the Londoners in the home arena should not become the Bayern nightmare again as in the lost "Final dahoam" 2012.
"We have to go through the door first.
We want to win, create good conditions and fill up confidence with a good game," demanded Flick.
A test to get in the mood is scheduled for Friday against Olympique Marseille.
With a long speech, Flick had sworn in his stars, who had 13 days off after the double, for a unique August.
He welcomed 31 players to Säbener Straße, including the new players around noble purchase Leroy Sané, who met all new colleagues on the pitch for the first time after his transfer from Manchester City.
"Leroy has fitted in well, as have all the newcomers," Flick reported.
But instead of talking about the new season, when Sané &amp; Co. are no longer only allowed to train with, Flick talked much rather about the current title project of the German serial champion.
After days of individual and small group training, they are now training in team strength for the Londoners, who, unlike Flick's ensemble, are in the rhythm of the game.
After that, the Munich team could face a quarterfinal against FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, with Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin possible opponents in the semifinals.
A path to the final in Lisbon "is not that easy," stressed the head coach, who from Tuesday can rely on the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training.
Klose, a World Cup record scorer, and Flick know from many a joint tournament preparation what is particularly important in the 0-on-100 preparation.
Working with his current team is "a pleasure," Flick praised.
The "focus on winning" is an impressive trait of his team.
The tournament with nine-man teams was also an ambitious affair on Sunday.
Of the top performers, all were there, including Thiago, who is eager to leave, and defender David Alaba, whose whereabouts beyond the premier league season are not assured.
Formula 1 needs a special rule to crown its world champion
Since it is not possible to race on the required number of continents, the FIA has to improvise in order to award the world championship titles.
All races in the Americas, meanwhile, have been canceled.
Race calendar becomes more and more concrete
The race calendar for the current Formula 1 season continues to take shape.
In addition to the ten Grand Prix confirmed so far, three more race tracks were added during the week.
In October, races are to be held at the Nürburgring in Germany and Portimão in Portugal.
On the first of November, Lewis Hamilton and Co. will be fighting for world championship points at the traditional Italian race track in Imola.
As things stand, this means that the 2020 race calendar will comprise 13 rounds.
"We are delighted that we continue to make great progress in finalizing our plans for the 2020 season," said Formula One boss Chase Carey.
A total of 15 to 18 races are expected to be completed in the premier class of motorsport during this extraordinary season.
Formula 1 plans to conclude its season in Asia.
The final race calendar is to be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
Before the races in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December, which have already been officially targeted, media reports suggest that there could still be appearances in Vietnam and Malaysia at the end of November.
Regulations require races on three continents
However, Formula 1's regulations require at least races on three continents for the world championship to be awarded.
Even if, as is currently planned, races are only held on two continents, there is to be one world champion.
With the help of a special rule, the FIA wants to award the titles, citing "exceptional circumstances" due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The traditional start of the season in Australia in March had to be cancelled at short notice due to the emerging corona crisis.
A return to the continent this year is not an option.
In addition, Formula 1 will not be visiting America this year.
Cancellation meets with criticism in Brazil
Due to the tense Corona situation, the races in Canada, the U.S., Mexico and Brazil will not take place.
"We look forward to being back with them next season," Carey explained.
The cancellation of the Americas races was met with criticism, particularly in Brazil: "The cancellation did not come as a surprise to us, but we cannot accept the reasons for it," said Tamas Rohonyi, promoter of the Grand Prix in São Paulo.
For example, he said, the infection figures in the São Paulo area are much lower than in other regions of Brazil.
Moreover, the concerns of some teams about not wanting to race in Brazil would not justify a cancellation.
They were prepared for the required safety measures, he said.
Greta Thunberg: Evil look against Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her encounter with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest on Stephen Colbert's popular latenight show via video chat and revealed in an interview what was on her mind during her encounter with Donald Trump.
Climate activist Greta Thunberg was a guest on a popular US latenight show via video chat.
Among other things, she talked about her fight against the powerful of the world.
The teenager also talked about her famous "evil eye" when she met Donald Trump.
New York City - In the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg drew attention to herself with her tireless efforts for the "Fridays For Future" movement.
Now she spoke on a popular latenight show about her plans for the future, as well as her encounter with U.S. President Donald Trump at the UN Climate Summit last year.
Latenight host Stephen Colbert welcomed the 17-year-old Thunberg to your show on Tuesday and conducted a lengthy interview with the Swede.
In it, she talked not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the world's powerful.
"There are some things that surprised me," she opined.
"How far people will go to shift the focus away from the climate crisis" shocked her, she said.
"Everything from organized hate campaigns to threats just because a group of kids take to the streets" is what she experienced, she said.
She finds heads of state and leading politicians who mock her on social media or even try to silence her "funny" because the reactions show her "because they have no other response."
Things got particularly interesting toward the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was asked about a famous scene in which she gave U.S. President Trump a bitter look.
At the 2019 UN Climate Summit in New York, for which the actvist sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive look was caught on camera and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
The short clip was turned into a GIF, or animated image, which ultimately became one of the most used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think about the U.S. president at that moment?
In response to Stephen Colbert's relatively open question, she replied only briefly and dryly: "To be honest, I don't think that needs any further explanation.
The experienced satirist Colbert probably didn't expect this quick-witted answer and disappeared from the picture laughing for a moment.
She was remembered by many at the climate conference for her "How dare you?" speech on the principles of climate protection.
Ex-Dortmund Immobile with triple pack for Lazio Roma
Ciro Immobile is now tied with Bayern's Robert Lewandowski in the race for Europe's Golden Boot.
Former Dortmund player Ciro Immobile still has the best chance of becoming the top scorer in the Italian soccer championship.
The former BVB pro contributed three goals in Lazio Roma's 5-1 (1-1) win at Hellas Verona, including two converted penalties in stoppage time of both halves.
With two games to go, the 30-year-old now has 34 goals to his name from the fourth-placed team in the table - the same number scored by FC Bayern München's Robert Lewandowski in the past Bundesliga season.
In Italy, Cristiano Ronaldo follows with 30 goals so far, the Portuguese superstar met with the leader in the evening still Sampdoria Genoa.
Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green dead.
His life was like a roller coaster ride: after a rapid rise with Fleetwood Mac, it went steeply downhill and then slowly up again.
Now blues rock guitarist Peter Green has died at the age of 73.
Genius guitarist, drug junkie, cult devotee: the co-founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully in his sleep at the age of 73, family members announced in an official statement on Saturday, with a further statement to be announced in the coming days.
Top musicians such as Peter Frampton paid tribute to Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood, in an emotional response, spoke of a "monumental loss" for all former and current members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
Fleetwood, a drummer, and Green, a guitarist, had formed the now long legendary band in London in 1967; his dreamy instrumental hit "Albatross" remains unforgotten to this day.
The musician's life ("The End Of The Game," "In The Skies") resembled a roller coaster ride.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a rapid ascent - but the band then celebrated its greatest successes without him.
Among other things, there is said to have been a dispute because Green wanted to donate all the group's profits to charity.
He began to appear in wide robes and with a large crucifix.
Psychological problems are also said to have played a role.
Just three years after forming, Green left the band in 1970.
A social decline followed.
The blues rock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, as biographers reported.
For a long time, Green was treated in a psychiatric ward.
During much of the 1970s, the musician disappeared from the scene.
He reportedly lived on the streets at times, worked as a cemetery gardener and spent time on an Israeli kibbutz.
Green was born in 1946 to a working-class Jewish family in London's Bethnal Green neighborhood.
At a young age, he became fascinated with U.S. blues musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
He learned his first guitar chords at the age of eleven.
At the age of 15, the teenager started playing guitar professionally and five years later got the chance to be on stage as the lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners.
Not long after, he was hired to replace his idol Eric Clapton in the Bluesbreakers.
In the midst of the blues boom, Green formed Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967 with fellow Bluesbreakers members Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross," composed by Green, gave the group its first number one hit in the winter of 1968/69 and catapulted them to the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid rise soon showed its downsides: Green couldn't cope with the media hype, and his experiments with the drug LSD became increasingly extreme.
He later commented on his life between music and addiction in an interview: "The worst thing that happened to me in life was the drugs - the best thing was to land a number 1 hit.
Toward the end of the decade, Green surprisingly achieved respectable success in 1979 with an album inspired by religious themes.
Fleetwood Mac, meanwhile, was riding a wave of success without him in a new formation.
Their 1977 album "Rumours" sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Despite various small solo successes, Green did not manage a major comeback until 1996, when he relaunched with a group of musician friends.
At the time, the British "Daily Telegraph" spoke of a rock star who had returned to earth.
Free of drugs, Green released several albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group until the band broke up in 2004.
For music experts, he was already a blues legend during his lifetime - and with his smooth sound one of the most influential guitarists of the past decades.
