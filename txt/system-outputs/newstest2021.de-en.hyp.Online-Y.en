Biker reacts lightning fast and prevents worse
On Friday evening, a traffic accident occurred on the country road between Machtolsheim and Merklingen, in which a motorcyclist was only slightly injured thanks to his quick reaction.
motorist overlooks bikers
A 44-year-old car driver wanted to turn left on the state road 1230 in the direction of Machtolsheim with her VW coming from Merklingen.
She missed the 24-year-old motorcyclist who is coming from the direction of Nellingen.
Hand and foot brake levers fly away in collision
The biker was still trying to avoid the car, but nevertheless toured it at the rear of the vehicle.
The stripping process torn off the hand and foot brake levers on the Suzuki and the driver was no longer able to slow down.
At his mind, he steered his motorcycle in the green stiffens next to the roadway and let it roll out there without falling.
Biker suffers leg injury
As a result of the car collision, the biker still suffered an injury to the car and had to be treated in a clinic.
Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 harvester infected
After a corona mass infection on a large vegetable farm in mamming in Lower Bavaria, almost 500 people are quarantined and are no longer allowed to leave the company.
A security service is monitoring the ban on outgoing.
A total of 174 harvest assistants were tested positive for the corona pathogen SARS-CoV-2 during the series investigation, as the district office Dingolfing-Landau announced on Saturday evening.
“To avoid further spread, we unfortunately have to take this step to protect the population,” explained District Councillor Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Previously, seven employees had already been infected in the company - this was the reason for the series test.
The farm is a large vegetable farm that grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and beetroot - but the cucumbers are used only for pickling jars.
Mamming is a rural community with over 3300 inhabitants not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW factory.
Bumeder appealed to citizens to keep calm: “According to our information, this is a closed circle of people”.
Infected workers have been separated from uninfected employees on the farm, and the site is now surrounded by a barrier fence.
Greens and SPD shared responsibility to the state government.
The two opposition groups accused Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet of neglecting the control of seasonal workers' shelters.
“This can take revenge bitterly when such local infection events have to be taken out and regional lockdowns have to be ordered,” said Jürgen Mistol, the Green Parliamentary Director.
The SPD looks very similar: “After the corona outbreak in the meadow yard slaughterhouse in mid-May, we also called for a special control program for farms with harvest assistants,” said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
“From our point of view, hygiene conditions in the workplace and housing conditions in particular need to be closely monitored.
That obviously didn't happen”.
The outbreak came “with announcement.”
Aidenbachstraße Underground Station: Dangerous dispute: 19-year-old falls into track bed after pushers
In a dispute between two youth groups at Aidenbachstraße underground station, a 19-year-old fell through a push and slipped into the track bed.
Obersendling - On Friday, there was a dispute between two youth groups at Aidenbachstraße Underground Station around 4.15 pm.
A passerby alerted the police, who came up with several stripes.
According to initial investigations, a Munich (17) pushed a 19-year-old to the ground.
The young man slipped over the edge of the platform and fell into the track bed.
People from the 17-year-old's group helped the fallen climb out of the track.
There was no danger from an incoming rail.
As the police report, there were again conflicts between the two people afterwards.
The 17-year-old fled the crime scene at first, but his personal details could be determined afterwards.
Accompanied by his father, he went to the police department 29.
The 17-year-old is being investigated for bodily harm.
Report: Seehofer urges longer data retention
Data retention is currently suspended.
However, Federal Interior Minister Horst Seehofer calls for an extension of the storage period after a media report.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
Federal Interior Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) calls for an extended data retention after a media report - half a year instead of the planned ten weeks.
As the “Bild am Sonntag” reports, Seehofer Minister of Justice Christine Lambrecht (SPD) asked for a quick change in the law in a letter.
Seehofer therefore intends to step up measures against child abuse.
He believes it makes sense to “make much-needed adjustments to the law right now,” the newspaper quotes from his letter.
Data retention is currently suspended.
The ECJ is expected to make a decision on this.
However, Seehofer wants the changes in advance so that they could be applied immediately after a possible positive judgment, the report continues.
A spokesperson for the Ministry of Justice told the newspaper that it could only be sensibly examined whether legal adjustments were needed once the courts had decided.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer, together with the national interior ministers, had already spoken out in favour of data retention in June.
NBA: Strip Club Hassle for Clippers Star Lou Williams
Excitement in the NBA!
Lou Williams (33), basketball pro of Los Angeles Clippers, is said to have left the tournament quarters in Disney World in Orlando /Florida with permission for a funeral.
According to US media reports, he still visited the strip club “Magic City” in Atlanta in the evening.
Williams, who is said to have admitted the visit according to ESPN data, is back in isloation, is being testered for Covid-19 daily.
His reason for visiting: chicken wings.
In February last year, “Sweet Lou”, as it is called in the NBA, has already expressed his love for these very wings.
The American wrote: “Magic City and Blue Flame (another strip club in Atlanta, by the right note) have the best wings in town”.
NBA insider Shams Charania announced on Twitter on Sunday that NBA Williams ordered a ten-day quarantine.
This way, the clippers star misses the first two official games after the test game phase.
In Disney World, the NBA wants to end the corona season.
At the moment, the top 22 teams with training games are preparing for the season finale that begins on Friday night.
Söder expresses on the corona situation after mass infection
Munich - Health Minister Melanie Huml (CSU) already announced a tea offensive for large farms on Sunday.
The press conference will be shown live on our homepage.
The case in Mamming in the district of Dingolfing-Landau has scared public authorities and politics.
Almost 500 harvesters from several countries are currently working at the large vegetable farm farm, with over a third infected with the corona pathogen.
The farm is now under quarantine and is closed off with a construction fence.
No one is allowed to leave the premises, food is delivered.
The authorities now offer free corona testing to the community's over 3300 residents.
As the harvesters had little contact with the local population, the district office has previously assumed that the infections have not spread beyond the farm.
“Bite of Conscience”: Confession of the alleged arsonist of Nantes
“My client was cooperative,” lawyer Quentin Chabert told the newspaper.
The defender added: “He very much regrets the actions, the confession was a liberation for him.”
His mandate is “plagued by remorse and very much taken away by the extent of the destruction.”
In the event of a conviction, the man is threatened with ten years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros, according to the public prosecutor's office.
The Gothic Saint Peter and Paul Cathedral in Nantes was severely damaged in a fire the night on Saturday last week.
The fire had broken out in three distant places in the church.
Laboratory tests confirmed suspicion of arson.
The suspect now detained had been arrested just a few hours after the fire.
But he was released after a day.
The man works as a volunteer for the diocese of Nantes and was responsible for closing the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
As there was no sign of a violent entry into the church, he quickly came into the spotlight of investigators.
Discuss the abolition of the 50+1 rule
Former DFB President Reinhard Grindel has recommended that you think about the abolition of the 50+1 rule.
“German football should at least discuss setting conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates completed facts,” Grindel told the “Bild am Sonntag”.
He stressed: “The 50+1 rules do not work for the clubs that are most likely to become Bavaria and Dortmund dangerous anyway: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, it is not possible to avoid the debate whether it is not necessary to facilitate investor involvement for clubs that want to break into this phalanx”.
However, he doubts whether there is a willingness to allow majority participation in the German Football League that is prohibited by the 50+1 rule in the Bundesliga.
“It remains a legal risk to pull investment fences around the Bundesliga as a business location in a European single market,” said Grindel.
The former DFB head sees the danger that “attempts to create more competitive balance in the Bundesliga end only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but do not lead to more tension in the championship”.
Even a uniform distribution of TV money will not have a decisive effect.
“FC Bayern generates sales of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund from 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million.
The differences are therefore immense among the top three clubs alone.
The other 15 clubs have an average budget of 130 million,” said the 58-year-old.
With a view to the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
“Unfortunately, there were people who noticed this error and pierced it to the press instead of talking to me about it,” Grindel said about accepting an expensive watch that led to his resignation in April 2019.
“This has already been very concerned with me in human terms.”
He received the gift worth around 11,000 euros from a Ukrainian official.
“I committed a compliance violation and it was right to draw the consequences from it,” said Grindel.
“I handled the ominous watch gift completely transparently and unruthlessly.
Many people in the DFB knew about it”.
He never “made a secret from the gift,” assured the 58-year-old.
“You might call it naive, at least this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption.”
“Black Lives Matter”: Injured and a Dead
The protests against police violence in the United States have sharpened again due to Donald Trump's deployment of federal police officers in several cities.
Clashes between demonstrators and police officers occurred in different cities on Saturday.
Three people were injured in Louisville, while 16 people were arrested in Seattle.
In Austin, a person was killed by shots while a demonstration train just crossed an intersection.
Clashes had previously occurred again in Portland during protests against racism and police violence.
The security forces, including federal police officials, used tear gas on Saturday night and forcibly assaulted protesters.
Hundreds, partly armed demonstrators marched through Louisville in Kentucky on Saturday and demanded that those responsible for Breonna Taylor's death should be held responsible for Breonna Taylor's death.
The 26-year-old student was shot dead in a drug raid in her apartment in Louisville in March.
The raid was aimed at someone else who didn't live there at all and no drugs were found either.
When a member of a group called themselves an armed alliance of black Americans fired a shot on Saturday, three people were injured.
According to the station NBC, they were taken to hospital.
None of them were in danger of their lives.
The police set up barricades because counterdemonstrators of a white militia had also formed.
In the end, the two groups did not meet.
In Austin, Texas, a person was shot dead and died in the course of a “Black Lives Matter” demonstration.
The police, according to their own statements, took a suspect into custody.
She has not yet provided any details on the circumstances of the act.
Mayor Steve Adler said, according to the “New York Times,” he was “inconsolable and stunned” about what happened, like many in the city.
Protesters also had clashes with the police in the American metropolis Seattle on Saturday.
They set fire to construction trucks in front of a youth prison, and the police used blending grenades and pepper spray.
According to the “Seattle Times,” 16 people were arrested for resistance to police officers or bodily harm.
A courthouse was set on fire in the city of Oakland, California.
A small group of protesters smashed windows, shot down fireworks, and dazzled police officers with lasers, Oakland police reported late Saturday night (local time).
The fire was quickly extinguished again.
In Aurora, a suburb of Denver in Colorado, a car drove through a crowd demonstrating on a highway.
Police reported that one of the protesters fired a gun and at least one person was taken to hospital injured.
In addition, windows were smashed in a court there too and a fire was set, as the police said.
Investigations have been started.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historical costumes defy Corona
Although the big break was missing in the spa town, visitors and performers enjoyed the rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, performers and organizers: the Rakoczy weekend without a rakoczy festival.
But: Even though the big party mile in the city center was missing, crowds and program highlights such as Saale, rakoczy ball or pageant were burning, many of them got their money's worth with the Corona-compliant alternative program.
“I think we managed to spread rakoczy flair,” says Kurdirector Sylvie Thormann.
The guests would have taken it well.
In principle, you return to the beginnings of the Rakoczy Festival, when the festival's historical alone was the focus of the festival.
Pleasant atmosphere
Vesna Konhäuser has always been visiting Bad Kissingen for Rakoczy Festival with her husband for more than 25 years.
So this time in the corona year too.
The couple made themselves comfortable at Luitpold Casino, watching the historical ones while strolling and listening to live Cuban music at the casino restaurant.
“I also find it so pleasant,” says Konhäuser.
She doesn't miss the crowds who otherwise belong to Rakoczy.
However, it lacks the usual program highlights, especially Saale on Friday evening, as well as the historic pageant and closing fireworks on Sunday evening.
“That's a pity.
The weather would have been a great fit this year,” she says.
Rakoczy horse show to take place again
For the actors of historical spa guests, the alternative program sometimes meant more work.
For example, for Christina Gold, who is involved in the pageant in a normal year and can be seen there on the carriage of the spa garden café.
This year she was walking around town on Saturdays and Sundays in costume.
“It's more exhausting, otherwise it's easier for us,” she says.
The equestrian club had less work to do, even if individual riders were on the road in the park.
“We very much hope that the equestrian quadrille can take place again next year,” says Chairman Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that after several years of break in 2021, a rakoczy riding tournament will take place again.
28 corona cases in Spanish second division Fuenlabrada
Spanish football second division, CF Fuenlabrada, sliders ever deeper into the crisis due to a corona outbreak.
Since the newcomer from near Madrid flew into the city of A Coruña for a game on July 20th despite the first corona cases, one low blow has followed the next.
By Sunday, 28 players or team members had tested positive, one was hospitalized, as the club announced.
Fuenlabrada from the city of the same name southwest of Madrid still had the chance to reach the ascent playoffs.
Now there is even a threat of relegation into the Second League B-Group.
The match against Deportivo La Coruña last Monday was cancelled at the last moment, the prosecutor's office is investigating a possible public health offense, while the top sports authority CSD is considering the club's forced descent.
Players and other team members are quarantined in a hotel.
“They did not receive a fresh towel or gel until the sixth day of quarantine,” wrote the sports newspaper “AS”.
Photos show players hanging underwear and club clothes to dry in their rooms in the hotel after they apparently had to wash them themselves.
The bed linen had also not been changed for five days.
Another problem is food.
Neither is it good nor sufficient, wrote “AS”.
The club management, on the other hand, said they were satisfied with the hotel.
The club's lawyer, Javier Tebas Llanas, rejected the accusation of having deliberately endangered public health.
The corona rules established by the football federation were not violated, stressed the son of the president of the Spanish Primera Division, Javier Tebas, as the news agency Europa Press and the sports newspaper “Marca” reported.
Prior to departure, there were four infected people until July 19, but they were all isolated and did not travel along.
Just before the flight to A Coruña on Monday, all players and team members were retested.
When the team was already in A Coruña, the corona test was positive for “five or six” other team members.
The game was canceled 60 minutes before the kickoff, said Tebas Llanas.
Police must catch horses ripped out at steam compartment
Two animals were on the road.
The police led her back to her owner.
On Sunday morning just before 6 o'clock, a road user communicated two free-running horses on the feeder between the Donnersdorf/Steinsfeld junction and the Theres motorway junction.
When the officials arrived, the horses were already between the feeder and the village Steamcompartment again.
After the officers gained the trust of horses just before the steam compartment, they were able to turn a rope carried in a patrol car.
Cycle professional Tony Martin: career continuation imaginable
Time trial specialist Tony Martin is thinking about continuing his career.
Frankfurt/Main - Seven-time trial world champion Tony Martin can certainly imagine continuing his cycling career.
“I am currently setting out the framework conditions with the team, how and in what form it could continue,” said the 35-year-old to the “Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung”.
Martin is currently employed by the Dutch team Jumbo Visma and had considered ending his career after this year before the corona break.
Negotiations with his team are also about the number of race days, he said.
Or about other problems that would plague him as a family man, Martin said.
He used to get up after a fall, and the first thought was: “Get back on the bike quickly.
Today, as the father of a young daughter, I think: what if”.
The cyclist admitted that there are certainly aspects that he is becoming increasingly difficult to deal with.
“But it was good for me to remember what I have in cycling and how much fun I enjoy it based on the corona time”.
The time trial specialist is entering the competition again at the Tour de l'Ain (August 5 to 9).
Bavaria: At least four dead on Bavaria's streets this weekend
The beautiful weather attracts bikers to the streets in many places.
For at least three people, the bike tour ends fatally.
An 18-year-old pedestrian also dies.
Schönthal - Several, mostly young people died in accidents on Bavaria's roads over the weekend.
An 18-year-old motorcyclist was caught on Saturday by a car that went into the opposite lane near Schönthal (district of Cham).
It was unclear why the car was in the opposite lane at first.
In Upper Bavaria, a 22-year-old hit a horse-drawn carriage on his machine on Saturday.
According to the police, he went downhill at Beilngries.
He hit the carriage in a left-hand turn.
His injuries were so severe that he died at the scene of an accident.
Of the twelve inmates of the carriage, one man was severely injured and a man slightly injured, as the police reported.
In another fatal accident, an 18-year-old died in Bad Kötzting, Upper Palatinate.
He had laid down on a road the night of Sunday and was run over by a 42-year-old car driver.
According to police suspicion, the 18-year-old wanted to sleep.
The motorist could no longer brake in time.
At Schönberg (Freyung-Grafenau district), a 57-year-old biker hit a car head-on on Saturday in a right-hand turn despite emergency braking.
He died at the scene of an accident.
The 57-year-old driver suffered a shock, while the remaining three people in the car remained unharmed.
The safety of motorcyclists was discussed on Saturday by Bavaria's Transport Minister Kerstin Schreyer (CSU).
In a letter to the organizer of the biker protests against driving bans announced for August, Gabor Kovacs, the minister referred to extensive investments such as underrun protection on guardrails and defusing dangerous curves.
“We have achieved a lot for the safety of motorcyclists in recent years,” the letter said.
“The number of motorized two-cyclists killed decreased by around 28 percent compared to 2011.”
Kovac tests against Frankfurt with Monaco
Frankfurt/Main (dpa) - Football coach Niko Kovac will soon have a reunion with Eintracht Frankfurt with his new club AS Monaco.
The eight-time French champion will be a guest at the Hesse, the former Croatian club on August 1 (6 pm).
For the Bundesliga player, it is the first and only endurance test before the return match in the Europa League against FC Basel (August 6).
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the encounter will be held without viewers.
“We're particularly looking forward to this game.
It's always nice to come to Frankfurt and meet friends,” explained Kovac.
This is an interesting test in terms of sports, said the 48-year-old.
Before moving to FC Bayern Munich, Kovac trained the Hesse from 2016 to 2018 and led to victory in the DFB Cup.
“A top-class opponent like Monaco is a good test for us to play against Basel.
Like all Frankfurters, I look forward to seeing Niko Kovac again,” said Eintracht coach Adi Hütter.
The 50-year-old Austrian succeeded the Croatian at Eintracht.
In March, the Frankfurters lost the round of 16 against Basel in their own stadium at 0:3.
Almost 50 new infections: Landkreis Hof just past lockdown
In the district of Hof, the number of known corona new infections increased further over the weekend: from 39 on Friday and 43 on Saturday (one person recovered and no longer falls into this statistic) to 47 on Sunday.
In addition, there is a case in the city of Hof.
As a result, the Hof space is approaching the critical mark of 50 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants in one week.
700 dead due to monsoon rain in Southeast Asia
More than 9 million people are affected by the severe floods in Southeast Asia, particularly in Bangladesh, India and Nepal.
A total of 700 people lost their lives due to the heavy monsoon rain.
In Bangladesh, the Red Crescent strives to reach isolated people in boats.
Entire villages are under water.
The farmers have lost their crops.
Panzeros in National Park die from landslides
In Kaziranga National Park, several of the 120 tank rhinos died due to landslides.
They are under protection and are considered endangered from extinction.
The floods are particularly bad this year, which scientists attribute to climate change.
According to the United Nations, Bangladesh is one of the most hit by global warming.
New apartments are vacant
In the village of Cox's Bazaar in southern Bangladesh, the state has built housing for 650 people displaced by the floods.
Only a few have moved in so far.
It's hard to get people to Cox's bazaar.
The enthusiasm is also kept in Grenezn.
Anyone who used to have a house was so small and resembled a cabin, often does not want to spend their lives in a large block of flats.
Many dwellings are vacant, but - as the government wants it - are to be moved into soon by those who lost their home due to the floods.
60 new corona infections in just one day in Vienna
In a 24-hour comparison, 60 new corona infections were reported in Vienna - there were 22 new infections in Lower Austria.

105 people died in connection with lung disease.
Argentina rejects creditor counteroffer
The new demands could not be met, announced by the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Buenos Aires on Saturday.
“This would not only be irresponsible, but also unfair,” a statement said.
“While 50 percent of children in Argentina live in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors.”
The debt of the second largest economy in South America is no longer sustainable under current conditions.
This is why Argentina is asking its private creditors to waive part of their claims of around 66 billion US dollars (around 59 billion euros).
If there is no agreement, the country is threatened with state bankruptcy again.
It would be the ninth payment default in Argentine history.
Lenders recently demanded higher interest rates on government bonds and changes to some contractual clauses.
However, the Argentine government is sticking to its latest offer and is not ready to make any further concessions.
Argentina is in a serious financial and economic crisis.
The inflation rate was more than 50 percent recently.
Experts expect economic strength to fall by around ten percent for the current year.
At the end of May, Argentina did not settle interest receivables of $503 million and therefore slipped into a limited payment default.
Arrived professionally - not private yet
“It's going great” - Dr. Stefanie Kramer draws this conclusion after her first days at the notary's office in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything went very fast: in mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she will succeed Lutz Feller at the Notary Office in Eggenfelden.
Just six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the lawyer with a doctorate started working, and normal day-to-day business has long been in full swing.
“However, I still have to arrive privately,” she explains in conversation with the Rottaler Anzeiger and laughs.
The short lead time was, of course, not enough to move the center of life from Regensburg to Eggenfelden completely, reports the native Dingolfingerin.
She is currently looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city with her husband, who works as a judge at the district court in Regensburg.
At least her husband was able to apply for parental leave on short notice in order to provide care for the two daughters (3½ and 1½ years old).
In order not to have to commute from Regensburg every day, she also has an overnight accommodation with her parents in Dingolfing for the time being, explains the 39-year-old.
Growing up in the neighbouring district, the city of Eggenfelden has of course long been familiar to her.
During local visits with her family in recent months, she found out again: “Eggenfelden is a really beautiful small town”.
She was all the more pleased that she made the race in the vacancy selection process.
Her homeland of Lower Bavaria also plays a central role in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's career: After studying law in Passau, she completed her legal clerkship period and the 2nd state examination in Regensburg.
After several positions as a notary assessor, among others, in Rehau and Hof in Upper Franconia, Babenhausen in the Unterallgäu and Regensburg - she also took her first position as a notary in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau in 2012.
In 2016, she went on parental leave, followed by the move to Regensburg.
Since then, she has taken over representative services in various notarial offices.
When the position in Eggenfelden was advertised due to Lutz Feller's approaching retirement, she saw the right time for full career re-entry, explains the 39-year-old.
The team of her predecessor, who will take over vacation representation in the notarial office in the future, has completely taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer - and has a praise for the firm's team right away: “It's going great!”
The fact that she can rely on well-established processes here makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming relocation of the private place of life.
In terms of kindergarten or nativity squares, she has already contacted a local institution.
And everything works out as desired, she hopes to pursue her hobby here soon - and get to know the most beautiful jogging tracks in the Rottal.
BVB plans to launch league with a maximum of 15,000 viewers
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be 20 percent full at the start of the season in the event of a fan return.
“Due to the distance regulation, which is mandatory to comply, we are currently planning with 12,000 to 15,000 viewers,” Borussia Dortmund's managing director Carsten Cramer told “Tagesspiegel”.
Normally, the arena in the district city captures just over 81,000 spectators in Bundesliga games.
In last season's ghost games caused by the corona pandemic, BVB lost around four million euros per game.
Cramer responsible for marketing, digitization and internationalization at BVB hopes that in addition to normal spectators, some of the approximately 4000 places in the hospitality area can also be opened again: “It is of course a blow to the office if these revenues break away completely”.
In view of the ongoing corona crisis, everyone is currently “well advised to take a stable page length first”.
“If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people are on short-time working in Germany alone, then the need for entertainment is limited,” explained Cramer.
The head of marketing from Dortmund praised the BVB professionals for their salary partial waiver, which is meant to help overcome the crisis: “Of course, players know that their salary waiver has a different effect than when we put 100 people working in merchandising on short-time work.”
Tiny miracles: early start to life with a few hundred grams
Hardly heavier than a packerl butter, just three tablespoons of blood throughout his body: that was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The boy is one of around 400 premature babies taken care of at the Graz Children's Clinic every year.
A quarter of them weigh less than 1,500 grams, a few - like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael - are extreme lightweight weights with less than one kilogram of birth weight.
They are so small and born so early that neither lungs, intestines, nor muscles are fully formed.
Their skin is sometimes so delicate that they could hurt the electrodes of an ECG.
And they're so tiny they sometimes wear doll clothes and mini diapers specially made for them.
But not so small that they wouldn't be in voice - “and how,” Berndt Urlesberger smiles.
“Even though they don't scream as loud as big babies, of course.”
When the whiteboard becomes the stage
Despite corona theatre in the classroom: The whiteboard as a stage experienced the 9th grades of St. James high school in Abtsgmünd just before the start of the holiday.
Actress Julia Sylvester from the Theater der Stadt Aalen presented the pupils the production “Das Heimatdress” - by video.
The students were then able to exchange ideas about the play and performance with actress and director Winfried Tobias via Skype.
The idea for the performance format was born from the current corona situation.
Teresa Nar was pleased with the enrichment of teaching.
Even though everyone involved agreed at the end that direct encounters in theatre and stage rooms would offer additional stimuli, the theatre also sees the potential for contact with schools.
“If we further improve the technical framework, it could be an interesting addition to gaming operations,” said director Winfried Tobias.
First round drawn: TSV 1860 would meet Eintracht Frankfurt in the DFB Cup
Should the TSV qualify for the DFB Cup in 1860, the lions will meet Eintracht Frankfurt in the first round.
This was the draw on Sunday.
Munich - Sixty possible opponents in the first round of the DFB Cup is determined.
The lions would meet Eintracht Frankfurt in a successful qualification.
This was the result of the draw on Sunday evening in the ARD sports show.
Because of the corona pandemic, the field of participants is not yet complete, wildcards were used in the draw.
Due to the voluntary abandonment of semi-final opponents FC Memmingen, TSV 1860 is already in the final of the Bavarian Toto Cup (September 4 or 5).
There, the lions meet either the Würzburg kickers or Victoria Aschaffenburg.
Should second league newcomer Würzburg reach the final, sixty would already be firmly qualified for the first round in the DFB Cup.
Otherwise, the Giesinger would have to prevail against regional player Aschaffenburg in the final game.
The first round of the DFB Cup will be held between September 11 and 14 and thus one week before the third league start.
“Gone by the Wind”: film legend Olivia de Havilland is dead
Film legend and oscar winner Olivia de Havilland is dead.
She died of natural death in Paris on Sunday at the age of 104, confirmed her spokeswoman for the German Press Agency.
De Havilland was known for her role as Melanie Hamilton in the southern epic “Gone by the Wind” (1939).
Born in Tokyo as a child of British parents, Olivia de Havilland moved to California as a toddler.
Austrian theatre man Max Reinhardt discovered the 19-year-old in the role of Hermia by Shakespeare's “Midsummer Night's Dream”.
The film studio Warner Brothers signed her for seven years and brought them out big alongside Eroll Flynn.
She made eight films with the heartbreaker.
In 1946 she won her first Oscar starring “To Each His Own”.
The film was screened in Germany under the title “Mutterherz”.
Three years later, the award as best actress came in William Wyler's “The Heiress”.
She also received a lot of recognition as a neurotic eccentric in “Der Dark Spiegel” and “Die Schlangengrube”.
Daphne du Maurier suggested her in 1952 for the leading role in the film adaptation of her novel “My Cousin Rachel”.
The play was a worldwide success.
She played lullaby for a corpse with her long-time friend Bette Davis.
The marriage with writer Marcus Goodrich (1946 to 1953) resulted in son Benjamin.
In Paris, de Havilland married journalist Pierre Paul Galante and had daughter Gisèle with him.
This marriage also broke up.
Rumors of an affair with former British Prime Minister Edward Heath have never been confirmed.
“Road to Timmendorf”: Beach volleyball: Thole/Winders miss finals on comeback
World Cup second Julius Thole and Clemens Wickler missed the final at the beach volleyball tournament “Road to Timmendorf”.
At the meeting of the top teams in Düsseldorf, they submitted 1:2 to their national team colleagues Nils Ehlers and Lars Flüggen in the semifinals (17:21, 21:17, 19:21).
Thole/Winders had most recently played at the World Tour Final in Rome in September of last year.
In the final game on the Rhine, her conquerors Ehlers/Flüggen defeated the surprise team Lukas Pfretschner and his interim partner Steven van de Velde with 0:2 (17:21, 17:21).
In addition to the show tournament, three starting places for the German championships were played in Timmendorfer Strand at the beginning of September: Armin Dollinger/Simon Kulzer, Manuel Harms/Richard Peemüller and Simon Pfretschner/Milan Sievers secured the tickets.
Kalbitz ejection from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of “fig leaf”
From the FDP's perspective, the exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is just a “fig leaf” and does not change the character of the party.
“The AfD is the parliamentary arm of right-wing extremists in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the tip of the Radical iceberg in the AfD,” said FDP interior politician Benjamin Strasser to the news agency dpa in Berlin.
The Federal Arbitration Tribunal of the AfD confirmed the exclusion of Kalbitz on Saturday in Stuttgart after several hours of hearing, which was decided by the majority of the Federal Executive Board in May.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD Group in the Brandenburg State Parliament.
“If the AfD was really about consistently removing right-wing extremists from their party, officials like Björn Höcke and his followers would have long been excluded,” said Strasser.
“However, there is no political will in the AfD because right-wing extremism is now part of the party”.
CSU Secretary General Markus Blume said similarly: “The fact that Andreas Kalbitz now remains excluded says nothing and does not change anything,” he told the “World on Sunday”.
“Rather, it speaks volumes of how many frenetic supporters a right-wing extremist still has in the middle of the AfD”.
Blume expects the AfD to land below five percent again in elections in the future.
“The days of the AfD in parliaments are numbered”.
Kalbitz was one of the spokesmen of the officially dissolved “wing” around Thuringian AfD state and group chairman Björn Höcke; constitutional protection classifies stroening as “secured right-wing extremist aspiration.”
In May, the AfD Federal Executive Board kicked Kalbitz out of the party.
As a reason he stated, Kalbitz did not specify earlier membership in the now banned far-right “home office German Youth” (HDJ) and the Republicans when he joined the party.
Kalbitz denies membership of HDJ.
The chairman of the left-wing parliamentary group in the Brandenburg State Parliament, Sebastian Walter, also stressed that the decision of the Federal Arbitration Tribunal did not change the character of the AfD: “The wolf only ate chalk.
The AfD remains a far-right party, whether with or without calbitz”.
This decision neither weakens the federal party nor does the right wing be weakened.
“The maneuver of the Meuthen troupe is transparent.
You want to avoid further observation by constitutional protection and try to get through under the radar,” said Walter.
“The AfD is not getting rid of the ghosts it called.
Ejection doesn't change anything yet,” commented Brandenburg SPD general secretary Erik Stohn about the decision in the Kalbitz case.
“Here, the AfD National Association and the faction remained their right-wing leader to this day”.
The legal dispute over Kalbitz's membership in the AfD will continue.
He announced on Saturday that he would now take civil law against the decision of the Federal Arbitration Tribunal.
North Sea wind farms deliver a good 21 percent more electricity
Wind power plants on the German North Sea fed 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity into the grid in the first six months of the year.
This is a good 21 percent more than in the same period last year, said network operator Tennet in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for transferring North Sea electricity to the mainland and forwarding it through the German power grid.
Wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of Tennet's grid area, have fed another 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
Overall, wind power from the North and Baltic Seas comes to 13.73 TWh, compared with a good 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind harvest at sea thus accounts for almost 19 percent of the total wind flow in Germany; that's about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms provide higher generation capacities
In addition to wind conditions, the increased contribution of offshore wind energy results from higher generation capacities because new wind farms have been connected to the grid in the past twelve months.
If the 1270 wind power plants in the North Sea were all running at full power at the same time, they could generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity by calculation.
The transmission capacity is sufficient; according to Tennet, it is 7.1 gigawatts.
It is expected to rise to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea by 2030.
“In Germany and the Netherlands, we are investing 20 billion euros in expanding offshore grid connections by then,” said Tennet Managing Director Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, wind farms cannot exploit their capacity even at sea, but reach around 40 percent.
The record day so far this year is January 2, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, North Sea wind turbines produce around 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, which is equivalent to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could supply almost seven million households with electricity.
Art “Skirmish” - an exhibition by Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the Gmünder Kunstverein.
This was almost a small anniversary celebration for the 130.
Birthday of the Gmünder Kunstverein: The exhibition opening “Skirmish” with works by Leipzig artist Christian Bold blew up the usual framework after the corona break.
Much more art lovers than usual followed the dialogue between the artist and the chairman of the Kunstverein, Professor Dr. Klaus Ripper.
The band “Defenders of the Universe” delivered the musical equivalent on southern Kornhaus Square.
The association “Sandtogether” was engaged north of the gallery.
Freital: Windbergfest cancelled due to corona
The Windberg Festival is not taking place this year.
The city of Freital cancelled the three-day festival scheduled in September.
In other years, over 30,000 people had visited this city festival.
“We really did not make this decision easy for ourselves and - aware of how difficult it is economically for the participants - hoped until the last minute,” said Lord Mayor Uwe Rumberg (unparty).
“But ultimately, as organizers, we are responsible for the health of many thousands of people here.”
Because if tens of thousands had flowed to the festival grounds and into the marquee, minimum distances, hygiene regulations and contact tracking in accordance with the current corona protection regulation could not have been observed.
Or the restrictions would have been so strong that there wouldn't be much left of a folk festival.
In addition, the organizational and monitoring effort would increase disproportionately many times over.
Rumberg put off to next year.
The city of Freital will then celebrate its 100th anniversary with, among other things, the Winter Mountain Festival from May 7 to 9, 2021 and Saxony Day from September 10 to 12, 2021.
dressage Olympic champion Werth in Achleiten not to beat
Achleiten - Six-time Olympic champion Isabell Werth was the outstanding rider at the dressage tournament in Achleiten, Austria.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg came to four wins this weekend at four starts.
After she won a Grand Prix each with Weihegold and Quantaz to prelude, she was not beaten in the Grand Prix Special and Freestyle on Sunday either.
On Sunday, Werth clearly prevailed against Austrian Victoria Max-Theurer on Abegglen on the 15-year-old mare Weihegold.
In the freestyle, too, the German on Quantaz was clearly ahead of her 34-year-old student Victoria Max-Theurer on Saturday.
Werth's winning horse Quantaz belongs to Max Theurer.
The most successful dressage rider in the world is to establish the ten-year-old stallion in the Grand Prix.
For Quantaz, it was the first freestyle ever.
Werth had already won all important four tests at the first tournament in Achleiten three weeks ago.
The last of the three international tournaments is scheduled there for August 14 to 16.
More air traffic controllers in Worms
The Worms University continues to go into the air: The “DFS German Air Traffic Control” donates a professorship for “Air Traffic Management”.
A corresponding contract between the university and DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially concluded for three years and starts in 2021.
With the professorship, it is possible to start studies not only in the summer semester, but also in the winter semester.
This allows you to train twice as many students as before.
At the same time, capacities are utilized evenly both at the university and at the DFS Air Traffic Traffic Traffic Academy.
DFS will advise the university on setting up and filling the professorship.
Represented at the university since 2019
Since the summer semester 2019, the first students have been in Air Traffic Management as part of their training as air traffic controller at Worms University of Applied Sciences.
Nine students have already started this year.
So far, the experience of DFS has been very positive, and the students' achievements are outstanding.
The combination of studies and pilot training significantly contributes to further increasing the attractiveness of the pilot profession.
“In these times, funding is not easy for us economically.
However, we are firmly expecting air traffic to recover and grow again in the long term.
To continue fulfilling our legal mandate in the future, we need highly qualified personnel,” says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, CEO of DFS when signing the contract.
“For DFS, the endowed professorship is a future-proof investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, cross-disciplinary knowledge base in the long term.
We are therefore continuing our good cooperation with the university and at the same time underpin our attractiveness as an employer”.
Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of Worms University of Applied Sciences, also underlines this: “The endowed professorship forms an important bridge between science and industry.
With it, we would like to build on the already existing cooperation with DFS German Air Traffic Control as a practical partner for the dual bachelor's program Air Traffic Management”.
The trust of German air traffic control is both the motivation and obligation for the University of Worms to further expand its teaching and research expertise in the future fields of aviation.
In action for tomorrow's air traffic controllers, the university was able to set very special highlights and innovative focal points for its students with its first endowed professorship for a dual degree program.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary in the Ministry of Science, Continuing Education and Culture, emphasizes: “With its focus on air transport, Worms University has a unique selling point in Rhineland-Palatinate.
The signing of the cooperation agreement today strengthens the university's profile”.
Lifehoof wrench lands on the A45
The A45 motorway was fully closed on Saturday noon towards Aschaffenburg for around 30 minutes, as the rescue helicopter was in use after a traffic accident.
A 76-year-old drove straight ahead in the turn with a Ford at around 12.40 at the Alzenau-Mitte exit and landed at the guardrail.
The impact triggered the front airbags, the driver suffered minor injuries to his face and had to be taken to a hospital for treatment.
The 72-year-old passenger's injuries were taken care of by an ambulance doctor and the patient was then flown to a hospital by rescue helicopter.
However, the police currently assume that there is no danger of life.
The damaged vehicle, which caused damage of around 2000 euros, had to be towed away.
Heil wants to check other industries after meat industry
The corona crisis brought conditions to light again in parts of the meat industry.
Law tightening is imminent.
But are they right - and will it stick with it?
Federal Labor Minister Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to review other industries according to the strict regulations now planned against maladministration in the meat industry.
“We will look at industry by industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective industry when necessary,” said Heil to the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany's employers are already warning against restricting work contracts in general.
After the massive corona outbreak at meat giant Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet intends to adopt a law of salvation this Wednesday.
Large slaughterhouses should no longer be allowed to use external personnel during slaughter, cutting and meat processing.
For this purpose, the use of work contracts and temporary workers there is to be banned.
Employer President Ingo Kramer told dpa: “Stay away from a general restriction on work contracts and temporary workers if you don't want to completely stall the economy”.
For example, work contracts are the basis for their added value at the customer for large areas of trade, construction and plant engineering.
“The misconduct of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument.”
Heil assured: “My goal is not to ban work contracts everywhere in the German economy”.
Work contracts make sense.
“When an industrial company commissions a craftsman to install a safety system, it is a normal work contract”.
The German meat industry considers a ban on work contracts and temporary work unconstitutional in its industry alone.
It cannot be explained why, in the future, labor law should apply different from sausage when portioning and packaging cheese, as reported by the “Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung” (Saturday).
Consumer prices would therefore rise by 10 to 20 percent per kilo and product in the event of a ban.
According to the results of an audit by the NRW Occupational Health and Safety Administration, often Eastern European employees from contracting companies worked in the industry 16 hours a day.
They often didn't have a break.
Wages were retained for protective equipment or rent.
It was also found that the situation with employee accommodation was often miserable.
Heil said that a relatively sharp law came into force for the meat industry as early as 2017.
However, these were bypassed by “tricky constructions”.
“Now it needs to be fundamentally cleaned up.”
The politician announced: “In the Occupational Health and Safety Act, which we intend to adopt in the cabinet at the end of July, also includes measures that not only affect the meat industry - for example, higher test rates for occupational health and safety or clear criteria for community accommodation”.
The draft presented to dpa includes amendments to the Act on the Safeguarding of Workers' Rights in the Meat Industry and the Occupational Health and Safety Act.
Brandenburg's Consumer Protection Minister Ursula Nonnemacher (Green) considers more intensive controls necessary.
“I would like to be able to do even more controls in many supervisory areas: food controls, animal welfare, everything possible, for example animal transport,” said Nonnemacher on Sunday in the RBB program “Brandenburg Aktuell”.
However, more personnel offices are also required for more controls.
Three dead in case of ultralight plane crash in Germany
According to the police, three people died in the crash of an ultralight aircraft on an apartment building in Wesel in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia.
A child was slightly injured.
Two more people were saved injured in the accident, said a spokesman for the district control center Wesel.
A parachute was found at the scene of the accident, according to the police.
The “Rheinische Post” reported, citing eyewitnesses, that the plane collided with a hot air balloon before the crash.
The house is a single or two-family house.
Further details were not known at first.
The eviction of Frankfurt Opera Square is peacefully
A week after the riots in Frankfurt, the clearing of the opera square was also peaceful during the night on Sunday.
At last, a few dozen people were still on the square, but left him before the curfew began at 1 o'clock.
The police have been on duty with numerous officers since the early evening, and a larger number of police was seen throughout the city.
The first time this weekend was banned from midnight on entry to the Opera Square, where riots occurred a week ago.
Police officers had been attacked with bottles out of the crowd of celebrationers.
At least five officers were injured after police entries, and several police vehicles were damaged.
Saturday night had also remained calm.
Car turns over: Young woman seriously injured in accident on federal road 83 near Hofgeismar
In an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme, a 21-year-old suffered serious injuries around 1:25pm on Sunday.
She was taken to Kassel Hospital.
With thermal imaging cameras, the fire brigade was looking for possible passengers.
According to the police, the woman was on federal road 83 towards her place of residence Hümme when her car left the road for previously unexplained cause and rolled over several times.
In order to save the accident, the fire department had to clear the roof of the car.
As it was unclear whether anyone was still in the vehicle, the adjacent corn field was searched from the rotary ladder using a thermal imaging camera.
The drone squadron from Warburg, which also works with thermal imaging cameras, was also ordered for people search.
However, the emergency workers did not find anyone among the tall corn plants.
The severely injured was taken by ambulance to the Kassel hospital for further care.
Almost 50 emergency personnel from the Hofgeismar, Hümme and Schöneberg fire brigade were on site.
The federal road was closed for two hours due to the accident.
Juventus Turin champion in Italy
Turin - After a redeeming goal by Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in series production.
The team around the five-time world footballer made the 36th scudetto in the club history perfect with a 2-0 (1:0) on Sunday evening in the home match against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo hit 1:0 before half.
With 83 points, Turin, who competed without the last long-injured ex-national player Sami Khedira, is no longer out of place one two matchdays before the end of Serie A season.
The table width of Inter Milan is seven points behind.
Juventus was harmless in the first half despite optical superiority, then Ronaldo hit with the last action after a free-kick variant.
The 35-year-old explored a feat by Miralem Pjanic directly with a flat shot (45.+7) from the penalty area boundary.
Ronaldo also participated in 2-0 against the more offensive guests, after his shot, Federico Bernardeschi (67th) dusted off.
This ensured lacklashless but decisive success.
The foule elf shot shot at the 89th minute should only have properly angled Ronaldo himself with a view to the goalkeeper classification.
“It's complicated to stay at ball level mentally and physically for 90 minutes.
The games are weird, and momentum changes very slightly,” explained coach Maurizio Sarri after 1:2 at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
The mental exhaustion of his players is particularly great, said the Juve Coach.
Because of the defeat, the Turinians had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
Juve recently owed this calming lead at the top of the table, to the weakness of competitors.
Because in the eleven games before Sunday's match, the Sarri team had only succeeded in five victories.
Whether Ronaldo will also be top scorer is doubtful.
Because while the Portuguese superstar has scored 31 goals so far, the former Dortmund Ciro Immobile has already had 34 hits in his account after his triple pack at the 5:1 (1:1) of the standings Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to FC Bayern's title win.
The current Juve professional Gonzalo Higuaín holds the record in Italy.
The Argentine scored 36 goals for the SSC Naples in the 2015/2016 season.
In August, the “old lady” of Italian football is waiting for the next title opportunity.
Juventus is in the round of 16 of the Champions League, but has to make up for a 0:1 first leg bust against Olympique Lyon on August 7th to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
Real Madrid or Manchester City would wait as an opponent in the next knockout round.
Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal car races recorded
Stuttgart - Despite all threatened penalties and court rulings, drivers continue to accelerate in countless illegal races on Baden-Württemberg roads: The police in the southwest have already registered more than 250 illegal car races last year and the first four months of this year.
There are no benchmarks for the years before, but the speeders are making judicial authorities increasingly work: Public prosecution offices between Konstanz and Mannheim conducted a total of 155 investigations for illegal races in 2018, with 252 years later, and 151 in the current year until the beginning of June.
The races were less about organized events, as evidenced by the Ministry of the Interior to a request from the Landtag SPD.
In most cases, the drivers spontaneously competed against each other or they would have escaped from the police - this is also reported as an illegal race.
German men between the ages of 18 and 60 were mainly behind the wheel.
113 fines - imprisonment 15 times
Only in comparatively few cases are the speeders caught and also asked to cash register: According to the Ministry of the Interior, a total of 113 fines have been imposed and 15 imprisonment sentences have been issued since 2018.
But there is no evidence that the number of illegal car races is actually increasing.
Rather, other drivers were more sensitive than before because of the many tragic accidents and processes of past years and showed more frequently, said a department spokesperson.
Highway 8 is particularly popular with racers, motorists keep slowing down traffic there in order to make room for themselves and use the free track for a race.
Last August, a dozen drivers were caught near Kirchheim unter Teck, and three months earlier, there were even 18 drivers on the A8 at Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular “racetrack”
The police even register more races on the A81 than on any other federal highway.
A speed limit tries to slow down the speeders on the particularly affected section between Engen and Geisingen.
The mostly high-priced and upbeat sports and luxury cars often have Swiss license plates because drivers are moving to Germany for the lawn due to the high penalties for driving too fast and car racing in the neighbouring country.
For the SPD, the speed limit cannot be reduced to a few distances: “With a general speed limit of 130 kilometers per hour, we would get rid of this problem on motorways,” says Martin Rivoir, the transport expert of the SPD state parliament group.
“The inhibition threshold for speeders would be significantly higher if you were not allowed to travel legally here and there at 200 kilometers per hour or more”.
Rivoir thinks less of enlightenment or image campaigns: “Anyone who puts themselves beyond all rules in this way and not only puts their own lives at stake, but also the lives of other road users, is hardly accessible with reason”.
ADAC calls for stronger police crackdown
That's not enough for ADAC, on the other hand: “We assume that speed limits will not be deterred by speed limits,” says Holger Bach, Head of Transport and Environment at ADAC Württemberg.
It calls for additional and tougher controls on the affected routes.
The high-speed test of strength often becomes painful and momentous serious: Since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people died in the races nationwide, two of them non-participants in a nightly crash in Stuttgart's city centre and one in Gerlingen.
Two young men are said to have delivered a car race there in November.
One of the vehicles came off the road, bounced against a garden wall and remained on its side, and the 18-year-old passenger died.
21 more people have been injured in the races of the past two years.
However, tougher penalties are not necessary, according to Interior Minister Thomas Strobl: “Legislative need for action to sanction illegal motor vehicle races harder is not seen,” says the Ministry of Interior Paper.
Blue light from July 23: Thirsty Burglar Steals Drinks from Snack
Rohrdorf: A man broke into a snack in Rohrdorf (district of Calw) on Thursday and stole drinks and cash.
A witness heard sounds in the valley road at around 3.40 and ran towards the snack.
There he noticed a man serving drinks at the fridge and then leaving the snack through a previously smashed front door.
The perpetrator fled towards the meadows behind the snack.
According to the police, the burglar also served at a cash register and stole cash in the low three-digit range.
The suspect is described as follows: he is about 1.75 to 1.80 metres tall and of strong stature.
In fact, he was wearing a black hoodie, black pants and bright shoes.
The police are taking further testimony.
Ackermann sprints to victory on final stage at Sibiu Tour
Professional cyclists Pascal Ackermann won his second victory on the final stage of the 10th Sibiu Tour.
Team Bora-Hansgrohe's 26-year-old Palatinate prevailed mass sprint on the 109-kilometre-long section with start and finish in Sibiu after he had already won a stage on Saturday.
It was season wins three and four for Ackermann.
His Austrian team mate Gregor Mühlberger prevailed in the overall standings.
The 26-year-old confidently decided on the mountain time trial in the morning and thus took the top of the classification.
Only 104 drivers left for the final stage in the evening.
No less than 18 starters had fallen victim to the time limit in the mountain time trial.
“I'm really happy to start the season's restart with a win,” Ackermann said after his success on Saturday.
“The sprint was really hectic,” said the 26-year-old.
He simply put on his sprint 300 meters before the finish line, “and it worked perfectly too”.
According to the rules of the World Association UCI, a corona test was carried out on all race participants and their companions six days before the start of the race.
During the entire tour, drivers and supervisors were separated from the organization team as well as from the media in isolated hygiene blasses.
Spectators at start and finish were not allowed.
Control center gave instructions for lay resuscitation
Düsseldorf - Tragic accident on Sunday noon in Dusseldorf-Garath.
In an apartment building, a child (4) was suddenly lifeless in the water while bathing.
According to the fire department, the emergency call was received just before 1 pm.
“A control center dispatcher immediately gave instructions on lay resuscitation,” a fire defender told BILD.
The arriving rescue workers took over the resuscitation measures a little later.
The child in danger of death was transported to the university hospital under resuscitation.
It is unclear why it crashed.
The police routinely started investigations into the event of an accident.
The firefighter: “We expect a tragic accident in the apartment”.
Nuremberg: Unapproved Tuning Meeting - Police intervene, 700 vehicles and around 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and temporarily over 1000 people took part in a “tuning meeting” in the parking lot of a furniture store on Saturday night.
The police made their announcement that they would more control such events.
There was a big tuning meeting on Saturday evening (July 25, 2020) in Nuremberg Südstadt.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the Middle Franconia police, the Nuremberg traffic police found an increased vehicle volume in the area of a large parking lot on Ingolstädter Straße at around 10.30 pm.
The police then carried out a variety of vehicle checks there.
The police only recently announced that they intend to take more action against so-called autoposers.
Illegal tuning meeting in Nuremberg: only a small part of the “scene”
The officials ranked over 700 vehicles and about 1100 people, the police reports.
However, only a small proportion of those present can be attributed to the “autoposer” and tuning scene.
It appears that the majority of the relevant scene was following the police appeal.
On the basis of the vehicles and people on site, it can be assumed that these were mostly onlookers.
In addition, the majority of those present complied with the applicable infection protection regulations, in particular observing the minimum distance and wearing a mouth/nose guard.
The control measures carried out on site ended around 1:00 a.m.
In total, officials found structural changes in 10 vehicles in such a way that the operating permit had gone out.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No car races
There were no illegal car races.
“The Middle Franconia police headquarters will continue to keep an eye on what is happening and continues to carry out increased control measures, also in connection with the emergence of spectators,” it said.
The agency News5 spoke to Jürgen Schrödinger from the involved towing company: “They all have beautiful rims, we can't scratch them,” says Schrödinger.
Special tapes would be used for this.
Also because the cars are wider, the company must be careful not to make damage.
“After all, young people should get their cars back unscathed”.
Employment Agency figures: 900 suspected cases of abuse during short-time work
Berlin - According to its own statements, the Federal Employment Agency (BA) is investigating around 900 suspected cases of abuse of short-time working allowance.
“This is extremely little for more than 880,000 companies that reported short-time working,” said the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Managing Board, responsible for the operational business, Daniel Terzenbach.
When a lot of companies suddenly applied for short-time work at the beginning of the corona crisis, the BA had to react quickly.
The exam usually lasts up to three weeks.
“We didn't have that much time in this hot phase.
We will take a closer look at the final statements all the more closely.
I'm sure there will be a lot more to do.
We are not naive there and have a long breath”.
Indications of abuse often come from affected employees or trade unions.
BA also uses analysis software to detect abuse patterns.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is preparing for a possible wave of insolvency in autumn.
“Will there be significantly more bankruptcy than in the previous year?
The assessments diverge, but we are already training our employees in employment agencies to process applications for insolvency money”.
The numbers are still unobtrusive, said Terzenbach.
World Heritage in Potsdam: party dissolved in the New Garden
Potsdam - On Friday evening, about 40 teenagers celebrated a party in the Neue Garten.
The collection was dissolved by the precinct drivers of the Prussian Castles and Gardens Foundation (SPSG) at 8.48 pm, the foundation informed on PNN request.
The young people would have left the park as a result.
On Saturday evening, some young people would have played rugby in the Neue Garten.
The meadow was cleared by precinct drivers, said SPSG spokesman Frank Kallensee on Sunday.
There are always illegal celebrations in the parks
There are always accumulations in the Foundation's parks that do not comply with the spacing and hygiene rules Covid-19 handling ordinance.
At the end of June, there was a celebration with about 300 people in Babelsberg Park, and a week later about 150 people celebrated in the Neue Garten.
Even without a corona regulation, the parks will be closed at nightfall.
Storage in the meadows is prohibited according to the parking regulations, there are only a few exceptions.
The foundation has been complaining for a long time that visitors would leave more and more waste and destroy protected biotopes.
In Berlin, illegal park parties have meanwhile reached a different dimension.
In the Hasenheide in the district of Neukölln, 5000 people celebrated an illegal techno party on Sunday night.
The event was dissolved by the police.
Austria: mass tests after corona outbreak in tourist resort
Authorities have reacted to a corona outbreak in the popular Upper Austrian tourist town of St. Wolfgang with hundreds of tests.
The number of confirmed cases rose to 48, as reported by the state authorities in Linz.
More than 100 results were still pending in the evening.
As a result, many of the infected are young interns in tourism companies, but at least one holiday guest has also been tested positive.
Residents, guests and tourism staff were asked to stay in their accommodations on Saturday evening.
The curfew was set at 11 pm.
“There are cancellations and cancellations there and there”, said the head of the tourism association Wolfgangsee, Hans Wieser, dpa.
In some cases, guests also left early.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist resort in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 overnight stays last year.
In a normal season, around one-third of guests are German.
The first infections had become public on Friday.
The head of the district authority, Alois Lanz, defended the behavior of interns on Saturday, who had celebrated in several venues and could have become infected there.
“We all liked to do that in our youth,” he told radio station OE1.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The tourism association launched an information campaign to raise awareness of the dangers of Covid-19 for young employees.
From Saturday, hundreds of employees, holidaymakers and locals were tested.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang from July 15 were contacted.
The outbreak brings memories of the Austrian ski and party resort Ischgl in Tyrol, which was a center of corona spread throughout Europe in the early stages of the pandemic.
In Austria, more than 1500 people are currently infected with the virus.

Premier League: Man United and Chelsea Qualified for Champions League
London (dpa) - English football record champion Manchester United returns to the Champions League after a year of absence.
The Red Devils secured third place on the final matchday of the Premier League with a 2-0 (0:0) success against direct competitor Leicester City.
The foxes now have to settle for the Europa League because Chelsea FC was still passing by and also qualified in fourth for the premier class.
Aston Villa was allowed to cheer in the fight against the descent.
Manchester United took the lead by a penalty kick from Bruno Fernandes (71st minute).
After a red card for Leicester City in the aftermath, Jesse Lingard (90.+8) hit the final score.
Chelsea, FC Bayern opponent in the Champions League of 16 finals, won the Wolverhampton Wanderers in parallel with 2-0 (2:0) thanks to Mason Mount (45.+1) and Olivier Giroud (45.+4).
“That means a lot to me,” said coach Frank Lampard, who is also in the final of the FA Cup against Arsenal in his first season as Chelsea Coach.
Chelsea's victory against Wolverhampton also benefited from Tottenham Hotspur, which passed the Wolves with a lean 1:1 (1:0) at Crystal Palace and starts sixth in the Europa League.
Aston Villa decided the remote duel with FC Watford and AFC Bournemouth for himself, but had to shake for a long time at West Ham United for class retention.
Jack Grealish's late leadership (84th) immediately recalled Andrej Jarmolenko (85th).
But that was enough because Watford lost at Arsenal at 2:3 (1:3).
The club, which took three coaches in the season, is disembarked after five first league years.
Just like Bournemouth, who couldn't save itself with a 3:1 (2:1) at FC Everton.
In the end, a point was missing.
FC Liverpool, which has been established as English champion since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3-1 (1:1) win at Newcastle United.
99 points are the highest score the Reds ever scored in a football season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp and his team barely missed the score record in English football.
Manchester City holds its record with 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
After the first minute Newcastle guided tour, Virgil van Dijk (38th), Divock Origi (59th) and Sadio Mané (89th) shot the game for Liverpool on Sunday.
“It was an extraordinary season for this wonderful club,” goalscorer Van Dijk said after the game, “it should inspire us to defend the title.
It's going to be hard”.
Premier League bosses should also be satisfied in the end.
Due to the coronavirus crisis, football operations in England were interrupted from March 13 to June 17.
In the meantime, there was even a discussion of early termination or a discontinuation of the remaining games on neutral ground.
After all, the season could be played to an end without any special events - but as in Germany without spectators in the stadiums.
Arrests and violence during demonstrations against Netanyahu
The protests in Israel against Netanyahu's head of government are getting more and more intense.
Violent clashes occurred during the night.
The Israeli police violently took action against participants in a demonstration against right-wing conservative head of government Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday night in Jerusalem.
Police spokesman Mickey Rosenfeld said twelve people were arrested for participating in riots.
The police used water launchers, among other things, to resolve the rally.
According to media reports, a total of around 6000 people gathered near Netanyahu's office on Saturday evening.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu's handling of the corona crisis.
The protesters beat drums, blew in horns and called Netanyahu to resign.
Participants of a counter-demonstration who supported Netanyahu were also arrested, the news site “ynet” reported.
People also demonstrated in many other places in Israel, including in front of the head of government's private villa in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
According to police, a man was arrested near Tel Aviv because it is suspected of having sprayed pepper spray from a moving car onto roadside demonstrators.
Another man was arrested after a knife attack on a demonstrator in the south of the country.
The protester had been slightly injured on his neck.
There have been several demonstrations against Netanyahu in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv recently.
The rallies accompany the corruption process against the head of government.
Netanyahu was also recently criticized for handling the corona crisis.
Among other things, he is presented with rapid easing and a lack of preparation for a second wave of corona.
The corona crisis has severely hit the country's economy.
The unemployment rate was more than 20 percent recently.
The number of new infections with the coronavirus in Israel recently rose to ever new record levels.
Accident near Ahlen (NRW) - Van crashes on car - nine injured - Ruhrgebiet - Bild.de
Ahlen - A rear-end crash demanded nine slightly injured people at Ahlen on Saturday afternoon on the B58.
A motorist was headed towards Beckum with her two children (3, 5).
The police: “She probably had slowed down suddenly because she wanted to turn”.
The driver of a Mercedes van driving behind her must have seen this too late.
He crashed into the back of the car.
In the accident, three occupants were slightly injured in the car and six in the van.
Several ambulances took her to an surrounding hospital.
North Korea closes border city after corona suspected
North Korea has so far seen its own measures to defend against the coronavirus as a “brilliant success”.
The country is now reporting on a suspicion for the first time.
Because of a first official corona suspicion in the country, North Korea completely sealed off a big city out of fear of disaster.
Despite the strictest epidemiological defenses in the past six months, “the malicious virus could have been introduced into the country,” state media reported.
The state of emergency was imposed for the region around the border city of Kaesong.
The communist leadership called the highest alert level.
If the suspected case is confirmed, it would be the first official case of infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the isolated country.
North Korea had not registered a single infection so far and described its defenses as “shining success.”
The information was doubted abroad.
The symptoms of the disease were reportedly found in an “outlier” who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on July 19.
The person dropped off to South Korea three years ago and has now returned across the border.
For the time being, there was no confirmation of border crossing within the four kilometre wide and largely mined military buffer zone from South Korea.
However, South Korea's military admitted the possibility of illegal border crossing to North Korea as high, according to reports by national news agency Yonhap.
There were investigations on some people.
North Korea, according to its own statements, called an urgent meeting of the Workers' Party's Politburo on Saturday, chaired by ruler Kim Jong Un on suspicion.
“The dangerous situation in Kaesong could cause a deadly and destructive disaster.”
As a preventive measure, Kim ordered “completely blocking Kaesong and isolating each district and region from others,” it said.
The data subject and all people in Kaesong who had had contact with her have been quarantined.
The party's central military commission should therefore investigate the “outlier” and the conduct of the responsible military unit and, if necessary, impose severe punishment.
It is estimated that around 300,000 people live in Kaesong.
Excitement before Council meeting: City East and noise protection are still up for discussion before a big summer break
“In addition to environmental issues, committee members will also vote on the development plan for the major project Downtown Development East, among other things,” it is more casually stated in the middle section of the city press release on the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, July 28, at 4.30 pm in the Grand Hall of the Congress Centre Pforzheim.
However, the appreciation of the eastern city in particular is controversial until the end.
The majorities for this are scarce, and most recently even negative in individual committees depending on their presence.
An appeal from business (construction, real estate, trade and IT) that was developed from citizenship and then by administration and municipal council to fail now after almost ten years of preparation, criticized project opponent Reinhard Klein as an “extra-parliamentary opposition,” “unsuspecting,” “speculation,””” denigration” and “deliberate false statements.”
“Everyone feels that they know better,” says Klein, who has been the only representative of the citizens list Pforzheim for a year now.
In fact, after reading the treaties, he is in this position: “I know what I'm talking about”.
The city is cheaper to exit, and contrary to statements of the city administration, the Technical Town Hall is after grants whose existence Klein is convinced to rehabilitate for 8.5 million euros.
The city will develop very differently than what is predicted in the town hall and by its proponents from the economy.
Shaping the city through its own strength rather than an investor: This is his plan B. One day after small, the FDP/FW/UB/LED faction, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
It also essentially envisages the renovation of the Technical City Hall, the openness of the Schlossberg, renting the ex-thale for administrative areas and a more small-scale city redesign ideally with local carriers.
Environmental issues play a central role
Environmental issues in particular will also play a central role.
The municipal council will, among other things, vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the Pforzheim population from health noise pollution caused by road traffic, including many times speed reductions.
In a press release, the local transport club Germany welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30, however, the political leaders in the city are not innocent of the fact that this has to happen because they are only due to neglect regular bus service with thinned out bars and little commitment to cycling contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus noise, according to the VCD.
The municipal council also votes on the participation of the city of the energy and climate protection agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
The agenda also includes accession to the Baden-Württemberg Climate Protection Pact, the reassessment of parental contributions in city day care facilities and the application for inclusion in federal smart city support.
Citizens are welcome, but need to take corona safeguards in mind.
Tim Zimmermann starts the new season with a lot of delay
With almost half a year delay, Tim Zimmermann starts his premiere season at the ADAC GT Masters on July 31.
Before the league of super sports cars can start regular operations, the first test drives were now on the way.
For Zimmermann, it was primarily about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3 closer.
The corona crisis has long prevented Tim Zimmermann from starting his first business trip in Grasser Racing's new Lamborghini Huracan.
This was now possible under special hygiene conditions.
23-year-old Langenargener made his first laps at the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his premiere in the GT3 car.
“There are a few things that are different from the pre-season Porsche,” says Zimmermann.
“With ABS, for example, you have to take turns differently.
But it was really a lot of fun”.
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite his only 25 years, the Dutchman is already experienced in GT sports and has been able to help his new team-mate in many things.
“I'm not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series also brings new challenges,” says Zimmermann.
“Steijn and I get along with each other dazzling and we also made tremendous progress at the Lausitzring from session to session”.
The GT Masters will also be holding its first race right there - at the Lausitzring.
From July 31, the 33 super sports cars will race through Lusatia.
However, Zimmermann, who is one of 15 newcomers to series production, knows the track.
He was the last guest in the Motodrom in 2015.
“It worked fast and I had to get used to the track little,” says Zimmermann, who is starting for the Friedrichshafen racing community Graf Zeppelin.
“The Lausitzring has many quick passages that you have to hit optimally in order to be fast”.
How fast Zimmermann really is then turns out in two weeks.
“The teams play poker a little while testing, of course,” he says.
“In the end, we are very satisfied and look forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring”.
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a tightly crowded calendar.
Seven races are pending until the beginning of November.
Current status is that no viewers will be admitted - but there is a prominent guest.
Ex-Formula 1 driver Niko Hülkenberg will take the GT steering wheel at the Nürburgring in mid-August.
British Transport Minister cold caught by quarantine decision
According to press reports, the UK government's decision to quarantine Spain holidaymakers for two weeks after they returned has caught the country's transport minister cold.
Therefore, Grant Shapps is currently on vacation in Spain, of all places, while his colleagues at home decided the measure on Saturday.
Due to the rising corona numbers in Spain, the London cabinet removed the country from the list of countries from which it is possible to enter without quarantine requirements.
The new regulation will apply from today, Sunday, so Shapps will also have to quarantine after he returns.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures on returnees.
But the regulation applies to those who are just on the leave deadline, only from Saturday, August 1, and was not introduced overnight.
By the way, Spain is still considered one of the “safe countries” in Austria that does not require quarantine in Austria.
“Many ministers may have known in advance that there is a possibility that a quarantine will be imposed on holidaymakers Spain,” commented Labour MP Diane Abbot.
“But apparently nobody bothered to tell Grant Shapps”.
Infection rates in the country are rising again just under a month after the end of the corona emergency in Spain and the end of the strict curfew.
Virologists are mainly responsible for nightlife for the renewed spread.
Spain is one of the British's favorite holiday destinations.
The British government is currently discourages unnecessary travel to mainland Spain, excluding the Canary Islands and Balearic Islands, which are particularly popular with British holidaymakers.
More than 272,000 infections with the novel coronavirus and more than 28,000 deaths have been recorded in Spain so far.
Russia: Navy Day: Putin announces hypersonic weapons for warships
Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that the warships were equipped with state-of-the-art hypersonic weapons on the Day of the Navy in his country.
With these unique weapons in the world, the fighting possibilities of Russian naval forces would be expanded, Putin said at the central naval parade in St. Petersburg on Sunday.
According to the agency Interfax, the Ministry of Defense also informed about successful tests of the hypersonic rocket zircon built for the naval.
The hypersonic weapons have a multiple of the speed of sound of around 343 meters per second.
They are considered weapons of the future.
Underwater tropedeo continues to be built
The atomically stockable underwater torpedo Poseidon continues to be built, it was said.
The planned sea drone is planned to destroy coastal destinations.
The president, who also sailed a military boat himself, said that 40 new ships would be put into service at the individual fleet associations of the largest country in the world this year alone.
Russia has a coastal area as large as no other country in the world.
For 300 years, the Navy has been reliably protecting Russia, said Putin during the day celebrated by sailors nationwide.
In many other Russian coastal towns, naval forces also parades the Day of the Navy.
In Syria, where Russia fights alongside ruler Bashar al-Assad, the military demonstrated strength at a gun show in Tartu's Mediterranean port.
Ammo was also fired there.
A video published by the Ministry of Defense not only featured warships, including a submarine, but also attack helicopters and jets.
Hurricane “Hanna” reaches Texas: help made difficult due to corona
Washington - The first hurricane of this year's season over the Atlantic has hit land in Texas.
Life-threatening floods, strong winds and heavy rainfall now threatened parts of the US state, as the National Hurricane Center told US climate agency NOAA on night through Sunday (local time).
Governor Greg Abbott declared a state of emergency for many districts.
The rampant corona pandemic in Texas is making the work of the helpers more difficult, said Abbott, according to US media.
evacuates called for caution
“Every hurricane is a huge challenge,” said Abbott according to the newspaper “Houston Chronicle”.
Looking at the Texas hurricane, he added: “This challenge is complicated and gets worse considering it sweeping through an area that is the state's most affected area by Covid-19.”
According to Johns Hopkins University, around 5000 people have so far died in Texas alone as a result of the corona pandemic.
Abbott called on people who had to leave their homes to be careful.
They should not disregard practices “we have become accustomed to,” such as wearing masks, said the governor, according to the station CBS.
It is important that everyone kept their distance.
Therefore, hotel rooms were also provided in some places.
In addition, the need to test for corona in emergency shelters.
Damage had initially been reported only from the coastal city of Port Mansfield.
Storm warning withdrawn
With wind speeds of up to 150 kilometers per hour, “Hanna” hit the island of Padre Island on land just off the Texan coast, according to authorities.
The tropical storm had previously been upgraded to the lowest level one hurricane.
For the stretch of coast from Port Mansfield to Sargent, a storm flood warning was first issued and later withdrawn.
Authorities expected a slowdown, while “Hanna” moved further inland and headed for northeastern Mexico.
“Douglas” is moving towards Hawaii
In the Pacific, hurricane “Douglas” headed towards Hawaii at wind speeds of around 150 kilometers per hour during the night on Sunday.
However, the hurricane center expected it to weaken further.
It is forecast to be near Hawaii's largest islands on Sunday (local time) - then just below the hurricane threshold as a storm.
According to a forecast from May, NOAA expected an above-average hurricane season over the Atlantic this year.
From June to the end of November, up to ten hurricanes can be expected, of which up to six very strong hurricanes could become very strong, the authority said.
On average, there are six hurricanes per year over the Atlantic Ocean, three of which develop into storms of great strength.
Given available climate data and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and Caribbean, the probability of a normal season was only 30 percent, and that of a below-average even only ten percent, was said at that time.
US President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that his government was closely watching the storms and was in contact with the affected states.
Four goals dismissed: video assistant “punished” Sassuolo
Sassuolos Filip Djuricic two goals were dismissed
Naples - Four goals scored, four goals dismissed: Sassuolo Calcio had a raven black evening in the Italian football league Serie A at the SSC Naples - and was really angry with the video assistant of the referee.
“A festival of ungiven goals for Sassuolo.
The VAR has never been so hard against a team,” commented the “Corriere dello Sport”.
Host Naples had taken the lead through a goal by full-back Elseid Hisaj in the 8th minute, and in the 32nd minute Filip Djuricic initially celebrated the balance.
Video Assistant Referee (VAR) took the hit back because of an offside position.
Five minutes later, Djuricic shot the ball back into the net - again the VAR intervened.
The team of referees also withdrew the goals of attackers Francesco Caputo (50th) and Domenico Berardi (61.) following the VAR's advice.
In addition time, Allan made the 2-0 final score perfect for Naples and the bitter evening for Sassuolo.
“The VAR is worse for Sassuolo than a speed trap on the road and punishes Sassuolo like no team before.
The new technology is setting records,” writes the “Gazzetta dello Sport”.
FC Bayern Munich: Pavard hurt
Munich (dpa) - The start of the hot preparation phase for the Champions League began with a setback for double winner FC Bayern.
After his first team training, Hansi Flick, who recovered “reasonably well” after a short vacation and a few days of training, has to consider how he can rebuild his successful defenses after the injury of world champion Benjamin Pavard.
The Frenchman, who has the third most operating minutes behind Captain Manuel Neuer and midfield chief Joshua Kimmich, suffered a ligament injury on the left foot root and threatens to be missing in decisive premier class duels.
In Munich's dirty weather, the right-back broke off a training game and was driven off the course with a golf kart.
How long the unrestricted regular player has to pause in the battle for the title is open.
A bet in the round of 16 against FC Chelsea on August 8 may be difficult, and the 24-year-old can hope for the final tournament in Lisbon, which will begin August 12 in Lisbon.
The Bavarians do not want to be stopped by the mishap from Sunday's training.
In his personal triple-formula, Flick cited the three attributes he wants to see from his stars on the way to Portugal's capital.
His victorious title collectors are expected to show quality, intensity and concentration in the ideally following 28 days until the premier class final game on August 23.
“We simply mastered the compulsory tasks with championship and trophy excellently.
Now it's time to create something special,” said Flick.
However, until Munich people can deal with the final tournament and a training camp in the Algarve in concrete terms, however, the sixth final obligation against FC Chelsea is due for the first time.
After 3-0 in the first leg before the corona break, Londoners in the home arena should not again become Bavaria's nightmare like in the lost “final dahoam” in 2012.
“We need to go through the door first.
We want to win, create good conditions and build trust with a good game,” said Flick.
A test for tuning up is due on Friday against Olympique Marseille.
With a long speech, Flick had sworn his stars, who had 13 days vacation after the double, to a one-off August.
He welcomed 31 players at Säbener Straße, including the new players in noble purchasing Leroy Sané, who first met all new colleagues on the court after moving from Manchester City.
“Leroy did a good job like all new ones,” Flick said.
But instead of talking about the new season, when Sané & Co. is no longer just allowed to train, Flick much preferred to talk about the German series champion's current title project.
After days of individual and small group training, team strength is now being trained for Londoners who are in the rhythm of play in contrast to the Flick ensemble.
After that, Munich people could face a quarter-final against FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, while Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin are potential opponents in the semifinals.
Getting to the finals in Lisbon “is not so easy,” emphasized the head coach, who can rely on the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training from Tuesday on.
World Cup record goalscorer Klose and Flick know about many joint tournament preparation, which is particularly important in the 0-to-100 tuning.
Working with his current team is “a pleasure,” Flick praised.
The “focus on winning” is an impressive feature of his team.
The tournament with nine-teams was also ambitious on Sunday.
All of the top performers were there, including Thiago willing to churn and defender David Alaba, whose whereabouts are not guaranteed beyond the premier class season.
Formula 1 needs a special rule to choose its world champion
As the required number of continents cannot be driven, the FIA must improvise to award the World Cup titles.
All America races have been canceled, though.
Race calendar is getting more and more concrete
The race calendar of the current Formula 1 season continues to take shape.
Three more racetracks were added to the ten confirmed Grand Prix so far during the week.
In October, the Nürburgring will be driven in Germany and Portimão, Portugal.
On the first of November, Lewis Hamilton and co. fight for World Cup points on the traditional Italian race track in Imola.
The 2020 race calendar thus comprises 13 races according to the current status.
“We're happy to continue making great progress in completing our plans for the 2020 season,” said Formula 1 boss Chase Carey.
A total of 15 to 18 races will be held in the premier class of motorsport in this exceptional season.
Formula 1 wants to complete its season in Asia.
The final race calendar is to be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
According to media reports, appearances in Vietnam and Malaysia could still take place at the end of November before the officially targeted races in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December.
Regulations call for races on three continents
The rules of Formula 1 require at least races on three continents for the award of the World Cup.
Even though, as currently planned, will only be driven on two continents, there should be a world champion.
With the help of a special rule, the FIA intends to award the titles due to the coronavirus pandemic, citing “extraordinary circumstances”.
The traditional start of the season in Australia in March had to be cancelled at short notice due to the oncoming corona crisis.
Returning to the continent later this year is not an issue.
In addition, Formula 1 will not be a guest in America this year.
Cancellation meets criticism in Brazil
Due to the tense corona situation, the races will not take place in Canada, the USA, Mexico and Brazil.
“We're looking forward to being with them again next season,” said Carey.
The cancellation of America races was particularly criticised in Brazil: “The cancellation was not surprising to us, but we cannot accept the reasons for this,” said Tamas Rohonyi, promoter of the São Paulo Grand Prix.
The number of infections in São Paulo is significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
The concerns of some teams not wanting to drive in Brazil would also not justify rejection.
You are prepared for the required security measures.
Greta Thunberg: Bad eye against Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg talked about her encounter with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest of Stephen Colbert's well-known latenight show via video switch and revealed in an interview what she had in mind when she met Donald Trump.
Climate-kivist Greta Thunberg was a guest in a popular US latenight show via video switch.
She talked about her fight against the world's powerful, among other things.
The teenager also spoke about her famous “evil eye” when she encountered Donald Trump.
New York City - Over the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has attracted attention with her tireless commitment to the “Fridays For Future” movement.
She now talked about her plans in the future in a well-known latenight show and her encounter with US President Donald Trump at the UN climate summit last year.
Latenight presenter Stephen Colbert welcomed 17-year-old Thunberg to your show on Tuesday and conducted a longer interview with the Swedish woman.
She not only talked about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the world's powerful.
“There are a few things that surprised me,” she said.
“How far people go to steer the focus away from the climate crisis,” she shook.
“Everything from organized hate campaigns to threats just because a group of children is taking to the streets,” she experienced.
Heads of state and leaders who ridicule or even try to silence them on social media find her “funny” because they show her the reactions “because they have no other answer to that.”
It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was addressed to a well-known scene in which she threw US President Trump a bitter evil eye behind.
At the 2019 UN climate summit in New York, for which the activist sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive view was captured by cameras and has since been seen by countless people online.
The short clip resulted in a GIF, an animated image that ultimately became one of the most used images for Trump opponents.
But what was the 17-year-old thinking about the US president right now?
To Stephen Colbert's relatively open question, she responded only briefly and dry: “To be honest, I don't think that needs any further explanation”.
Experienced satirist Colbert probably didn't expect the quick-witted answer and quickly disappeared from the picture laughing.
With her “how dare you?” -She remembered her speech on the principles of climate protection at the climate conference.
Ex-Dortmund property with triple pack for Lazio Rome
Ciro Immobile is now on par with Bavaria's Robert Lewandowski in the race for Europe's Golden Shoe.
The former Dortmund Ciro Immobile continues to have the best chance of becoming top scorer in the Italian football championship.
The former BVB pro scored three hits in Lazio Rom's 5:1 (1:1) victory at Hellas Verona, including two turned penalty kicks in the replay times of both halves.
The 30-year-old from fourth in the standings now has 34 season goals in his account before the end - Robert Lewandowski from FC Bayern Munich scored just as many in the past Bundesliga season.
In Italy, Cristiano Ronaldo follows with 30 goals so far, while the Portuguese superstar met Sampdoria Genoa with the leader in the evening.
Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green died
His life was like a roller coaster ride: after a rapid ascent with Fleetwood Mac, it went steeply downhill and then slowly upwards.
Now bluesrock guitarist Peter Green has died at the age of 73.
Awesome guitarist, drug junkie, cult follower: The band's co-founder Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully in his sleep at the age of 73, family members shared an official statement on Saturday, and another statement would be announced for the next few days.
Top musicians like Peter Frampton recognized Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional response of a “monumental loss” for all previous and current members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
Drummer Fleetwood and guitarist Green founded the long-legendary band in London in 1967, and his dreamy instrumental hit “Albatross” remains unforgotten to this day.
The musician's life (“The End of the Game”, “In the Skies”) was like a roller coaster ride.
Green experienced a rapid rise with Fleetwood Mac - but then the band celebrated their biggest successes without him.
There is said to have been a dispute, among other things, because Green wanted to donate all the Group's profits to charity.
He began to appear in wide garments and with a large crucifix.
Psychological problems are also said to have played a role.
Green left the band just three years after its foundation in 1970.
It was followed by a social decline.
The bluesrock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, as biographers reported.
Green has been treated in psychiatry for a long time.
During most of the 1970s, the musician disappeared from the scene.
He is said to have lived on the streets temporarily, worked as a cemetery gardener and spent a time in an Israeli kibbutz.
Green was born in 1946 as the son of a Jewish working class family in London's Bethnal Green district.
At a young age, he was enthusiastic about US blues musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
He learned the first guitar grips at the age of eleven.
At the age of 15, the teenager started playing guitar professionally and was given the chance five years later to be on stage as lead guitarist for instrumental band Peter B's Looners.
A little later he was hired in the bluesbreakers to replace his idol Eric Clapton.
In the middle of the blues boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac together with his bluesbreakers colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie in the summer of 1967.
The song “Albatross”, composed by Green, gave the group the first number 1 hit in winter 1968/69 and catapulted them to the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid rise soon showed its downsides: Green did not cope with the media hustle, and his experiments with the drug LSD became increasingly extreme.
He later commented on the life between music and addiction in an interview: “The worst thing that happened to me in life is drugs - the best thing was to land a number 1 hit.”
Towards the end of the decade, Green was surprisingly successful in 1979 with an album inspired by religious themes.
Fleetwood Mac, meanwhile, swam on a wave of success in new formation without him.
Her album “Rumours”, released in 1977, sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
Despite various small solo successes, Green did not make a major comeback until he started again in 1996 with a group of friendly musicians.
The British “Daily Telegraph” spoke of a rock star returned to Earth at the time.
Drug-free, Green released a few albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group until the band dissolved in 2004.
For music experts, he was already a blues legend during his lifetime - and with his soft sound, one of the most influential guitarists of the past decades.
