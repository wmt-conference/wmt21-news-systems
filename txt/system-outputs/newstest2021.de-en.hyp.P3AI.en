Biker reacts lightning fast and prevents worse
On Friday evening, a traffic accident occurred on the highway between Machtolsheim and Merklingen, in which a motorcyclist was only slightly injured thanks to his quick reaction.
Motorist overlooks biker
A 44-year-old driver wanted to turn left with her VW coming from Merklingen on the state road 1230 in the direction of Machtolsheim.
Here she overlooked the 24-year-old motorcyclist coming from the direction of Nellingen.
In the event of a collision, handbrake and foot brake levers fly away
The biker still tried to avoid the car, but nevertheless touched it at the rear of the vehicle.
The Suzuki's hand and foot brake levers were torn off and the driver was no longer able to brake.
He steered his motorcycle in the green stiffeners next to the road and let it roll out there without falling.
Biker suffers leg injury
Due to the collision with the car, the biker still suffered an injury at the Beim and had to be treated in a clinic.
Mamming: Mass Corona Infection: 174 Harvesters Infected
After a mass corona infection on a large vegetable farm in Mamming, Lower Bavaria, almost 500 people are under quarantine and are no longer allowed to leave the company.
A security service supervises the curfew.
A total of 174 harvesters were tested positive for the corona pathogen SARS-CoV-2 during the screening, as the district office of Dingolfing-Landau announced on Saturday evening.
"Unfortunately, in order to prevent further spread, we have to take this step to protect the population," explained District Administrator Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Previously, seven employees had already been infected in the company - this was the reason for the series test.
The farm is a large vegetable farm that grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and beetroot - the cucumbers, however, only for jars.
Mamming is a rural community with a good 3300 inhabitants not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW plant.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to keep calm: "According to our information, it is a closed circle of people".
On the farm, infected workers were separated from uninfected workers, the site is now surrounded by a fence.
The Greens and the SPD shared responsibility with the state government.
The two opposition factions accused Prime Minister Markus Soeder (CSU) and his cabinet of neglecting the control of the accommodation of seasonal workers.
"This can take bitter revenge if such local infections spread and regional lockdowns have to be ordered," said Juergen Mistol, the parliamentary managing director of the Greens.
The SPD takes a very similar view: "After the corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof slaughterhouse in mid-May, we have already called for a special control program for farms with harvest workers," said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
"From our point of view, the hygiene conditions at the workplace and the living conditions in particular must be closely monitored.
That obviously did not happen. "
The outbreak had come "with announcement".
Subway station Aidenbachstrasse: Dangerous dispute: 19-year-old falls into the track bed after Schubser
In a dispute between two youth groups at the Aidenbachstrasse underground station, a 19-year-old fell through a shove and slipped into the track bed.
Obersendling - On Friday there was a dispute between two youth groups at the underground station Aidenbachstrasse at 4.15 pm.
A passer-by alerted the police, who approached with several patrols.
According to initial investigations, a Munich resident (17) pushed a 19-year-old to the ground.
The young man slipped over the platform edge and fell into the track bed.
People from the group of the 17-year-old helped the fallen person to climb off the track.
There was no danger of an approaching railway.
According to the police, there were again clashes between the two people.
The 17-year-old initially fled the scene of the crime, but his personal details could be determined afterwards.
Accompanied by his father, he went to the Police Inspectorate 29.
The 17-year-old is under investigation for assault.
Report: Seehofer pushes for longer data retention
Data retention is currently suspended.
According to a media report, however, Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer calls for an extension of the storage period.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
According to a media report, Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer (CSU) is calling for an extension of data retention - instead of the planned ten weeks for half a year.
As the "Bild am Sonntag" reports, Seehofer asked Minister of Justice Christine Lambrecht (SPD) in a letter for a quick change in the law.
Seehofer therefore wants to strengthen the measures against child abuse.
He believes it makes sense "to make urgently needed adjustments to the law now," the newspaper quotes from the letter.
Data retention is currently suspended.
A decision of the European Court of Justice is expected.
Seehofer, however, wants the amendments in advance so that they can be applied immediately after a possible positive verdict, the report continues.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice told the newspaper that it could only be meaningfully examined whether legal adjustments were needed once the courts had ruled.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer, together with the interior ministers of the federal states, had already spoken out in June in favour of data retention.
NBA: Stripclub Trouble for Clippers Star Lou Williams
Excitement in the NBA!
Lou Williams (33), basketball pro of the Los Angeles Clippers, is said to have left the tournament quarters in Disney World in Orlando / Florida with permission for a funeral.
According to US media reports, he still visited the strip club "Magic City" in Atlanta in the evening.
Williams, who is said to have admitted the visit according to ESPN data, is back in isloation, is tested daily on COVID-19.
His reason to visit: Chicken Wings.
In February last year, "Sweet Lou", as he is called in the NBA, already expressed his love for exactly these wings.
The American wrote: "Magic City and Blue Flame (another strip club in Atlanta) have the best wings in town".
NBA insider Shams Charania announced on Sunday on Twitter that the NBA has imposed a ten-day quarantine on Williams.
Thus, the Clippers star missed the first two official games after the test phase.
In Disney World, the NBA wants to end the Corona season.
Currently, the best 22 teams are preparing for the season finale, which starts on Friday night.
Soeder expresses itself after mass infection to the corona-situation
Munich - Health Minister Melanie Huml (CSU) has already announced a test offensive for large farms on Sunday.
The press conference will be shown live on our homepage.
The case in Mamming in the district of Dingolfing-Landau has alarmed the authorities and politicians.
Almost 500 harvesters from several countries are currently working on the large vegetable farm, and more than a third have been infected with the corona pathogen.
The farm is now under quarantine and is fenced off with a construction fence.
No one is allowed to leave the premises, food is delivered.
The authorities are now offering free corona tests to the 3,300 inhabitants of the municipality.
Since the harvesters had little contact with the local population, the district office has so far assumed that the infections have not spread beyond the farm.
"Remorse": Confession of the alleged arsonist of Nantes
"My client has been cooperative," lawyer Quentin Chabert told the newspaper.
The defence lawyer added: "He deeply regrets the deeds, the confession was a liberation for him".
His mandate was "plagued by remorse and greatly affected by the extent of the destruction."
In the event of a conviction, the man is threatened with ten years imprisonment and a fine of 150,000 euros, according to the public prosecutor.
The Gothic St. Peter and Paul Cathedral in Nantes was severely damaged in a fire last night on Saturday.
The fire had broken out in three distant places in the church.
Laboratory tests confirmed the suspicion of arson.
The suspect had already been arrested a few hours after the fire.
However, he was released after one day.
The man works as a volunteer for the diocese of Nantes and was responsible for the closure of the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
Since there was no trace of a violent intrusion into the church, he quickly came into the focus of the investigators.
Discussing the abolition of the 50 + 1 rule
Former DFB President Reinhard Grindel has recommended that consideration be given to abolishing the 50 + 1 rule.
"German football should at least discuss setting conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates a fait accompli," Grindel told Bild am Sonntag.
He stressed: "For the clubs that are most likely to become dangerous in Bavaria and Dortmund, the 50 + 1 rules do not work anyway: See Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, there is no getting around the debate as to whether it is not advisable to facilitate the involvement of investors in associations that want to break into this phalanx ".
However, he has doubts whether there is a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority participation, which is prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50 + 1 rule.
"It remains a legal risk to build investment fences around the Bundesliga as a business location in a single European market," said Grindel.
The former DFB boss sees the danger that "the attempts to ensure more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will ultimately only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but will not lead to more tension in the championship."
Even an equal distribution of TV funds will not have a decisive effect.
"FC Bayern generates a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund 500 million and RB Leipzig 300 million.
So the differences between the first three clubs are already immense.
The other 15 clubs have an average budget of 130 million, "the 58-year-old explained.
Looking back at the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Unfortunately, there have been people who have noticed this mistake and pierced the press instead of addressing me," Grindel said about the adoption of an expensive watch that led to his resignation in April 2019.
"That has already occupied me a lot in human terms."
He had received the gift worth around 11,000 euros from a Ukrainian official.
"I committed a compliance violation, and it was right to draw the consequences," Grindel said.
"I handled the ominous watch gift completely transparently and without suspicion.
Many people in the DFB knew about it. "
He had never "made a secret of the present," the 58-year-old assured.
"This may be called naive, but this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption."
"Black Lives Matter": Injured and one dead
Protests against police violence in the United States have escalated again with Donald Trump's deployment of federal police in several cities.
On Saturday there were clashes between protesters and police in various cities.
Three people were injured in Louisville and 16 people were arrested in Seattle.
In Austin, one person was killed by gunfire while a march was crossing an intersection.
Previously, there had been clashes in Portland during protests against racism and police violence.
The security forces, including federal police officers, used tear gas on Saturday night and violently dispersed demonstrators.
Hundreds of partially armed protesters marched through Louisville, Kentucky on Saturday, demanding that those responsible for Breonna Taylor's death be held accountable.
The 26-year-old student had been shot dead in March during a drug raid in her apartment in Louisville.
The target of the raid was someone else who did not live there, and no drugs were found.
When a member of a group calling itself the Armed Alliance of Black Americans fired a shot on Saturday, three people were injured.
According to NBC, they were taken to the hospital.
None of them were in mortal danger.
The police set up barricades because counter-demonstrators of a white militia had also formed.
In the end, the two groups did not meet.
In Austin, Texas, one person was shot and killed in a "Black Lives Matter" demonstration.
The police claimed to have taken a suspect into custody.
She has not yet provided any further information on the circumstances of the crime.
Mayor Steve Adler, according to the New York Times, said he, like many in the city, was "inconsolable and stunned" by what had happened.
Demonstrators also clashed with the police in the American metropolis of Seattle on Saturday.
They set fire to construction vehicles in front of a youth prison, and the police used blinding grenades and pepper spray.
According to the Seattle Times, 16 people were arrested for resisting police or assault.
In the city of Oakland, California, a courthouse was set on fire.
A small group of protesters smashed windows, fired fireworks, and blinded police officers with lasers, Oakland police said late Saturday night (local time).
The fire was quickly extinguished.
In Aurora, a suburb of Denver, Colorado, a car drove through a crowd demonstrating on a highway.
According to the police, one of the demonstrators fired a gun and at least one person was taken to the hospital injured.
In addition, windows were smashed in a court and a fire was set, the police reported.
Investigations have been launched.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historical costumes defy Corona
Although the big party was missing in the spa town, visitors and performers enjoyed the Rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, performers and organizers: The Rakoczy weekend without Rakoczy festival.
But: Even if the big party mile in the city center was missing, the crowds and program highlights such as Saale burn, Rakoczy ball or pageant, many came at the Corona compliant alternative program at their expense.
"I think we have succeeded in spreading Rakoczy flair," says spa director Sylvie Thormann.
The guests would have accepted it well.
In principle, one returns to the beginnings of the Rakoczy festival, as well as the historical ones alone were in the focus of the festival.
Pleasant atmosphere in the hotel
For more than 25 years, Vesna Konhaeuser and her husband have always visited Bad Kissingen for the Rakoczy festival.
This time, too, in the Corona year.
The couple has made themselves comfortable at the Luitpold Casino, watching the historical ones while strolling and listening to the Cuban live music at the casino restaurant.
"I also find it quite pleasant," says Konhaeuser.
She does not miss the crowds that otherwise belong to Rakoczy.
But it lacks the usual program highlights, above all Saale burns on Friday evening as well as the historical parade and the closing fireworks on Sunday evening.
"That's a pity indeed.
The weather would have been great this year, "she says.
Rakoczy-Equestrian Tournament to take place again
For the performers of the historical spa guests, the alternative program sometimes meant more work.
For example, for Christina Gold, who takes part in the parade in a normal year and can be seen there on the carriage of the Kurgarten cafeteria.
This year she was walking around the city in costume on Saturdays and Sundays.
"It's more strenuous, otherwise we'll have it easier," she says.
The riding club had less to do, even if individual riders were traveling in the park.
"We very much hope that the equestrian quadrille can take place again next year," says Chairman Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that after a break of several years, a Rakoczy equestrian tournament will take place again in 2021.
28 Corona cases in Spanish second-division club Fuenlabrada
The Spanish second division football club CF Fuenlabrada is sliding deeper and deeper into the crisis because of a corona outbreak.
Since the newcomer from near Madrid had flown to a game in the city of A Coru on July 20, despite the first corona cases, one low blow follows the next.
By Sunday, 28 players or team members had been tested positive, one came to the hospital, the club announced.
Fuenlabrada from the city of the same name southwest of Madrid still had the chance to reach the promotion playoffs.
Now even the relegation to the B-group of the Second League threatens.
The match against Deportivo La Coru a last Monday was cancelled at the last minute, the prosecutor's office is investigating a possible offense against public health, the supreme sports authority CSD is considering the forced relegation of the club.
Players and other team members are quarantined in a hotel.
"Until the sixth day of quarantine, they did not receive a fresh towel and gel," wrote the sports newspaper "AS".
Photos show how players hung up underwear and club clothes in their rooms in the hotel to dry after they apparently had to wash them themselves.
The bed linen had not been changed for five days.
Another problem is the food.
It is neither good nor sufficient, wrote "AS".
The club management, on the other hand, said that they were satisfied with the hotel.
The club's lawyer, Javier Tebas Llanas, rejected the accusation of deliberately endangering public health.
The son of the President of the Spanish Primera Division, Javier Tebas, stressed that the corona rules established by the Football Association had not been violated, as reported by the news agency Europa Press and the sports newspaper "Marca".
Before the flight, there had been four infected persons until 19 July, but they were all isolated and had not travelled with them.
All players and team members were tested again just before the flight on Monday to A Coruarmaca.
When the team was already in A Corona, the corona test was positive for "five or six" other team members.
The match was cancelled 60 minutes before the kick-off, said Tebas Llanas.
Police must capture horses torn out of steam compartment
Two animals were on the road.
The police escorted her back to her owner.
On Sunday morning shortly before 6 o'clock a road user informed two free-running horses on the feeder between the junction Donnersdorf / Steinsfeld and the motorway junction Theres.
When the officers arrived, the horses were already back between the feeder and the village of Dampfach.
After the officers had won the trust of the horses shortly before Dampfach, they each had a rope carried in the patrol car.
Professional cyclist Tony Martin: Career continuation conceivable
Time trial specialist Tony Martin is thinking about a continuation of his career.
Frankfurt / Main - The seven-time time trial world champion Tony Martin can certainly imagine continuing his cycling career.
"Together with the team, I am currently defining the framework conditions for how and in what form things could continue," the 35-year-old told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung.
Martin is currently employed by the Dutch team Jumbo-Visma and had considered ending his career after this year before the Corona break.
The negotiations with his team are also about the number of race days, he said.
Or about other problems that would plague him as a family man, Martin said.
He used to get up after a fall, and the first thought was: "Quickly back on the bike.
Today, as the father of a little daughter, I think: What if ".
The professional cyclist admitted that there are aspects with which he is increasingly struggling.
"But it was good for me to remember from the Corona period what I enjoy about cycling and how much I enjoy it."
The time trial specialist returns to the competition at the Tour de l'Ain (5 to 9 August).

"The number of motorized two-wheelers killed was reduced by around 28 percent compared to 2011."
Kovac tests with Monaco against Frankfurt
Frankfurt / Main (dpa) - Football coach Niko Kovac will soon be seeing Eintracht Frankfurt again with his new club AS Monaco.
The eight-time French champion will make a guest appearance on 1 August (6 p.m.) at the Hesse, the former club of the Croatian.
For the Bundesliga club, it is the first and only endurance test before the return match in the Europa League against FC Basel (6 August).
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the match is played without spectators.
"We are particularly looking forward to this game.
It's always nice to come to Frankfurt and meet friends, "Kovac explained.
From a sporting point of view, this is an interesting test, said the 48-year-old.
Before joining FC Bayern Munich, Kovac had coached the Hessians from 2016 to 2018 and led them to victory in the DFB-Pokal.
"A top-class opponent like Monaco is a good test for us in view of the match against Basel.
Like all Frankfurters, I am looking forward to seeing Niko Kovac again, "said Eintracht coach Adi Huetter.
The 50-year-old Austrian had succeeded the Croat at Eintracht.
In March, the Frankfurters had lost the first leg of the round of 16 against Basel in their own stadium with 0: 3.
Nearly 50 new infections: Hof district just past the lockdown
In the county of Hof, the number of known new corona infections on the weekend has increased further: From 39 on Friday and 43 on Saturday (one person has recovered and no longer falls into this statistic) to 47 on Sunday.

This means that the Hof area is approaching the critical threshold of 50 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants in one week.
700 deaths due to monsoon rains in Southeast Asia
More than 9 million people are affected by the severe floods in Southeast Asia, especially in Bangladesh, India and Nepal.
A total of 700 people lost their lives because of the heavy monsoon rains.
In Bangladesh, the Red Crescent is trying to reach the isolated people in boats.
Whole villages are under water.
The farmers have lost their crops.
Armored rhinoceroses in national park die from landslides
In Kaziranga National Park, several of the 120 rhinoceroses died from landslides.
They are under protection and considered threatened with extinction.
This year, the floods are particularly severe, which scientists attribute to climate change.
According to the United Nations, Bangladesh is one of the countries most affected by global warming.
New apartments are empty
In the town of Cox's Bazaar in southern Bangladesh, the state has built apartments for 650 people displaced by the floods.
So far, only a few people have moved in.
It is difficult to bring people to Cox's Bazaar.
The enthusiasm also persists in Grenezn.
Anyone who used to have a house, no matter how small and resembling a hut, often does not want to spend his life in a large apartment block.
Many apartments are empty, but - as the government wants - they will soon be occupied by those who have lost their homes to the floods.

Argentina rejects counteroffer from creditors
The new demands could not be met, the Ministry of Economy announced in Buenos Aires on Saturday.
"That would not only be irresponsible, but also unjust," a statement said.
"While 50 percent of children in Argentina live in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors".
The debt of the second largest economy in South America is no longer sustainable under current conditions.
Argentina is therefore demanding that its private creditors relinquish part of their claims of around 66 billion US dollars (around 59 billion euros).
If no agreement is reached, the country is once again threatened with bankruptcy.
It would be the ninth default in Argentine history.
Most recently, lenders had called for higher interest rates on government bonds and changes to some contractual clauses.
However, the Argentine government is sticking to its last offer and is not prepared to make any further concessions.
Argentina is experiencing a severe financial and economic crisis.
The most recent inflation rate was more than 50 percent.
For the current year, experts anticipate a decline in economic power of around ten percent.
At the end of May, Argentina had not paid interest receivables amounting to 503 million US dollars and had thus slipped into a limited default.
Arrived professionally - not yet privately
"Things are going very well" - this is the conclusion of Dr. Stefanie Kramer after her first days in the notary's office in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything went very quickly: In mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she would succeed Lutz Feller at the Eggenfeld notary's office.
Just six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the doctor of law started work, and normal day-to-day business has long been running at full speed.
"Privately, however, I still have to arrive," she explains in conversation with the Rottaler Anzeiger and laughs.
Of course, the short lead time was not enough to completely relocate the center of life from Regensburg to Eggenfelden, reports the native of Dingolfing.
She is currently looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city with her husband, who works as a judge at the Regional Court in Regensburg.
At least her husband could still apply for parental leave at short notice in order to be able to guarantee the care of the two daughters (3 extended and 1 extended years old).
In order not to have to commute every day from Regensburg, she also has an overnight stay with her parents in Dingolfing for the time being, explains the 39-year-old.
Having grown up in the neighbouring district, she has of course long been familiar with the city of Eggenfelden.
During visits with her family over the past few months, she once again stated: "Eggenfelden is a really beautiful small town".
She was all the more pleased that she had won the selection process for the vacancy.
Her homeland of Lower Bavaria also plays a central role in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's professional career: After studying law in Passau, she completed her legal clerkship and the 2nd state examination in Regensburg.
After several positions as a notary assessor, including in Rehau and Hof in Upper Franconia, Babenhausen in Lower Allgaeu and Regensburg - during this time she also "incidentally" shouldered the doctorate in employment law - she took up her first position as a notary in Rotthalmuenster in the district of Passau in 2012.
In 2016 she went on parental leave and finally moved to Regensburg.
Since then, she has taken over representation services in various notarial offices.
When the position in Eggenfelden was advertised due to the approaching retirement of Lutz Feller, she saw the right time for the full return to work, explains the 39-year-old.
The team of her predecessor, who will take over the holiday representation in the notarial office in the future, has taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer completely - and immediately has a praise for the team of the law firm ready: "It is going super well!"
The fact that she can rely on well-rehearsed processes here makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming relocation of the private center of life.
In terms of kindergarten and nursery places, she has already contacted a local institution.
And if everything works out as desired, she hopes to be able to pursue her hobby here soon - and to get to know the most beautiful jogging routes in the Rottal.
BVB plans to start the league with maximum 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be filled to 20 percent at the start of the season in the event of a fan return.
"Due to the distance regulation, which must be complied with, we are currently planning with 12,000 to 15,000 spectators," Borussia Dortmund's Managing Director Carsten Cramer told the Tagesspiegel.
Normally, the arena in the district city holds a little more than 81,000 spectators at Bundesliga matches.
In the ghost games caused by the corona pandemic last season, BVB lost about four million euros per game.
Cramer, who is responsible for marketing, digitalization and internationalization at BVB, hopes that in addition to the normal spectator seats, some of the approximately 4000 seats in the hospitality sector can be opened again: "It is of course a blow to the office if these revenues completely break down".
In view of the ongoing corona crisis, everyone is currently "well advised to take a stable sideline".
"If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people in Germany alone are in short-time work, then the need for entertainment is limited," Cramer explained.
The Dortmund marketing manager praised the BVB professionals for their partial salary waiver, which should help to overcome the crisis: "Of course, the players know that their salary waiver has a different effect than if we put 100 people who work in merchandising on short-time work".
Tiny miracles: Early start to life with a few hundred grams
Hardly heavier than a packet of butter, just three tablespoons of blood in his entire body: That was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The boy is one of about 400 premature babies who are cared for annually at the Graz Children's Hospital.
A quarter of them weigh less than 1,500 grams, a few - like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael - are extreme lightweights with less than a kilogram of birth weight.
They are born so small and so early that neither lungs, nor intestines, nor muscles are fully developed.
Their skin is sometimes so tender that they could hurt the electrodes of an ECG.
And they are so tiny that they sometimes wear doll clothes and mini diapers made especially for them.
But not so small that they wouldn't have a voice - "and how," smiles Berndt Urlesberger.
"Even if, of course, they don't scream quite as loudly as big babies."
When the whiteboard becomes a stage
Despite Corona Theater in the classroom: The whiteboard as a stage experienced the 9th grades of the St. James Gymnasium in Abtsgmuend shortly before the start of the holiday.
Actress Julia Sylvester from the Theater der Stadt Aalen presented the production "Das Heimatkleid" to the students - via video.
Afterwards, the students were able to exchange information about the play and the performance with the actress and the director Winfried Tobias via Skype.
The idea for the performance format was born from the current corona situation.
Teacher Teresa Nar was happy about the enrichment of the lessons.
Even if in the end all participants agreed that the direct encounter in the theatre and stage space would offer additional stimuli, one can also see the potential for contact in the schools in the theatre.
"If we continue to improve the technical framework, this could be an interesting addition to the game," emphasised director Winfried Tobias.
First round draw: TSV 1860 would face Eintracht Frankfurt in the DFB-Pokal
Should TSV 1860 qualify for the DFB-Pokal, the lions will face Eintracht Frankfurt in the first round.
This resulted in the draw on Sunday.
Munich - Sixty possible opponents in the first round of the DFB-Pokal have been decided.
The lions would face Eintracht Frankfurt in a successful qualification.
This was the result of the draw on Sunday evening in the ARD sports show.
Because the field of participants is not yet complete due to the corona pandemic, placeholders were used in the draw.
Due to the voluntary waiver of semi-final opponents FC Memmingen, TSV 1860 is already in the final of the Bavarian Toto-Pokal (4 or 5 September).
There the lions meet either the Wuerzburger Kickers or Viktoria Aschaffenburg.
If they reached the final, they would qualify for the first round of the DFB-Pokal.
Otherwise, the Giesinger would have to prevail in the final against Regionalliga Aschaffenburg.
The first round of the DFB-Pokal will take place between 11 and 14 September, one week before the start of the third division.
"Gone with the Wind": Film legend Olivia de Havilland is dead
Film legend and Oscar winner Olivia de Havilland is dead.
She died of natural causes on Sunday in Paris at the age of 104, confirmed her spokesperson for the German Press Agency.

Kalbitz expulsion from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "fig leaf"
The expulsion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is in the view of the FDP only a "fig leaf" and does not change the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the far right in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the tip of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD, "said FDP interior politician Benjamin Strasser to the dpa news agency in Berlin.
The Federal Arbitration Court of the AfD had confirmed on Saturday in Stuttgart after several hours of hearing the expulsion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Executive Board had decided by a majority in May.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD parliamentary group in the Brandenburg state parliament.
"If the AfD really wanted to consistently remove right-wing extremists from their party, functionaries like Bjorn Hoecke and his supporters would have been excluded long ago," Strasser said.
"However, there is no political will to do so in the AfD, because right-wing extremism is now part of the party."
CSU General Secretary Markus Blume expressed a similar opinion: "The fact that Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded says nothing and does not change anything," he told "Welt am Sonntag".
"Rather, it speaks volumes how many frenetic supporters a right-wing extremist in the middle of the AfD still has."
Blume assumes that the AfD will again land below five percent in elections in the future.
"The days of the AfD in the parliaments are numbered".
Kalbitz was one of the spokesmen of the now officially dissolved "wing" around the Thuringian AfD state and parliamentary group chairman Bjorn Hoehe; the Office for the Protection of the Constitution classifies the coronation as a "secured right-wing extremist effort".
In May, the AfD federal executive had kicked Kalbitz out of the party.
As a reason, he stated that Kalbitz had not stated an earlier membership in the now banned right-wing extremist "Heimattreue Deutsche Jugend" (HDJ) and the Republicans when he joined the party.
Kalbitz denies membership in the HDJ.
Sebastian Walter, chairman of the Left faction in the Brandenburg state parliament, also stressed that the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court did not change the character of the AfD: "The wolf has only eaten chalk.
The AfD remains a far-right party, with or without Kalbitz. "
Neither the federal party nor the right wing would be weakened by this decision.
"The manoeuvre of the mutineers is transparent.
They want to avoid further observation by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution and try to get under the radar, "said Walter.
"The AfD can't get rid of the ghosts it called.
An expulsion does not change anything, "commented Brandenburg SPD General Secretary Erik Stohn on the decision in the Kalbitz case.
"Here, the AfD regional association and the parliamentary group remained their right-wing leader to this day".
The legal dispute over Kalbitz's membership in the AfD will continue.
He announced on Saturday that he would now take civil action against the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court.
North Sea wind farms deliver a good 21 percent more electricity.
The wind power plants on the German North Sea fed 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity into the grid in the first six months of the year.
This is a good 21 percent more than in the same period of the previous year, said network operator Tennet in Bayreuth.
TenneT is responsible for the transmission of the North Sea electricity to the mainland and the transmission through the German electricity grid.
The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of Tennet's grid area, have fed in a further 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
Overall, wind power from the North Sea and the Baltic Sea will therefore reach 13.73 TWh, compared with a good 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind harvest at sea thus accounts for almost 19 percent of the total wind power in Germany; this is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms ensure higher generation capacities
In addition to wind conditions, the increased contribution of offshore wind energy results from higher generation capacities because new wind farms have been connected to the grid in the past twelve months.
If the 1270 wind power plants in the North Sea were all running at full power at the same time, they would be able to generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient for this; according to Tennet, it is 7.1 gigawatts.
It is planned to increase to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea by 2030.
"In Germany and the Netherlands, we are investing 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore grid connections by then," said TenneT Managing Director Tim Meyerjuergens.
In reality, even at sea, wind farms cannot exhaust their capacity, but reach about 40 percent.
The record day so far this year is 2 January, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind turbines produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, which corresponds to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could supply almost seven million households with electricity.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition of the Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the Gmuender Kunstverein.
This was almost a small anniversary celebration for the 130.
The opening of the exhibition "Skirmish" with works by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold went beyond the usual framework after the corona break.
Many more art lovers than usual followed the dialogue between the artist and the chairman of the Kunstverein, Professor Dr. Klaus Ripper.
The musical equivalent was provided by the band "Defenders of the Universe" on the southern Kornhausplatz.
North of the gallery, the association "Sandtogether" was involved.
Freital: Windbergfest cancelled due to Corona
The Windbergfest does not take place this year.
The city of Freital has cancelled the three-day festival planned for September.
In other years, more than 30,000 people had attended this city festival.
"We really did not make this decision easy for ourselves and - aware of how difficult it is economically for those involved - hoped until the last minute," explained Lord Mayor Uwe Rumberg (non-partisan).
"But ultimately, we are responsible for the health of many thousands of people here as organizers."
If tens of thousands had flocked to the fairgrounds and the marquee, minimum distances, hygiene regulations and contact tracking in accordance with the current Corona Protection Ordinance could not have been observed.
Or the restrictions would have been so strong that not much would have remained of a folk festival.
In addition, the organisational and monitoring effort would increase disproportionately.
Rumberg consoled for next year.
Then the city of Freital will celebrate its 100th anniversary with the Winterbergfest from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the Day of the Saxons from 10 to 12 September 2021, among other events.
Dressage Olympic Champion Werth in Achleiten, Germany
Achleiten - The six-time Olympic champion Isabell Werth was the outstanding rider at the dressage tournament in Achleiten, Austria.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg scored four victories at four starts this weekend.
After winning one Grand Prix each with Weihegold and Quantaz, she could not be beaten in the Grand Prix Special and the Freestyle on Sunday.
On the 15-year-old mare Weihegold Werth prevailed on Sunday in the special against the Austrian Victoria Max-Theurer on Abegglen.
Also in the freestyle on Saturday, the German was clearly ahead of her 34-year-old pupil Victoria Max-Theurer on Quantaz.
Werth's winning horse Quantaz belongs to Max-Theurer.
The most successful dressage rider in the world is to establish the ten-year-old stallion in the Grand Prix.
For Quantaz, it was the first freestyle ever.
Werth had already won all four important tests at the first tournament in Achleiten three weeks ago.
The last of the three international tournaments is scheduled for 14 to 16 August.
More air traffic controllers in Worms in future
The University of Applied Sciences in Worms is taking to the skies: DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung is endowing a professorship for Air Traffic Management.
A corresponding contract between the university and DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially concluded for three years and will start in 2021.
With the professorship, it is possible to start studying not only in the summer, but also in the winter semester.
This means that twice as many students can be trained as before.
At the same time, capacity utilisation at both the university and the DFS Air Traffic Control Academy will be uniform.
DFS will advise the university on setting up and filling the professorship.
Represented at the university since 2019
Since the summer semester 2019, the first students as part of their training as air traffic controllers at the University of Applied Sciences Worms have been in the Air Traffic Management degree program.
Nine students have already started this year.
So far, DFS 'experience has been very positive, and the students' performance has been excellent.
The combination of studies and pilot training makes a significant contribution to further increasing the attractiveness of the pilot profession.
"In these times, extraction is not easy for us economically.
However, we firmly expect air traffic to recover and grow again in the long term.
In order to continue fulfilling our legal mandate in the future, we need highly qualified personnel, "said Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, Chairman and CEO of DFS, at the signing of the contract.
"For DFS, the endowed professorship is a future-proof investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, interdisciplinary knowledge base in the long term.
We are therefore continuing our good cooperation with the university and at the same time underpinning our attractiveness as an employer. "
This is also underlined by Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of Worms University of Applied Sciences: "The endowed professorship forms an important bridge between science and industry.
With it, we would like to build on our existing cooperation with DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual bachelor's degree programme in Air Traffic Management. "
For the University of Applied Sciences Worms, the trust placed in it by the German air navigation service provider is both a motivation and an obligation to further expand its teaching and research expertise in the future fields of air traffic.
In its commitment to the air traffic controllers of tomorrow, the university can set very special highlights and innovative priorities for its students with the first endowed professorship for a dual course of study.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary at the Ministry of Science, Continuing Education and Culture, emphasises: "With its focus on air transport, Worms University of Applied Sciences has a unique selling point in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Today's signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the profile of the university. "
Rescue helicopter lands on the A 45
The A45 motorway towards Aschaffenburg was completely closed for about 30 minutes on Saturday afternoon, as the rescue helicopter was in use after a traffic accident.
A 76-year-old drove a Ford around 12.40 o'clock in the exit Alzenau-Mitte in the curve straight ahead and landed at the guardrail.
The driver suffered minor injuries to his face and had to be taken to a hospital for treatment.
The 72-year-old passenger's injuries were treated by the emergency doctor and the patient was then flown to a hospital by rescue helicopter.
At present, however, the police assume that there is no danger to life.
The damaged vehicle, which suffered damage of about 2000 euros, had to be towed away.
Heil wants to examine other industries after meat industry
The Corona crisis brought the conditions in parts of the meat industry to light again.
Legislative tightening is imminent.
But are they legitimate - and will they remain so?
Federal Minister of Labour Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to review other sectors in accordance with the now planned strict regulations against grievances in the meat industry.
"We will look at industry by industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective industry if necessary," said Heil of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany's employers are already warning against restricting work contracts in general.
After the massive corona outbreak at the meat giant Tonnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet wants to pass a law of salvation this Wednesday.
Large slaughterhouses should no longer be allowed to employ external personnel for slaughter, cutting and meat processing.
To this end, the use of contract workers and temporary workers is to be banned there.
Employer President Ingo Kramer told the dpa: "Stay away from a general restriction of contracts for work and temporary employment, if you do not want to strangle the economy completely".
Contracts for work and services, for example, are the basis for creating added value for customers in a wide range of trades, the construction industry and plant engineering.
"The misconduct of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument".
Heil assured: "My goal is not to ban contracts for work and services everywhere in the German economy."
Contracts for work and services make sense.
"When an industrial company commissions a craftsman to install a safety system, this is a normal contract for work and services."
The German meat industry considers a ban on contracts for work and temporary agency work in its sector alone to be unconstitutional.
It is not possible to explain why different labour law should apply to portioning and packaging of cheese in the future than to sausages, according to a statement on the draft law, as reported by the "Neue Osnabruecker Zeitung" (Saturday).
A ban would therefore increase the consumer price by 10 to 20 percent per kilo and product.
According to the results of an audit by the North Rhine-Westphalia Occupational Safety and Health Administration, many Eastern European employees from contracted work companies worked 16 hours a day in the industry.
Often they had no break.
Wages were withheld for protective equipment or rent.
It was also noted that the situation with the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Heil said that a relatively harsh law had already come into force for the meat industry in 2017.
However, these were bypassed by "tricky constructions".
"Now we have to clean up fundamentally".
The politician announced: "In the Occupational Safety and Health Act, which we want to adopt in the cabinet at the end of July, there are also measures that do not only affect the meat industry - for example, higher inspection rates for occupational safety and health or clear criteria for community accommodation".
The draft presented to the dpa includes amendments to the Act on the Protection of Employee Rights in the Meat Industry and the Occupational Safety and Health Act.
Brandenburg's Consumer Protection Minister Ursula Nonnemacher (Greens) believes that more intensive controls are necessary.
"I would like us to be able to carry out even more inspections in many areas of supervision: Food inspections, animal welfare, everything possible, including animal transport," said Nonnemacher on Sunday in the RBB programme "Brandenburg aktuell".
However, more controls would also require more staff positions.
Three dead in ultralight plane crash in Germany
According to the police, three people died in the crash of an ultralight aircraft on an apartment building in Wesel in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia.
One child was slightly injured.
Two other people were rescued injured in the accident, said a spokesman for the district control center Wesel.
According to the police, a parachute was found at the scene of the accident.
The "Rheinische Post" reported, citing eyewitnesses, that the plane had collided with a hot air balloon before the crash.
The house is a single-family or two-family house.
Further details were not initially disclosed.
Evacuation of Frankfurt Opernplatz proceeded peacefully
One week after the riots in Frankfurt, the evacuation of the Opernplatz took place peacefully on Sunday night.
A few dozen people remained in the square, but left before the curfew began at 1 o'clock.
The police had been in action since the early evening with numerous officers, and a larger police force could be seen throughout the city.
For the first time this weekend, from midnight onwards, there was a ban on entering the Opernplatz, where riots had occurred a week ago.
Police officers had been attacked with bottles from the crowd of revelers.
At least five police officers were injured and several police vehicles were damaged.
The night to Saturday had also remained quiet.
Car overturns: Young woman seriously injured in accident on federal highway 83 near Hofgeismar
In an accident between Schoeneberg and Huemme, a 21-year-old suffered serious injuries at around 1.25 pm on Sunday.
She was taken to Kassel Hospital.
The fire brigade used thermal imaging cameras to search for possible passengers.
According to the police, the woman was on her way to her place of residence on federal highway 83, when her car got off the road for an unknown reason and rolled over several times.
In order to save the victims, the fire brigade had to cut the roof of the passenger car.
Since it was unclear whether there was anyone else in the vehicle, the adjacent corn field was scanned from the turntable ladder with a thermal imaging camera.
The drone squadron from Warburg, which also works with thermal imaging cameras, had also been ordered to search for people.
However, the volunteers did not find anyone between the tall maize plants.
The seriously injured woman was taken by ambulance to the Kassel hospital for further care.
Nearly 50 firefighters from the fire brigade Hofgeismar, Huemme and Schoeneberg were on site.
The highway was closed for two hours due to the accident.
Juventus Turin champions in Italy
Turin - After a redeeming goal by Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin has secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in a row.
The team around the five-time world footballer made the 36th Scudetto in club history perfect with a 2-0 (1-0) on Sunday evening in the home game against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo scored 1-0 before halftime.
With 83 points, Turin, which competed without the last long-injured former international Sami Khedira, is no longer to be ousted from first place two matchdays before the end of the season of Serie A.
The runner-up Inter Milan is seven points behind.
Juventus was harmless despite optical superiority in the first half, then Ronaldo hit after a free kick variant with the last action.
The 35-year-old exploited a footage of Miralem Pjanic directly from the penalty area border with a flat shot (45 + 7).
Against the now more offensive guests Ronaldo was also involved in the 2-0, after his shot Federico Bernardeschi (67.) dusted off.
This ensured the lackluster but decisive success.
The foul shot to the bar in the 89th minute should have only really scared Ronaldo himself with a view to the scorer's score.
"It's complicated to stay at ball level mentally and physically for 90 minutes.
The games are weird, and momentum is changing very slightly, "said coach Maurizio Sarri even after the 1-2 at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Above all, the mental exhaustion of his players is great, said the Juve coach.
Because of the defeat, the Turins had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
The reassuring lead at the top of the standings in the end was mainly due to the weakness of the competitors.
In the eleven games before the game on Sunday, the Sarri-team had only managed five victories.
Whether Ronaldo will also be the top scorer is questionable.
While the Portuguese superstar has scored 31 goals so far, the former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile already has 34 goals on his account - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the title win of FC Bayern - after his three-pack in the 5: 1 (1: 1) of the fourth Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona.
The record in Italy is held by the current juvenile pro Gonzalo Higua.
The Argentinean scored 36 goals for SSC Napoli during the 2015 / 2016 season.
In August, the "old lady" of Italian football awaits the next chance to win the title.
Juventus are in the round of 16 of the Champions League, but will have to make up for a 0-1 first leg defeat against Olympique Lyon on 7 August to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next knockout round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would be waiting as opponents.
Baden-Wuerttemberg: Over 250 illegal car races recorded
Stuttgart - Despite all the threatened penalties and court judgments, motorists continue to accelerate in countless illegal races on the roads of Baden-Wuerttemberg: Last year and in the first four months of this year, the police in the southwest have already registered more than 250 illegal car races.
There are no comparable figures for the years before, but the speeders are increasingly doing the judicial authorities work: A total of 155 investigations into illegal races were conducted at the public prosecutors' offices between Constance and Mannheim in 2018, one year later there were already 252 and 151 in the current year until the beginning of June.
The races were less about organized events, as can be seen from the response of the Ministry of the Interior to a request of the Landtag SPD.
In most cases, the drivers had spontaneously competed against each other or they had fled from the police - this is also reported as an illegal race.
The drivers were mainly German men between the ages of 18 and 60.
113 fines - imprisonment fifteen times
Only in comparatively few cases are the speeders caught and also asked to pay: According to the Ministry of the Interior, a total of 113 fines have been imposed since 2018 and 15 imprisonment sentences have been imposed.
However, there is no evidence that the number of illegal car races is actually increasing.
Rather, other motorists reacted more sensitively than before because of the numerous tragic accidents and processes of recent years and reported more frequently, said a ministry spokesman.
Especially popular with speeders is the Autobahn 8, where drivers repeatedly slow down the traffic to make room for themselves and use the free track for a race.
Last August, a dozen drivers were caught near Kirchheim unter Teck, three months earlier there were even 18 drivers on the A8 near Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular "racetrack"
On the A81, the police register even more races than on any other federal highway.
With a speed limit there is an attempt to slow down the speeders on the particularly affected section between Engen and Geisingen.
The mostly high-priced and pimped up sports and luxury cars often have Swiss license plates, because the drivers turn to Germany because of the high penalties for driving too fast and car racing in the neighboring country.
For the SPD, the speed limit must not be reduced to a few routes: "With a general speed limit of 130 kilometers per hour, we would get rid of this problem on motorways," says Martin Rivoir, the transport expert of the SPD parliamentary group.
"The inhibition threshold for speeders would be significantly higher if you were not allowed to travel legally here and there at 200 kilometers per hour or more."
Rivoir thinks less of education or image campaigns: "Those who flout all the rules in such a way and risk not only their own lives, but also the lives of other road users, can hardly be reached with reason".
ADAC calls for stronger police action
However, this is not enough for the ADAC: "We assume that speeders will not be deterred by the speed limits," says Holger Bach, Head of the Transport and Environment Department at the ADAC Wuerttemberg.
It calls for additional and tougher controls on the routes concerned.
Not infrequently, the high-speed test of strength turns into painful and momentous seriousness: Since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people have died in the races nationwide, two of them uninvolved in a nightly crash in Stuttgart's city center and one in Gerlingen.
Two young men are said to have competed in a car race there in November.
One of the vehicles came off the road, crashed into a garden wall and remained on the side, the 18-year-old passenger died.
21 other people were injured in the races of the past two years.
According to Interior Minister Thomas Strobl, however, tougher penalties are not necessary: "There is no need for legislative action to impose tougher sanctions on illegal motor vehicle races," says the Interior Ministry's paper.
July 23 Blue Light: Thirsty Burglar Steals Drinks from Snack Bar
Rohrdorf: A man broke into a snack bar in Rohrdorf (Calw district) on Thursday and stole drinks and cash.
A witness heard noises in the valley road around 3.40 a.m. and ran towards the snack bar.
There he noticed a man who served himself drinks at the fridge and then left the snack bar through a previously smashed front door.
The perpetrator fled towards the meadows behind the snack bar.
According to the police, the burglar also used a cash register and stole cash in the low three-digit range.
The suspect is described as follows: He is about 1.75 to 1.80 meters tall and of strong stature.
In fact, he wore a black hooded sweater, black trousers and bright shoes.
Further evidence is received by the police.
Ackermann sprints to victory on final stage at Sibiu Tour
Professional cyclist Pascal Ackermann has won his second day on the final stage of the 10th Sibiu Tour.
The 26-year-old Palatinate rider from the Bora-hansgrohe team prevailed in the mass sprint on the 109-kilometre-long section with start and finish in Sibiu, having already won a stage on Saturday.
It was the third and fourth season for Ackermann.
In the overall classification, his Austrian teammate Gregor Muehlberger prevailed.
The 26-year-old had confidently won the mountain time trial in the morning and thus took the lead in the classification.
Only 104 riders were left for the final stage in the evening.
No fewer than 18 starters had fallen victim to the time limit in the mountain time trial.
"I'm really happy to start the new season with a victory," Ackermann said after his success on Saturday.
"The sprint was really hectic," said the 26-year-old.
With 300 meters to go, he simply put on his sprint, "and it worked perfectly."
In accordance with the rules of the UCI, a corona test was carried out on all participants and their companions six days before the start of the race.
During the entire tour, the driver and attendant were separated from the organising team and the media in isolated hygiene bubbles.
Spectators at the start and finish were not allowed.
Control center gave instructions for lay resuscitation
Dusseldorf - Tragic accident on Sunday afternoon in Dusseldorf-Garath.
In an apartment building, a child (4) suddenly lay lifeless in the water while bathing.
According to the fire brigade, the emergency call was received shortly before 13: 00.
"A control center dispatcher immediately gave instructions for lay resuscitation," a fire brigade spokesman told BILD.
The rescuers arrived a little later and took over the resuscitation measures.
The child, who was in mortal danger, was transported to the university hospital under resuscitation.
Why it happened is unclear.
The police have routinely started investigating the accident.
The spokesman for the fire brigade: "We assume a tragic accident in the apartment".
Nuremberg: Unauthorized tuning meeting - police intervenes, 700 vehicles and about 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and at times over 1000 people took part in a "tuning meeting" on Saturday night in the parking lot of a furniture store.
The police carried out their announcement to intensify their control of such events.
A large tuning meeting took place on Saturday evening (25 July 2020) in Nuremberg's southern city.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the police of Middle Franconia, an increased volume of vehicles in the area of a large car park in Ingolstadt Street was detected by the Nuremberg traffic police at around 10.30 pm.
As a result, the police carried out a large number of vehicle inspections there.
Only recently, the police had announced that they wanted to step up their action against so-called autoposers.
Illegal tuning meeting in Nuremberg: Only a small part of the "scene"
The officers were among the top 700 vehicles and about 1100 people, according to the police.
However, only a small part of those present can be attributed to the "autoposer" and tuning scene.
Apparently, the majority of the relevant scene complied with the appeal of the police.
On the basis of the vehicles and people on site, it can be assumed that these were mainly onlookers.
In addition, the majority of those present adhered to the applicable infection protection regulations, in particular the observance of the minimum distance and the wearing of a mouth-nose protection.
The control measures carried out on site were completed at around 1: 00 a.m.
In total, the officials found such structural changes in 10 vehicles that the operating license had expired.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No car racing required
There were no illegal car races.
"The police headquarters in Middle Franconia will continue to keep an eye on what is happening and will continue to carry out intensified control measures, also in connection with the emergence of onlookers," it said.
The agency News5 spoke with Juergen Schroedinger from the towing company involved: "They all have beautiful rims, which we must not scratch," says Schroedinger.
Special tapes would be used for this purpose.
Also because the cars are wider, the company must be careful not to damage them.
"After all, the young people should get their cars back unscathed."
Figures from the Employment Agency: 900 suspected cases of abuse in short-time work
Berlin - The Federal Employment Agency (BA) is investigating around 900 suspected cases of abuse of short-time work allowance.
"This is extremely low for more than 880,000 companies that have reported short-time work," Daniel Terzenbach, the board member responsible for operations, told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.
When, at the beginning of the Corona crisis, a large number of companies suddenly applied for short-time work, the BA had to react quickly.
The examination usually takes up to three weeks.
"We didn't have that much time during this hot phase.
All the more closely we will look at the final accounts.
There will certainly be more to come.
We are not naive and have perseverance. "
Indications of abuse often come from the affected employees or trade unions.
In addition, the BA uses analysis software to identify patterns of abuse.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is preparing for a possible wave of insolvency in the autumn.
"Will there be significantly more insolvencies than in the previous year?
The assessments differ, but we are preparing ourselves in the event of a case and are already training our employees in the employment agencies to process applications for insolvency benefits. "
The figures are still inconspicuous, said Terzenbach.
World Heritage in Potsdam: Party in the New Garden dissolved
Potsdam - On Friday evening, about 40 young people celebrated a party in the New Garden.
The collection was dissolved at 8.48 p.m. by the drivers of the Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation (SPSG), the foundation informed on PNN request.
The young people then left the park.
On Saturday evening, some young people would have played rugby in the New Garden.
The meadow had been cleared by district drivers, said SPSG spokesman Frank Kallensee on Sunday.
There are always illegal celebrations in the parks
In the parks of the Foundation, there are always accumulations in which the distance and hygiene rules COVID-19 contact regulations are not observed.
At the end of June there was a celebration with about 300 people in the Babelsberg Park, a week later about 150 people celebrated in the New Garden.
Even without a corona regulation, the parks are closed at dusk.
Camping on the meadows is prohibited by park regulations, there are only a few exceptions.
The foundation has been complaining for a long time that visitors are leaving more and more garbage and destroying protected biotopes.
Meanwhile, illegal park parties have taken on a different dimension in Berlin.
On Sunday night 5000 people celebrated an illegal techno party in the Hasenheide in the district of Neukoelln.
The event was dissolved by the police.
Austria: Mass tests after corona outbreak in tourist resort
Authorities have responded to a corona outbreak in the popular Upper Austrian tourist resort of St. Wolfgang with hundreds of tests.
The number of confirmed cases rose to 48, as the state authorities in Linz announced.
More than 100 results were still pending in the evening.
According to this, many of the infected are young interns in tourism companies, but at least one holiday guest was tested positive.
Residents, guests and tourism staff were asked to stay in their accommodation on Saturday night.
The curfew was fixed at 11pm.
"There are cancellations and cancellations of bookings here and there," said the head of the Wolfgangsee Tourism Association, Hans Wieser, to the dpa.
Some of the guests also left early.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist resort in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 overnight stays last year.
In a normal season, about a third of the guests are Germans.
On Friday the first infections had become public knowledge.
The head of the district authority, Alois Lanz, defended the behaviour of the trainees on Saturday, who had celebrated in several restaurants and could have contracted the disease there.
"We all enjoyed doing this in our youth," he told the radio station Oe1.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The Tourism Board launched an information campaign to raise awareness among young employees of the dangers of COVID-19.
From Saturday onwards, hundreds of employees, holidaymakers and locals were tested.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang from 15 July were contacted.
The outbreak evokes memories of the Austrian ski and party resort of Ischgl in Tyrol, which was a center of corona spread throughout Europe in the early phase of the pandemic.
In total, more than 1500 people in Austria are currently infected with the virus.
The focus of the new infections is on Vienna and Upper Austria.
Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualified for Champions League
London (dpa) - English football record champions Manchester United return to the Champions League after a year's absence.
The Red Devils finished third in the Premier League with a 2-0 win over Leicester City.
The Foxes now have to be content with the Europa League, because Chelsea FC passed by and also qualified for the premier league in fourth place.
In the fight against relegation, Aston Villa was allowed to cheer.
Manchester United took the lead with a penalty kick from Bruno Fernandes (71st minute).
After a red card for Leicester City in injury time, Jesse Lingard (90th + 8) scored the final score.
Chelsea, in the Champions League round of 16 opponent of FC Bayern, won thanks to Mason Mount (45th + 1) and Olivier Giroud (45th + 4) in parallel with 2-0 (2-0) against Wolverhampton Wanderers.
"That means a lot to me," said coach Frank Lampard, who is also in the FA Cup final against Arsenal in his first season as Chelsea coach.
Chelsea's victory over Wolverhampton also benefited Tottenham Hotspur, who passed the Wolves 1-1 (1-0) at Crystal Palace and started sixth in the Europa League.
Aston Villa won the long-distance duel with Watford and AFC Bournemouth, but had to tremble at West Ham United for a long time for the class preservation.
The late lead of Jack Grealish (84.) immediately compensated Andrej Yarmolenko (85.).
However, the 1: 1 (0: 0) was sufficient because Watford lost against Arsenal with 2: 3 (1: 3).
The club, which had three coaches in the season, was relegated after five years in the first division.
Just like Bournemouth, who could not save themselves by a 3-1 (2-1) at Everton FC.
In the end, one point was missing.
Liverpool, who have been English champions since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3-1 (1-1) victory at Newcastle United.
99 points is the highest score the Reds have ever scored in a football season.
Coach Juergen Klopp and his team narrowly missed the point record in English football.
Manchester City holds the record with 100 points during the 2017 / 18 season.
After the Newcastle lead in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38th), Divock Origi (59th) and Sadio Man (89th) turned the game on Sunday for Liverpool.
"It was an extraordinary season for this wonderful club," said goalscorer van Dijk after the match, "which should spur us on to defend the title.
It will be difficult ".
The Premier League bosses are also likely to be satisfied in the end.
Due to the coronavirus crisis, football operations in England were suspended from 13 March to 17 June.
In the meantime, there has even been discussion about a premature termination or the remaining matches being played on neutral ground.
In the end, however, the season could be played without any special incidents - but as in Germany without spectators in the stadiums.
Arrests and violence at demonstrations against Netanyahu
The protests in Israel against Netanyahu's head of government are becoming increasingly fierce.
During the night there were violent clashes.
On the night of Sunday in Jerusalem, the Israeli police took violent action against participants in a demonstration against right-wing conservative Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Twelve people were arrested for participating in riots, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said.
Among other things, the police used water cannons to disperse the rally.
According to media reports, a total of around 6,000 people had gathered near Netanyahu's office on Saturday evening.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu's handling of the Corona crisis.
The protesters beat drums, blew horns and called on Netanyahu to resign.
Participants in a counter-demonstration supporting Netanyahu were also detained, the news site "ynet" reported.
People also demonstrated in many other places in Israel, including in front of the head of government's private villa in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
According to police, a man was arrested near Tel Aviv on suspicion of having sprayed pepper spray on demonstrators on the roadside from a moving car.
Another man was arrested after a stabbing attack on a demonstrator in the south of the country.
The demonstrator was slightly injured in the neck.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv there have recently been several demonstrations against Netanyahu.
The rallies accompany the corruption process against the head of government.
Recently, Netanyahu has also been criticized for his handling of the Corona crisis.
Among other things, he is accused of premature easing and a lack of preparation for a second corona wave.
The Corona crisis has hit the country's economy hard.
The unemployment rate recently stood at more than 20 percent.
The number of new infections with the coronavirus in Israel has recently risen to record levels.
Accident at Ahlen (North Rhine-Westphalia) - Transporter crashes on car - nine injured - Ruhrgebiet - Bild.de
Ahlen - A rear-end collision on Saturday afternoon on the B58 near Ahlen caused nine minor injuries.
A female driver was driving with her two children (3, 5) towards Beckum.
The police: "Presumably she had suddenly slowed down because she wanted to turn".
The driver of a Mercedes van, who was driving behind her, must have seen this too late.
He crashed into the back of the car.
Three occupants in the car and six in the van were slightly injured in the accident.
Several ambulances took her to a nearby hospital.
North Korea seals off border town after Corona-suspected case
North Korea has so far seen its own measures to combat the coronavirus as a "shining success".
Now the country is reporting on a suspected case for the first time.
Because of a first official corona suspicion in the country, North Korea has completely sealed off a large city for fear of a catastrophe.
Despite the most stringent epidemiological defenses in the past six months, "the malignant virus may have been introduced into the country," the state media reported.
A state of emergency has been declared for the region around the border town of Kaesong.
The Communist leadership declared the highest level of alarm.
If confirmed, it would be the first official case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the isolated country.
North Korea claims not to have registered a single infection and described its defenses as a "shining success."
The information was questioned abroad.
The disease symptoms were reportedly found in an "outlier" who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on July 19.
The person fled to South Korea three years ago and has now returned across the border.
For the border crossing within the four kilometers wide and mostly still mined military buffer zone, there was initially no confirmation from South Korea.
However, according to reports by the national news agency Yonhap, South Korea's military admitted the possibility of an illegal border crossing to North Korea as high.
There have been investigations into some of them.
North Korea called an emergency meeting of the Labor Party Politburo, chaired by Kim Jong Un, on Saturday on suspicion.
The "dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive catastrophe".
Kim had already ordered on Friday as a preventive measure "to completely block Kaesong and isolate each district and the region from others," it continued.
The person concerned, as well as all people in Kaesong who had had contact with her, had been placed under quarantine.
The central military commission of the party should investigate the "breakaway case" as well as the behavior of the responsible military unit and, if necessary, impose severe punishment.
It is estimated that there are approximately 300,000 people living in Kaesong.
Tension ahead of Council meeting: City-east and noise abatement still to be discussed before summer break
"In addition to environmental issues, the committee members will also vote on the development plan for the major project inner-city development east," it says rather casually in the middle part of the city press release for the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, July 28, at 4.30 pm in the main hall of the CongressCentrum Pforzheim.
Above all, however, the upgrading of the eastern city is controversially discussed until the end.
The majorities in favour of it are scarce, most recently even rejecting it in individual committees, depending on their attendance.
Reinhard Klein criticized an appeal from the economy (construction, real estate, trade and IT) not to let the project developed by the citizenry and then by the administration and the local council now fail after almost ten years of preparation as "extra-parliamentary opposition", "unsuspecting", "speculation", "denigration" and "deliberate false statements".
"Everyone thinks they know better," says Klein, who has been the only representative of the Pforzheim Citizens' List on the municipal council for a year.
In fact, after reading the Treaties, he was in this position: "I know what I am talking about".
The exit would be cheaper for the city, the Technical City Hall is contrary to statements of the city administration after subsidies, of the existence of which Klein is convinced to rehabilitate for 8.5 million euros.
The city will develop in a completely different way than predicted in the town hall and by supporters from the economy.
One day after Klein, the FDP / FW / UB / LED faction, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
Essentially, it also provides for the renovation of the Technical Town Hall, the keeping open of the Schlossberg, the leasing of the former valley for administrative space and a more small-scale inner city redevelopment, ideally with local sponsors.
Environmental issues play a central role
In addition, environmental issues will play a central role.
Among other things, the municipal council will vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the population of Pforzheim from health noise pollution caused by road traffic, including many speed reductions.
In a press release, the local transport club Germany welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30. However, the political leaders in the city are not innocent of the fact that this must happen, because they have only contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus noise by neglecting regular bus traffic with thinned out cycles and by little commitment to cycling, according to the VCD.
The municipal council also votes on the participation of the city of the Energy and Climate Protection Agency Pforzheim / Enzkreis.
In addition, the agenda includes accession to the Baden-Wuerttemberg Climate Protection Pact, the reassessment of parental contributions in the municipal daycare facilities and the application for admission to the federal government's Smart City funding.
Citizens are welcome, but must heed corona protection measures.
Tim Zimmermann starts the new season with a lot of delay
Tim Zimmermann will start his debut season in the ADAC GT Masters on 31 July with a delay of almost half a year.
Before the league of super sports cars can start regular operation, the first test runs have now been scheduled.
For Zimmermann, it was all about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3 better.
For a long time, the Corona crisis prevented Tim Zimmermann from tackling his first official race in the new Lamborghini Huracan of Grasser Racing.
This was now possible under special hygiene conditions.
The 23-year-old from Langenargen completed his first laps at the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his debut in the GT3 car.
"There are already a few things that are different from the Porsche from the previous season," says Zimmermann.
"With ABS, for example, you have to go into corners differently.
But it was really great fun. "
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite his only 25 years of experience in GT racing, the Dutchman has been able to help his new teammate in many things.
"I'm not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series brings with it new challenges," says Zimmermann.
"Steijn and I get along brilliantly and we have also made enormous progress from session to session at the Lausitzring."
Right there - at the Lausitzring - the GT Masters will also hold its first race.
From 31 July, the 33 supercars will race through Lusatia.
Zimmermann, who is one of 15 newcomers to the series, knows the track.
In 2015 he was most recently guest at the Motodrom.
"It worked quickly and I didn't have to get used to the track much," says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafen racing community Graf Zeppelin.
"The Lausitzring has many fast passages that you have to hit optimally to be fast".
How fast Zimmermann really is then turns out in two weeks.
"Of course, the teams play poker a little during the tests," he says.
"In the end, however, we are very satisfied and look forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring".
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a crowded calendar.
Seven races are scheduled until the beginning of November.
The current state is that no spectators will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
In mid-August, former Formula One driver Niko Huelkenberg will take over the GT steering wheel.
British Transport Minister cold-caught by quarantine decision
The British government's decision to quarantine holidaymakers in Spain for two weeks after their return has, according to press reports, caught the country's transport minister off guard.
According to this, Grant Shapps is currently on holiday in Spain, of all places, while his colleagues at home decided on the measure on Saturday.
Due to the increase in corona numbers in Spain, the cabinet in London removed the country from the list of countries from which entry without quarantine conditions is possible.
The new regulation will apply from today, Sunday, so Shapps will also have to be quarantined after his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures on returnees.
But for those who are only on holiday on the cut-off date, the scheme will only apply from Saturday, 1 August, and was not introduced overnight.
Spain, by the way, is one of the "safe countries" in Austria for which no quarantine is required.
"Many ministers may have known in advance that there is a possibility that a quarantine will be imposed on holidaymakers in Spain", commented Labour MEP Diane Abbot.
"But apparently no one bothered to tell Grant Shapps."
Less than a month after the end of the corona emergency in Spain and the end of the strict curfew, the number of infections in the country is rising again.
Virologists mainly blame the nightlife for the new spread.
Spain is one of the British people's favourite holiday destinations.
The British government is currently advising against unnecessary travel to mainland Spain, with the exception of the Canary Islands and Balearic Islands, which are particularly popular with British holidaymakers.
So far, more than 272,000 infections with the novel coronavirus and more than 28,000 deaths have been registered in Spain.
Russia: Navy Day: Putin announces hypersonic weapons for warships
Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced on the occasion of Naval Day in his country that warships will be equipped with the most modern hypersonic weapons.
These weapons, which are unique in the world, would expand the combat capabilities of the Russian naval forces, Putin said on Sunday in St. Petersburg at the central naval parade.
According to Interfax, the Ministry of Defense also informed about successful tests of the Zirkon hypersonic missile built for the navy.
The hypersonic weapons have a multiple of the speed of sound of about 343 meters per second.
They are considered weapons of the future.
Underwater tropedeo is still being built
The nuclear submarine torpedo Poseidon will continue to be built, it was said.
The planned sea drone is planned to destroy coastal targets.
The president, who himself also drove a military boat, said that this year alone 40 new ships would be put into service with the individual fleet units of the largest country in the world.
Russia has such a large coastal area as no other country in the world.
For 300 years, the navy has reliably protected Russia, Putin said on the day celebrated by sailors nationwide.
At many other Russian coastal towns, the naval forces also celebrated the Day of the Navy with parades.
In Syria, where Russia is fighting alongside ruler Bashar al-Assad, the military demonstrated strength at an arms show in the Mediterranean port of Tartu.
Ammunition was also fired.
A video released by the Ministry of Defence showed not only warships, including a submarine, but also combat helicopters and jets.
Hurricane "Hanna" reaches Texas: Help because of Corona more difficult
Washington - The first hurricane of this year's season over the Atlantic has hit land in Texas.
Life-threatening floods, strong winds and heavy rainfall are now threatening parts of the US state, the National Hurricane Center told the US climate agency NOAA on the night of Sunday (local time).
Governor Greg Abbott declared a state of emergency for many districts.
The corona pandemic raging in Texas is making the work of aid workers more difficult, Abbott said, according to US media.
Evacuees called for caution
"Every hurricane is a huge challenge," Abbott said according to the Houston Chronicle.
With regard to the hurricane in Texas, he added, "This challenge is complicated and exacerbated when you consider that it is sweeping through an area that is the most COVID-19 affected area in the state."
According to Johns Hopkins University, around 5,000 people have died in Texas alone as a result of the corona pandemic.
Abbott called on people who had to leave their homes to be careful.
They should not disregard practices "to which we have become accustomed," such as wearing masks, the governor said, according to CBS.
It was important that everyone kept their distance.
Therefore, hotel rooms have also been provided in some places.
In addition, tests should be carried out in emergency shelters on Corona.
Damage was initially reported only from the coastal town of Port Mansfield.
Storm warning withdrawn again
With wind speeds of up to 150 kilometers per hour, "Hanna" was hit on land on the island of Padre Island just off the Texas coast, according to the authorities.
The storm had previously been upgraded to a low-level hurricane.
For the coastal section from Port Mansfield to Sargent, a storm surge warning had been issued and later withdrawn.
Authorities expected a weakening, while "Hanna" moved further inland and headed for northeastern Mexico.
"Douglas" is moving towards Hawaii
In the Pacific, Hurricane Douglas was on its way to Hawaii during the night on Sunday with wind speeds of around 150 kilometers per hour.
However, the hurricane center expected it to weaken further.
According to the forecast, it will be near Hawaii's largest islands on Sunday (local time) - then as a storm just below the hurricane threshold.
According to a forecast from May, NOAA expected an above-average hurricane season over the Atlantic this year.
From June to the end of November, up to ten hurricanes can be expected, of which up to six could become very strong hurricanes, the authority had explained.
On average, there are six hurricanes per year over the Atlantic, three of which develop into storms of great strength.
In view of available climate data and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, the probability of a normal season was only 30 percent, and that of a below-average even only 10 percent, it was said at the time.
Us President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that his administration is closely monitoring the storms and is in contact with the affected states.
Four goals stripped: Video assistant "punished" Sassuolo
Sassuolos Filip Djuricic were stripped of two goals
Naples - Four goals scored, four goals deprived: Sassuolo Calcio experienced a pitch-black evening at the 0-2 (0-1) SSC Naples in the Italian football league Serie A - and was really angry at the video assistant of the referee.
"A festival of ungiven gates for Sassuolo.
Never before has the VAR acted so hard against a team, "commented the" Corriere dello Sport ".
Host Naples had taken the lead in the 8th minute with a goal from defender Elseid Hisaj, while Filip Djuricic cheered for the equalizer in the 32nd minute.
The Video Assistant Referee (VAR) withdrew the goal due to an offside position.
Five minutes later, Djuricic kicked the ball back into the net - again the VAR intervened.
The goals of attackers Francesco Caputo (50th) and Domenico Berardi (61st) were also withdrawn by the referee team according to the advice of the UAR.
In injury time, Allan made the 2-0 final score for Naples and the bitter evening for Sassuolo perfect.
"The VAR is worse for Sassuolo than a radar trap on the road and punishes Sassuolo like no other team before.
The new technology sets new records, "writes the" Gazzetta dello Sport ".
FC Bayern Munich: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start of the hot preparation phase for the Champions League began with a setback for Doublesieger FC Bayern.
Hansi Flick, who recovered "reasonably well" after a short holiday and a few days of training, has to think about how he can rebuild his successful defense after the injury of world champion Benjamin Pavard.
The Frenchman, who has the third most minutes behind captain Manuel Neuer and midfielder Joshua Kimmich, suffered a ligament injury at the left foot and threatens to be absent in decisive royal class duels.
In Munich's dirty weather, the right-back broke off a training game and was driven off the course with a golf kart.
How long the unrestricted regular player has to pause in the fight for the title remains to be seen.
An appearance in the second leg of the round of 16 against Chelsea FC on 8 August should be difficult, the 24-year-old can hope for the final tournament starting on 12 August in Lisbon.
However, the Bavarians do not want to be stopped by the mishap from the training on Sunday.
In his personal triple formula, Flick named the three attributes he wants to see from his stars on their way to Portugal's capital.
Quality, intensity and concentration are to show his victorious title collectors in the ideally following 28 days until the king class final on 23 August.
"We have mastered the compulsory tasks with championship and trophy simply outstanding.
Now we need to create something special, "said Flick.
Until the Munichers can deal with the final tournament and before a training camp in the Algarve, but first of all the eighth final duty against Chelsea FC.
After the 3-0 in the first leg before the Corona break, the Londoners should not become a Bayern nightmare again in their home arena as in the lost "Finale dahoam" 2012.
"We have to go through the door first.
We want to win, create good conditions and recharge our batteries with a good game, "demanded Flick.
A test for attunement is scheduled on Friday against Olympique Marseille.
With a long speech, Flick had sworn his stars, who had 13 days vacation after the double, to a unique August.
He greeted 31 players on Sabre Street, including the new players around high-end shopping Leroy San, who met all new colleagues on the field for the first time after his move from Manchester City.
"Leroy, like all the newcomers, fitted in well," Flick reported.
But instead of talking about the new season, when Sanguine & Co. are no longer only allowed to train, Flick preferred to talk about the current title project of the German series champion.
After days of individual and small group training, the team is now training for the Londoners, who, in contrast to the Flick ensemble, are in the rhythm of the game.
After that Munich could face a quarter-final against FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, in the semi-finals Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin are possible opponents.
A way to the final in Lisbon "is not that easy," stressed the head coach, who can rely on the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training from Tuesday onwards.
The World Cup record scorer Klose and Flick know from many a joint tournament preparation, what is particularly important in the 0-on-100 attunement.
With his current team, working is "a pleasure," praised Flick.
The "focus on winning" is an impressive trait of his team.
The tournament with nine teams was also ambitious on Sunday.
All of the top performers were there, including Thiago and defender David Alaba, whose whereabouts are not certain beyond the premier league season.
Formula 1 needs a special rule to choose its world champion.
Since it is not possible to drive on the required number of continents, the FIA has to improvise in order to award the World Championship titles.
All races in the United States were cancelled.
Race calendar is becoming more and more concrete
The racing calendar for the current Formula 1 season continues to take shape.
In addition to the ten confirmed Grand Prix so far, three other race tracks were added during the week.
In October it will be driven at the Nuerburgring in Germany and in the Portuguese Portimo.
On the first of November, Lewis Hamilton and Co. will fight for World Championship points at the traditional Italian race track in Imola.
This means that the 2020 race calendar currently comprises 13 rounds.
"We are pleased to continue to make great progress in finalizing our plans for the 2020 season," said Formula One boss Chase Carey.
A total of 15 to 18 races in the premier class of motorsport are to be completed in this extraordinary season.
Formula 1 wants to conclude its season in Asia.
The final race calendar is to be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
Before the already officially planned races in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December, media reports suggest that appearances in Vietnam and Malaysia could take place at the end of November.
Regulations require races on three continents
However, the Formula 1 regulations require at least races on three continents for the allocation of the World Championship.
Even if, as currently planned, only two continents will be driven, there is to be a world champion.
With the help of a special rule, the FIA wants to award the titles on the basis of "exceptional circumstances" due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The traditional start of the season in Australia in March had to be cancelled at short notice due to the looming corona crisis.
A return to the continent later this year is not an issue.
In addition, Formula 1 will not be visiting America this year.
Cancellation met with criticism in Brazil
Due to the tense corona situation, the races will not take place in Canada, the USA, Mexico and Brazil.
"We look forward to being with them again next season," Carey said.
The cancellation of the America races was met with criticism, especially in Brazil: "The cancellation did not come as a surprise to us, but we cannot accept the reasons for it," said Tamas Rohonyi, promoter of the Grand Prix in SSojourn o Paulo.
For example, the number of infections in the So Paulo area is significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
In addition, the concerns of some teams not wanting to drive in Brazil would not justify a rejection.
Be prepared for the required security measures.
Greta Thunberg: Evil eye against Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest on Stephen Colbert's famous late-night show via video and revealed in an interview what she had in mind when she met Donald Trump.
Klimaatkivistin Greta Thunberg was a guest on a popular US late-night show via video.
Among other things, she talked about her fight against the powerful of the world.
The teenager also talked about her famous "evil eye" when she met Donald Trump.
New York City - Over the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has attracted attention with her tireless commitment to the "Fridays For Future" movement.
Now she spoke in a well-known late-night show about her plans for the future as well as her meeting with US President Donald Trump at the UN climate summit last year.
Latenight presenter Stephen Colbert welcomed 17-year-old Thunberg to your show on Tuesday and conducted a lengthy interview with the Swede.
She spoke not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the powerful of the world.
"There are some things that surprised me," she said.
"How far people are going to shift the focus away from the climate crisis," she said.
"Everything from organized hate campaigns to threats just because a group of children take to the streets," she said.
She finds heads of state and leading politicians who mock her on social media or even try to silence her "funny" because they show her the reactions "because they have no other answer".
It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was asked about a well-known scene in which she cast a bitter look after US President Trump.
At the UN Climate Summit 2019 in New York, for which the Aktvistin sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive gaze was caught by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
The short clip turned into a GIF, an animated image that eventually became one of the most widely used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think about the US president at that moment?
To Stephen Colbert's relatively open question, she only answered briefly and dryly: "To be honest, I don't think that needs any further explanation."
The experienced satirist Colbert had probably not expected the quick-witted answer and disappeared from the picture laughing briefly.
With her "How dare you?" Speech on the principles of climate protection, she was remembered by many at the climate conference.
Ex-Dortmunder Immobile with three-pack for Lazio Rome
Ciro Immobile is now on par with Bavaria's Robert Lewandowski in the race for Europe's Golden Shoe.
The former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile still has the best chance of becoming the top scorer in the Italian football championship.
The former BVB professional contributed three goals to the 5-1 (1-1) victory of Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona, including two converted penalties in the injury times of both halves.
This means that the 30-year-old from fourth in the standings now has 34 goals on his account before the end of the season - just as many scored Robert Lewandowski from FC Bayern Munich in the past Bundesliga season.
In Italy Cristiano Ronaldo follows with 30 goals so far, the Portuguese superstar met with the leader in the evening on Sampdoria Genoa.
Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green passed away
His life was like a rollercoaster ride: After a rapid ascent with Fleetwood Mac, it went steeply downhill and then slowly up again.
Now blues rock guitarist Peter Green has died at the age of 73.
Brilliant guitarist, drug junkie, cult fan: The co-founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully in his sleep at the age of 73, family members said in an official statement on Saturday that another statement would be announced for the next few days.
Top musicians such as Peter Frampton praised Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional reaction of a "monumental loss" for all past and present members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
Drummer Fleetwood and guitarist Green had founded the now legendary band in 1967 in London, and his dreamy instrumental hit "Albatross" is still unforgotten today.
The musician's life ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") resembled a roller coaster ride.
With Fleetwood Mac Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated their greatest successes but then without him.
Among other things, there was a dispute because Green wanted to donate all the profits of the group to charity.
He began to perform in wide robes and with a large crucifix.
Mental health problems also played a role.
Three years after its formation, Green left the band in 1970.
This was followed by a social decline.
The blues rock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, as biographers reported.
For a long time, Green was treated in psychiatry.
During most of the 1970s, the musician disappeared from the scene.
He is said to have lived temporarily on the street, worked as a cemetery gardener and spent some time in an Israeli kibbutz.
Green was born in 1946 to a Jewish working-class family in Bethnal Green, London.
At a young age, he became enthusiastic about American blues musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At the age of eleven, he learned to play the guitar.
At the age of 15, the teenager began playing guitar professionally and five years later got the chance to be on stage as lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners.
Shortly afterwards, he was hired as a replacement for his idol Eric Clapton with the Bluesbreakers.
In the midst of the blues boom, Green formed Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967 with his Bluesbreakers colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross", composed by Green, gave the group their first number one hit in the winter of 1968 / 69 and catapulted them to the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid rise soon showed its downsides: Green could not cope with the media hype, his experiments with the drug LSD became more and more extreme.
He later commented on life between music and addiction in an interview: "The worst thing that has happened to me in life is drugs - the best thing was to land a number one hit".
Towards the end of the decade, Green surprisingly achieved a respectable success in 1979 with an album inspired by religious themes.
Fleetwood Mac, meanwhile, swam without him in a new formation on a wave of success.
Their 1977 album "Rumours" sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Despite several minor solo successes, Green did not make a major comeback until 1996, when he rejoined a group of fellow musicians.
