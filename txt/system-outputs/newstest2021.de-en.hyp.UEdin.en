Biker reacts lightning fast and prevents worse
On Friday evening, a traffic accident occurred on the country road between Machtolsheim and Merklingen, in which a motorcyclist was only slightly injured thanks to his quick reaction.
Car driver overlooks bikers
A 44-year-old driver wanted to turn left onto Landesstraße 1230 in the direction of Machtolsheim with her VW from Merklingen at around 9.30 pm.
She overlooked the 24 year old motorcycle driver coming from the direction of Nellingen.
Hand and foot brake levers fly away in the collision
The biker still tried to avoid the car, but still touched it at the rear of the vehicle.
Due to the grazing process, the hand and foot brake levers on the Suzuki were torn off and the driver was no longer able to brake.
Mindfully, he steered his motorcycle in the green stiffeners next to the road and let it roll out there without falling.
Biker suffers leg injury
However, due to the collision with the car, the biker suffered an injury and had to be treated in a clinic.
Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 harvesters infected
After a mass coronavirus infection on a large vegetable farm in Mamming, Lower Bavaria, almost 500 people are under quarantine and are no longer allowed to leave the farm.
A security service monitors the ban on going out.
A total of 174 harvest workers were tested positive for the Sars-CoV-2 coronavirus during the series investigation, as the Dingolfing-Landau district office announced on Saturday evening.
"In order to avoid further expansion, we unfortunately have to take this step to protect the population," explained District Administrator Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Previously, seven employees had already become infected in the company - this was the reason for the series test.
The farm is a large vegetable farm, which grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and beetroot - but the cucumbers only for inlay glasses.
Mamming is a rural community with about 3300 inhabitants not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW plant.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to keep calm: "According to our information, this is a closed circle of people."
On the farm, infected people were separated from non-infected employees, and the site is now surrounded by a barrier fence.
The Greens and SPD gave the state government co-responsibility.
The two opposition factions accused Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet of neglecting to control the accommodation of seasonal workers.
"This can be a bitter revenge if such local infection events take place and regional lockdowns have to be ordered," said Jürgen Mistol, the parliamentary managing director of the Greens.
The SPD takes a similar view: "After the coronavirus outbreak in the Wiesenhof slaughterhouse in mid-May, we have already called for a special control programme for farms with harvest helpers," said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
"In our view, the hygiene conditions at the workplace and the living conditions in particular must be strictly controlled.
That obviously didn't happen."
The outbreak had come "with announcement".
Aidenbachstraße underground station: Dangerous dispute: 19-year-old falls into the track bed after Schubser
In a dispute between two youth groups at Aidenbachstraße underground station, a 19-year-old fell through a pusher and slipped into the track bed.
Obersendling - On Friday there was a dispute between two youth groups at the Aidenbachstraße underground station at around 4.15 pm.
A passer-by alerted the police, who arrived with several stripes.
According to initial investigations, a Munich resident (17) pushed a 19-year-old to the ground.
The young man slid over the platform edge and fell into the track bed.
People from the 17-year-old's group helped the victim to climb out of the track.
There was no danger from an incoming train.
According to the police, there were again clashes between the two people.
The 17-year-old initially fled the scene, but his personal details could be determined afterwards.
Accompanied by his father, he went to the police inspection 29.
The 17-year-old is being investigated for assault.
Report: Seehofer pushes for longer data retention
Data retention is currently suspended.
According to a media report, however, Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer is calling for an extension of the storage period.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
According to a media report, Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer (CSU) is calling for extended data retention - instead of the planned ten weeks, half a year.
As the "Bild am Sonntag" reports, Seehofer asked Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht (SPD) in a letter for a quick change in the law.
Seehofer therefore wants to strengthen the measures against child abuse.
He believes it makes sense to "make urgently needed adjustments to the law already now," the newspaper quotes from the letter.
Data retention is currently suspended.
A decision of the ECJ is expected.
Seehofer, however, wants the changes beforehand so that they can be applied immediately after a possible positive judgment, the report continues.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice told the newspaper that it could only be meaningfully examined whether legal adjustments were necessary once the courts had decided.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer, together with the interior ministers of the federal states, had already advocated data retention in June.
NBA: Strip club trouble for Clippers star Lou Williams
Excitement in the NBA!
Lou Williams (33), basketball pro for the Los Angeles Clippers, is said to have left the tournament quarters at Disney World in Orlando/Florida with permission for a funeral.
According to US media reports, he still visited the strip club "Magic City" in Atlanta in the evening.
Williams, who is said to have admitted the visit according to ESPN, is back in Isloation, being tested daily for COVID-19.
His reason for visiting: Chicken Wings.
In February last year, "Sweet Lou", as he is called in the NBA, has already expressed his love for exactly these Wings.
The American wrote: "Magic City and Blue Flame (another strip club in Atlanta) have the best wings in town."
NBA insider Shams Charania announced on Twitter on Sunday that the NBA has imposed a ten-day quarantine on Williams.
The Clippers star thus misses the first two official games after the test match phase.
The NBA wants to play the corona season at Disney World.
Currently, the top 22 teams are preparing for the season finale, which starts on Friday night.
Söder comments on coronavirus situation after mass infection
Munich - Health Minister Melanie Huml (CSU) has already announced a test offensive for large farms on Sunday.
The press conference will be shown live on our homepage.
The case in Mamming in the district of Dingolfing-Landau has alarmed authorities and politicians.
Almost 500 harvest workers from several countries are currently working on the large vegetable farm, and more than a third have become infected with the coronavirus.
The farm is now under quarantine and is closed off with a construction fence.
Nobody is allowed to leave the premises, food is delivered.
The authorities are now offering free coronavirus tests to the more than 3,300 residents of the municipality.
Since the harvest workers had little contact with the local population, the district office assumes that the infections have not spread beyond the farm.
"Conscience bites": confession of the alleged arsonist of Nantes
"My client has been cooperative," lawyer Quentin Chabert told the newspaper.
The defense attorney added, "He very much regrets the deeds, the confession was a liberation for him."
His mandate was "plagued by remorse and greatly affected by the extent of the destruction."
If convicted, the man faces ten years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros, according to prosecutors.
The Gothic Saint Peter and Paul Cathedral in Nantes was severely damaged in a fire during the night on Saturday last week.
The fire had broken out in three distant places in the church.
Laboratory tests confirmed the suspicion of arson.
The now detained suspect had already been arrested a few hours after the fire.
He was released after a day.
The man works as a volunteer for the diocese of Nantes and was responsible for the closure of the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
Since there was no trace of a violent intrusion into the church, he quickly came into the eyes of the investigators.
Discussing the abolition of the 50+1 rule
Former DFB President Reinhard Grindel has recommended thinking about abolishing the 50+1 rule.
"German football should at least discuss setting conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates a fait accompli," Grindel told Bild am Sonntag.
He stressed: "For the clubs that are most likely to become dangerous for Bayern and Dortmund, the 50+1 rules do not work anyway: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, there is no getting around the debate as to whether it is not necessary to make it easier for associations that want to break into this phalanx to involve investors."
However, he has doubts whether there is a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority participation, which is prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50+1 rule.
"It remains a legal risk to draw investment fences around the business location Bundesliga in a European single market," said Grindel.
The former DFB boss sees the danger that "attempts to ensure more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but will not lead to more excitement in the championship."
Even an equal distribution of TV money will not have a decisive effect.
"FC Bayern has a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund 500 million and RB Leipzig 300 million.
The differences are therefore already immense among the first three clubs alone.
The other 15 clubs have an average budget of 130 million," explained the 58-year-old.
Looking at the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Unfortunately, there have been people who have noticed this mistake and pierced the press instead of talking to me about it," Grindel said of the acceptance of an expensive watch that led to his resignation in April 2019.
"That has already occupied me very much in human terms."
He had received the gift, worth around 11,000 euros, from a Ukrainian official.
"I committed a compliance violation, and it was right to draw the consequences from it," Grindel said.
"I handled the ominous watch gift completely transparently and unsuspectingly.
Many in the DFB knew about it."
He never "made a secret of the gift," assured the 58-year-old.
"This may be called naive, at least this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption."
"Black Lives Matter": Injured and one dead
Protests against police violence in the United States have come to a head again with Donald Trump's use of federal police in several cities.
On Saturday, there were clashes between demonstrators and police in various cities.
Three people were injured in Louisville and 16 people were arrested in Seattle.
In Austin, one person was killed by gunfire while a demonstration train was crossing an intersection.
Previously, there had been clashes in Portland during protests against racism and police violence.
The security forces, including federal police officers, used tear gas and violently dispersed demonstrators on the night of Saturday.
Hundreds of demonstrators, some armed, marched through Louisville in Kentucky on Saturday, demanding that those responsible for the death of Breonna Taylor be held accountable.
The 26-year-old student was shot dead in March during a drug raid on her apartment in Louisville.
The target of the raid was someone else who did not live there, and no drugs were found.
Three people were injured when a member of a group that describes itself as an armed alliance of black Americans fired a shot on Saturday.
According to NBC, they were taken to the hospital.
None of them were in mortal danger.
The police set up barricades because counter-demonstrators from a white militia had also formed.
In the end, the two groups did not meet.
In Austin, Texas, one person was shot and died during a "Black Lives Matter" demonstration.
According to the police, a suspect was taken into custody.
She has not yet given any further details on the circumstances of the offence.
Mayor Steve Adler, according to the New York Times, said he, like many in the city, was "inconsolable and stunned" by what had happened.
Protesters also clashed with police in the American metropolis of Seattle on Saturday.
They set fire to construction vehicles in front of a youth prison, and the police used flash grenades and pepper spray.
According to the Seattle Times, 16 people were arrested for resisting police officers or assault.
In the city of Oakland, California, a courthouse was set on fire.
A small group of demonstrators smashed windows, shot fireworks and blinded police officers with lasers, Oakland police said late on Saturday night (local time).
The fire was quickly extinguished.
In Aurora, a suburb of Denver, Colorado, a car drove through a crowd demonstrating on a highway.
According to the police, one of the demonstrators fired a gun and at least one person was taken to the hospital injured.
In addition, windows were also smashed in a court and a fire was set, according to the police.
Investigations have been started.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historical costumes defy Corona
Although the big snack was missing in the spa town, visitors and performers enjoyed the Rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, performers and organizers: the Rakoczy weekend without the Rakoczy festival.
But even if the big party mile in the city center was missing, the crowds and program highlights such as Saale burning, Rakoczy ball or parade, many got their money's worth with the corona-compliant alternative program.
"I think we have succeeded in spreading Rakoczy flair," says spa director Sylvie Thormann.
The guests would have accepted it well.
In principle, one returns to the beginnings of the Rakoczy festival, when only the historical ones were in the focus of the festival.
Pleasant atmosphere
Vesna Konhäuser has been visiting Bad Kissingen with her husband for more than 25 years.
This is also the case this time in the Corona year.
The couple has made themselves comfortable at the Luitpold casino, watches the historical while strolling and listens to the Cuban live music at the casino restaurant.
"I also find it very pleasant," says Konhäuser.
She does not miss the crowds that otherwise belong to Rakoczy.
But it lacks the usual program highlights, above all Saale burns on Friday evening as well as the historic procession and the final fireworks on Sunday evening.
"That's a pity.
The weather would have been great this year," she says.
Rakoczy riding tournament to take place again
For the performers of the historic spa guests, the alternative program partly meant more work.
For example, for Christina Gold, who participates in the procession in a normal year and can be seen there on the carriage of the Kurgartencafé.
This year she was walking in the city on Saturdays and Sundays in costume.
"It's more strenuous, otherwise it's easier," she says.
The riding club had less to do, even if individual riders were out and about in the park.
"We very much hope that the riding quadrille can take place again next year," says chairwoman Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that after a break of several years, a Rakoczy riding tournament will take place again in 2021.
28 corona cases in Spanish second division Fuenlabrada
The Spanish football second division CF Fuenlabrada is sliding deeper and deeper into crisis due to a coronavirus outbreak.
Since the newcomer from the vicinity of Madrid had flown to the city of A Coruna for a match on 20 July despite the first cases of coronavirus, one low blow has followed the next.
By Sunday, 28 players or team members had tested positive, and one was hospitalized, the club announced.
Fuenlabrada from the city of the same name south-west of Madrid still had the chance to reach the promotion playoffs.
Now even the relegation to the B group of the second league threatens.
Last Monday's match against Deportivo La Coruna was cancelled at the last moment, the public prosecutor's office is investigating a possible crime against public health, the supreme sports authority CSD is considering the forced relegation of the club.
The players and other team members are quarantined in a hotel.
"Until the sixth day of quarantine, they did not receive a fresh towel or gel," wrote the sports newspaper "AS".
The photos show players hanging underwear and club clothes in their rooms in the hotel to dry after they apparently had to wash them themselves.
The bed linen was not changed for five days.
Another problem is the food.
"AS" wrote that it was neither good nor sufficient.
The club management, however, said that they were satisfied with the hotel.
The accusation of deliberately endangering public health was rejected by the club's lawyer, Javier Tebas Llanas.
According to Javier Tebas, the son of the president of the Spanish Primera Division, the news agency Europa Press and the sports newspaper "Marca" have not been violated.
Before departure, there had been four infected persons by 19 July, but they had all been isolated and had not travelled with them.
All players and team members were tested again immediately before the flight on Monday.
When the team had already arrived in A Coruna, "five or six" other team members had tested positive for the coronavirus.
The match was cancelled 60 minutes before kick-off, Tebas Llanas said.
Police must catch pulled-out horses at Dampfach
Two animals were on the road.
The police led her back to her owner.
On Sunday morning shortly before 6 o'clock a road user informed two free-running horses on the feeder between the junction Donnersdorf/Steinsfeld and the motorway junction Theres.
When the officials arrived, the horses were already back between the feeder and the village of Dampfach.
After the officials had won the trust of the horses shortly before Dampfach, they each had a rope carried along in the patrol car.
Professional cyclist Tony Martin: career continuation imaginable
Time trial specialist Tony Martin is considering a continuation of his career.
Frankfurt/Main - Seven-time time trial world champion Tony Martin can certainly imagine continuing his cycling career.
"I am currently setting out the framework conditions with the team as to how and in what form things could continue," the 35-year-old told the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung".
Martin is currently employed by the Dutch team Jumbo-Visma and had considered ending his career after this year before the corona break.
The negotiations with his team are also about the number of race days, he said.
Or about other problems that would plague him as a family man, Martin said.
He used to get up after a fall, and the first thought was: "Get back on the bike quickly.
Today, as the father of a little daughter, I think: what if".
The professional cyclist admitted that there are aspects with which he is increasingly struggling.
"But it was good for me to notice from the corona time what I have in cycling and how much fun it is for me."
The time trial specialist returns to the competition at the Tour de l'Ain (5 to 9 August).
Bavaria: At least four dead on Bavaria's roads at the weekend
The beautiful weather attracts bikers to the streets in many places.
For at least three people, the tour with the motorcycle ends fatally.
An 18-year-old pedestrian also dies.
Schönthal - Several, mostly young people died in accidents on Bavaria's roads at the weekend.
An 18-year-old female motorcyclist was hit by a car on the opposite lane near Schönthal (Cham district) on Saturday.
Why the car ran into the opposite lane was initially unclear.
In Upper Bavaria, a 22-year-old man collided with a horse-drawn carriage on his machine on Saturday.
According to the police, he was travelling downhill at Beilngries.
In a left turn, he crashed into the carriage.
His injuries were so severe that he died at the scene of the accident.
Of the twelve occupants of the carriage, one man was seriously injured and one man was slightly injured, according to the police.
An 18-year-old died in another fatal accident in Bad Kötzting, Upper Palatinate.
He had laid down on a road on the night of Sunday and was run over by a 42-year-old driver.
According to the police, the 18-year-old wanted to sleep.
The driver could no longer brake in time.
At Schönberg (Freyung-Grafenau district) on Saturday, a 57-year-old biker crashed head-on against a car in a right-hand bend despite full braking.
He died at the scene of the accident.
The 57-year-old driver suffered a shock, the other three people in the car remained uninjured.
The safety of motorcyclists was discussed on Saturday by Bavaria's transport minister Kerstin Schreyer (CSU).
In a letter to the organiser of the biker protests against driving bans announced for August, Gabor Kovacs, the minister referred to extensive investments such as underride protection on crash barriers and the defusing of dangerous curves.
"We have achieved a lot for the safety of motorcyclists in recent years," the letter said.
"The number of motorized two-wheelers killed fell by around 28 percent compared to 2011."
Kovac tests with Monaco against Frankfurt
Frankfurt/Main (dpa) - For football coach Niko Kovac there will soon be a reunion with Eintracht Frankfurt with his new club AS Monaco.
The eight-time French champion will make a guest appearance on 1 August (6 p.m.) at the Hessen, the former club of the Croat.
For the Bundesliga club, it is the first and only endurance test before the return match in the Europa League against FC Basel (6 August).
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the meeting will be held without spectators.
"We are especially looking forward to this game.
It's always nice to come to Frankfurt and meet friends," explained Kovac.
Sportingly, this is an interesting test, said the 48-year-old.
Before joining Bayern Munich, Kovac had coached Hessen from 2016 to 2018 and led them to victory in the DFB-Pokal.
"A top-class opponent like Monaco is a good test for us in terms of the game against Basel.
Like all Frankfurters, I am looking forward to seeing Niko Kovac again," said Eintracht coach Adi Hütter.
The 50-year-old Austrian had succeeded the Croat at Eintracht.
In March, the Frankfurters had lost the round of 16 match against Basel in their own stadium with 0-3.
Nearly 50 new infections: Hof district close to lockdown
In the district of Hof, the number of known new coronavirus infections continued to increase over the weekend: from 39 on Friday and 43 on Saturday (one person has recovered and no longer falls into this statistic) to 47 on Sunday.
In addition, there is a case in the town of Hof.
The Hof area is thus approaching the critical mark of 50 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants in one week.
700 dead due to monsoon rains in Southeast Asia
More than 9 million people are affected by the severe floods in Southeast Asia, mainly in Bangladesh, India and Nepal.
A total of 700 people were killed due to the heavy monsoon rains.
In Bangladesh, the Red Crescent is trying to reach the isolated people in boats.
Whole villages are under water.
The farmers have lost their crops.
Tank rhinos in national park die from landslides
In Kaziranga National Park, several of the 120 tank rhinos died from landslides.
They are under protection and considered to be in danger of extinction.
This year, the floods are particularly bad, which scientists attribute to climate change.
According to the United Nations, Bangladesh is one of the countries most affected by global warming.
New apartments are empty
In the village of Cox's Bazar in the south of Bangladesh, the state has built apartments for 650 people displaced by the floods.
So far, only a few have moved in.
It is difficult to bring people to Cox's Bazar.
Also the enthusiasm keeps in Grenezn.
Those who used to have a house, however small and similar to a hut, often do not want to spend their lives in a large block of flats.
Many apartments are empty, but - as the government wants - will soon be occupied by those who have lost their homes due to the floods.
60 new coronavirus infections in just one day in Vienna
In a 24-hour comparison, 60 new coronavirus infections were reported in Vienna - in Lower Austria there were 22 new infections.

105 people died in connection with the lung disease.
Argentina rejects counter-offer from creditors
The new demands could not be met, the Ministry of Economy in Buenos Aires announced on Saturday.
"This would not only be irresponsible, but also unfair," it said in a statement.
"While 50 percent of children in Argentina live in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors."
The debts of the second largest economy in South America are no longer sustainable under current conditions.
That is why Argentina is asking its private creditors to waive part of their claims of around 66 billion US dollars (around 59 billion euros).
If no agreement is reached, the country is again threatened with state bankruptcy.
It would be the ninth default in Argentine history.
Most recently, lenders had demanded higher interest rates on government bonds and changes to some contractual clauses.
However, the Argentine government is sticking to its last offer and is not prepared to make any further concessions.
Argentina is in a severe financial and economic crisis.
The inflation rate was recently more than 50 percent.
Experts expect economic strength to decline by around ten percent this year.
At the end of May, Argentina had not settled interest claims amounting to 503 million US dollars and had thus slipped into a limited default.
Professionally arrived - privately not yet
"It's going super well" - this is the conclusion Dr. Stefanie Kramer draws after her first days in the notary's office in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything went very quickly: In mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she will succeed Lutz Feller at the Eggenfelden notary's office.
Already six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the lawyer, who holds a doctorate, started work, and normal day-to-day business has long been in full swing.
"However, I still have to arrive privately," she explains in conversation with the Rottaler Anzeiger and laughs.
Of course, the short lead time was not enough to completely relocate the center of life from Regensburg to Eggenfelden, reports the native Dingolfingerin.
She is currently looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city with her husband, who works as a judge at the regional court in Regensburg.
At least her husband was able to apply for parental leave at short notice to ensure the care of the two daughters (31⁄2 and 11⁄2 years old).
In order not to have to commute every day from Regensburg, she also has an overnight accommodation with her parents in Dingolfing, explains the 39-year-old.
Having grown up in the neighbouring district, the town of Eggenfelden has of course long been known to her.
During visits on site with her family in recent months, she once again stated: "Eggenfelden is a really beautiful small town."
She was all the more pleased that she had made the race in the selection process for the vacancy.
Her homeland of Lower Bavaria also plays a central role in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's professional career: After studying law in Passau, she completed her legal traineeship and the second state examination in Regensburg.
After several positions as a notary assessor, among others in Rehau and Hof in Upper Franconia, Babenhausen in the Lower Allgäu and Regensburg - during this time she also shouldered her doctorate in employment law - she took up her first position as a notary in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau in 2012.
In 2016, she went on parental leave, followed by the move to Regensburg.
Since then, she has taken over representation services in various notarial offices.
When the position in Eggenfelden was advertised due to Lutz Feller's approaching retirement, she saw the right time for her full professional return, explains the 39-year-old.
The team of her predecessor, who will take over the vacation representation in the notarial office in the future, has completely taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer - and immediately has a praise for the team of the law firm ready: "It's going super well!"
The fact that she can rely on well-established processes here makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming relocation of the private centre of life.
She has already contacted a local institution regarding kindergarten and nursery places.
And if everything works out as desired, she hopes to be able to pursue her hobby here soon - and get to know the most beautiful jogging trails in the Rottal.
BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be filled to 20 percent at the start of the season in the event of a fan return.
"Due to the distance regulation, which must be observed, we are currently planning with 12,000 to 15,000 spectators," Borussia Dortmund's managing director Carsten Cramer told the "Tagesspiegel".
Normally, the arena in the district city holds just over 81,000 spectators at Bundesliga matches.
In the ghost games caused by the corona pandemic last season, BVB lost around four million euros per game.
Cramer, who is responsible for marketing, digitalisation and internationalisation at the BVB, hopes that, in addition to the normal spectator seats, some of the approximately 4,000 seats in the hospitality sector can also be opened up again: "It is, of course, a blow to the bank if these revenues completely disappear."
In view of the ongoing coronavirus crisis, everyone is currently "well advised to take a stable side first".
"If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people in Germany alone are in short-time work, then the need for entertainment is limited," explained Cramer.
The Dortmund marketing boss praised the BVB professionals for their partial salary waiver, which is intended to help overcome the crisis: "Of course, the players know that their salary waiver has a different effect than if we put 100 people who work in merchandising on short-time work."
Tiny miracles: Early start in life with a few hundred grams
Hardly heavier than a pack of butter, just three tablespoons of blood in his entire body: that was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The boy is one of around 400 premature babies who are cared for annually at the Graz Children's Hospital.
A quarter of them weigh less than 1,500 grams, a few - like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael - are extreme lightweights with less than a kilogram of birth weight.
They are so small and born so early that neither lungs, nor intestines, nor muscles are fully developed.
Their skin is sometimes so delicate that they could injure the electrodes of an ECG.
And they are so tiny that they sometimes wear doll clothes and mini diapers made especially for them.
But not so small that they don't have a voice - "and how," smiles Berndt Urlesberger.
"Even if they don't scream as loudly as big babies, of course."
When the whiteboard becomes a stage
Despite Corona Theater in the classroom: The whiteboard as a stage experienced the 9th grade of the Sankt-Jakobus-Gymnasium in Abtsgmünd shortly before the start of the holiday.
Actress Julia Sylvester from the Theater der Stadt Aalen presented the production "Das Heimatkleid" to the students - via video.
Afterwards, the students were able to exchange ideas about the play and the performance with the actress and the director Winfried Tobias via Skype.
The idea for the performance format from the current corona situation was born.
Teacher Teresa Nar was happy about the enrichment of the lessons.
Even if all those involved agreed in the end that the direct encounter in the theatre and stage space would offer additional stimuli, you can also see the potential for contact with the schools in the theatre.
"If we continue to improve the technical framework, this could be an interesting addition to the game operation," emphasized director Winfried Tobias.
First round draw: TSV 1860 would meet Eintracht Frankfurt in the DFB-Pokal
Should TSV 1860 qualify for the DFB-Pokal, the Lions will meet Eintracht Frankfurt in the first round.
This resulted in the draw on Sunday.
Munich - Sixty possible opponents in the first round of the DFB-Pokal have been determined.
The Lions would meet Eintracht Frankfurt in a successful qualification.
This resulted in the draw on Sunday evening in the ARD sports show.
Because the field of participants is not yet complete due to the corona pandemic, placeholders were used in the draw.
Due to the voluntary renunciation of semi-final opponents FC Memmingen, TSV 1860 is already in the final of the Bavarian Toto Cup (4 or 5 September).
There the lions meet either the Würzburg Kickers or Viktoria Aschaffenburg.
Should second division promoted Würzburg reach the final, sixty would already be qualified for the first round of the DFB-Pokal.
Otherwise, the Giesinger would have to prevail in the final against regional league club Aschaffenburg.
The first round of the DFB-Pokal will take place between 11 and 14 September, one week before the start of the third division.
"Gone with the Wind": Film legend Olivia de Havilland is dead
The film legend and Oscar winner Olivia de Havilland is dead.
She died a natural death on Sunday in Paris at the age of 104, confirmed her spokeswoman for the German Press Agency.
De Havilland was known for her role as Melanie Hamilton in the southern epic "Gone with the Wind" (1939).
Born to British parents in Tokyo, Olivia de Havilland moved to California as an infant.
The Austrian theatre man Max Reinhardt discovered the 19-year-old in the role of Hermia of Shakespeare's "Midsummer Night's Dream".
The film studio Warner Brothers signed her for seven years and brought her out with Eroll Flynn.
She made eight films with the heartbreaker.
In 1946 she won her first Oscar in the leading role of "To Each His Own".
The film was shown in Germany under the title "Mutterherz".
Three years later came the award for best actress in William Wyler's "The Heiress".
She also received a lot of recognition as a neurotic eccentric in "The Dark Mirror" and "The Snake Pit".
Daphne du Maurier proposed her in 1952 for the leading role in the film adaptation of her novel "My Cousin Rachel".
The piece became a worldwide success.
With her long-time friend Bette Davis, she played in "Lullaby for a Corpse".
His son Benjamin emerged from his marriage to the writer Marcus Goodrich (1946 to 1953).
In Paris, de Havilland married the journalist Pierre Paul Galante and had a daughter, Giséle, with him.
This marriage also broke up.
However, rumours of an affair with former British Prime Minister Edward Heath have never been confirmed.
"Road to Timmendorf": Beach volleyball: Thole/Wickler miss final at comeback
World Cup runners-up Julius Thole and Clemens Wickler missed the final at the beach volleyball tournament "Road to Timmendorf".
At the meeting of the top teams in Düsseldorf, they lost in the semifinals to their national team colleagues Nils Ehlers and Lars Flüggen with 1:2 (17:21, 21:17, 19:21).
Most recently, Thole/Wickler played at the World Tour Final in Rome in September last year.
In the final on the Rhine, their conquerors Ehlers/Flüggen lost to the surprise team Lukas Pfretschner and his interim partner Steven van de Velde 0-2 (17:21, 17:21).
In addition to the show tournament, three starting places for the German championships were played in Timmendorfer Strand at the beginning of September: The tickets were secured by Armin Dollinger/Simon Kulzer, Manuel Harms/Richard Peemüller and Simon Pfretschner/Milan Sievers.
Kalbitz ejection from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "fig leaf"
The expulsion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is in the view of the FDP only a "fig leaf" and does not change the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the far-right in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the tip of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD," FDP domestic politician Benjamin Strasser told the dpa news agency in Berlin.
The Federal Arbitration Court of the AfD had confirmed on Saturday in Stuttgart, after several hours of hearing, the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Executive Board had decided by a majority in May.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD parliamentary group in the Brandenburg state parliament.
"If the AfD really wanted to consistently remove right-wing extremists from their party, officials like Björn Höcke and his supporters would have been excluded long ago," Strasser said.
"However, there is no political will for this in the AfD, because right-wing extremism is now part of the party."
CSU General Secretary Markus Blume said similarly: "The fact that Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded says nothing and does not change anything," he told "Welt am Sonntag".
"It speaks volumes how many frenetic supporters a right-wing extremist still has in the middle of the AfD."
Blume assumes that the AfD will end up below five percent in future elections.
"The days of the AfD in the parliaments are numbered".
Kalbitz was one of the spokesmen of the officially dissolved "wing" around the Thuringian AfD state and parliamentary group chairman Björn Höcke; the Office for the Protection of the Constitution classifies the strip as a "secured right-wing extremist effort".
In May, the AfD federal executive had kicked Kalbitz out of the party.
As a reason, he stated that Kalbitz had not stated an earlier membership in the now banned right-wing extremist "Heimattreue Deutsche Jugend" (HDJ) and among the Republicans when he joined the party.
Kalbitz denies membership in the HDJ.
The chairman of the left-wing faction in the Brandenburg state parliament, Sebastian Walter, also stressed that the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court did not change the character of the AfD: "The wolf only ate chalk.
The AfD remains a far-right party, with or without Kalbitz."
Neither the federal party nor the right wing will be weakened by this decision.
"The manoeuvre of the Meuthen troops is transparent.
They want to avoid further observation by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution and try to get through under the radar," said Walter.
"The AfD will not get rid of the spirits it called.
A throw-out does not change anything," commented the Brandenburg SPD general secretary Erik Stohn on the decision in the Kalbitz case.
"Here, the AfD regional association and the parliamentary group held to their right-wing leader until today."
The legal dispute over Kalbitz's membership in the AfD will continue.
He announced on Saturday that he would now take civil action against the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court.
North Sea wind farms deliver a good 21 percent more electricity
The wind power plants on the German North Sea fed 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity into the grid in the first six months of the year.
This is a good 21 percent more than in the same period last year, said network operator Tennet in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of North Sea electricity to the mainland and the transmission through the German electricity grid.
The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of Tennet's grid area, have fed in another 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
Overall, wind power from the North Sea and Baltic Sea comes to 13.73 TWh, compared to a good 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind harvest at sea thus accounts for almost 19 percent of total wind power in Germany, which is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms ensure higher generation capacity
In addition to the wind conditions, the increased contribution of offshore wind energy results from higher generation capacities, because new wind farms have been connected to the grid in the past twelve months.
If the 1270 wind power plants in the North Sea were all running at full power at the same time, they could generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient; according to Tennet, it is 7.1 gigawatts.
It is expected to rise to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea by 2030.
"In Germany and the Netherlands, we are investing 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore grid connections by then," said Tennet Managing Director Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, wind farms cannot exhaust their capacity even at sea, but reach around 40 percent.
The previous record day this year is January 2, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind turbines produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, which corresponds to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could supply almost seven million households with electricity.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition of the Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the Gmünder Kunstverein.
This was almost a small anniversary celebration for the 130th anniversary.
Birthday of the Gmünder Kunstverein: The exhibition opening "Skirmish" with works by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold broke the usual framework after the corona break.
Many more art lovers than usual followed the dialogue between the artist and the chairman of the Kunstverein, Professor Dr. Klaus Ripper.
The musical equivalent was provided by the band "Defenders of the Universe" on the southern Kornhausplatz.
North of the gallery the association "Sandtogether" was involved.
Freital: Windbergfest cancelled due to corona
The Windbergfest will not take place this year.
The city of Freital has cancelled the three-day festival planned for September.
In other years, more than 30,000 people had attended this city festival.
"We really did not make this decision easy for ourselves and - aware of how difficult it is economically for the participants - hoped until the last minute," explained Lord Mayor Uwe Rumberg (non-partisan).
"But ultimately, as the organizer, we are responsible for the health of many thousands of people."
If tens of thousands had flocked to the festival grounds and into the marquee, minimum distances, hygiene regulations and contact tracing could not have been complied with in accordance with the current coronavirus protection regulation.
Or the restrictions would have been so severe that not much would have remained of a folk festival.
In addition, the organisational and monitoring effort would increase disproportionately.
Rumberg put off for next year.
Then the city of Freital will celebrate its 100th anniversary with the Winterbergfest from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the Day of the Saxons from 10 to 12 September 2021.
Olympic dressage champion Werth not to be beaten in Achleiten
Achleiten - Six-time Olympic champion Isabell Werth was the outstanding rider at the dressage tournament in Achleiten, Austria.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg came to four victories in four starts at the weekend.
After winning a Grand Prix with Weihegold and Quantaz, she was also unbeatable on Sunday in the Grand Prix Special and in the freestyle.
On the 15-year-old mare Weihegold, Werth clearly prevailed against the Austrian Victoria Max-Theurer on Abegglen in the Special on Sunday.
The German was also clearly ahead of her 34-year-old pupil Victoria Max-Theurer in the freestyle on Quantaz on Saturday.
Werth's winning horse Quantaz belongs to Max-Theurer.
The most successful dressage rider in the world is to establish the ten-year-old stallion in the Grand Prix.
For Quantaz it was the first freestyle ever.
Werth had already won all four important competitions at the first tournament in Achleiten three weeks ago.
The last of the three international tournaments is scheduled for August 14-16.
More air traffic controllers in Worms in the future
Worms University continues to take to the skies: "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" endows a professorship for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the university and DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially concluded for three years and will start in 2021.
The professorship enables students to start their studies not only in the summer semester, but also in the winter semester.
This means that twice as many students can be trained as before.
At the same time, capacities at both the university and the DFS air traffic control academy are being utilised evenly.
DFS will advise the university on the establishment and appointment of the professorship.
Represented at the university since 2019
Since the summer semester 2019, the first students have been in the Air Traffic Management course as part of their training as air traffic controllers at Worms University of Applied Sciences.
Nine students have already started this year.
So far, the experience of DFS has been very positive, and the students' achievements are excellent.
The combination of study and pilot training makes a significant contribution to further increasing the attractiveness of the pilot profession.
"In these times, funding is not easy for us economically.
However, we firmly expect air traffic to recover and grow again in the long term.
In order to continue fulfilling our legal mandate in the future, we need highly qualified personnel," says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, CEO of DFS, at the signing of the contract.
"For DFS, the endowed professorship is a future-proof investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, interdisciplinary knowledge base in the long term.
We are therefore continuing our good cooperation with the university and at the same time underlining our attractiveness as an employer."
This is also underlined by Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of the Worms University of Applied Sciences: "The endowed professorship forms an important bridge between science and industry.
With it, we would like to build on the existing cooperation with DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual bachelor's degree programme in Air Traffic Management."
The trust of German air traffic control is both a motivation and an obligation for Worms University of Applied Sciences to further expand its teaching and research competence in the future fields of aviation.
Working for the air traffic controllers of tomorrow, the university can set very special highlights and innovative focal points for its students with the first endowed professorship for a dual course of study.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary at the Ministry of Science, Continuing Education and Culture, emphasises: "With its focus on air transport, Worms University of Applied Sciences has a unique selling point in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Today's signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the university's profile."
Rescue screwdriver lands on the A 45
The A 45 motorway towards Aschaffenburg was fully closed for about 30 minutes on Saturday afternoon, as the rescue helicopter was in action after a traffic accident.
A 76-year-old drove a Ford straight ahead in the Alzenau-Mitte exit at around 12.40 p.m. and landed at the guardrail.
The impact triggered the front airbags, the driver suffered minor injuries to his face and had to be taken to a hospital for treatment.
The 72-year-old passenger's injuries were treated by the emergency doctor and the patient was then flown to a hospital by rescue helicopter.
At present, however, the police assume that there is no danger to life.
The damaged vehicle, which suffered damage of about 2,000 euros, had to be towed away.
Heil wants to test other industries after meat industry
The coronavirus crisis brought conditions in parts of the meat industry to light again.
Legislative tightening is imminent.
But are they right - and will it continue?
According to the now planned strict regulations against abuses in the meat industry, Federal Minister of Labour Hubertus Heil (SPD) also wants to examine other sectors.
"We will look at industry by industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective industry if necessary," Heil told the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany's employers are already warning against restricting work contracts in general.
After the mass coronavirus outbreak at the meat giant Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet wants to pass a law of salvation this Wednesday.
Large slaughterhouses should no longer be allowed to use external personnel for slaughter, cutting and meat processing.
For this purpose, the use of contract workers and temporary workers is to be prohibited there.
Employer president Ingo Kramer told the dpa: "Finger away from a general restriction of work contracts and temporary employment, if one does not want to completely strangle the economy".
Work contracts, for example, are mandatory for large areas of the trade, the construction industry and plant construction as the basis for their added value at the customer.
"The failures of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument."
Heil assured: "My goal is not to ban work contracts everywhere in the German economy."
Work contracts make sense.
"When an industrial company commissions a craftsman to install a safety system, this is a completely normal work contract."
The German meat industry considers a ban on work contracts and temporary work to be unconstitutional in its industry alone.
It cannot be explained why different labour laws should apply to portioning and packaging cheese in the future than to sausages, according to a statement on the bill, as reported by the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Saturday).
A ban would therefore increase the consumer price by 10 to 20 percent per kilo and product.
According to the results of an audit by the NRW Occupational Safety and Health Administration, many Eastern European employees from contract companies worked 16 hours a day in the industry.
They often had no break.
Wage was withheld for protective equipment or rent.
It was also found that the situation regarding the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Heil said that a relatively sharp law had already come into force for the meat industry in 2017.
However, these were bypassed by "tricky constructions".
"Now we have to clean up fundamentally."
The politician announced: "The Occupational Safety and Health Act, which we want to adopt in the cabinet at the end of July, also includes measures that do not only affect the meat industry - for example, higher inspection rates for occupational safety and health or clear criteria for shared accommodation."
The draft presented by dpa includes amendments to the Act on the Protection of Workers' Rights in the Meat Industry and the Occupational Safety and Health Act.
Brandenburg's consumer protection minister Ursula Nonnemacher (Greens) considers more intensive controls necessary.
"I would like us to be able to carry out even more checks in many supervisory areas: food controls, animal welfare, everything possible, including animal transport," said Nonnemacher on Sunday in the RBB programme "Brandenburg aktuell".
However, more staff positions are also needed for more controls.
Three dead in crash of ultralight aircraft in Germany
According to the police, three people died in the crash of an ultralight aircraft on an apartment building in Wesel in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia.
One child was slightly injured.
Two other people were rescued injured in the accident, said a spokesman for the Wesel district control center.
According to the police, a parachute was found at the scene of the accident.
The "Rheinische Post" reported, citing eyewitnesses, that the plane had collided with a hot air balloon before the crash.
The house is a one- or two-family house.
Further details were not disclosed at first.
Clearance of Frankfurt Opera Square proceeds peacefully
One week after the riots in Frankfurt, the evacuation of the Opera Square took place peacefully during the night on Sunday.
Finally, several dozen people were still in the square, but left before the curfew began at 1 a.m.
The police had been on duty with numerous officers since the early evening, and there was a larger police presence throughout the city.
For the first time this weekend, from midnight, there was a ban on entering the Opera Square, where riots had occurred a week ago.
Police officers were attacked with bottles from the crowd of revelers.
At least five officers were injured and several police vehicles were damaged.
The night to Saturday had also remained quiet.
Car rolls over: Young woman seriously injured in accident on Bundesstraße 83 near Hofgeismar
A 21-year-old suffered serious injuries in an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme at around 1.25 p.m. on Sunday.
She was taken to the Kassel hospital.
The fire department was looking for possible passengers with thermal imaging cameras.
According to the police, the woman was driving on Bundesstraße 83 in the direction of her place of residence, Hümme, when her car got off the road for unknown reasons and overturned several times.
In order to save the accident, the fire brigade had to cut the roof of the car free.
Since it was unclear whether anyone was still in the vehicle, the adjacent corn field was searched from the turntable ladder with a thermal imaging camera.
The drone squadron from Warburg, which also works with thermal imaging cameras, was also ordered to search for people.
However, the emergency services did not find anyone between the tall maize plants.
The seriously injured was taken by ambulance to the Kassel hospital for further care.
Nearly 50 firefighters from the Hofgeismar, Hümme and Schöneberg fire brigades were on site.
The highway was closed for two hours due to the accident.
Juventus Turin champions in Italy
Turin - After a redeeming goal from Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin has secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in a row.
The team around the five-time world footballer made the 36th Scudetto in the club's history perfect with a 2:0 (1:0) on Sunday evening in the home game against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo scored 1-0 before half-time.
With 83 points, Turin, which competed without the recently injured former international Sami Khedira, can no longer be displaced from first place two days before the end of the Serie A season.
Second-placed Inter Milan is seven points behind.
Juventus were harmless despite optical superiority in the first half, then Ronaldo scored after a free-kick variant with the last action.
The 35-year-old used a shot from Miralem Pjanic directly from the penalty area with a flat shot (45.+7).
Against the now more offensive guests Ronaldo was also involved in the 2:0, after his shot Federico Bernardeschi (67th) dusted off.
This ensured the lackluster but decisive success.
The foul penalty shot to the bar in the 89th minute is only Ronaldo himself with a view to the goal-scoring classification.
"It's complicated to stay at ball level mentally and physically for 90 minutes.
The games are strange, and the momentum changes very slightly," explained coach Maurizio Sarri after the 1-2 draw at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Above all, the mental exhaustion of his players is great, said the Juve coach.
Because of the defeat, the Turin team had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
Juve recently owed its reassuring lead at the top of the standings above all to the weakness of its competitors.
In the eleven games before the match on Sunday, the Sarri team had only managed five victories.
Whether Ronaldo will also be the top scorer is questionable.
While the Portuguese superstar has scored 31 goals so far, the former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile has already scored 34 goals after his three-pack in the 5:1 (1:1) of the fourth-placed Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to FC Bayern's title win.
The record in Italy is held by the current Juve pro Gonzalo HiguaÃ3n.
The Argentine scored 36 goals for SSC Napoli in the 2015/2016 season.
The next title opportunity awaits the "Old Lady" of Italian football in August.
Juventus are in the round of 16 of the Champions League, but will have to make up for a 0-1 loss against Olympique Lyon on 7 August to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next knockout round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would wait as opponents.
Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal car races recorded
Stuttgart - Despite all the threatened penalties and court rulings, drivers continue to throttle in countless illegal races on the streets of Baden-Württemberg: Last year and the first four months of this year, the police in the southwest have already registered more than 250 illegal car races.
There are no comparable figures for the previous years, but the speeders are increasingly making the judicial authorities work: In 2018, a total of 155 investigations were conducted at the public prosecutor's offices between Konstanz and Mannheim for illegal races, one year later there were already 252 and 151 in the current year until the beginning of June.
The races were less about organised events, as can be seen from the response of the Ministry of the Interior to a request from the state parliament SPD.
In most cases, the drivers spontaneously competed against each other or they took flight from the police - this is also reported as an illegal race.
At the wheel were mainly German men between the ages of 18 and 60.
113 fines - 15 times imprisonment
Only in comparatively few cases are the racers caught and also asked to pay: According to the Interior Ministry, a total of 113 fines have been imposed since 2018 and 15 prison sentences have been issued.
However, there is no evidence that the number of illegal car races is actually increasing.
Rather, other drivers reacted more sensitively than before because of the numerous tragic accidents and processes of past years and reported more frequently, said a ministry spokesman.
The motorway 8 is particularly popular with speeders, where drivers repeatedly slow down traffic in order to make room for themselves and use the free track for a race.
Last August, a dozen riders were caught near Kirchheim unter Teck, three months earlier there were even 18 riders on the A8 near Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular "race track"
The police even register more races on the A81 than on any other motorway.
With a speed limit, there is an attempt to slow down the speeders on the particularly affected section between Engen and Geisingen.
The mostly high-priced and pimped-up sports and luxury cars often have Swiss license plates, because the drivers switch to the lawn in Germany because of the high penalties for driving too fast and racing in the neighboring country.
For the SPD, the speed limit must not be reduced to a few routes: "With a general speed limit of 130 kilometres per hour, we would get rid of this problem on motorways," says Martin Rivoir, the transport expert of the SPD parliamentary group.
"The inhibition threshold for racers would be significantly higher if you were not allowed to travel legally here and there with 200 kilometers per hour and more."
Rivoir thinks less of enlightenment or image campaigns: "Those who defy all rules in this way and risk not only their own lives, but also the lives of other road users, can hardly be reached with reason."
ADAC calls for stronger police crackdown
However, this is not enough for the ADAC: "We assume that speeders will not be deterred by the speed limits," says Holger Bach, head of the transport and environment department at ADAC Württemberg.
It calls for additional and also tougher controls on the affected routes.
Since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people have died in the races nationwide, two of them uninvolved in a night-time crash in Stuttgart's city centre and one in Gerlingen.
Two young men are said to have competed in a car race there in November.
One of the vehicles came off the road, crashed into a garden wall and remained on the side, the 18-year-old passenger died.
21 more people were injured in the races of the past two years.
In the opinion of Interior Minister Thomas Strobl, however, tougher penalties are not necessary: "Legislative action to sanction illegal motor vehicle races more severely is not seen," says the paper of the Interior Ministry.
Blue light from July 23: Thirsty burglar steals drinks from snack bar
Rohrdorf: A man broke into a snack bar in Rohrdorf (Calw district) on Thursday and stole drinks and cash.
A witness heard noises in the valley road at around 3.40 a.m. and ran towards the snack bar.
There he noticed a man who was serving drinks at the refrigerator and then left the snack bar through a previously smashed entrance door.
The perpetrator fled towards the meadows behind the snack bar.
According to the police, the burglar also used a cash register and stole cash in the low three-digit range.
The suspect is described as follows: He is about 1.75 to 1.80 meters tall and of strong stature.
In fact, he was wearing a black hoodie, black trousers and light shoes.
The police receive further witness information.
Ackermann sprints to victory on final stage at Sibiu Tour
Professional cyclist Pascal Ackermann won his second victory of the day on the final stage of the 10th Sibiu Tour.
The 26-year-old Palatine from the Bora-hansgrohe team prevailed in the mass sprint on the 109-kilometre section with start and finish in Sibiu, having already won a stage on Saturday.
It was the season wins three and four for Ackermann.
In the overall classification, his Austrian team mate Gregor Mühlberger prevailed.
The 26-year-old had won the mountain time trial in the morning and thus took the lead in the classification.
Only 104 riders had entered the final stage in the evening.
No less than 18 starters had fallen victim to the time limit in the mountain time trial.
"I'm really happy to start the new season with a victory," Ackermann said after his success on Saturday.
"The sprint was really hectic," said the 26-year-old.
With 300 metres to go, he simply put on his sprint, "and it worked out perfectly."
In accordance with the rules of the UCI, a corona test was carried out on all race participants and their companions six days before the start of the race.
During the entire tour, drivers and attendants were separated from the organising team and the media in isolated hygiene bubbles.
Spectators at the start and finish were not allowed.
Control center gave instructions for lay resuscitation
Düsseldorf - Tragic accident on Sunday afternoon in Düsseldorf-Garath.
In an apartment building, a child (4) suddenly lay lifeless in the water while bathing.
According to the fire department, the emergency call was received shortly before 13:00.
"A dispatcher immediately gave instructions for lay resuscitation," a fire department spokesman told BILD.
The arriving rescue workers took over the resuscitation measures shortly afterwards.
The child, who was in mortal danger, was transported to the university hospital under resuscitation.
Why it crashed is unclear.
The police have routinely started investigations into the accident.
The fire department spokesman: "We assume a tragic accident in the apartment".
Nuremberg: Unauthorised tuning meeting - police intervene, 700 vehicles and around 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and at times over 1000 people took part in a "tuning meeting" in the parking lot of a furniture store on Saturday night.
The police implemented their announcement to increase control of such events.
A big tuning meeting took place on Saturday evening (25 July 2020) in Nuremberg's Südstadt district.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the Mittelfranken police, the Nuremberg traffic police found an increased number of vehicles in the area of a large parking lot on Ingolstädter Straße at around 10.30 p.m.
The police then carried out a large number of vehicle checks.
Only recently, the police had announced that they wanted to take increased action against so-called autoposers.
Illegal tuning meeting in Nuremberg: Only a small part of the "scene"
According to the police, the officers numbered around 700 vehicles and about 1100 people at the top.
However, only a small part of those present can be attributed to the "autoposer" and tuning scene.
Apparently, most of the relevant scene complied with the police's appeal.
Based on the vehicles and people on site, it can be assumed that these were mainly onlookers.
In addition, the majority of those present complied with the applicable infection protection regulations, in particular the observance of the minimum distance and the wearing of a mouth-nose protection.
The control measures carried out on site were completed around 1:00 a.m.
In total, the officials found such structural changes in 10 vehicles that the operating license had expired.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No car races
There were no illegal car races.
"The police headquarters in Middle Franconia will continue to keep an eye on what is happening and will continue to carry out increased control measures, also in connection with the emergence of onlookers," it said.
The agency News5 spoke to Jürgen Schrödinger from the towing company involved: "They all have beautiful rims, we must not scratch them," says Schrödinger.
Special tapes would be used for this.
Also because the cars are wider, the company must be careful not to damage them.
"After all, the young people should get their cars back unscathed."
Employment Agency figures: 900 suspected cases of short-time work abuse
Berlin - According to its own statement, the Federal Employment Agency (BA) is investigating around 900 suspected cases of abuse of short-time workers' allowances.
"This is extremely low for more than 880,000 companies that have reported short-time work," Daniel Terzenbach, the Executive Board member responsible for operations, told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.
When many companies suddenly applied for short-time work at the beginning of the corona crisis, the BA had to react quickly.
The exam usually takes up to three weeks.
"We didn't have that much time in this hot phase.
We will therefore take a closer look at the final accounts.
There will certainly be a lot more to come.
We are not naive and have a long breath."
Evidence of abuse often comes from the affected employees or trade unions.
In addition, the BA uses analysis software to identify abuse patterns.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is preparing for a possible wave of insolvency in the autumn.
"Will there be significantly more insolvencies than in the previous year?
The assessments differ, but we are preparing ourselves for the case and are already training our employees in the employment agencies to process applications for insolvency money."
The figures are still inconspicuous, said Terzenbach.
World Heritage in Potsdam: Party in the New Garden dissolved
Potsdam - On Friday evening, about 40 young people celebrated a party in the New Garden.
The collection was dissolved at 8.48 p.m. by the drivers of the Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation (SPSG), the foundation announced on PNN's request.
The young people then left the park.
On Saturday evening, some young people would have played rugby in the New Garden.
The meadow had been cleared by precinct drivers, said SPSG spokesman Frank Kallensee on Sunday.
Again and again there are illegal celebrations in the parks
In the parks of the foundation, there are repeated accumulations in which the distance and hygiene rules are not observed.
At the end of June there was a celebration with about 300 people in the Park Babelsberg, a week later about 150 people celebrated in the New Garden.
Even without coronavirus regulations, the parks will be closed at nightfall.
Camping on the meadows is prohibited according to the park regulations, there are only a few exceptions.
The foundation has been complaining for some time that visitors are leaving more and more rubbish and destroying protected biotopes.
In Berlin, meanwhile, illegal park parties have reached another dimension.
In the Hasenheide in the district of Neukölln, 5,000 people celebrated an illegal techno party on Sunday night.
The event was disbanded by the police.
Austria: Mass testing after coronavirus outbreak in tourist resort
Authorities have responded to a coronavirus outbreak in the popular Upper Austrian tourist resort of St. Wolfgang with hundreds of tests.
The number of confirmed cases rose to 48, according to the state authorities in Linz.
More than 100 results were still pending in the evening.
According to this, many of the infected are young interns in tourism companies, but at least one holiday guest has also tested positive.
Residents, guests and tourism staff were asked to stay in their accommodation on Saturday evening.
The curfew was set at 11 p.m.
"There are cancellations and cancellations there and there" of bookings, said the head of the tourism association Wolfgangsee, Hans Wieser, the dpa.
Some guests also left early.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist resort in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 overnight stays last year.
In a normal season, around a third of the guests are Germans.
On Friday, the first infections had become public knowledge.
The head of the district authority, Alois Lanz, defended on Saturday the behaviour of the interns, who had celebrated in several restaurants and could have become infected there.
"We all enjoyed doing that in our youth," he told radio station Ö1.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The tourism association launched an information campaign to raise awareness among young employees about the dangers of COVID-19.
From Saturday, hundreds of employees, holidaymakers and locals were tested.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang from 15 July were contacted.
The outbreak brings back memories of the Austrian ski and party resort of Ischgl in Tyrol, which was a centre of coronavirus spread throughout Europe in the early stages of the pandemic.
In total, more than 1500 people are currently infected with the virus in Austria.
The focus of new infections is on Vienna and Upper Austria.
Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualified for Champions League
London (dpa) - English football record champions Manchester United return to the Champions League after a one-year absence.
The Red Devils secured third place in the table on the final day of the Premier League by beating direct rivals Leicester City 2-0 (0-0).
The Foxes now have to settle for the Europa League, because Chelsea FC still passed and qualified for the premier class in fourth place.
Aston Villa was allowed to cheer in the fight against relegation.
Manchester United took the lead with a penalty kick from Bruno Fernandes (71 minute).
After a red card for Leicester City in injury time, Jesse Lingard (90.+8) reached the final score.
Chelsea, opponents of FC Bayern in the Champions League eighth final, won 2-0 (2-0) against Wolverhampton Wanderers thanks to Mason Mount (45.+1) and Olivier Giroud (45.+4).
"That means a lot to me," said coach Frank Lampard, who is also in the FA Cup final against Arsenal in his first season as Chelsea coach.
Chelsea's victory against Wolverhampton also benefited Tottenham Hotspur, who went past the Wolves with a meagre 1-1 (1-0) at Crystal Palace to start sixth in the Europa League.
Aston Villa won the long-distance duel with Watford and AFC Bournemouth, but had to tremble at West Ham United for a long time.
The late lead of Jack Grealish (84th) immediately compensated Andrej Jarmolenko (85th).
But the 1:1 (0:0) was enough, because Watford lost 2:3 (1:3) at Arsenal.
The club, which had three coaches in the season, is relegated after five first division years.
Just like Bournemouth, who could not save themselves by a 3:1 (2:1) at Everton.
In the end, one point was missing.
Liverpool, who have been English champions since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3-1 (1-1) win at Newcastle United.
99 points is the highest score the Reds have ever scored in a football season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp and his team narrowly missed the points record in English football.
Manchester City holds the record with 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
After the Newcastle lead in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38th), Divock Origi (59th) and Sadio Mané (89th) turned the game on Sunday for Liverpool.
"It was an extraordinary season for this wonderful club," said goal scorer van Dijk after the game, "which should spur us on to defend the title.
It's going to be difficult."
The Premier League bosses are also likely to be satisfied in the end.
Due to the coronavirus crisis, football operations in England were suspended from 13 March to 17 June.
In the meantime, there was even discussion about a premature abandonment or hosting of the remaining matches on neutral ground.
Finally, however, the season could be played without any special incidents - but as in Germany without spectators in the stadiums.
Arrests and violence at demonstrations against Netanyahu
The protests in Israel against Prime Minister Netanyahu are becoming increasingly violent.
During the night there were violent clashes.
On the night of Sunday, the Israeli police violently cracked down on participants in a demonstration against the right-wing conservative Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem.
Twelve people were arrested for participating in riots, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said.
Among other things, the police used water cannons to break up the rally.
According to media reports, around 6,000 people had gathered near Netanyahu's official residence on Saturday evening.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu's handling of the corona crisis.
The protesters beat drums, blew horns and called on Netanyahu to resign.
Participants in a counter-demonstration supporting Netanyahu were also detained, the news website "ynet" reported.
People also demonstrated in many other places in Israel, including in front of the head of government's private villa in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
According to police, a man was arrested near Tel Aviv on suspicion of spraying pepper spray from a moving car onto demonstrators on the side of the road.
Another man was arrested after a stabbing attack on a protester in the south of the country.
The demonstrator was slightly injured in the neck.
There have recently been several demonstrations against Netanyahu in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.
The rallies accompany the corruption trial against the head of government.
Most recently, Netanyahu has also been criticized for his handling of the coronavirus crisis.
Among other things, he is accused of hasty relaxations and a lack of preparation for a second wave of coronavirus.
The coronavirus crisis has hit the country's economy hard.
The unemployment rate was recently more than 20 percent.
The number of new coronavirus infections in Israel has recently risen to new record levels.
Accident near Ahlen (NRW) - Transporter crashes on car - nine injured - Ruhrgebiet - Bild.de
Ahlen - A rear-end collision caused nine minor injuries on the B58 near Ahlen on Saturday afternoon.
A car driver was driving with her two children (3, 5) towards Beckum.
The police: "Probably she had suddenly slowed down because she wanted to turn."
The driver of a Mercedes van driving behind her must have seen this too late.
He crashed into the back of the car.
Three passengers in the car and six in the van were slightly injured in the accident.
Several ambulances took her to a surrounding hospital.
North Korea seals off border town after suspected coronavirus case
North Korea has so far seen a "shining success" in its own measures to ward off the coronavirus.
The country is now reporting a suspected case for the first time.
Due to a first official suspected coronavirus case in the country, North Korea has completely sealed off a major city for fear of disaster.
Despite the strictest epidemiological defenses in the past six months, "the malignant virus may have been introduced into the country," the state media reported.
A state of emergency has been declared for the region around the border town of Kaesong.
The Communist leadership declared the highest level of alert.
If the suspected case is confirmed, it would be the first official case of infection with Sars-CoV-2 in the isolated country.
North Korea has not registered a single infection and described its defensive measures as a "shining success".
The information was doubted abroad.
The disease symptoms were reportedly detected in an "outlier" who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on July 19.
The person left for South Korea three years ago and has now returned across the border.
There was initially no confirmation from South Korea for crossing the border within the four-kilometre-wide and largely still mined military buffer zone.
However, according to reports by the national news agency Yonhap, South Korea's military acknowledged the possibility of an illegal border crossing into North Korea as high.
Investigations were carried out on a number of people.
According to its own statements, North Korea called an emergency meeting of the Politburo of the Workers' Party, chaired by leader Kim Jong Un, on Saturday because of the suspected case.
The "dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive catastrophe."
Kim had already ordered on Friday as a preventive measure to "completely block Kaesong and isolate every district and the region from others," it continued.
The person concerned and all the people in Kaesong who had been in contact with him were quarantined.
The central military commission of the party should therefore investigate the "outlier case" as well as the behaviour of the responsible military unit and, if necessary, impose severe punishment.
It is estimated that about 300,000 people live in Kaesong.
Excitement ahead of Council meeting: City East and noise protection are still under discussion before a big summer break
"In addition to environmental issues, the committee members will also vote, among other things, on the development plan for the large-scale project Innenstadtentwicklung-Ost," it says rather casually in the middle section of the city press release for the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, 28 July, at 4.30 p.m. in the Great Hall of the CongressCentrum Pforzheim.
Above all, the upgrading of the eastern city is discussed controversially until the end.
The majorities in favour are narrow, most recently even negative in individual committees depending on attendance.
After almost ten years of preparation, project opponent Reinhard Klein criticised an appeal from business (construction, real estate, trade and IT) not to let the project, which was developed out of the citizenry and then by the administration and municipal council, fail now as "extra-parliamentary opposition", "clueless", "speculation", "vilification" and "deliberate false statements".
"Everyone thinks they know better," says Klein, who has been a member of the municipal council for a year as the only representative of the Pforzheim citizens' list.
In fact, after reading the contracts, he was in this position: "I know what I'm talking about."
The exit is cheaper for the city, the technical town hall is contrary to statements of the city administration after grants, of whose existence Klein is convinced to renovate for 8.5 million euros.
The city will develop completely differently than predicted in the town hall and on the part of the advocates from the economy.
One day after Klein, the FDP/FW/UB/LED faction, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
It essentially also provides for the renovation of the Technical Town Hall, the opening of the Schloßberg, the renting of the ex-Thales for administrative areas and a more small-scale city centre redesign, ideally with local carriers.
Environmental issues play a central role
Environmental issues will also play a central role.
Among other things, the local council will vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the population of Pforzheim from noise pollution caused by road traffic, including many speed reductions.
In a press release, the local transport club Germany welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30. However, the political leaders in the city are not innocent of the fact that this must happen, because they have only contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus noise by neglecting the regular bus traffic with thinned cycles and by little commitment to cycling.
The municipal council also votes on the participation of the city of the energy and climate protection agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
In addition, the agenda includes accession to the climate protection pact of the state of Baden-Württemberg, the redefinition of parental contributions in the city's childcare facilities and the application for admission to the federal government's Smart City funding.
Citizens are welcome, but must take coronavirus protection measures to heart.
Tim Zimmermann starts the new season with a lot of delay
Tim Zimmermann will start his premiere season in the ADAC GT Masters on 31 July with a delay of almost half a year.
Before the league of super sports cars can start regular operation, the first test drives were scheduled.
For Zimmermann, it was all about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3 better.
The corona crisis has long prevented Tim Zimmermann from embarking on his first business trip in Grasser Racing's new Lamborghini Huracan.
This was now possible under special hygiene conditions.
The 23-year-old Langenargener made his first laps at the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his premiere in the GT3 car.
"There are already a few things that are different from the Porsche from the previous season," says Zimmermann.
"With the ABS, for example, you have to go into the corners differently.
But it was really a lot of fun."
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite being only 25 years old, the Dutchman is already experienced in GT racing and has been able to help his new team-mate in many things.
"I'm not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series also brings new challenges," says Zimmermann.
"Steijn and I understand each other brilliantly and we have also made enormous progress from session to session at the Lausitzring."
Right there - at the Lausitzring - the GT Masters will also hold its first race.
From 31 July, the 33 super sports cars will race through Lusatia.
Zimmermann, who is one of 15 serial newcomers, knows the track.
In 2015, he was a guest at the Motodrom.
"It worked quickly and I didn't have to get used to the track," says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafen racing community Graf Zeppelin.
"The Lausitzring has many fast passages that you have to hit optimally to be fast."
It turns out in two weeks how fast Zimmermann really is.
"Of course, the teams play a little poker during the tests," he says.
"Finally, however, we are very satisfied and look forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring."
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a tightly packed calendar.
Seven races are scheduled until the beginning of November.
The current state is that no spectators will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
Ex-Formula 1 driver Niko Hülkenberg will enter the GT steering wheel at the Nürburgring in mid-August.
British Transport Minister caught cold by quarantine decision
The British government's decision to quarantine Spanish holidaymakers for two weeks after their return has caught the country's transport minister cold, according to press reports.
Grant Shapps is currently on holiday in Spain, of all places, while his colleagues at home decided on the measure on Saturday.
Due to the rising coronavirus numbers in Spain, the cabinet in London removed the country from the list of countries from which entry is possible without quarantine requirements.
The new regulation will apply from today, Sunday, so Shapps will also have to quarantine after his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures on returnees.
However, the scheme does not apply to those who are currently on holiday until Saturday, 1 August, and has not been introduced overnight.
Incidentally, Spain is still considered one of the "safe countries" in Austria for which no quarantine is required.
"Many ministers may have known in advance that there is a possibility of a quarantine being imposed on holidaymakers in Spain," commented Labour MP Diane Abbot.
"But apparently nobody bothered to tell Grant Shapps."
Less than a month after the end of the coronavirus emergency in Spain and the end of the strict curfew, the number of infections in the country is rising again.
Virologists mainly blame the nightlife for the renewed spread.
Spain is one of the favourite holiday destinations of the British.
The British government is currently advising against unnecessary travel to the Spanish mainland, except for the Canary Islands and Balearic Islands, which are particularly popular with British holidaymakers.
To date, more than 272,000 infections with the novel coronavirus and more than 28,000 deaths have been recorded in Spain.
Russia: Navy Day: Putin announces hypersonic weapons for warships
Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced that warships in his country will be equipped with state-of-the-art hypersonic weapons on Navy Day.
With these weapons, which are unique in the world, the combat capabilities of the Russian naval forces would be expanded, Putin said on Sunday in St. Petersburg at the central naval parade.
According to the Interfax agency, the Ministry of Defence also informed about successful tests of the Zircon hypersonic missile built for the navy.
The hypersonic weapons have a multiple of the speed of sound of around 343 metres per second.
They are considered weapons of the future.
Underwater tropedeo continues to be built
Construction will continue on the nuclear-equippable underwater torpedo Poseidon, it was said.
The planned sea drone is planned to destroy coastal targets.
The president, who himself also sailed in a military boat, said that this year alone 40 new ships would be put into service with the individual fleet units of the largest country in the world.
Russia has such a large coastal area as no other country in the world.
The navy has been protecting Russia reliably for 300 years, Putin said on the day celebrated by sailors nationwide.
The naval forces also celebrated Navy Day with parades in many other Russian coastal towns.
In Syria, where Russia is fighting alongside ruler Bashar al-Assad, the military demonstrated strength at an arms show in the Mediterranean port of Tartu.
Ammunition was also fired there.
A video published by the Ministry of Defence showed not only warships, including a submarine, but also combat helicopters and jets.
Hurricane "Hanna" reaches Texas: Help made more difficult because of corona
Washington - The first hurricane of this year's season over the Atlantic has made landfall in Texas.
Life-threatening floods, strong winds and heavy rainfall now threatened parts of the US state, the National Hurricane Center of the US climate agency NOAA announced during the night on Sunday (local time).
Governor Greg Abbott declared a state of emergency for many counties.
The coronavirus pandemic raging in Texas is making the work of aid workers more difficult, Abbott said, according to US media.
Evacuees called for caution
"Every hurricane is a tremendous challenge," Abbott said, according to the Houston Chronicle.
With regard to the cyclone in Texas, he added: "This challenge is complicated and exacerbated when you consider that it is sweeping through an area that is the most affected by COVID-19 in the state."
According to Johns Hopkins University, around 5,000 people have died in Texas alone as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.
Abbott called on people who had to leave their homes to be cautious.
They should not disregard practices "to which we have become accustomed," such as wearing masks, the governor said, according to CBS.
It was important that everyone kept their distance.
Therefore, hotel rooms were also provided in some places.
In addition, corona should be tested in emergency shelters.
Damage was initially reported only from the coastal town of Port Mansfield.
Storm warning withdrawn
With wind speeds of up to 150 kilometers per hour, according to authorities, "Hanna" hit land on the island of Padre Island just off the Texas coast.
The tropical storm had previously been upgraded to the lowest level one hurricane.
For the coastal section from Port Mansfield to Sargent, a storm surge warning was initially issued and later withdrawn.
Authorities expected a weakening, while "Hanna" moved further inland and headed for northeastern Mexico.
"Douglas" is moving towards Hawaii
In the Pacific, Hurricane "Douglas" was heading towards Hawaii during the night on Sunday with wind speeds of around 150 kilometres per hour.
The hurricane center, however, expected it to weaken further.
According to the forecast, it will be near Hawaii's largest islands on Sunday (local time) - then as a storm just below the hurricane threshold.
Over the Atlantic, NOAA expected an above-average hurricane season this year, according to a forecast from May.
From June to the end of November, up to ten hurricanes are expected, of which up to six could become very strong hurricanes, the agency had said.
On average, there are six hurricanes per year over the Atlantic, three of which develop into storms of great strength.
Given the available climate data and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, the probability of a normal season is only 30 percent, while a below-average season is only 10 percent, it was said at the time.
US President Donald Trump wrote via Twitter that his administration is closely monitoring the storms and is in contact with the affected states.
Four goals denied: video assistant "punished" Sassuolo
Sassuolo's Filip Djuricic were deprived of two goals
Naples - Four goals scored, four goals denied: Sassuolo Calcio experienced a raven-black evening at the 0:2 (0:1) at the SSC Napoli in the Italian football league Serie A - and was really angry with the video assistant of the referee.
"A festival of not given goals for Sassuolo.
The VAR has never been so tough on a team," commented Corriere dello Sport.
Hosts Naples had taken the lead through a goal from outside defender Elseid Hisaj in the 8th minute, with Filip Djuricic initially hailing the equaliser in the 32nd minute.
The Video Assistant Referee (VAR) took the hit back because of an offside position.
Five minutes later Djuricic shot the ball into the net again - again the VAR intervened.
The goals of attacker Francesco Caputo (50th) and Domenico Berardi (61st) were also withdrawn by the refereeing team after being informed by the VAR.
In the injury time Allan made the 2-0 final score for Naples and the bitter evening for Sassuolo perfect.
"For Sassuolo, the VAR is worse than a radar trap on the road and punishes Sassuolo like no other team before.
The new technology sets new records," writes the "Gazzetta dello Sport".
FC Bayern Munich: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start of the hot preparation phase for the Champions League began for double winner FC Bayern with a setback.
After a short holiday and a few days of training, Hansi Flick has to think about how he can rebuild his successful defence after the injury of world champion Benjamin Pavard.
The Frenchman, who has the third most minutes behind captain Manuel Neuer and midfield boss Joshua Kimmich, suffered a ligament injury at the left foot root and threatens to be missing in decisive premier class duels.
In the Munich dirty weather, the right-back broke off a training game and was driven off the course with a golf kart.
How long the unrestricted regular player has to pause in the fight for the title is open.
An appearance in the second leg against Chelsea on 8 August should be difficult, the 24-year-old can hope for the final tournament starting on 12 August in Lisbon.
The Bavarians, however, do not want to be stopped by the mishap from training on Sunday.
In his personal triple formula, Flick mentioned the three attributes he wants to see from his stars on their way to Portugal's capital.
Quality, intensity and concentration are to be shown by his victorious title collectors in the ideally following 28 days until the royal class final on 23 August.
"We have mastered the mandatory tasks with championship and cup simply excellently.
Now it's time to create something special," said Flick.
Until the Munich team can concretely deal with the final tournament and previously a training camp in the Algarve, however, it is time for the round of 16 against Chelsea FC.
After the 3:0 in the first leg before the corona break, the Londoners should not become the Bayern nightmare again in the home arena as in the lost "final dahoam" in 2012.
"We have to go through the door first.
We want to win, create good conditions and build confidence with a good game," demanded Flick.
A test to get in the mood is scheduled for Friday against Olympique Marseille.
With a long speech, Flick had sworn his stars, who had 13 days of vacation after the double, to a unique August.
He welcomed 31 players to Säbener Straße, including the new players around noble purchase Leroy Sané, who met all new colleagues on the pitch for the first time after his move from Manchester City.
"Like all newcomers, Leroy has fitted in well," reported Flick.
But instead of talking about the new season, when Sané & Co. are no longer only allowed to train, Flick preferred to talk about the current title project of the German series champion.
After days of individual and small group training, team strength is now being trained for the Londoners, who, in contrast to the Flick ensemble, are in playing rhythm.
After that, the Munich team could face a quarter-final against FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, in the semi-finals Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin are possible opponents.
A way to the final in Lisbon "is not that easy," stressed the head coach, who can rely on the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training from Tuesday.
World Cup record goalscorer Klose and Flick know about many a joint tournament preparation, which is particularly important in the 0 to 100 set-up.
With his current team, working is "a pleasure," praised Flick.
The "focus on winning" is an impressive characteristic of his team.
The tournament with nine teams was also ambitious on Sunday.
All of the top performers were there, including Thiago, who is willing to emigrate, and defender David Alaba, whose whereabouts are not assured beyond the royal class season.
Formula 1 needs a special rule to choose its world champion
Since it is not possible to drive on the required number of continents, the FIA has to improvise in order to award the world championship titles.
All American races were cancelled.
Race calendar is becoming more and more concrete
The racing calendar of the current Formula 1 season continues to take shape.
Three more race tracks were added to the ten confirmed Grand Prix so far during the week.
In October, races will be held at the Nürburgring in Germany and in the Portuguese city of Portimao.
On the first of November, Lewis Hamilton and Co. will fight for World Championship points at the traditional Italian race track in Imola.
This means that the 2020 race calendar currently comprises 13 races.
"We are pleased to continue to make great progress in finalizing our plans for the 2020 season," said Formula One boss Chase Carey.
A total of 15 to 18 races in the premier class of motorsport are to be completed in this extraordinary season.
Formula 1 wants to conclude its season in Asia.
The final race calendar is to be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
According to media reports, appearances in Vietnam and Malaysia could take place at the end of November before the officially targeted races in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December.
Regulations require races on three continents
However, Formula 1 regulations require at least races on three continents to be awarded the World Championship.
Even if, as currently planned, only two continents are driven, there is to be a world champion.
With the help of a special rule, the FIA wants to award the titles, citing "exceptional circumstances" due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The traditional start of the season in Australia in March had to be cancelled at short notice due to the impending coronavirus crisis.
A return to the continent this year is not an issue.
In addition, Formula 1 will not be a guest in America this year.
Cancellation met with criticism in Brazil
Due to the tense coronavirus situation, the races will not take place in Canada, the USA, Mexico and Brazil.
"We're looking forward to being with them again next season," Carey said.
The cancellation of the American races met with criticism, especially in Brazil: "The cancellation did not come as a surprise to us, but we cannot accept the reasons for it," said Tamas Rohonyi, promoter of the Grand Prix in Sao Paulo.
For example, the number of infections in the Sao Paulo area is significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
Furthermore, the concerns of some teams about not wanting to race in Brazil would not justify a rejection.
They are prepared for the required security measures.
Greta Thunberg: Evil look against Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest on Stephen Colbert's well-known late night show and revealed in an interview what she had in mind when she met Donald Trump.
Climate activist Greta Thunberg was a guest on a popular US latenight show via video.
Among other things, she talked about her struggle against the powerful of the world.
The teenager also talked about her famous "evil eye" when she met Donald Trump.
New York City - Over the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has attracted attention with her tireless commitment to the "Fridays For Future" movement.
Now she spoke on a well-known late-night show about her plans for the future and her meeting with US President Donald Trump at the UN climate summit last year.
Latenight host Stephen Colbert welcomed 17-year-old Thunberg to your show on Tuesday and conducted a lengthy interview with the Swede.
She spoke not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the world's powerful.
"There are some things that surprised me," she said.
"How far people go to steer the focus away from the climate crisis," she said.
"Everything from organized hate campaigns to threats just because a group of children takes to the streets," she said.
Heads of state and leading politicians who mock her on social media or even try to silence her find her "funny" because the reactions show her "because they have no other answer to it".
It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was approached about a well-known scene in which she cast a bitter look after US President Trump.
At the 2019 UN climate summit in New York, for which the actor sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive gaze was caught by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
The short clip resulted in a GIF, i.e. an animated image, which ultimately became one of the most frequently used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think about the US president at that moment?
To Stephen Colbert's relatively open question, she answered only briefly and dryly: "To be honest, I don't think that needs any further explanation."
The experienced satirist Colbert had probably not expected the quick-witted answer and briefly disappeared from the picture, laughing.
With her "How dare you?" speech on the principles of climate protection, she was remembered by many at the climate conference.
Ex-Dortmunder Immobile with three-pack for Lazio Rome
Ciro Immobile is now on par with Bavaria's Robert Lewandowski in the race for Europe's Golden Shoe.
Former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile still has the best chance of becoming top scorer in the Italian football championship.
The former BVB pro contributed three goals in Lazio Rome's 5-1 (1-1) win at Hellas Verona, including two converted penalties in the injury times of both halves.
This means that the 30-year-old from the fourth place in the table now has 34 goals of the season on his account - just as many were scored by Robert Lewandowski from Bayern Munich in the past Bundesliga season.
In Italy Cristiano Ronaldo follows with 30 goals so far, the Portuguese superstar met Sampdoria Genoa with the leader in the evening.
Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green has died
His life was like a roller coaster ride: After a rapid ascent with Fleetwood Mac, it went steeply downhill and then slowly uphill again.
Now the blues rock guitarist Peter Green has died at the age of 73.
Ingenious guitarist, drug junkie, cult follower: The co-founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully in his sleep at the age of 73, family members announced in an official statement on Saturday, a further statement would be announced for the next few days.
Top musicians such as Peter Frampton praised Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional reaction of a "monumental loss" for all former and current members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
The drummer Fleetwood and the guitarist Green had founded the now legendary band in London in 1967, his dreamy instrumental hit "Albatross" is still unforgettable today.
The musician's life ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") resembled a rollercoaster ride.
With Fleetwood Mac Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated their greatest successes but then without him.
Among other things, there was a dispute because Green wanted to donate all the profits of the group to charity.
He began to perform in wide robes and with a large crucifix.
Psychological problems are also said to have played a role.
Three years after its founding, Green left the band in 1970.
A social decline followed.
The blues rock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, as biographers reported.
For a long time, Green was treated in psychiatry.
For much of the 1970s, the musician disappeared from the scene.
He is said to have lived temporarily on the street, worked as a cemetery gardener and spent some time in an Israeli kibbutz.
Green was born in 1946 to a working-class Jewish family in Bethnal Green, London.
From an early age, he was enthusiastic about US blues musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At the age of eleven he learned the first guitar grips.
At the age of 15, the teenager began playing guitar professionally and five years later got the chance to be on stage as lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners.
Shortly afterwards, he was hired by the Bluesbreakers as a replacement for his idol Eric Clapton.
In the midst of the blues boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967 together with his Bluesbreakers colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross" composed by Green gave the group their first number one hit in the winter of 1968/69 and catapulted them to the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid rise soon showed its dark side: Green could not cope with the media hype, his experiments with the drug LSD became increasingly extreme.
He later commented on life between music and addiction in an interview: "The worst thing that happened to me in life is the drugs - the best thing was to land a number one hit."
Towards the end of the decade, Green was surprisingly successful in 1979 with an album inspired by religious themes.
Meanwhile, Fleetwood Mac swam without him in a new formation on a wave of success.
Their 1977 album "Rumours" sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Despite various small solo successes, Green did not make a major comeback until he started again in 1996 with a group of friendly musicians.
The British "Daily Telegraph" spoke at the time of a rock star who had returned to Earth.
Free of drugs, Green released several albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group until the band broke up in 2004.
For music experts, he was already a blues legend during his lifetime - and with his gentle sound one of the most influential guitarists of the past decades.
