Biker reacts at lightning speed and prevents worse
On Friday evening, a traffic accident occurred on the road between Machtolsheim and Merklingen, in which a motorcyclist was only slightly injured thanks to his quick reaction.
Motorist overlooks biker
At 9.30 p.m. a 44-year-old driver wanted to turn left with her VW coming from Merklingen onto Landesstraße 1230 in the direction of Machtolsheim.
Here she overlooked the 24-year-old motorcyclist coming from the direction of Nellingen.
Hand and foot brake levers fly away during the collision
The biker tried to avoid the car, but still grazed it at the rear of the vehicle.
Due to the strip process, the hand and foot brake levers on the Suzuki were torn off and the driver was no longer able to brake.
Mentally, he steered his motorcycle in the green stiffness next to the road and let it roll out there without falling.
Biker suffers leg injury
Due to the collision with the car, the biker nevertheless suffered an injury to the Beim and had to be treated in a clinic.
Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 harvesters infected
After a Corona mass infection on a large vegetable farm in Mamming, Lower Bavaria, almost 500 people are under quarantine and are no longer allowed to leave the farm.
A security service monitors the ban on going out.
A total of 174 harvesters tested positive for the Corona pathogen Sars-CoV-2 during the series examination, as reported by the district office of Dingolfing-Landau on Saturday evening.
"In order to avoid further spread, we unfortunately have to take this step to protect the population", explained District Administrator Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Previously, seven employees had already been infected in the company - this was the reason for the series test.
The farm is a large vegetable farm that grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and beetroot - but the cucumbers only for insertion jars.
Mamming is a rural community with about 3300 inhabitants not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW plant.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to keep calm: "According to our information, it is a closed group of people."
In the courtyard, infected persons were separated from uninfected employees and the area is now surrounded by a barrier fence.
The Greens and SPD gave the state government co-responsibility.
The two opposition factions accused Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet of neglecting the control of the shelters of seasonal workers.
"This can take bitter revenge if such local infections have to spread and regional lockdowns have to be ordered", said Jürgen Mistol, parliamentary managing director of the Green Party.
The SPD takes a very similar view: "After the Corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof slaughterhouse in mid-May, we have already called for a special control program for farms with harvesters", said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
From our point of view, the hygiene conditions in the workplace and living conditions in particular need to be closely controlled.
That obviously didn't happen. "
The outbreak came "with announcement."
Underground station Aidenbachstraße: Dangerous dispute: 19-year-old falls into the track bed after Schubser
In a dispute between two youth groups at the Aidenbachstraße underground station, a 19-year-old fell through a push and slipped into the track bed.
Obersendling - On Friday there was a dispute between two youth groups at the underground station Aidenbachstraße at around 4.15 p.m.
A passerby alerted the police, who arrived with several patrols.
According to an initial investigation, a man from Munich (17) pushed a 19-year-old to the ground.
The young man slid over the edge of the platform and fell into the track bed.
People from the 17-year-old's group helped the fallen man climb out of the track.
There was no danger from an incoming train.
According to the police, there were again clashes between the two persons.
The 17-year-old initially fled the crime scene, but his personal details could be determined afterwards.
Accompanied by his father, he went to Police Inspectorate 29.
The 17-year-old is being investigated for assault.
Report: Seehofer pushes for longer data retention
Data retention is currently suspended.
According to a media report, however, Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer calls for an extension of the storage period.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
According to a media report, Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer (CSU) calls for extended data retention - instead of the planned ten weeks half a year.
As the "Bild am Sonntag" reports, Seehofer asked Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht (SPD) in a letter for a quick change in the law.
Accordingly, Seehofer wants to strengthen the measures against child abuse.
He considers it useful to make urgently needed adjustments to the law now, "the newspaper quotes from the letter.
Data retention is currently suspended.
A decision by the ECJ is expected.
Seehofer, however, wants the changes beforehand so that they could be applied immediately after a possible positive judgment, the report continues.
A spokesperson for the Ministry of Justice told the newspaper that it could only be meaningful to examine whether legal adjustments were needed if the courts had decided.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer, together with the interior ministers of the federal states, had already spoken out in favour of data retention in June.
NBA strip club trouble for Clippers star Lou Williams
Excitement in the NBA!
Lou Williams (33), basketball professional of the Los Angeles Clippers, is said to have left the tournament quarter in Disney World in Orlando / Florida with permission for a funeral.
According to US media reports, he visited the strip club "Magic City" in Atlanta in the evening.
Williams, who is said to have admitted the visit according to ESPN, is back in Isloation, is being tested daily for Covid-19.
His reason for visiting: Chicken Wings.
In February last year, "Sweet Lou", as he is called in the NBA, has already expressed his love for exactly these wings.
The American wrote: "Magic City and Blue Flame (another strip club in Atlanta) have the best wings in the city."
NBA insider Shams Charania announced on Twitter on Sunday that the NBA Williams has ordered a ten-day quarantine.
Thus, the Clippers star misses the first two official games after the test match phase.
In Disney World, the NBA wants to end the Corona season.
Currently, the best 22 teams with training games are preparing for the season finale starting on Friday night.
Söder comments on the Corona situation after mass infection
Munich - Health Minister Melanie Huml (CSU) has already announced a test offensive for large farms on Sunday.
The press conference will be shown live on our homepage.
The case in Mamming in the district of Dingolfing-Landau has startled authorities and politicians.
Almost 500 harvesters from several countries are currently working on the large vegetable farm, and more than a third have been infected with the Corona pathogen.
The farm is now under quarantine and is cordoned off with a construction fence.
No one is allowed to leave the premises, food is delivered.
The authorities now offer free Corona tests to the 3,300 residents of the municipality.
Since the harvesters had little contact with the local population, the district office so far assumes that the infections did not spread beyond the farm.
Confession of the alleged arsonist of Nantes
"My client has shown himself to be cooperative", lawyer Quentin Chabert told the newspaper.
The defense attorney added: "He very much regrets the deeds, the confession was a liberation for him."
His mandate was "plagued by remorse and very much taken away by the extent of the destruction."
If convicted, according to the prosecutor's office, the man faces ten years imprisonment and a fine of 150,000 euros.
The Gothic St. Peter and Paul Cathedral in Nantes was badly damaged in a fire during the night to Saturday last week.
The fire broke out in three places far apart in the church.
Laboratory tests confirmed the suspicion of arson.
The now imprisoned suspect had already been arrested a few hours after the fire.
He was released after one day.
The man works as a volunteer for the diocese of Nantes and was responsible for the closure of the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
Since there was no trace of a violent intrusion into the church, he quickly became the focus of attention of the investigators.
Discuss abolition of the 50 + 1 rule
Former DFB President Reinhard Grindel has recommended that we consider the abolition of the 50 + 1 rule.
"German football should at least discuss setting conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates a fait accompli", Grindel told the "Bild am Sonntag."
He stressed: "For the clubs that are most likely to be dangerous to Bavaria and Dortmund, the 50 + 1 rules do not work anyway: See Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, one cannot avoid the debate as to whether it is not necessary to make it easier for associations that want to break into this phalanx to involve investors. "
However, he has doubts as to whether there is a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority shareholdings, which are prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50 + 1 rule.
"It remains a legal risk to pull investment fences around the Bundesliga as a business location in a European internal market", said Grindel.
The former DFB boss sees the danger that "the attempts to ensure more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will ultimately only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but will not lead to more excitement in the championship."
Even an equal distribution of TV funds will not have a decisive effect.
FC Bayern generates a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million.
So the differences are already immense among the first three clubs alone.
The other 15 clubs have an average budget of 130 million", explained the 58-year-old.
Looking at the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Unfortunately, there have been people who have noticed this mistake and pierced the press instead of addressing me about it", said Grindel about the acceptance of an expensive watch that led to his resignation in April 2019.
"That has preoccupied me humanly."
He had received the gift worth around 11,000 euros from a Ukrainian official.
"I committed a compliance violation, and it was right to draw the conclusions from it", said Grindel.
I handled the ominous watch gift completely transparently and unsuspectingly.
Many people in the DFB knew about it.
He never "made a secret of the gift", assured the 58-year-old.
"This may be called naive, but this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption."
"Black Lives Matter": Injured and one dead
The protests against police violence in the United States have been exacerbated by Donald Trump's deployment of federal police officers in several cities.
On Saturday there were clashes between demonstrators and police in various cities.
Three people were injured in Louisville and 16 in Seattle.
In Austin, one person was killed by gunfire while a march was just crossing an intersection.
Previously, there had been clashes again in Portland during protests against racism and police violence.
The security forces, including officers from the Federal Police, used tear gas on Saturday night and forcibly drove demonstrators apart.
Hundreds of demonstrators, partly armed, marched through Louisville in Kentucky on Saturday, demanding that those responsible for the death of Breonna Taylor be held accountable.
The 26-year-old student was shot dead during a drug raid at her home in Louisville in March.
The target of the raid was someone else who did not live there and no drugs were found.
When a member of a group that describes itself as an armed alliance of black Americans fired a shot on Saturday, three people were injured.
According to NBC, they were taken to the hospital.
None of them were in mortal danger.
The police set up barricades because counter-demonstrators of a white militia had also formed.
In the end, there was no clash between the two groups.
In Austin, Texas, one person was shot and died during a "Black Lives Matter" demonstration.
The police said they took a suspect into custody.
She has not yet provided any further information on the circumstances of the crime.
According to the New York Times, Mayor Steve Adler said that, like many in the city, he was "inconsolable and stunned" by what had happened.
Demonstrators also clashed with the police in the American metropolis of Seattle on Saturday.
They set fire to trailers in front of a juvenile prison, and the police used stun grenades and pepper spray.
According to the Seattle Times, 16 people were arrested for resisting police officers or assault.
A courthouse was set on fire in the city of Oakland, California.
A small group of demonstrators smashed windows, shot down fireworks and blinded police officers with lasers, Oakland police said late Saturday night (local time).
The fire was quickly extinguished.
In Aurora, a suburb of Denver in Colorado, a car drove through a crowd demonstrating on a highway.
According to the police, one of the protesters fired a gun and at least one person was taken to hospital injured.
In addition, windows were smashed in a court and a fire was set, according to the police.
Investigations have been started.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historical costumes defy Corona
Although the big show in the spa town was missing, visitors and performers enjoyed the Rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, performers and organizers: The Rakoczy weekend without Rakoczy festival.
But even if the big party mile in the city center was missing, the crowds and program highlights such as Saale burns, Rakoczy ball or parade, many got their money's worth with the Corona-compliant alternative program.
"I think we have succeeded in spreading the Rakoczy flair", says spa director Sylvie Thormann.
The guests would have accepted it well.
In principle, one returns to the beginnings of the Rakoczy festival, when the historical ones alone were the focus of the festival.
Pleasant atmosphere
Vesna Konhäuser and her husband have been visiting Bad Kissingen for the Rakoczy Festival for more than 25 years.
This is also the case this time in the Corona year.
The couple have made themselves comfortable at the Luitpold Casino, watching the historical ones stroll and listening to the Cuban live music at the casino restaurant.
"I also find it quite pleasant", says Konhäuser.
She doesn't miss the crowds that otherwise belong to Rakoczy.
But it lacks the usual program highlights, especially Saale burns on Friday evening as well as the historic parade and the final fireworks display on Sunday evening.
That's a pity.
The weather would have been great this year", she says.
Rakoczy equestrian tournament to take place again
For the performers of the historical spa guests, the alternative program sometimes meant more work.
For example, for Christina Gold, who takes part in the parade in a normal year and can be seen there on the carriage of the Kurgartencafé.
This year she was walking in the city on Saturdays and Sundays in costume.
"It's more exhausting, otherwise we'll have it easier", she says.
The equestrian club had less to do, even if individual riders were traveling in the park.
"We very much hope that the equestrian quadrille will take place again next year", says the chairwoman Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that after a break of several years, a Rakoczy equestrian tournament will take place again in 2021.
28 Corona cases with Spanish second division club Fuenlabrada
The Spanish second division football club CF Fuenlabrada is sliding deeper and deeper into the crisis due to a Corona outbreak.
Since the newcomer from near Madrid flew to the city of A Coruña for a match on July 20, despite the first Corona cases, one low blow follows the next.
By Sunday, 28 players or team members had tested positive, one was hospitalized, according to the club.
Fuenlabrada from the city of the same name southwest of Madrid still had the chance to reach the promotion playoffs.
Now even the relegation to the B group of the Second League is threatening.
The match against Deportivo La Coruña last Monday was cancelled at the last moment, the prosecutor's office is investigating a possible crime against public health, the top sports authority CSD is considering the forced relegation of the club.
The players and other team members are quarantined in a hotel.
"Until the sixth day of quarantine, they did not receive a fresh towel or gel", wrote the sports newspaper "AS."
Photos show how players hung up underwear and club clothes in their rooms in the hotel to dry, after they apparently had to wash them themselves.
Also, the bed linen was not changed for five days.
Another problem is food.
It is neither good nor sufficient, wrote "AS."
The club management, on the other hand, said that they were satisfied with the hotel.
The club's lawyer, Javier Tebas Llanas, rejected the accusation of intentionally endangering public health.
They did not violate the Corona rules laid down by the football association, stressed the son of the president of the Spanish Primera Division, Javier Tebas, as reported by the news agency Europa Press and the sports newspaper "Marca."
Before departure, there were four people infected by July 19, but all of them were isolated and did not travel with them.
Right before the flight to A Coruña on Monday, all players and team members were tested again.
When the team was already in A Coruña, "five or six" other team members of the Corona test were positive.
The game was cancelled 60 minutes before the kick-off, said Tebas Llanas.
Police have to catch horses torn out at Dampfach
Two animals were on the road.
The police took her back to her owner.
On Sunday morning shortly before 6 o'clock a road user informed two freewheeling horses on the feeder between the junction Donnersdorf / Steinsfeld and the motorway junction Theres.
When the officials arrived, the horses were already back between the feeder and the village of Dampfach.
After the trust of the horses could be gained by the officials shortly before Dampfach, they each had a rope carried in the patrol car put on.
Professional cyclist Tony Martin: Career continuation imaginable
Time trial specialist Tony Martin is thinking about continuing his career.
Frankfurt / Main - Seven-time time trial world champion Tony Martin can imagine continuing his cycling career.
"I am currently staking out the framework conditions with the team, how and in what form it could continue", the 35-year-old told the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung."
Martin is currently employed by the Dutch team Jumbo-Visma and had considered ending his career after this year before the Corona break.
Negotiations with his team are also about the number of race days, he said.
Or other problems that would plague him as a family man, said Martin.
He used to get up after a fall and the first thought was: "Quickly back on the bike.
Today, as the father of a young daughter, I think: "What if."
The professional cyclist acknowledged that there are definitely aspects with which he is increasingly struggling.
But it was good for me to realize from the Corona time what I have about cycling and how much fun I enjoy it.
The time trial specialist returns to the competition at the Tour de l'Ain (5 to 9 August).
Bavaria: At least four dead on Bavaria's streets at the weekend
The beautiful weather attracts bikers to the streets in many places.
For at least three people, the tour by motorcycle ends fatally.
An 18-year-old pedestrian also dies.
Schönthal - Several mostly young people died in accidents on Bavaria's roads over the weekend.
An 18-year-old motorcyclist was hit by a car in the opposite lane near Schönthal (Cham district) on Saturday.
Why the car got into the opposite lane was initially unclear.
In Upper Bavaria on Saturday, a 22-year-old collided with a horse-drawn carriage on his plane.
According to the police, he was downhill at Beilngries.
In a left turn he hit the carriage.
His injuries were so severe that he died at the scene of the accident.
Of the twelve occupants of the carriage, one man was seriously injured and one man was slightly injured, according to the police.
In another fatal accident, an 18-year-old died in Bad Kötzting, Upper Palatinate.
He had laid down on a road on Sunday night and was rolled over by a 42-year-old driver.
According to the police, the 18-year-old wanted to sleep.
The driver could not brake in time.
Near Schönberg (Freyung-Grafenau district) on Saturday a 57-year-old biker crashed head-on into a car in a right turn despite full braking.
He died at the scene of the accident.
The 57-year-old driver suffered a shock and the remaining three people in the car were uninjured.
The safety of motorcyclists was discussed on Saturday by Bavaria's Minister of Transport Kerstin Schreyer (CSU).
In a letter to the organiser of the biker protests against driving bans announced for August, Gabor Kovacs, the minister referred to extensive investments such as underrun protection on guardrails and the defusing of dangerous curves.
"We have achieved a great deal for the safety of motorcyclists in recent years", the letter said.
The number of motorized cyclists killed decreased by around 28 percent compared to 2011.
Kovac tests with Monaco against Frankfurt
Frankfurt / Main (dpa) - For football coach Niko Kovac there will soon be a reunion with Eintracht Frankfurt with his new club AS Monaco.
The eight-time French champion will be a guest on August 1 (6 p.m.) at the Hessen, the former club of the Croatian.
For the Bundesliga club it is the first and only endurance test before the return leg in the Europa League against FC Basel (6 August).
Because of the coronavirus pandemic, the encounter is held without spectators.
We are particularly looking forward to this game.
It's always nice to come to Frankfurt and meet friends", explained Kovac.
In sporting terms, this is an interesting test, said the 48-year-old.
Before joining FC Bayern Munich, Kovac had coached Hesse from 2016 to 2018 and led them to victory in the DFB-Pokal.
A top-class opponent like Monaco is a good test for us with regard to the game against Basel.
Like all Frankfurt residents, I am looking forward to seeing Niko Kovac again", said Eintracht coach Adi Hütter.
The 50-year-old Austrian had succeeded the Croat at Eintracht.
In March, the Frankfurt team lost the round-of-16 first leg against Basel in their own stadium 3-0.
Almost 50 new infections: Landkreis Hof just past the lockdown
In the district of Hof, the number of known new Corona infections has increased further over the weekend: From 39 on Friday and 43 on Saturday (one person has recovered and is no longer included in these statistics) to 47 on Sunday.
In addition, there is a case in the city of Hof.
This brings the Hof area closer to the critical mark of 50 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants in one week.
700 killed by monsoon rains in Southeast Asia
More than 9 million people are affected by the severe flooding in Southeast Asia, mainly in Bangladesh, India and Nepal.
Due to the heavy monsoon rain, a total of 700 people were killed.
In Bangladesh, the Red Crescent is trying to reach the isolated people in boats.
Whole villages are under water.
The farmers have lost their crops.
Tank rhinos in national park die from landslides
In the Kaziranga National Park, several of the 120 tank rhinos died from landslides.
They are under protection and are considered to be endangered by extinction.
This year, the floods are particularly bad, which scientists attribute to climate change.
According to the United Nations, Bangladesh is one of the countries most affected by global warming.
New apartments are empty
In the village of Cox's Bazar in the south of Bangladesh, the state has built apartments for 650 people displaced by the floods.
So far, only a few have moved in.
It's difficult to bring people to Cox's Bazar.
The enthusiasm also persists in Grenezn.
Anyone who used to have a house, no matter how small it was and resembled a hut, often does not want to spend their lives in a large block of flats.
Many apartments are empty, but - as the government wants it - will soon be occupied by those who have lost their homes due to the floods.

Argentina rejects counter-offer from creditors
The new demands could not be met, the Ministry of Economy in Buenos Aires announced on Saturday.
This would not only be irresponsible but also unfair, according to a statement.
While 50 percent of children in Argentina live in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors.
The debt of the second largest economy in South America is no longer sustainable under current conditions.
That is why Argentina is asking its private creditors to waive some of their claims of around 66 billion US dollars (around 59 billion euros).
If no agreement is reached, the country is once again threatened with bankruptcy.
It would be the ninth default in Argentine history.
Most recently, lenders had called for higher interest rates on government bonds and changes to some contractual clauses.
However, the Argentine government is sticking to its last offer and is not prepared to make any further concessions.
Argentina is experiencing a severe financial and economic crisis.
The inflation rate has recently been more than 50 percent.
Experts expect economic power to decline by around ten percent for the current year.
At the end of May, Argentina had not settled interest claims amounting to 503 million US dollars and had thus slipped into a limited default.
Arrived professionally - not yet in private
"It's going super well" - this is the conclusion drawn by Dr. Stefanie Kramer after her first days at the notary's office in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything went very quickly: In mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she will succeed Lutz Feller at the Eggenfelden notary office.
Six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the lawyer with a doctorate in law started work, and normal day-to-day business has long been in full swing.
"However, I still have to arrive", she explains in conversation with the Rottaler Anzeiger and laughs.
Of course, the short lead time was not enough to relocate the centre of life from Regensburg completely to Eggenfelden, reports the native Dingolfinger.
Currently, she and her husband, who works as a judge at the district court in Regensburg, are looking for a suitable apartment or a house in the city.
At least her husband was able to apply for parental leave at short notice in order to ensure the care of the two daughters (3 1⁄2 and 1 1⁄2 years old).
In order not to have to commute every day from Regensburg, she also has an overnight stay with her parents in Dingolfing, explains the 39-year-old.
Growing up in the neighbouring district, the city of Eggenfelden has of course been known to her for a long time.
During visits on site with her family in recent months, she noticed again: "Eggenfelden is a really beautiful small town."
She was all the more pleased that she made the race in the selection process for the vacancy.
Her native Lower Bavaria also plays a central role in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's professional career: After studying law in Passau, she completed her legal traineeship and the 2nd state examination in Regensburg.
After several positions as a notary assessor, among others in Rehau and Hof in Upper Franconia, Babenhausen in the Lower Allgäu and Regensburg - during this time she also "incidentally" shouldered her doctorate in employment law - she took up her first position as a notary in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau in 2012.
In 2016 she went on parental leave, followed by the move to Regensburg.
Since then, she has taken over representative services in various notary offices.
When the position in Eggenfelden was advertised due to the approaching retirement of Lutz Feller, she saw the right time for full career re-entry, explains the 39-year-old.
The team of her predecessor, who will take over the holiday representation at the notary's office in the future, has completely taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer - and immediately has praise for the firm's team: "It's going super well!"
The fact that she can rely on well-rehearsed processes makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming relocation of the private centre of life.
When it comes to kindergarten and nursery places, she has already contacted a local institution.
And if everything works out as desired, she hopes to be able to pursue her hobby here soon - and get to know the most beautiful jogging tracks in the Rottal valley.
BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be 20 percent filled at the start of the season in the event of a fan return.
Due to the distance control, which is mandatory to comply with, we are currently planning with 12,000 to 15,000 spectators, Borussia Dortmund's managing director Carsten Cramer told the "Tagesspiegel."
Normally, the arena in the district city holds just over 81,000 spectators at Bundesliga matches.
In the ghost games caused by the Corona pandemic last season, BVB lost around four million euros per game.
The Cramer, who is responsible for marketing, digitization and internationalization at BVB, hopes that in addition to the normal audience seats, some of the approximately 4000 seats in the hospitality area can be opened again: "It is of course a blow to the office if these revenues break away completely."
In view of the ongoing Corona crisis, everyone is currently "well advised to take a stable side length."
"If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people in Germany alone are in short-time work, then the need for entertainment is limited", explained Cramer.
The head of marketing in Dortmund praised the BVB professionals for their partial salary waiver, which should help to overcome the crisis: "Of course, the players know that their salary waiver has a different effect than if we put 100 people who work in merchandising on short-time work."
Tiny miracles: Early start to life with a few hundred grams
Barely heavier than a packet of butter, just three tablespoons of blood in his entire body: That was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The boy is one of about 400 premature babies who are cared for annually at the Graz Children's Hospital.
A quarter of them weigh less than 1,500 grams, a few - like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael - are extreme lightweights with less than one kilogram of birth weight.
They are so small and born so early that neither lungs, nor intestines, nor muscles are fully developed.
Their skin is sometimes so delicate that they could injure the electrodes of an ECG.
And they are so tiny that they sometimes wear doll's clothes and mini diapers specially made for them.
But not so small that they wouldn't be in voice - "and how", smiles Berndt Urlesberger.
Even if of course they don't scream as loudly as big babies.
When the whiteboard becomes a stage
Despite Corona Theater in the classroom, the 9th grades of the Sankt-Jakobus-Gymnasium in Abtsgmünd experienced the whiteboard as a stage shortly before the start of the holiday.
Actress Julia Sylvester from the Theater der Stadt Aalen presented the production "The Home Dress" to the pupils - via video.
Afterwards, the students were able to exchange ideas about the play and the performance via Skype with the actress and the director Winfried Tobias.
The idea for the performance format from the current Corona situation was born.
Teacher Teresa Nar was happy about the enrichment of the lessons.
Even if all participants agreed at the end that the direct encounter in the theatre and stage space would offer additional stimuli, the theatre also sees the potential for contact with the schools.
"If we further improve the technical framework, this could be an interesting addition to the game operation", said director Winfried Tobias.
First round drawn: TSV 1860 would face Eintracht Frankfurt in the DFB-Pokal
Should TSV 1860 qualify for the DFB-Pokal, the Lions will face Eintracht Frankfurt in the first round.
This resulted in the draw on Sunday.
Munich - Sixty possible opponents in the first round of the DFB-Pokal have been determined.
The Lions would face Eintracht Frankfurt in a successful qualification.
This was the result of the draw on Sunday evening at the ARD-Sportschau.
Because the field of participants is not yet complete due to the Corona pandemic, placeholders were used in the draw.
Due to the voluntary renunciation of semi-final opponents FC Memmingen, TSV 1860 is already in the final of the Bavarian Toto Cup (4 or 5 September).
There the lions meet either the Würzburger Kickers or Viktoria Aschaffenburg.
Should second division side Würzburg reach the final, Sixty would already have qualified for the first round of the DFB-Pokal.
Otherwise, the Giesinger would have to prevail in the final against Regionalliga club Aschaffenburg.
The first round of the DFB-Pokal will be held between 11 and 14 September, one week before the start of the third league.
Gone with the Wind: Film legend Olivia de Havilland is dead
Film legend and Oscar winner Olivia de Havilland is dead.
She died of natural causes on Sunday in Paris at the age of 104, confirmed her spokeswoman for the German Press Agency.
De Havilland was known for her role as Melanie Hamilton in the southern epic "Gone with the Wind" (1939).
Born in Tokyo, Olivia de Havilland moved to California as a toddler.
The Austrian theatre man Max Reinhardt discovered the 19-year-old in the role of Hermia of Shakespeare's "Midsummer Night' s Dream."
The film studio Warner Brothers signed her for seven years and brought her out big alongside Eroll Flynn.
She made eight films with the Heartbreaker.
In 1946 she won her first Oscar in the lead role of "To Each His Own."
The film was shown in Germany under the title "Mother's Heart."
Three years later, the award for Best Actress came in William Wyler's "The Heiress" (The Heiress).
She also received a lot of recognition as a neurotic eccentric in "The Dark Mirror" and "The Snake Pit."
Daphne du Maurier suggested her in 1952 for the lead role in the film adaptation of her novel "My Cousin Rachel."
The piece was a worldwide success.
She played with her longtime boyfriend Bette Davis in "Lullaby for a Corpse."
The son Benjamin emerged from his marriage to the writer Marcus Goodrich (1946 to 1953).
In Paris, de Havilland married the journalist Pierre Paul Galante and had his daughter Gisèle with him.
This marriage also broke up.
However, rumors of an affair with former British Prime Minister Edward Heath have never been confirmed.
"Road to Timmendorf": Beach volleyball: Thole / Wickler miss final on comeback
The World Cup second Julius Thole and Clemens Wickler missed the final at the beach volleyball tournament "Road to Timmendorf."
At the meeting of the top teams in Düsseldorf they lost in the semi-finals to their national team colleagues Nils Ehlers and Lars Flüggen with 1: 2 (17: 21, 21: 17, 19: 21).
Most recently, Thole / Wickler played at the World Tour Final in Rome in September last year.
In the final on the Rhine their conquerors Ehlers / Flüggen claimed a defeat against the surprise team Lukas Pfretschner and his interim partner Steven van de Velde with 0: 2 (17: 21, 17: 21).
In addition to the show tournament, three starting places for the German championships were played at the beginning of September in Timmendorfer Strand: The tickets were secured by Armin Dollinger / Simon Kulzer, Manuel Harms / Richard Peemüller and Simon Pfretschner / Milan Sievers.
Kalbitz ejection from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "Feigenblatt"
From the point of view of the FDP, the expulsion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is only a "fig leaf" and does not change the character of the party.
The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the right-wing extremists in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the tip of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD", the FDP domestic politician Benjamin Strasser told the news agency dpa in Berlin.
On Saturday in Stuttgart, after several hours of hearing, the Federal Arbitration Court of the AfD confirmed the exclusion of Kalbitz, which was decided by a majority of the federal executive board in May.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD parliamentary group in the Brandenburg state parliament.
"If the AfD were really interested in consistently removing right-wing extremists from their party, officials such as Björn Höcke and his supporters would have been expelled long ago", said Strasser.
"However, there is no political will for this in the AfD, because right-wing extremism now belongs to the party."
CSU General Secretary Markus Blume commented similarly: "The fact that Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded does not say anything and does not change anything", he told the "Welt am Sonntag."
"Rather, it speaks volumes about how many frenetic supporters a right-wing extremist still has in the middle of the AfD."
Blume assumes that the AfD will again end up below five percent in elections in the future.
"The days of the AfD in the parliaments are numbered."
Kalbitz was one of the spokesmen of the officially dissolved "wing" around the Thuringian AfD state and parliamentary group chairman Björn Höcke; the Protection of the Constitution classifies the coronation as "assured right-wing extremist aspiration."
In May, the AfD federal executive had thrown Kalbitz out of the party.
As a reason he stated that Kalbitz did not specify an earlier membership in the now banned far-right "Heimattreuen Deutsche Jugend" (HDJ) and the Republicans when he joined the party.
Kalbitz denies membership in the HDJ.
The chairman of the left parliamentary group in the Brandenburg state parliament, Sebastian Walter, also stressed that the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court did not change the character of the AfD: "The wolf has only eaten chalk.
The AfD remains a far-right party, whether with or without Kalbitz.
Neither the federal party nor the right wing will be weakened with this decision.
The manoeuvre of the Meuthen troupe is transparent.
They want to avoid further observation by the Protection of the Constitution and try to get through under the radar", said Walter.
The AfD will not get rid of the ghosts it called.
An expulsion does not change anything, "commented the Brandenburg SPD general secretary Erik Stohn on the decision in the Kalbitz case.
"Here the AfD state association and the faction held to their right-wing leader to this day."
The legal dispute over Kalbitz's membership in the AfD will continue.
He announced on Saturday that he would now take civil action against the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court.
North Sea wind farms supply a good 21 percent more electricity
The wind power plants on the German North Sea fed 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity into the grid in the first six months of the year.
This is a good 21 percent more than in the same period last year, said the network operator Tennet in Bayreuth.
TenneT is responsible for transmitting North Sea electricity to the mainland and transmitting it through the German electricity grid.
The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which do not belong to Tennet's grid area, have fed in a further 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
Overall, wind power from the North Sea and Baltic Sea comes to 13.73 TWh, compared to a good 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind harvest at sea thus accounts for almost 19 percent of the total wind power in Germany, which is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms ensure higher generation capacities
In addition to wind conditions, the increased contribution of offshore wind energy results from higher generation capacities, because new wind farms have been connected to the grid over the past twelve months.
If the 1270 wind power plants in the North Sea were all running at full power at the same time, they could generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient for this; according to Tennet, it is 7.1 gigawatts.
It is expected to rise to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea by 2030.
"In Germany and the Netherlands, we are investing 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore grid connections", said Tennet Managing Director Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, even at sea, wind farms cannot exploit their capacity, but reach about 40 percent.
The record day so far this year is January 2, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind turbines produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, which corresponds to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could supply nearly seven million households with electricity.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the Gmünder Kunstverein.
This was almost a small anniversary celebration for the 130th anniversary.
Birthday of the Gmünder Kunstverein: The opening of the exhibition "Skirmish" with works by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold went beyond the usual scope after the Corona break.
Many more art lovers than usual followed the dialogue between the artist and the chairman of the Kunstverein, Professor Dr. Klaus Ripper.
The musical equivalent was provided by the band "Defenders of the Universe" on the southern Kornhausplatz.
North of the gallery the association "Sandtogether" was involved.
Freital: Windbergfest cancelled due to Corona
The Windberg Festival will not take place this year.
The city of Freital has cancelled the three-day festival planned in September.
In other years, over 30,000 people had attended this city festival.
"We really did not make this decision easy for ourselves and - knowing how difficult it is economically for those involved - hoped until the last minute", explained Lord Mayor Uwe Rumberg (non-party).
But ultimately, as an organizer, we are responsible for the health of many thousands of people.
Because if tens of thousands had flocked to the festival grounds and the marquee, minimum distances, hygiene regulations and contact tracking in accordance with the current Coronaschutz regulation could not have been complied with.
Or the restrictions would have been so strong that there would not have been much left of a folk festival.
In addition, the organizational and monitoring effort would increase disproportionately many times over.
Rumberg consoled to next year.
Then the city of Freital will celebrate its 100th anniversary with the Winterberg Festival from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the Day of the Saxons from 10 to 12 September 2021.
Olympic dressage champion Werth in Achleiten not to be beaten
Achleiten - Six-time Olympic champion Isabell Werth was the outstanding rider at the dressage tournament in Achleiten, Austria.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg scored four victories in four starts over the weekend.
After winning a Grand Prix at the start with Weihegold and Quantaz, she was also unbeatable on Sunday in the Grand Prix Special and in the freestyle.
On the 15-year-old mare Weihegold Werth clearly prevailed on Sunday in the special against the Austrian Victoria Max-Theurer on Abegglen.
The German was also clearly ahead of her 34-year-old student Victoria Max-Theurer in the freestyle on Saturday on Quantaz.
Werth's winning horse Quantaz belongs to Max-Theurer.
The most successful dressage rider in the world is to establish the ten-year-old stallion in the Grand Prix.
It was Quantaz's first freestyle ever.
Werth had already won all important four tests at the first tournament in Achleiten three weeks ago.
The last of the three international tournaments is scheduled for August 14-16.
More air traffic controllers in Worms in the future
The University of Applied Sciences in Worms goes further into the air: The "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" donates a professorship for "Air Traffic Management."
A corresponding contract between the university and DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially concluded for three years and will start in 2021.
The professorship makes it possible to start studies not only in the summer semester but also in the winter semester.
This means that twice as many students can be trained as before.
At the same time, capacities at both the university and the DFS Air Traffic Control Academy will be utilized evenly.
DFS will advise the university on setting up and filling the professorship.
Represented at the university since 2019
Since the summer semester 2019, the first students have been in the Air Traffic Management program as part of their training as an air traffic controller at Worms University of Applied Sciences.
Nine students have already started this year.
So far, DFS's experience has been very positive and the students' achievements are excellent.
The combination of studies and pilot training contributes significantly to further increasing the attractiveness of the pilot profession.
In these times, promotion is not easy for us economically.
However, we firmly expect air traffic to recover and grow again in the long term.
In order to continue to fulfil our statutory mandate in the future, we need highly qualified personnel", says Professor Klaus-Dieter SCHEURLE, Chairman of DFS at the signing of the contract.
For DFS, the endowed professorship is a future-proof investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, interdisciplinary knowledge base in the long term.
We therefore continue our good cooperation with the university and at the same time underpin our attractiveness as an employer. "
This is also underlined by Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of Worms University of Applied Sciences: "The endowed professorship forms an important bridge between science and industry.
With it, we would like to build on the existing cooperation with DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual bachelor's degree program in Air Traffic Management. "
The trust of German air traffic control is both a motivation and an obligation for Worms University of Applied Sciences to further expand its teaching and research expertise in the future fields of aviation.
Working for the air traffic controllers of tomorrow, the university can set very special highlights and innovative priorities for its students with the first endowed professorship for a dual course of study.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary at the Ministry of Science, Continuing Education and Culture, emphasizes: "With its focus on aviation, Worms University of Applied Sciences has a unique selling point in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Today's signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the profile of the university.
Rescue helicopter lands on the A 45
The A 45 motorway was fully closed for about 30 minutes on Saturday afternoon in the direction of Aschaffenburg, as the rescue helicopter was in operation after a traffic accident.
A 76-year-old drove a Ford at about 12.40 o'clock in the exit Alzenau-Mitte straight ahead in the curve and landed at the guardrail.
The impact triggered the front airbags and the driver suffered minor injuries to his face and had to be taken to a hospital for treatment.
The injuries of the 72-year-old passenger were treated by the emergency doctor and the patient was then flown by rescue helicopter to a hospital.
Currently, however, the police assume that there is no danger to life.
The damaged vehicle, which caused damage of about 2000 euros, had to be towed.
Heil wants to test other industries after the meat industry
The Corona crisis brought the conditions in parts of the meat industry to light again.
Tightening of the law is imminent.
But are they right - and will it stick to it?
Federal Labour Minister Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to review other industries in accordance with the now planned strict regulations against grievances in the meat industry.
"We will look at the industry by industry and then take suitable measures for the respective industry if necessary", Heil told the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany's employers are already warning against restricting work contracts in general.
Following the mass Corona outbreak at the meat giant Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet wants to pass a law of salvation this Wednesday.
Large slaughterhouses should no longer be allowed to deploy external personnel for slaughter, disassembly and meat processing.
To this end, the use of work contracts and temporary workers there is to be prohibited.
Employer president Ingo Kramer told the dpa: "Hands off a general restriction of work contracts and employee assignment, if you do not want to completely strangle the economy."
Work contracts, for example, are the basis for their added value to the customer for large areas of crafts, construction and plant engineering.
"The failures of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument."
Heil assured: "My goal is not to ban works contracts everywhere in the German economy."
Work contracts make sense.
"If an industrial company commissions a craftsman to install a safety system, this is a normal work contract."
The German meat industry considers a ban on works contracts and temporary work in its industry alone to be unconstitutional.
It cannot be explained why different labour law should apply to portioning and packaging cheese in the future than to sausages, according to a statement on the bill, as reported by the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Saturday).
In the event of a ban, the consumer price would rise by 10 to 20 percent per kilo and product.
According to the results of an audit by the NRW Occupational Health and Safety Administration, many Eastern European employees from contract companies worked in the industry 16 hours a day.
They often had no break.
Wages were retained for protective equipment or rent.
It was also noted that the situation with the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Heil said that a relatively sharp law for the meat industry had already come into force in 2017.
However, these have been circumvented by "tricky constructions."
"Now it has to be fundamentally cleaned up."
The politician announced: "In the Occupational Health and Safety Act, which we want to adopt in the cabinet at the end of July, there are also measures that do not only affect the meat industry - for example, higher test rates for occupational health and safety or clear criteria for community accommodation."
The draft presented to dpa includes amendments to the law on safeguarding workers' rights in the meat industry and the Occupational Health and Safety Act.
Brandenburg's Consumer Protection Minister Ursula Nonnemacher (Green Party) believes that more intensive controls are necessary.
"I would like us to be able to make even more checks in many supervisory areas: Food inspections, animal welfare, all sorts of things, such as animal transport", said Nonnemacher on Sunday on the RBB programme "Brandenburg aktuell."
But more staff positions are also needed for more checks.
Three killed in ultralight crash in Germany
According to the police, three people died when an ultralight plane crashed into an apartment building in Wesel in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia.
One child was slightly injured.
Two other people were rescued injured in the accident, said a spokesman for the Wesel district control centre.
A parachute was found at the scene of the accident, according to the police.
The "Rheinische Post" reported, citing eyewitnesses, that the plane collided with a hot air balloon before the crash.
The house is a one- or two-family house.
Further details were not disclosed at first.
Eviction of Frankfurt Opera Square proceeded peacefully
One week after the riots in Frankfurt, the eviction of the opera square during the night to Sunday was also peaceful.
Most recently, a few dozen people stayed on the square, but left it before the curfew began at 1 a.m.
The police had been deployed with numerous officers since the early evening, and a larger police force could be seen throughout the city.
For the first time this weekend, from midnight, there was a ban on entering the Opera Square, where there were riots a week ago.
Policemen had been attacked with bottles from the crowd of revellers.
At least five officers were injured and several police vehicles were damaged.
The night to Saturday had also remained quiet.
Car overturns: Young woman seriously injured in accident on federal highway 83 near Hofgeismar
A 21-year-old suffered serious injuries in an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme on Sunday at around 1.25 p.m.
She was taken to the Klinikum Kassel.
With thermal imaging cameras, the fire department was looking for possible passengers.
According to the police, the woman was on the federal highway 83 in the direction of her home town of Hümme, when her car came off the road for a hitherto unknown reason and flipped over several times.
In order to save the victims, the fire department had to cut the roof of the car.
Since it was unclear whether anyone was still in the vehicle, the adjacent corn field was searched from the turntable ladder with a thermal imaging camera.
The drone squadron from Warburg, which also works with thermal imaging cameras, was also ordered for the search for persons.
However, the volunteers did not find anyone between the tall corn plants.
The seriously injured man was taken by ambulance to the Kassel hospital for further care.
Almost 50 emergency personnel from the fire department Hofgeismar, Hümme and Schöneberg were on site.
The federal highway was closed for two hours due to the accident.
Juventus Turin champion in Italy
Turin - After a redeeming goal from Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus has secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in a row.
The team around the five-time world footballer made the 36th Scudetto in the club's history perfect with a 2: 0 (1: 0) on Sunday evening in the home game against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo scored 1-0 before halftime.
With 83 points, Turin, which competed without the last long-injured ex-national player Sami Khedira, can no longer be displaced from first place two match days before the end of the Serie A season.
Second place Inter Milan is seven points behind.
Juventus was harmless despite optical superiority in the first half, then Ronaldo scored after a free-kick variant with the last action.
The 35-year-old recycled a game by Miralem Pjanic directly from the boundary of the penalty area with a flat shot (45. + 7).
Against the now more offensive guests Ronaldo was also involved in the 2-0, after his shot Federico Bernardeschi (67th) dusted off.
This ensured the lacklustre but decisive success.
The foulelfmeter shot to the bar in the 89th minute should have only reallyed Ronaldo himself with regard to the goalscoring classification.
It's complicated to stay at ball height mentally and physically for 90 minutes.
The games are strange and the momentum changes very slightly", explained coach Maurizio Sarri after the 1: 2 at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Especially the mental exhaustion of his players is great, said the Juve coach.
Because of the defeat, the Turin team had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
Juve's reassuring lead at the top of the table was mainly due to the weakness of its competitors.
Because in the eleven games before Sunday's game, the Sarri team managed only five wins.
Whether Ronaldo will also be the top scorer is questionable.
While the Portuguese superstar has scored 31 goals so far, the former Dortmund Ciro Immobile has already scored 34 goals after his three-pack in the 5: 1 (1: 1) of fourth place Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the title win of FC Bayern.
The record in Italy is held by the current Juve professional Gonzalo Higuaín.
The Argentine scored 36 goals for SSC Napoli in the 2015 / 2016 season.
In August the next title chance awaits the "Old Lady" of Italian football.
Juventus are in the round of 16 of the Champions League, but have to make up for a 0-1 first leg loss against Olympique Lyon on August 7 to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next knockout round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would wait as opponents.
Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal car races recorded
Stuttgart - Despite all threatened penalties and court rulings, motorists continue to accelerate in countless illegal races on the roads of Baden-Württemberg: Last year and the first four months of this year, the police in the southwest have already registered more than 250 illegal car races.
There are no comparative figures for the years before, but the racers are increasingly doing work for the judicial authorities: In 2018, the public prosecutor's offices between Konstanz and Mannheim conducted a total of 155 investigations for illegal races, a year later there were already 252 and in the current year until the beginning of June already 151.
The races were less about organized events, according to the response of the Ministry of the Interior to an inquiry from the state parliament SPD.
In most cases, the drivers spontaneously competed against each other or they escaped from the police - this is also reported as an illegal race.
At the wheel were mainly German men between the ages of 18 and 60.
113 fines - 15 times imprisonment
Only in comparatively few cases are the racers caught and asked to pay: According to the Ministry of the Interior, a total of 113 fines have been imposed and 15 prison sentences have been issued since 2018.
However, there is no evidence that the number of illegal car races is actually increasing.
Rather, other drivers reacted more sensitively than before because of the numerous tragic accidents and trials of past years and reported more frequently, said a ministry spokesman.
The motorway 8 is particularly popular with racers. Again and again, drivers slow down the traffic there in order to gain space and use the free track for a race.
Last August a dozen drivers were caught near Kirchheim unter Teck, three months earlier there were even 18 drivers on the A8 near Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular "race track"
On the A81, the police register even more races than on any other federal motorway.
With a speed limit, an attempt is made to slow down the racers on the particularly affected section between Engen and Geisingen.
The mostly high-priced and pimped-up sports and luxury cars often have Swiss license plates because the drivers switch to the grass in Germany because of the high penalties for driving too fast and car racing in the neighbouring country.
For the SPD, the speed limit must not be reduced to a few distances: "With a general speed limit of 130 kilometres per hour, we would tackle this problem on motorways", says Martin Rivoir, the transport expert of the SPD parliamentary group.
"The inhibition threshold for racers would be significantly higher if you were not allowed to travel legally here and there with 200 kilometres per hour and more."
Rivoir thinks less of enlightenment or image campaigns: "Anyone who overrides all rules in such a way and puts not only their own lives but also the lives of other road users at risk, is hardly achievable with reason."
ADAC calls for stronger police crackdown
On the other hand, this is not enough for the ADAC: "We assume that speeders will not be deterred by the speed limits", says Holger Bach, Head of Transport and Environment at ADAC Württemberg.
It calls for additional and tougher controls on the affected routes.
Not infrequently, the high-speed test of strength turns into painful and consequential seriousness: Since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people across the country have died in the races, two of them uninvolved in a nightly crash in downtown Stuttgart and one in Gerlingen.
Two young men are said to have engaged in a car race there in November.
One of the vehicles came off the road, crashed into a garden wall and remained lying on its side, the 18-year-old passenger died.
21 other people were injured in the races of the past two years.
According to Interior Minister Thomas Strobl, however, tougher penalties are not necessary: "The need for legislative action to sanction illegal motor vehicle races harder is not seen", says the paper of the Ministry of the Interior.
Blue light from July 23: Thirsty burglar steals drinks from snack bar
Rohrdorf: A man broke into a snack bar in Rohrdorf (Calw district) on Thursday and stole drinks and cash.

In fact, he was wearing a black hoodie, black trousers and light shoes.
Further witness information will be received by the police.
Ackermann sprints to victory on final stage at Sibiu Tour
Professional cyclist Pascal Ackermann won his second day victory on the final stage of the 10th Sibiu Tour.
The 26-year-old Palatinate rider from Team Bora-Hansgrohe prevailed in the mass sprint on the 109-kilometre section with start and finish in Sibiu, having already won a stage on Saturday.
It was the season wins three and four for Ackermann.
His Austrian team mate Gregor Mühlberger prevailed in the overall classification.
The 26-year-old had confidently won the mountain time trial in the morning and thus took the lead in the classification.
Only 104 riders competed for the final stage in the evening.
No fewer than 18 starters had fallen victim to the time limit in the mountain time trial.
"I'm really happy to start the season restart with a win", Ackermann explained after his success on Saturday.
"The sprint was really hectic", said the 26-year-old.
300 meters before the finish he simply put on his sprint, "and it worked out perfectly."
According to the rules of the world governing body UCI, a Corona test was carried out for all race participants and their companions six days before the start of the race.
During the entire tour, drivers and supervisors in isolated hygiene bubbles were separated from the organisation team and the media.
Spectators at the start and finish were not allowed.
Control center gave instructions for lay resuscitation
Düsseldorf - Tragic accident on Sunday afternoon in Düsseldorf-Garath.
In an apartment building, a child (4) suddenly lay lifeless in the water while bathing.
According to the fire department, the emergency call was received shortly before 1 p.m.
"A control center disponent immediately gave instructions for lay resuscitation", a fire department spokesman told BILD.
The arriving rescue workers took over the resuscitation measures shortly afterwards.
The child in danger of his life was transported to the university hospital under resuscitation.
Why it crashed is unclear.
The police have routinely started an investigation into the cause of the accident.
The fire department spokesman: "We assume a tragic accident in the apartment."
Nuremberg: Unauthorized tuning meeting - Police intervene 700 vehicles and around 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and temporarily over 1000 people participated Saturday night in a "tuning meeting" in the parking lot of a furniture store.
The police implemented their announcement to increasingly control such events.
A big tuning meeting took place on Saturday evening (July 25, 2020) in Nuremberg's southern city.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the police of Middle Franconia, the Nuremberg traffic police detected an increased volume of vehicles in the area of a large parking lot in Ingolstädter Straße at around 10.30 p.m.
As a result, the police carried out a large number of vehicle checks there.
Only recently the police announced that they wanted to step up action against so-called autoposers.
Illegal tuning meeting in Nuremberg: Only a small part of the "scene"
The officers counted at the top about 700 vehicles and about 1100 people, according to the police.
However, only a small proportion of those present can be assigned to the "autoposer" and tuning scene.
Apparently, the majority of the relevant scene complied with the police's appeal.
Based on the vehicles and persons on site, it can be assumed that these were mainly onlookers.
In addition, the vast majority of those present adhered to the applicable infection protection regulations, in particular compliance with the minimum distance and wearing mouth and nose protection.
The on-site inspection measures were completed at around 1: 00 a.m.
In total, the officials noticed such structural changes in 10 vehicles that the operating license had expired.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No car races
There were no illegal car races.
"The police headquarters of Middle Franconia will continue to keep an eye on the events and will continue to carry out increased control measures, also in connection with the emergence of onlookers", it said.
The agency News5 spoke to Jürgen Schrödinger from the participating towing company: "They all have beautiful rims, we must not scratch them", says Schrödinger.
Special tapes would be used for this purpose.
Also because the cars are wider, the company must be careful not to cause any damage.
"After all, the young people should get their cars back unscathed."
Figures from the Employment Agency: 900 suspected cases of abuse during short-time work
Berlin - According to its own statement, the Federal Employment Agency (BA) is investigating around 900 suspected cases of abuse of short-time worker benefits.
This is extremely little for more than 880,000 companies that have reported short-time work, Daniel Terzenbach, CEO responsible for operations, told the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung."
When many companies suddenly applied for short-time work at the beginning of the Corona crisis, the BA had to react quickly.
Normally, the exam takes up to three weeks.
So much time was not available to us in this hot phase.
We will take a closer look at the final accounts.
There will certainly be a lot more to come.
We are not naive and have a long breath.
Evidence of abuse often comes from the affected employees or trade unions.
BA also uses analysis software to detect patterns of abuse.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is preparing for a possible wave of insolvency in the autumn.
Will there be significantly more insolvencies than in the previous year?
The assessments differ, but we prepare ourselves in case and are already training our employees in the employment agencies to process applications for insolvency money. "
The figures are still inconspicuous, said Terzenbach.
World Heritage in Potsdam: Party in the New Garden dissolved
Potsdam - On Friday evening about 40 young people celebrated a party in the New Garden.
The collection was dissolved at 8.48 p.m. by the district drivers of the Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation (SPSG), the foundation announced on PNN request.
The young people then left the park.
On Saturday evening, some young people played rugby in the New Garden.
The meadow had been cleared by district drivers, said SPSG spokesman Frank Kallensee on Sunday.
Again and again there are illegal celebrations in the parks
In the parks of the foundation there are repeated accumulations in which the distance and hygiene rules Covid 19 Contact Ordinance are not complied with.
At the end of June there was a celebration with about 300 people in the park Babelsberg, a week later about 150 people celebrated in the New Garden.
Even without a corona regulation, the parks will be closed at nightfall.
Storage on the meadows is prohibited according to the parking regulations, there are only a few exceptions.
The foundation has been complaining for a long time that visitors are leaving more and more rubbish and destroying protected biotopes.
In Berlin, meanwhile, illegal park parties have reached a different dimension.
In the Hasenheide in the district of Neukölln, 5000 people celebrated an illegal techno party on Sunday night.
The event was dissolved by the police.
Austria: Mass tests after Corona outbreak in tourist resort
With hundreds of tests, authorities have reacted to a Corona outbreak in the popular Upper Austrian tourist resort of St. Wolfgang.
The number of confirmed cases rose to 48, according to the state authorities in Linz.
More than 100 results were still pending in the evening.
Accordingly, many of those infected are young interns in tourism businesses, but at least one holiday guest has tested positive.
Residents, guests and tourism staff were asked to stay in their accommodations on Saturday evening.
The curfew was set at 11 p.m.
"There are cancellations and cancellations of bookings there and there, the head of the Wolfgangsee Tourist Board, Hans Wieser", told dpa.
Occasional guests also left early.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist resort in Upper Austria with more than 400,000 overnight stays last year.
In a normal season, about a third of the guests are Germans.
On Friday, the first infections became public.
On Saturday, the head of the district authority, Alois Lanz, defended the behaviour of the interns, who had celebrated in several restaurants and may have been infected there.
"We all enjoyed doing that in our youth", he told the radio station Ö1.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The tourism association launched an information campaign to raise awareness among young employees about the dangers of Covid-19.
Starting on Saturday, hundreds of employees, holidaymakers and locals were tested.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang from July 15 were contacted.
The outbreak evokes memories of the Austrian ski and party resort of Ischgl in Tyrol, which in the early stages of the pandemic was a centre of the Corona spread throughout Europe.
In total, more than 1,500 people in Austria are currently infected with the virus.
The focus of new infections is on Vienna and Upper Austria.
Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualify for Champions League
London (dpa) - English football record champion Manchester United returns to the Champions League after a year's absence.
The Red Devils secured third place in the table on the last day of the Premier League with a 2-0 (0-0) win over direct rivals Leicester City.
The Foxes now have to settle for the Europa League, because Chelsea FC still passed by and also qualified for the premier class in fourth place.
In the fight against relegation, Aston Villa was able to cheer.
Manchester United took the lead with a penalty kick from Bruno Fernandes (71st minute).
After a red card for Leicester City in injury time, Jesse Lingard (90 + 8) scored the final score.
Chelsea, opponents of FC Bayern in the Champions League round of 16, won 2-0 (2-0) against Wolverhampton Wanderers thanks to Mason Mount (45 + 1) and Olivier Giroud (45 + 4).
"That means a lot to me", said coach Frank Lampard, who is also in the final of the FA Cup against Arsenal in his first season as Chelsea coach.
Chelsea's win over Wolverhampton also benefited Tottenham Hotspur, who passed the Wolves with a meagre 1-1 (1-0) at Crystal Palace and started in sixth place in the Europa League.
Aston Villa won the long-distance duel with Watford FC and AFC Bournemouth, but had to tremble for class retention at West Ham United for a long time.
The late lead of Jack Grealish (84th) immediately compensated Andrej Jarmolenko (85th).
The 1: 1 (0: 0) was enough because Watford lost 2: 3 (1: 3) at Arsenal.
The club, which scored three coaches during the season, is relegated after five first league years.
Just like Bournemouth, who couldn't save himself by a 3-1 (2-1) at Everton.
In the end, one point was missing.
Liverpool FC, who have been English champions since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3-1 (1-1) victory at Newcastle United.
99 points is the highest score the Reds have ever achieved in a football season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp and his team narrowly missed the points record in English football.
Manchester City holds the record with 100 points in the 2017 / 18 season.
After the Newcastle lead in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38th), Divock Origi (59th) and Sadio Mané (89th) shot the match for Liverpool on Sunday.
"It was an extraordinary season for this wonderful club", said goalscorer van Dijk after the game, which should encourage us to defend the title.
It's going to be hard.
The Premier League bosses should also be satisfied in the end.
Due to the coronavirus crisis, football operations in England were suspended from 13 March to 17 June.
In the meantime, there was even discussion about an early abandonment or the hosting of the remaining games on neutral ground.
In the end, however, the season could be played without any special incidents - but as in Germany without spectators in the stadiums.
Arrests and violence during demonstrations against Netanyahu
The protests in Israel against Prime Minister Netanyahu are becoming increasingly intense.
During the night there were violent clashes.
On Sunday night in Jerusalem, the Israeli police took violent action against participants in a demonstration against the right-wing conservative Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Twelve people were arrested for participating in riots, said police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld.
Among other things, the police used water cannons to break up the rally.
According to media reports, a total of around 6,000 people gathered near Netanyahu's official residence on Saturday evening.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu's handling of the Corona crisis.
The protesters beat drums, blew horns, and called on Netanyahu to resign.
Participants in a counter-demonstration were also arrested, who supported Netanyahu, reported the news site "Ynet."
People also demonstrated in many other places in Israel, including in front of the head of government's private villa in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
According to police reports, a man was arrested near Tel Aviv because he was suspected of spraying pepper spray from a moving car on demonstrators on the side of the road.
Another man was arrested after a stabbing attack on a demonstrator in the south of the country.
The demonstrator was slightly injured in the neck.
There have recently been several demonstrations against Netanyahu in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.
The rallies accompany the corruption trial against the head of government.
Most recently, Netanyahu was also criticized for his handling of the Corona crisis.
Among other things, he is accused of hasty relaxation and a lack of preparation for a second Corona wave.
The Corona crisis has badly affected the country's economy.
The unemployment rate recently stood at more than 20 percent.
The number of new infections with the coronavirus in Israel has recently risen to ever new record levels.
Accident near Ahlen (NRW) - Transporter crashes on car - nine injured - Ruhrgebiet - Bild.de
Ahlen - A rear-end collision caused nine minor injuries on the B58 near Ahlen on Saturday afternoon.
A female driver was travelling with her two children (3, 5) in the direction of Beckum.
The police: "Presumably she had suddenly braked because she wanted to turn."
The driver of a Mercedes van who drove behind her must have seen this too late.
He crashed into the back of the car.
Three passengers in the car and six in the van were slightly injured in the accident.
Several ambulances took her to a nearby hospital.
North Korea seals off border town after Corona suspected case
North Korea has so far seen its own measures to ward off the coronavirus as a "brilliant success."
Now the country is reporting a suspected case for the first time.
Because of a first official Corona suspected case in the country, North Korea has completely sealed off a big city for fear of a disaster.
Despite the strictest epidemiological defense measures in the past six months, "the malignant virus may have been introduced into the country", the state media reported.
A state of emergency has been imposed for the region around the border town of Kaesong.
The communist leadership declared the highest alert level.
If the suspected case is confirmed, it would be the first official case of infection with Sars-CoV-2 in the isolated country.
North Korea has not yet registered a single infection and described its defensive measures as a "shining success."
The information was doubted abroad.
The symptoms of the disease were reportedly detected in an "outlier" who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on July 19.
The person left for South Korea three years ago and has now returned across the border.
There was initially no confirmation from South Korea for the border crossing within the four-kilometre-wide and largely mined military buffer zone.
However, according to reports from the national news agency Yonhap, South Korea's military acknowledged the possibility of crossing the border illegally into North Korea as high.
There were investigations into some people.
North Korea said it called an emergency meeting of the Workers' Party's Politburo, chaired by ruler Kim Jong Un, on Saturday because of the suspected case.
The dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive catastrophe. "
Kim had already ordered on Friday as a preventive measure to "completely block Kaesong and isolate each district and region from others."
The person concerned and all the people in Kaesong who had been in contact with her were quarantined.
The central military commission of the party should therefore investigate the "outlier case" as well as the behaviour of the responsible military unit and, if necessary, impose harsh punishment.
It is estimated that about 300,000 people live in Kaesong.
Tension ahead of Council meeting: City-East and noise protection are up for discussion before a big summer break
"In addition to environmental issues, the committee members will also vote on the development plan for the large-scale project inner city development East", it says rather casually in the middle section of the municipal press release for the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, July 28, at 4.30 p.m. in the Great Hall of the CongressCentrum Pforzheim.
Above all, the upgrading of the eastern city is controversial until the end.
The majorities for this are narrow, most recently even negative in individual committees, depending on their presence.
An appeal from the economy (construction, real estate, trade and IT) not to let the project developed from the citizenry and then by the administration and the municipal council fail after almost ten years of preparation, criticized project opponent Reinhard Klein as "extra-parliamentary opposition", "clueless", "speculation", "vilification" and "deliberate false statements."
"Everyone thinks they know better", says Klein, who has been a member of the municipal council for a year as the only representative of the Pforzheim citizen list.
In fact, after reading the contracts, he is in this position: "I know what I'm talking about."
The exit will be cheaper for the city, contrary to statements of the city administration, the Technical Town Hall is to be renovated after grants, the existence of which Klein is convinced, for 8.5 million euros.
The city will develop very differently than is predicted in the town hall and on the part of business advocates.
To shape the city by its own strength and not an investor: This is his plan B. One day after Klein, the FDP / FW / UB / LED faction, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
It also essentially envisages the renovation of the Technical Town Hall, the keeping open of the Schloßberg, the rental of the ex-valley for administrative space and a smaller-scale transformation of the city centre, ideally with local carriers.
Environmental issues play a central role
Environmental issues will also play a central role.
Among other things, the municipal council will vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the population of Pforzheim from health noise pollution caused by road traffic, including many speed reductions.
In a press release, the local transport club Germany welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30. However, the political leaders in the city are not innocent of the fact that this must happen, because by neglecting the regular bus traffic with thinned cycles and by little commitment to cycling, they have only contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus the noise, according to the VCD.
The municipal council also votes on the participation of the city of the Energy and Climate Protection Agency Pforzheim / Enzkreis.
Also on the agenda is the accession to the climate protection pact of the state of Baden-Württemberg, the redefinition of parental contributions in the municipal daycare centres and the application for inclusion in the federal government's smart city funding.
Citizens are welcome, but must heed Corona protection measures.
Tim Zimmermann starts the new season with a lot of delay
With a delay of almost half a year, Tim Zimmermann will start his premiere season in the ADAC GT Masters on July 31.
Before the league of super sports cars can start regular operations, the first test drives were scheduled.
For Zimmermann it was all about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3 better.
The Corona crisis has long prevented Tim Zimmermann from embarking on his first business trip in the new Lamborghini Huracan from Grasser Racing.
This was now possible under special hygiene conditions.
The 23-year-old Langenargener made his first laps at the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his premiere in the GT3 car.
"There are already a few things that are different from the Porsche from the pre-season", says Zimmermann.
With the ABS, for example, you have to go into the corners differently.
But it was really a lot of fun.
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite his only 25 years, the Dutchman is already experienced in GT sport and was able to help his new team-mate in many things.
"I'm not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series also brings new challenges", says Zimmermann.
"Steijn and I understand each other brilliantly and we have made enormous progress from session to session at the Lausitzring."
Right there - at the Lausitzring - the GT Masters will also host its first race.
From July 31, the 33 super sports cars will race through Lusatia.
Zimmermann, who is one of 15 newcomers to the series, knows the track.
In 2015 he was a guest at the Motodrom.
"It worked quickly and I didn't have to get used to the track", says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafen racing community Graf Zeppelin.
The Lausitzring has many fast passages that you have to hit optimally in order to be fast.
How fast Zimmermann really is, it turns out in two weeks.
"Of course, the teams play poker a little bit during the tests", he says.
In the end, however, we are very satisfied and are looking forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring.
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a densely packed calendar.
Seven races are scheduled until the beginning of November.
The current state of affairs is that no spectators will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
In mid-August at the Nürburgring, ex-Formula 1 driver Niko Hülkenberg will reach into the GT steering wheel.
British Transport Minister caught cold by quarantine decision
The British government's decision to quarantine Spanish holidaymakers for two weeks after their return has caught the country's transport minister cold, according to press reports.
Accordingly, Grant Shapps is currently on vacation in Spain of all places, while his colleagues at home decided on the measure on Saturday.
Due to the rising Corona numbers in Spain, the cabinet in London removed the country from the list of countries from which entry without quarantine requirements is possible.
The new regulation will apply from today, Sunday, so Shapps will also have to be quarantined after his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returnees.
But the regulation applies to those who are just on vacation on the deadline, only from Saturday, August 1, and was not introduced overnight.
Incidentally, Spain is still regarded in Austria as one of the "safe countries" for which no quarantine is required in Austria.
"Many ministers may have known in advance that there is a possibility that a quarantine will be imposed on holidaymakers in Spain", commented Labour MP Diane Abbot.
"But apparently nobody bothered to tell Grant Shapps."
Less than a month after the end of the Corona emergency in Spain and the expiry of the strict curfew, the number of infections in the country is rising again.
Virologists primarily blame the nightlife for the new spread.
Spain is one of Britain's favourite holiday destinations.
The British government is currently advising against unnecessary travel to mainland Spain, excluding the Canary Islands and Balearic Islands, which are particularly popular with British holidaymakers.
So far, more than 272,000 infections with the novel coronavirus and more than 28,000 deaths have been recorded in Spain.
Russia: Naval Day: Putin announces hypersonic weapons for warships
On the occasion of Navy Day in his country, Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced equipping the warships with state-of-the-art hypersonic weapons.
These weapons, which are unique in the world, would expand the fighting possibilities of the Russian naval forces, Putin said on Sunday in St. Petersburg at the central naval parade.
According to the Interfax agency, the Ministry of Defence also informed about successful tests of the zircon hypersonic missile built for the Navy.
The hypersonic weapons have a multiple of the speed of sound of around 343 meters per second.
They are considered weapons of the future.
Underwater tropedeo will continue to be built
It will continue to be built on the atomically equipped underwater torpedo Poseidon.
The planned sea drone is planned to destroy coastal targets.
The president, who himself also drove a military boat, said that this year alone 40 new ships would be put into service by the individual fleet units of the largest country in the world.
Russia has such a large coastal area as no other country in the world.
The Navy has been reliably protecting Russia for 300 years, Putin said on the day celebrated by sailors nationwide.
Naval forces also celebrated Naval Day with parades in many other Russian coastal towns.
In Syria, where Russia is fighting alongside ruler Bashar al-Assad, the military demonstrated strength at a arms show in the Mediterranean port of Tartus.
Ammunition was also fired there.
A video published by the Ministry of Defense showed not only warships, including a submarine, but also combat helicopters and jets.
Hurricane "Hanna" reaches Texas: Help made more difficult due to Corona
Washington - This year's first hurricane over the Atlantic has made landfall in Texas.
Life-threatening flooding, strong winds and heavy rainfall now threatened parts of the US state, the National Hurricane Center of the US Climate Agency NOAA announced during the night to Sunday (local time).
Governor Greg Abbott declared a state of emergency for many districts.
The Corona pandemic, which is rampant in Texas, is making the work of the aid workers more difficult, Abbott said, according to the US media.
Evacuees called for caution
"Every hurricane is an enormous challenge", said Abbott according to the newspaper "Houston Chronicle."
Referring to the cyclone in Texas, he added: "This challenge is complicated and is exacerbated, considering that it is sweeping through an area that is the area most affected by Covid-19 in the state."
According to the Johns Hopkins University, around 5,000 people have died in Texas alone as a result of the Corona pandemic.
Abbott called on people who had to leave their homes to be cautious.
They should not disregard practices "we've gotten used to", such as wearing masks, the governor said, according to CBS.
It was important that everyone kept their distance.
Therefore, hotel rooms have also been provided in some places.
In addition, Corona should be tested in emergency shelters.
Damage was initially reported only from the coastal town of Port Mansfield.
Storm warning withdrawn
With winds of up to 150 kilometers per hour, according to authorities, "Hanna" made landfall on the island of Padre Island just off the Texas coast.
The tropical storm had previously been upgraded to the lowest level one hurricane.
For the coastal stretch from Port Mansfield to Sargent, a storm surge warning was issued and later withdrawn.
Authorities expected a slowdown while "Hanna" moved further inland and headed towards northeastern Mexico.
"Douglas" is moving towards Hawaii
In the Pacific, Hurricane "Douglas" was heading for Hawaii during the night to Sunday with winds of around 150 kilometres per hour.
However, the hurricane center expected it to weaken further.
According to the forecast, it is expected to be near Hawaii's largest islands on Sunday (local time) - then as a storm just below the hurricane threshold.
Over the Atlantic, NOAA expected an above-average hurricane season this year, according to a May forecast.
From June to the end of November, up to ten hurricanes are expected, of which up to six could become very strong cyclones, the authority said.
On average, there are six hurricanes per year over the Atlantic, three of which develop into storms of great magnitude.
In view of available climate data and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, the probability of a normal season is only 30 percent, that of a below-average season is only ten percent, it was said at the time.
Us President Donald Trump wrote via Twitter that his administration is closely monitoring the storms and is in contact with the affected states.
Four goals stripped: Video assistant "punished" Sassuolo
Sassuolo's Filip Djuricic were stripped of two goals
Napoli - Four goals scored, four goals stripped: Sassuolo Calcio experienced a raven-black evening at 0-2 (0-1) at SSC Napoli in the Italian football league Serie A - and was really angry with the referee's video assistant.
A festival of not given goals for Sassuolo.
Never before has the VAR acted so hard against a team, "commented the" Corriere dello Sport. "
Host Napoli had taken the lead by a goal from outside defender Elseid Hisaj in the 8th minute, in the 32nd minute Filip Djuricic initially cheered the equaliser.
The Video Assistant Referee (VAR) withdrew the hit due to an offside position.
Five minutes later, Djuricic shot the ball into the net again - the VAR intervened again.
The referee team also withdrew the goals of attacker Francesco Caputo (50th) and Domenico Berardi (61st) according to the VAR.
In the injury time, Allan made the 2-0 final score for Naples and the bitter evening for Sassuolo perfect.
The VAR is worse for Sassuolo than a radar trap on the road and punishes Sassuolo like no team before.
The new technology sets records, writes the "Gazzetta dello Sport."
FC Bayern Munich: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start of the hot preparation phase for the Champions League began with a setback for double winners FC Bayern.
Hansi Flick, who recovered "reasonably well" after a short holiday and a few days of training, has to think about how he can rebuild his successful defense after the injury of world champion Benjamin Pavard.
The Frenchman, who has the third most minutes of action behind captain Manuel Neuer and midfielder Joshua Kimmich, suffered a ligament injury to his left foot root and threatens to be missing in decisive premier class duels.
In the Munich Schmuddelwetter, the right-back broke off a training game and was driven off the course with a golf kart.
How long the unrestricted regular player has to pause in the fight for the title is open.
An appearance in the round-of-16 second leg against Chelsea FC on 8 August should be difficult, and the 24-year-old can hope for the final tournament starting on 12 August in Lisbon.
But Bayern do not want to be stopped by the mishap from training on Sunday.
Flick mentioned in his personal triple formula the three attributes he wants to see from his stars on their way to Portugal's capital.
Quality, intensity and concentration will be shown by his victory-hungry title collectors in the ideally following 28 days until the premier class final on August 23rd.
We simply mastered the mandatory tasks with championship and cup very well.
Now it's time to create something special", said Flick.
Until the Munich team can deal specifically with the final tournament and previously a training camp in the Algarve, the round-of-16 obligation against Chelsea FC is scheduled.
After the 3: 0 in the first leg before the Corona break, the Londoners should not become a Bayern nightmare again in the home arena as in the lost "final at home" in 2012.
We have to go through the door first.
We want to win, create good conditions and recharge our trust with a good game, demanded Flick.
A test to get in the mood is scheduled for Friday against Olympique Marseille.
With a long speech, Flick had sworn his stars, who had 13 days of vacation after the double, to a unique August.
He welcomed 31 players on Säbener Straße, including the new players around noble shopping Leroy Sané, who met all new colleagues on the pitch for the first time after his move from Manchester City.
"Like all new ones, Leroy has fitted in well", reported Flick.
But instead of talking about the new season, when Sané & Co. are no longer just allowed to train, Flick much preferred to talk about the current title project of the German series champion.
After days of individual and small group training, team strength is now being trained for the Londoners, who, in contrast to the Flick ensemble, are in the playing rhythm.
After that, the Munich team could face a quarter-final against FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, in the semi-finals Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin are possible opponents.
A way to the final in Lisbon "is not so easy", said the head coach, who from Tuesday on can rely on the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training.
The World Cup record goalscorer Klose and Flick know from many joint tournament preparations what is particularly important in the 0-to-100 mood.
With his current team, working is "a pleasure", praised Flick.
"Focus on winning" is an impressive characteristic of his team.
The tournament with nine teams was also ambitious on Sunday.
All of the top performers were there, including the willing to emigrate Thiago and defender David Alaba, whose whereabouts are not assured beyond the premier class season.
Formula One needs a special rule to choose its world champion
Since it is not possible to drive on the required number of continents, the FIA has to improvise to award the World Championship titles.
All American races were cancelled.
Racing calendar is becoming more and more concrete
The racing calendar of the current Formula 1 season continues to take shape.
In addition to the ten Grand Prix confirmed so far, three more race tracks were added during the week.
In October, the race will take place at the Nürburgring in Germany and Portimão, Portugal.
On November 1st, Lewis Hamilton and Co. will compete for World Championship points on the traditional Italian race track in Imola.
As it stands, the 2020 racing calendar comprises 13 races.
"We are delighted that we continue to make great progress in completing our plans for the 2020 season", said Formula One boss Chase Carey.
A total of 15 to 18 races in the premier class of motorsport are to be completed in this extraordinary season.
Formula One wants to conclude its season in Asia.
The final race calendar will be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
Before the already officially targeted races in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December, according to media reports, appearances in Vietnam and Malaysia could still take place at the end of November.
Regulations require races on three continents
The regulations of Formula 1 require at least races on three continents for the awarding of the world championship.
Even if, as currently planned, only two continents will be driven, there will be a world champion.
With the help of a special rule, the FIA wants to award the titles, citing "exceptional circumstances" due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The traditional start of the season in Australia in March had to be cancelled at short notice due to the looming season.
A return to the continent later this year is not an issue.
In addition, Formula One will not be a guest in America this year.
Cancellation met with criticism in Brazil
Due to the tense corona situation, the races will not take place in Canada, the USA, Mexico and Brazil.
"We're looking forward to being back with them next season", explained Carey.
The cancellation of the American races was met with criticism, especially in Brazil: "The cancellation did not come as a surprise to us, but we cannot accept the reasons for this", said Tamas Rohonyi, promoter of the Grand Prix in São Paulo.
The number of infections in the São Paulo area is significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
Moreover, the concerns of some teams about not wanting to drive in Brazil would not justify rejection.
They are prepared for the required security measures.
Greta Thunberg: Evil eye against Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest on Stephen Colbert's well-known latenight show via video switch and revealed in an interview what she had in mind when she met Donald Trump.
Climate activist Greta Thunberg was a guest on a popular US latenight show via video switch.
Among other things, she talked about her struggle against the powerful of the world.
The teenager also spoke about her famous "evil gaze" during her encounter with Donald Trump.
New York City - Over the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has attracted attention with her tireless commitment to the "Fridays For Future" movement.
Now she spoke in a well-known latenight show about her plans for the future and her meeting with US President Donald Trump at the UN climate summit last year.
Latenight host Stephen Colbert welcomed 17-year-old Thunberg to your show on Tuesday and conducted a lengthy interview with the Swede.
She spoke not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the world's powerful.
"There are some things that surprised me", she said.
"How far people go to direct the focus away from the climate crisis" has shocked her.
She has experienced everything from organized hate campaigns to threats just because a group of children are taking to the streets.
She finds heads of state and leading politicians who scoff at her on social media or even try to silence her "funny" because the reactions show her "because they have no other answer."
It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was approached about a well-known scene in which she took a bitterly evil look at US President Trump.
At the 2019 UN Climate Summit in New York, for which the activist sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive gaze was captured by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
The short clip resulted in a GIF, an animated image, which ultimately became one of the most frequently used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think about the US president at that moment?
In response to Stephen Colbert's relatively open question, she answered only briefly and dryly: "To be honest, I think that doesn't need any further explanation."
The experienced satirist Colbert probably did not expect the quick-witted answer and briefly disappeared from the picture laughing.
With her "How dare you?" Speech on the principles of climate protection, she was remembered by many at the climate conference.
Ex-Dortmund real estate with a three-pack for Lazio Rome
Ciro Immobile is now on par with Bavaria's Robert Lewandowski in the race for Europe's Golden Shoe.
The former Dortmund Ciro Immobile still has the best chance of becoming the top scorer in the Italian football championship.
The former BVB professional scored three goals in Lazio Rome's 5-1 (1-1) victory at Hellas Verona, including two converted penalties in the injury times of both halves.
This means that the 30-year-old from fourth place in the table two games of the season before the end now has 34 goals of the season on his account - Robert Lewandowski of FC Bayern Munich scored just as many in the past Bundesliga season.
In Italy, Cristiano Ronaldo follows with 30 goals so far, the Portuguese superstar faced Sampdoria Genoa with the leader in the evening.
Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green died
His life was like a rollercoaster ride: After a rapid climb with Fleetwood Mac, it went steeply downhill and then slowly up again.
Now the blues rock guitarist Peter Green has died at the age of 73.
Brilliant guitarist, drug junkie, cult fan: The co-founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully in his sleep at the age of 73, family members said in an official statement on Saturday that a further statement would be announced for the next few days.
Top musicians like Peter Frampton praised Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional reaction of a "monumental loss" for all former and current members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
The drummer Fleetwood and the guitarist Green formed the now legendary band in London in 1967. His dreamy instrumental hit "Albatross" is still unforgotten.
The musician's life ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") resembled a roller coaster ride.
Green experienced a rapid rise with Fleetwood Mac - but the band celebrated their greatest successes without him.
Among other things, there was a dispute because Green wanted to donate all of the group's profits to charity.
He began to perform in wide robes and with a large crucifix.
Psychological problems are also said to have played a role.
Three years after its founding, Green left the band in 1970.
This was followed by a social decline.
The blues rock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, biographers reported.
For a long time, Green was treated in psychiatry.
During much of the 1970s, the musician disappeared from the scene.
He is said to have temporarily lived on the street, worked as a cemetery gardener and spent some time in an Israeli kibbutz.
Green was born in 1946 to a Jewish working-class family in the London district of Bethnal Green.
Already at a young age he was enthusiastic about US blues musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At the age of eleven he learned the first guitar handles.
At the age of 15, the teenager started playing guitar professionally and five years later got the chance to be on stage as lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners.
Shortly afterwards he was hired as a replacement for his idol Eric Clapton with the Bluesbreakers.
In the middle of the blues boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967 together with his Bluesbreakers colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross" composed by Green gave the group its first number 1 hit in the winter of 1968 / 69 and catapulted them to the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid rise soon showed its downsides: Green could not cope with the media hype and his experiments with the drug LSD became more and more extreme.
He later commented on life between music and addiction in an interview: "The worst thing that happened to me in life is drugs - the best thing was to land a number 1 hit."
Towards the end of the decade, Green surprisingly achieved a respectable success in 1979 with an album inspired by religious themes.
Meanwhile, Fleetwood Mac swam without him in a new formation on a wave of success.
Their 1977 album "Rumours" sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Despite various small solo successes, Green did not make a major comeback until he started again in 1996 with a group of musician friends.
The British "Daily Telegraph" spoke at the time of a rock star returning to Earth.
Free from drugs, Green released some albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group until the band broke up in 2004.
For music experts he was a blues legend during his lifetime - and with his soft sound one of the most influential guitarists of the past decades.
