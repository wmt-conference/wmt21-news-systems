Biker reacts at lightning speed and prevents worse
On Friday evening, a traffic accident occurred on the road between Machtolsheim and Merklingen, in which a motorcyclist was only slightly injured thanks to his quick reaction.
Car driver overlooks bikers
At 9.30 p.m. a 44-year-old motorist wanted to turn left with her VW coming from Merklingen onto Landesstraße 1230 in the direction of Machtolsheim.
She overlooked the 24-year-old, right-of-way motorcyclist coming from Nellingen.
Hand and foot brake levers fly away during the collision
The biker tried to avoid the car, but nevertheless grazed it at the rear of the vehicle.
Due to the striking process, the hand and foot brake levers on the Suzuki were torn off and the driver was no longer able to brake.
Mentally, he steered his motorcycle in the green stiffness next to the roadway and had it rolled out without falling.
Biker suffers leg injury
Due to the collision with the car, the biker nevertheless suffered an injury and had to be treated in a clinic.
Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 harvesters infected
After a mass Corona infection on a large vegetable farm in Mamming, Lower Bavaria, almost 500 people are under quarantine and are no longer allowed to leave the farm.
A security service monitors the ban on going out.
A total of 174 harvesters tested positive for the Corona pathogen Sars-CoV-2 during the series examination, as reported by the district office Dingolfing-Landau on Saturday evening.
In order to avoid further spread, we unfortunately have to take this step to protect the population, explained District Administrator Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Previously, seven employees had already been infected in the company - this was the reason for the series test.
The farm is a large vegetable farm that grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and beetroot - but the cucumbers are only for insertion jars.
Mamming is a rural community with about 3300 inhabitants not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW plant.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to keep calm: "According to our information, this is a closed group of people."
On the farm, infected people were separated from uninfected employees, and the site is now surrounded by a barrier fence.
The Greens and SPD gave the state government a share of responsibility.
The two opposition factions accused Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet of neglecting the control of the shelters of seasonal workers.
This can take bitter revenge if such local infections have to take hold and regional lockdowns have to be ordered, said Jürgen Mistol, the parliamentary managing director of the Green Party.
The SPD takes a similar view: "Following the Corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof slaughterhouse in mid-May, we have already called for a special control programme for farms with harvesters," said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
From our point of view, it is precisely the hygiene conditions in the workplace and living conditions that need to be strictly controlled.
This obviously did not happen. "
The outbreak came "with an announcement."
Underground station Aidenbachstraße: Dangerous dispute: 19-year-old falls into the track bed after pushing
In a dispute between two youth groups at the Aidenbachstraße underground station, a 19-year-old fell through a push and slipped into the track bed.
Obersendling - On Friday there was a dispute between two youth groups at the Aidenbachstraße underground station at around 4.15 p.m.
A passerby alerted the police, who arrived with several stripes.
According to an initial investigation, a man from Munich (17) pushed a 19-year-old to the ground.
The young man slid over the edge of the platform and fell into the track bed.
People from the 17-year-old's group helped the fallen man to climb out of the track.
There was no danger of an incoming train.
According to the police, there were clashes between the two people afterwards.
The 17-year-old initially fled the scene, but his personal details could be determined afterwards.
Accompanied by his father, he went to the police inspectorate 29.
The 17-year-old is being investigated for assault.
Report: Seehofer pushes for longer data retention
Data retention is currently suspended.
According to a media report, however, Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer is calling for an extension of the storage period.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
According to a media report, Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer (CSU) is calling for extended data retention - instead of the planned ten weeks for half a year.
As the "Bild am Sonntag" reports, Seehofer Minister of Justice Christine Lambrecht (SPD) asked in a letter for a quick change in the law.
Accordingly, Seehofer wants to step up measures against child abuse.
He considers it useful to "make urgently needed adjustments to the law now," the newspaper quotes from the letter.
Data retention is currently suspended.
The ECJ is expected to make a decision on this.
Seehofer, however, wants the changes beforehand, so that they could be applied immediately after a possible positive judgment, the report continues.
A spokesperson for the Ministry of Justice told the newspaper that it was only possible to examine whether legal adjustments were needed once the courts had ruled.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer, together with the interior ministers of the federal states, had already spoken out in June in favour of data retention.
NBA: Strip club trouble for Clippers star Lou Williams
Excitement in the NBA!
Lou Williams (33), a professional basketball player for the Los Angeles Clippers, is said to have left the tournament headquarters in Disney World in Orlando / Florida with permission for a funeral.
According to US media reports, he visited the strip club "Magic City" in Atlanta in the evening.
Williams, who is said to have admitted the visit according to ESPN data, is back in isloation and is being tested daily for Covid-19.
His reason for the visit: Chicken Wings.
In February last year "Sweet Lou," as he is called in the NBA, already expressed his love for exactly these wings.
The American wrote: "Magic City and Blue Flame (another strip club in Atlanta, editor's note) have the best wings in town."
NBA insider Shams Charania announced on Twitter on Sunday that the NBA Williams had ordered a ten-day quarantine.
The Clippers star missed the first two official games after the test match phase.
In Disney World, the NBA wants to end the Corona season.
Currently, the best 22 teams with training games are preparing for the season finale starting on Friday night.
Söder comments on the Corona situation after a mass infection
Munich - Health Minister Melanie Huml (CSU) has already announced a test offensive for large farms on Sunday.
The press conference will be shown live on our homepage.
The case in Mamming in the district of Dingolfing-Landau has startled authorities and politicians.
Almost 500 harvesters from several countries are currently working on the large vegetable farm, and more than a third have been infected with the Corona pathogen.
The farm is now under quarantine and is cordoned off with a construction fence.
No one is allowed to leave the premises, food is delivered.
The authorities are now offering free Corona tests to the 3,300 residents of the municipality.
Since the harvesters had little contact with the local population, the district office previously assumed that the infections did not spread beyond the farm.
Remorse: Confession of the alleged arsonist of Nantes
My client has shown himself to be cooperative, lawyer Quentin Chabert told the newspaper.
The defense attorney added: "He greatly regrets the actions, the confession was a release for him."
His mandate was "plagued by remorse and greatly affected by the extent of the destruction."
According to the prosecutor's office, if convicted, the man faces ten years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros.
The Gothic St. Peter's and Paul's Cathedral in Nantes was badly damaged in a fire on Saturday last week.
The fire broke out in three places far apart in the church.
Laboratory tests confirmed the suspicion of arson.
The now imprisoned suspect had already been arrested a few hours after the fire.
He was released after one day.
The man works as a volunteer for the diocese of Nantes and was responsible for the closure of the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
Since there was no trace of a violent intrusion into the church, he quickly came to the attention of the investigators.
Discussing the abolition of the 50 + 1 rule
Former DFB president Reinhard Grindel has recommended thinking about abolishing the 50 + 1 rule.
German football should at least discuss setting conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates a fait accompli, Grindel told the "Bild am Sonntag."
He stressed: "For the clubs that are most likely to be dangerous in Bavaria and Dortmund, the 50 + 1 rules do not work anyway: See Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, one cannot avoid the debate as to whether it is not necessary to make it easier for associations that want to break into this phalanx to involve investors. "
However, he has doubts as to whether there is a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority shareholdings, which are prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50 + 1 rule.
It remains a legal risk to draw investment fences around the Bundesliga as a business location in a European internal market, said Grindel.
The former head of the DFB sees the danger that "the attempts to create a more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will ultimately only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but will not lead to more excitement in the championship."
Even an equal distribution of TV funds will not have a decisive effect.
FC Bayern has a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million.
So the differences are already immense among the first three clubs alone.
The other 15 clubs have an average budget of 130 million, explained the 58-year-old.
Looking at the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
Unfortunately, there have been people who have noticed this mistake and stabbed the press instead of talking to me about it, Grindel said about the acceptance of an expensive watch that led to his retirement in April 2019.
I was very preoccupied with that. "
He had received the gift worth about 11,000 euros from a Ukrainian official.
I committed a breach of compliance and it was right to draw conclusions from it, said Grindel.
I was completely transparent and unsuspecting about the ominous watch gift.
Many people in the DFB knew about it. "
He had never "made a secret of the gift," assured the 58-year-old.
This may be called naive, at least this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption. "
Black Lives Matter: Injured and one dead
Protests against police violence in the United States have come to a head again as a result of Donald Trump's deployment of federal police officers in several cities.
On Saturday there were clashes between demonstrators and police officers in various cities.
Three people were injured in Louisville and 16 people were arrested in Seattle.
In Austin, one person was killed by gunfire while a demonstration train was crossing an intersection.
Previously, clashes had occurred again in Portland during protests against racism and police violence.
The security forces, including federal police officers, used tear gas on Saturday night and forcibly dispersed demonstrators.
Hundreds of demonstrators, some of them armed, marched through Louisville in Kentucky on Saturday, demanding that those responsible for the death of Breonna Taylor be held responsible.
The 26-year-old student was shot dead in March during a drug raid in her apartment in Louisville.
The target of the raid was someone else who did not live there, and no drugs were found.
On Saturday, when a member of a group that describes itself as an armed alliance of black Americans fired a shot, three people were injured.
According to NBC, they were taken to the hospital.
None of them were in danger of their lives.
The police set up barricades because counter-demonstrators from a white militia had formed.
In the end, there was no clash between the two groups.
In Austin, Texas, one person was shot and died during a "Black Lives Matter" demonstration.
According to the police, a suspect was taken into custody.
So far, she did not provide further information on the circumstances of the crime.
According to the New York Times, Mayor Steve Adler said he was, like many in the city, "inconsolable and stunned" by what had happened.
Demonstrators in the American metropolis of Seattle also clashed with the police on Saturday.
They set fire to trailers in front of a juvenile prison, and the police used stun grenades and pepper spray.
According to the Seattle Times, 16 people were arrested for resisting police officers or assault.
In the city of Oakland, California, a courthouse was set on fire.
A small group of protesters smashed windows, shot down fireworks and blinded police officers with lasers, Oakland police said late on Saturday evening (local time).
The fire was quickly extinguished.
In Aurora, a suburb of Denver in Colorado, a car drove through a crowd demonstrating on a highway.
According to the police, one of the protesters fired a gun and at least one person was taken to hospital injured.
In addition, windows were smashed in a court and a fire was set, according to the police.
Investigations have been started.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historical costumes defy Corona
Although the big show in the spa town was missing, visitors and performers enjoyed the Rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, performers and organizers: The Rakoczy weekend without a Rakoczy festival.
But even if the big party mile in the city center was missing, the crowds and program highlights such as Saale burning, Rakoczy ball or parade, many people got their money's worth with the Corona-compliant alternative program.
I think we have succeeded in spreading Rakoczy flair, says spa director Sylvie Thormann.
The guests had accepted it well.
In principle, one returns to the beginnings of the Rakoczy festival, when only the historical ones were the focus of the festival.
Pleasant atmosphere
Vesna Konhäuser and her husband have been visiting Bad Kissingen for the Rakoczy festival for more than 25 years.
This is also the case in the Corona year.
The couple made themselves comfortable at the Luitpold Casino, watching the historical while strolling and listening to the Cuban live music at the casino restaurant.
I think it's so pleasant, says Konhäuser.
She does not miss the crowds that otherwise belong to Rakoczy.
But it lacks the usual program highlights, especially Saale on Friday evening, as well as the historic parade and the closing fireworks display on Sunday evening.
That's a pity.
The weather would have been a great fit this year, she says.
Rakoczy equestrian tournament to take place again
For the performers of the historical spa guests, the alternative program sometimes meant more work.
For example, for Christina Gold, who takes part in the parade in a normal year and can be seen on the carriage of the spa garden café.
This year, on Saturdays and Sundays, she was walking around the city in costume.
It's more strenuous, otherwise we'll have it easier, she says.
The riding club had less to do, even if individual riders were on the road in the park.
We very much hope that the equestrian quadrille will take place again next year, says chairwoman Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that after a break of several years, a Rakoczy equestrian tournament will take place again in 2021.
28 Corona cases with Spanish second division club Fuenlabrada
The Spanish second division football club CF Fuenlabrada is sliding deeper and deeper into crisis due to a Corona outbreak.
Since the newcomer from near Madrid, despite the first Corona cases, flew to the city of A Coruña for a game on July 20, one low blow follows the next.
By Sunday, 28 players or team members had tested positive and one was hospitalized, according to the club.
Fuenlabrada from the city of the same name southwest of Madrid still had the chance to reach the promotion playoffs.
Now there is even the threat of relegation to the B-Group of the Second League.
The match against Deportivo La Coruña last Monday was cancelled at the last moment, the prosecutor's office is investigating a possible crime against public health, the supreme sports authority CSD is considering the forced relegation of the club.
The players and other team members are quarantined in a hotel.
Until the sixth day of the quarantine, they received no fresh towel and no gel, wrote the sports newspaper "AS."
Photos show players hanging up underwear and club clothes in their rooms in the hotel to dry, after they apparently had to wash them themselves.
Also the bed linen was not changed for five days.
Another problem is eating.
It is neither good nor sufficient, wrote "AS."
The club management, on the other hand, said they were satisfied with the hotel.
The club's lawyer, Javier Tebas Llanas, rejected the accusation of intentionally endangering public health.
According to the son of the president of the Spanish Primera Division, Javier Tebas, the news agency Europa Press and the sports newspaper "Marca" reported that they did not violate the Corona rules set by the football association.
Before departure, there were four people infected by July 19, but they were all isolated and did not travel with them.
Right before the flight to A Coruña on Monday, all players and team members were tested again.
When the team was already in A Coruña, the Corona test was positive for "five or six" other team members.
The game was cancelled 60 minutes before kick-off, said Tebas Llanas.
Police must catch torn-out horses at the steam compartment
Two animals were on the road.
The police led her back to her owner.
On Sunday morning shortly before 6 o'clock a road user informed two free-running horses on the feeder between the junction Donnersdorf / Steinsfeld and the motorway junction Theres.
When the officials arrived, the horses were already back between the feeder and the village of Dampfach.
After the officials were able to win the trust of the horses shortly before the steam compartment, they each had a rope carried in the patrol car.
Professional cyclist Tony Martin: Career sequel imaginable
Time trial specialist Tony Martin is thinking about a continuation of his career.
Frankfurt / Main - The seven-time time trial world champion Tony Martin can imagine continuing his cycling career.
The 35-year-old told the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung" (Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung) how and in what form the team could proceed.
Martin is currently employed by the Dutch team Jumbo-Visma and had considered ending his career after this year before the Corona break.
The negotiations with his team are also about the number of race days, he said.
Or other problems that would plague him as a family man, said Martin.
He used to get up after a fall, and the first thought was: "Quickly back on the bike.
Today, as the father of a young daughter, I think: What if. "
The professional cyclist acknowledged that there are certainly aspects with which he is increasingly struggling.
But it was good for me to realize from the Corona era what I have in cycling and how much I enjoyed it. "
The time trial specialist returns to the competition at the Tour de l'Ain (5 to 9 August).
Bavaria: At least four dead on Bavaria's streets at the weekend
The fine weather attracts bikers to the streets in many places.
For at least three people, the motorcycle tour ends fatally.
An 18-year-old pedestrian also dies.
Schönthal - Several people, mostly young, died in accidents on Bavaria's roads over the weekend.

Why the car got into the opposite lane was initially unclear.
On Saturday in Upper Bavaria, a 22-year-old collided with a horse-drawn carriage on his plane.
According to the police, he was on his way downhill at Beilngries.
In a left turn he crashed into the carriage.
His injuries were so severe that he died at the scene of the accident.
Of the twelve passengers in the carriage, one man was seriously injured and one man was slightly injured, according to the police.
In another fatal accident, an 18-year-old died in the Upper Palatinate town of Bad Kötzting.
He lay down on a road during the night of Sunday and was overrun by a 42-year-old driver.
According to the police, the 18-year-old wanted to sleep.
The driver was unable to brake in time.
At Schönberg (district of Freyung-Grafenau) on Saturday a 57-year-old biker crashed head-on into a car in a right turn despite full braking.
He died at the scene of the accident.
The 57-year-old driver suffered a shock and the remaining three people in the car were uninjured.
The safety of motorcyclists was discussed on Saturday by Bavaria's Minister of Transport Kerstin Schreyer (CSU).
In a letter to the organizer of the biker protests announced for August against driving bans, Gabor Kovacs, the minister referred to extensive investments such as underrun protection on guardrails and the defusing of dangerous curves.
In recent years, we have achieved a great deal for the safety of motorcyclists, the letter said.
The number of motorcyclists killed was reduced by around 28 percent compared to 2011. "
Kovac tests with Monaco against Frankfurt
Frankfurt / Main (dpa) - For football coach Niko Kovac, his new club AS Monaco will soon be reunited with Eintracht Frankfurt.
The eight-time French champion will make a guest appearance on August 1 (6 p.m.) at Hesse, the former club of the Croatian.
For the Bundesliga club, this is the first and only endurance test before the return leg in the Europa League against FC Basel (6 August).
Because of the coronavirus pandemic, the encounter will be held without spectators.
We are particularly looking forward to this game.
It's always nice to come to Frankfurt and meet friends, explained Kovac.
This is an interesting test in sporting terms, said the 48-year-old.
Before joining FC Bayern Munich, Kovac had coached Hesse from 2016 to 2018 and led them to victory in the DFB-Pokal.
A top-class opponent like Monaco is a good test for us with regard to the game against Basel.
Like all Frankfurters, I am looking forward to seeing Niko Kovac again, said Eintracht coach Adi Hütter.
The 50-year-old Austrian had succeeded the Croat at Eintracht.
In March, the team from Frankfurt lost the round-of-16 first leg against Basel in their own stadium 3-0.
Nearly 50 new infections: Landkreis Hof just past the lockdown
In the district of Hof, the number of known new Corona infections increased further over the weekend: From 39 on Friday and 43 on Saturday (one person has recovered and is no longer included in this statistic) to 47 on Sunday.
In addition, there is a case in the town of Hof.
This brings the courtyard area closer to the critical mark of 50 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants in one week.
700 killed by monsoon rains in Southeast Asia
The severe flooding in Southeast Asia has affected more than 9 million people, mainly in Bangladesh, India and Nepal.
Due to the heavy monsoon rain, a total of 700 people were killed.
In Bangladesh, the Red Crescent is trying to reach the isolated people in boats.
Whole villages are under water.
The farmers have lost their crops.
Tank rhinos in national park die from landslides
In Kaziranga National Park, several of the 120 tank rhinos were killed by landslides.
They are under protection and are considered to be in danger of extinction.
This year, the floods are particularly severe, which scientists attribute to climate change.
According to the United Nations, Bangladesh is one of the countries most affected by global warming.
New apartments are empty
In the village of Cox's Bazar in the south of Bangladesh, the state has built apartments for 650 people displaced by the floods.
So far only a few have moved in.
It is difficult to bring people to Cox's Bazaar.
The enthusiasm is also maintained in Grenezn.
Anyone who used to have a house, no matter how small it was and resembled a hut, often does not want to spend his life in a large block of flats.
Many apartments are empty, but - the government wants it - will soon be occupied by those who have lost their homes due to the floods.

Argentina rejects counter-offer from creditors
The new demands could not be fulfilled, the Ministry of Economy in Buenos Aires announced on Saturday.
This would not only be irresponsible, but also unfair, it said in a statement.
While 50 percent of children in Argentina live in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors. "
The debt of the second largest economy in South America is no longer sustainable under current conditions.
That is why Argentina is calling on its private creditors to waive some of their claims of about 66 billion US dollars (about 59 billion euros).
If no agreement is reached, the country is once again threatened with bankruptcy.
It would be the ninth default in Argentine history.
Most recently, lenders had demanded higher interest rates on government bonds and changes to some contractual clauses.
However, the Argentine government is sticking to its last offer and is not prepared to make any further concessions.
Argentina is experiencing a severe financial and economic crisis.
The inflation rate has recently been more than 50 percent.
For the current year, experts expect economic power to decline by around ten percent.
At the end of May, Argentina failed to settle interest claims amounting to 503 million US dollars, resulting in a limited default.
Arrived professionally - not yet in private
It's going very well "- Dr. Stefanie Kramer draws this conclusion after her first days at the notary's office in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything went very fast: In mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she would succeed Lutz Feller at the Eggenfelden notary's office.
Just six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the lawyer, who holds a doctorate in law, started work, and normal day-to-day business has long been in full swing.
Privately, however, I still have to arrive, she explains in conversation with the Rottaler Anzeiger and laughs.
Of course, the short lead time was not enough to relocate the center of life from Regensburg completely to Eggenfelden, reports the native of Dingolfinger.
She and her husband, who works as a judge at the district court in Regensburg, are currently looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city.
At least her husband could still apply for parental leave at short notice in order to be able to guarantee the care of the two daughters (3 1 ⁄ 2 and 1 1 ⁄ 2 years old).
In order not to have to commute every day from Regensburg, she also has an overnight stay with her parents in Dingolfing, explains the 39-year-old.
Growing up in the neighbouring district, the city of Eggenfelden has been known to her for a long time.
During visits to the site with her family over the past few months, she realized again: "Eggenfelden is a really nice small town."
She was all the more pleased that she had made the race in the selection process for the vacancy.
Her home country of Lower Bavaria also plays a central role in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's professional career: After studying law in Passau, she completed her legal traineeship and the 2nd state examination in Regensburg.
After several positions as a notary assessor, among others in Rehau and Hof in Upper Franconia, Babenhausen in Unterallgäu and Regensburg - during which time she also "incidentally" shouldered her doctorate in employment law - she took up her first position as a notary in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau in 2012.
In 2016, she went on parental leave, followed by moving to Regensburg.
Since then, she has taken over representative services in various notary offices.
When the position in Eggenfelden was advertised because of the approaching retirement of Lutz Feller, she saw the right time for full career re-entry, explains the 39-year-old.
The team of her predecessor, who will take over the holiday representation at the notary's office in the future, has completely taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer - and immediately has some praise for the firm's team: "It's going very well!"
The fact that she can rely on well-rehearsed processes makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming relocation of the private centre of life.
When it comes to kindergarten and nursery places, she has already contacted a local institution.
And if everything goes as desired, she hopes to pursue her hobby here as soon as possible - and get to know the most beautiful jogging tracks in the Rottal valley.
BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The biggest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be 20 percent filled at the start of the season in the event of a fan return.
Due to the distance regulation, which is mandatory, we are currently planning with 12,000 to 15,000 spectators, Borussia Dortmund's managing director Carsten Cramer told the "Tagesspiegel."
Normally, the arena in the district city holds just over 81,000 spectators at Bundesliga matches.
In last season's ghost games caused by the Corona pandemic, BVB lost around four million euros per game.
Cramer, who is responsible for marketing, digitisation and internationalisation at BVB, hopes that in addition to the normal audience seats, some of the approximately 4,000 seats in the hospitality area can be opened up again: "It goes without saying that it will be a blow to the office if this revenue breaks away completely."
In view of the ongoing Corona crisis, everyone is currently "well advised to take a stable side length."
If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people in Germany alone are in short-time work, then the need for entertainment is limited, explained Cramer.
The head of marketing in Dortmund praised the BVB professionals for their partial salary waiver, which should help to overcome the crisis: "Of course, the players know that their salary waiver has a different effect than if we put 100 people working in merchandising on short-time work."
Tiny miracles: Early start in life with a few hundred grams
Hardly heavier than a packet of butter, just three tablespoons of blood in his entire body: That was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The boy is one of about 400 premature babies who are cared for annually at the children's hospital in Graz.
A quarter of them weigh less than 1,500 grams, a few - like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael - are extreme lightweights with a birth weight of less than one kilogram.
They are so small and born so early that neither lungs, intestines, nor muscles are fully developed.
Their skin is sometimes so delicate that they could injure the electrodes of an ECG.
And they are so tiny that they sometimes wear doll's clothes and mini diapers made especially for them.
But not so small that they wouldn't be in voice - "and how," smiles Berndt Urlesberger.
Even if of course they don't scream as loud as big babies. "
When the whiteboard becomes a stage
Despite the Corona theatre in the classroom: The whiteboard as a stage experienced the 9th grades of the Sankt-Jakobus-Gymnasium in Abtsgmünd shortly before the start of the holiday.
Actress Julia Sylvester from the Theater der Stadt Aalen presented the students with the production "Das Heimatkleid" (The Home Dress) via video.
Afterwards, the pupils were able to discuss the play and the performance with the actress and director Winfried Tobias via Skype.
The idea for the performance format from the current Corona situation was born.
Teacher Teresa Nar was happy about the enrichment of the lessons.
Even if at the end all participants agreed that the direct encounter in the theatre and stage space would offer additional stimuli, the theatre also sees the potential for contact with schools.
If we further improve the technical framework, this could be an interesting addition to the game operation, said director Winfried Tobias.
First round drawn: TSV 1860 would face Eintracht Frankfurt in the DFB-Pokal
Should TSV 1860 qualify for the DFB-Pokal, the Lions will face Eintracht Frankfurt in the first round.
This resulted in the draw on Sunday.
Munich - Sixty possible opponents in the first round of the DFB-Pokal have been announced.
The Lions would face Eintracht Frankfurt in a successful qualification.
This was the result of the draw on Sunday evening at the ARD-Sportschau.
Because the field of participants is not yet complete due to the Corona pandemic, placeholders were used in the draw.
Due to the voluntary renunciation of semi-final opponents FC Memmingen, TSV 1860 is already in the final of the Bavarian Toto Cup (September 4 or 5).
There the lions meet either the Würzburger Kickers or Viktoria Aschaffenburg.
Should second division side Würzburg reach the final, Sechzig would already have qualified for the first round of the DFB-Pokal.
Otherwise, the Giesinger would have to prevail in the final against Regionalliga club Aschaffenburg.
The first round of the DFB-Pokal will take place between 11 and 14 September, one week before the third league starts.
Gone with the Wind: Film legend Olivia de Havilland is dead
The film legend and Oscar winner Olivia de Havilland is dead.
She died of natural causes on Sunday in Paris at the age of 104, confirmed her spokeswoman for the German Press Agency.
De Havilland was known for her role as Melanie Hamilton in the Southern epic "Gone with the Wind" (1939).
Born to British parents in Tokyo, Olivia de Havilland moved to California as a toddler.
The Austrian theatre man Max Reinhardt discovered the 19-year-old in the role of Hermia von Shakespeare's "Midsummer Night's Dream."
The Warner Brothers film studio signed her for seven years and brought her out big alongside Eroll Flynn.
She made eight films with the Heartbreaker.
In 1946 she won her first Oscar in the lead role of "To Each His Own."
The film was shown in Germany under the title "Mutterherz."
Three years later came the award for Best Actress in William Wyler's "The Heiress" (The Heiress).
She also received a lot of recognition as a neurotic eccentric in "The Dark Mirror" and "The Snake Pit."
Daphne du Maurier suggested her in 1952 for the leading role in the film adaptation of her novel "My Cousin Rachel."
The piece was a worldwide success.
She played with her longtime girlfriend Bette Davis in "Lullaby for a Corpse."
From the marriage to the writer Marcus Goodrich (1946 to 1953) the son Benjamin was born.
In Paris de Havilland married the journalist Pierre Paul Galante and had his daughter Gisèle with him.
This marriage also broke up.
However, rumors of an affair with former British Prime Minister Edward Heath have never been confirmed.
Road to Timmendorf: Beach volleyball: Thole / Wickler miss the final at comeback
The World Cup second Julius Thole and Clemens Wickler missed the final at the beach volleyball tournament "Road to Timmendorf."
At the meeting of the top teams in Düsseldorf they defeated their national team colleagues Nils Ehlers and Lars Flüggen 1: 2 in the semi-finals (17: 21, 21: 17, 19: 21).
Thole / Wickler last played at the World Tour Final in Rome in September of last year.
In the final on the Rhine, their conquerors Ehlers / Flüggen defeated the surprise team Lukas Pfretschner and his interim partner Steven van de Velde 0-2 (17-21, 17-21).
In addition to the show tournament, three starting places for the German championships were played at the beginning of September in Timmendorfer Strand: The tickets were secured by Armin Dollinger / Simon Kulzer, Manuel Harms / Richard Peemüller and Simon Pfretschner / Milan Sievers.
Kalbitz expulsion from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "fig leaf"
From the point of view of the FDP, the expulsion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is only a "fig leaf" and does not change the character of the party.
The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the right-wing extremists in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the tip of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD, the FDP domestic politician Benjamin Strasser told the news agency dpa in Berlin.
On Saturday, after several hours of hearing in Stuttgart, the Federal Arbitration Court of the AfD confirmed the expulsion of Kalbitz, which was decided by the majority of the federal executive board in May.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD parliamentary group in the Brandenburg state parliament.
If the AfD were really interested in consistently removing right-wing extremists from its party, officials such as Björn Höcke and his supporters would have been excluded long ago, said Strasser.
However, there is no political will for this in the AfD, because right-wing extremism now belongs to the party. "
CSU General Secretary Markus Blume commented similarly: "The fact that Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded does not say anything and does not change anything," he told the "Welt am Sonntag."
Rather, it speaks volumes about how many frenetic supporters a right-wing extremist still has in the middle of the AfD. "
Blume assumes that the AfD will again be below five percent in elections in the future.
The days of the AfD in parliaments are numbered. "
Kalbitz was one of the spokesmen of the now officially dissolved "wing" around the Thuringian AfD state and parliamentary group chairman Björn Höcke; the Protection of the Constitution classifies the Strönung as an "assured right-wing extremist endeavor."
In May, the AfD federal executive had thrown Kalbitz out of the party.
As a reason he stated that Kalbitz did not indicate an earlier membership in the now banned far-right "Heimattreuen Deutsche Jugend" (HDJ) and with the Republicans when he joined the party.
Kalbitz denies membership in the HDJ.
The chairman of the left parliamentary group in the Brandenburg state parliament, Sebastian Walter, also stressed that the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court did not change the character of the AfD: "The wolf has only eaten chalk.
The AfD remains a far-right party, with or without Kalbitz. "
Neither the federal party nor the right wing will be weakened with this decision.
The manoeuvre of the Meuthen troops is transparent.
They want to avoid further observation by the Protection of the Constitution and try to get through under the radar, said Walter.
The AfD will not get rid of the ghosts it called.
An expulsion does not change anything, commented the Brandenburg SPD general secretary Erik Stohn on the decision in the Kalbitz case.
Here the AfD state association and the parliamentary group held their right-wing leader to this day. "
The legal dispute over Kalbitz's membership in the AfD will continue.
The latter announced on Saturday that he would now take civil action against the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court.
North Sea wind farms provide a good 21 percent more electricity
The wind power plants on the German North Sea fed 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity into the grid in the first six months of the year.
This is a good 21 percent more than in the same period last year, said the network operator Tennet in Bayreuth.
TenneT is responsible for the transmission of North Sea electricity to the mainland and the transmission through the German electricity grid.
The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which do not belong to Tennet's grid area, have fed in another 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
Overall, wind power from the North Sea and Baltic Sea comes to 13.73 TWh, compared to a good 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind harvest at sea thus accounts for almost 19 percent of the total wind power in Germany, which is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms provide higher generation capacity
In addition to the wind conditions, the increased contribution of offshore wind energy has resulted from higher generation capacities, as new wind farms have been connected to the grid over the past twelve months.
If the 1270 wind power plants in the North Sea were all running at full power at the same time, they could generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient; according to Tennet, it is 7.1 gigawatts.
By 2030 it is expected to rise to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea.
In Germany and the Netherlands, we are investing 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore grid connections, said Tennet Managing Director Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, even at sea, wind farms cannot utilize their capacity, but reach about 40 percent.
The record day so far this year is January 2, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind turbines produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, equivalent to three to four nuclear power plants.
This means that almost seven million households could be supplied with electricity.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the Gmünder Kunstverein.
This was almost a small anniversary celebration for the 130.
Birthday of the Gmünder Kunstverein: The exhibition opening "Skirmish" with works by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold went beyond the usual scope after the Corona break.
Many more art lovers than usual followed the dialogue between the artist and the chairman of the Kunstverein, Professor Dr. Klaus Ripper.
The musical equivalent was provided by the band "Defenders of the Universe" on the southern Kornhausplatz.
North of the gallery, the association "Sandtogether" was involved.
Freital: Windbergfest cancelled due to Corona
The Windberg Festival will not take place this year.
The city of Freital has cancelled the three-day festival scheduled for September.
In other years, over 30,000 people had attended this city festival.
We really did not make this decision easy for ourselves and - knowing how difficult it is economically for the participants - we hoped until the last minute, said Lord Mayor Uwe Rumberg (non-party).
But ultimately, as an organizer, we are responsible for the health of many thousands of people.
Because if tens of thousands had flocked to the festival grounds and the marquee, minimum distances, hygiene regulations and contact tracking in accordance with the current Coronaschutz regulation could not have been complied with.
Or the restrictions would have been so severe that there was not much left of a folk festival.
Moreover, the organizational and monitoring effort would increase disproportionately many times over.
Rumberg comforted himself for next year.
Then the city of Freital will celebrate its 100th anniversary with the Winterberg Festival from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the Day of the Saxons from 10 to 12 September 2021.
Olympic dressage champion Werth in Achleiten not to be beaten
Achleiten - The six-time Olympic champion Isabell Werth was the outstanding rider at the dressage tournament in Achleiten, Austria.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg scored four victories in four starts at the weekend.
After winning a Grand Prix at the start with Weihegold and Quantaz, she was also unbeatable on Sunday in the Grand Prix Special and in the freestyle.
On the 15-year-old mare Weihegold Werth won on Sunday in the special against the Austrian Victoria Max-Theurer on Abegglen.
The German was also clearly ahead of her 34-year-old student Victoria Max-Theurer in the freestyle on Saturday on Quantaz.
Werth's winning horse Quantaz belongs to Max-Theurer.
The most successful dressage rider in the world is to establish the ten-year-old stallion in the Grand Prix.
It was Quantaz's first freestyle ever.
Werth had already won all four important tests at the first tournament in Achleiten three weeks ago.
The last of the three international tournaments is scheduled for August 14-16.
More air traffic controllers in Worms in the future
Worms University goes further into the air: "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" is donating a professorship for "Air Traffic Management."
A corresponding contract between the university and DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially concluded for three years and will start in 2021.
With the professorship, it is possible to start studying not only in the summer semester, but also in the winter semester.
This makes it possible to train twice as many students as before.
At the same time, capacities at both the university and the air traffic control academy of DFS are being utilized evenly.
DFS will advise the university on setting up and filling the professorship.
Represented at the university since 2019
Since the summer semester 2019, the first students have been studying Air Traffic Management as part of their training as an air traffic controller at Worms University of Applied Sciences.
Nine students have already started this year.
So far, DFS's experience has been very positive and the students' performance is outstanding.
The combination of studies and air traffic controller training contributes significantly to further increasing the attractiveness of the air traffic controller profession.
In these times, promotion is not easy for us economically.
However, we firmly expect air traffic to recover and to grow again in the long term.
In order to be able to fulfil our statutory mandate in the future, we need highly qualified personnel, says Professor Klaus-Dieter SCHEURLE, Managing Director of DFS at the signing of the contract.
For DFS, the endowed professorship is a future-proof investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, interdisciplinary knowledge base in the long term.
We are therefore continuing our good cooperation with the university and at the same time confirming our attractiveness as an employer. "
This is also underlined by Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of Worms University of Applied Sciences: "The endowed professorship forms an important bridge between science and business.
With it, we would like to build on the existing cooperation with DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual bachelor's degree program Air Traffic Management. "
The trust of German air traffic control is both a motivation and an obligation for Worms University of Applied Sciences to further expand its teaching and research expertise in the future fields of aviation.
By working for the air traffic controllers of tomorrow, the university could set very special highlights and innovative priorities for its students with the first endowed professorship for a dual course of study.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary at the Ministry of Science, Continuing Education and Culture, emphasizes: "With its focus on aviation, Worms University of Applied Sciences has a unique selling point in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Today's signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the profile of the university. "
Rescue helicopter lands on the A 45
The A 45 motorway was fully closed for about 30 minutes on Saturday afternoon in the direction of Aschaffenburg, as the rescue helicopter was in operation after a traffic accident.
A 76-year-old drove a Ford at 12: 40 p.m. in the Alzenau-Mitte exit in the curve straight ahead and landed at the guardrail.
The impact triggered the front airbags, the driver suffered minor injuries to his face and had to be taken to a hospital for treatment.
The 72-year-old passenger's injuries were treated by the emergency doctor and the patient was then flown by rescue helicopter to a hospital.
Currently, however, the police assume that there is no danger to life.
The damaged vehicle, which caused damage of about 2000 Euros, had to be towed away.
Heil wants to examine other industries after the meat industry
The Corona crisis brought the conditions in parts of the meat industry to light again.
Tightening the laws are imminent.
But are they right - and will it stick to that?
Federal Labour Minister Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to review other industries in accordance with the now planned strict regulations against maladministration in the meat industry.
We will look at the industry for industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective industry if necessary, Heil told the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany's employers are already warning against restricting work contracts in general.
Following the mass Corona outbreak at the meat giant Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the federal cabinet wants to pass a law of salvation this Wednesday.
Large slaughterhouses should no longer be allowed to deploy external personnel for slaughter, dismantling and meat processing.
For this purpose, the use of contractual and temporary workers is to be banned there.
Employer President Ingo Kramer told dpa: "Hands off a general restriction on work contracts and employee assignment if you don't want to completely strangle the economy."
Work contracts, for example, are mandatory for large areas of crafts, construction and plant engineering as the basis for their added value to the customer.
Individual misconduct cannot destroy such an important instrument. "
Heil assured: "My goal is not to ban works contracts everywhere in the German economy."
Work contracts are meaningful.
If an industrial company commissions a craftsman to install a safety system, this is a normal work contract. "
The German meat industry considers a ban on works contracts and temporary work in its industry alone to be unconstitutional.
It is not possible to explain why different labour laws should apply to portioning and packaging cheese in the future than to sausage, according to a statement on the bill, as reported by the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Saturday).
In the event of a ban, the consumer price would rise by 10 to 20 percent per kilo and product.
According to the results of an audit by the NRW Occupational Health and Safety Administration, many Eastern European employees from works contract companies worked in the industry, sometimes 16 hours a day.
Often they did not have a break.
Wages were retained for protective equipment or rent.
It was also noted that the situation in the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Heil said that a relatively strict law had already come into force for the meat industry in 2017.
However, these were bypassed by "tricky constructions."
Now we need to fundamentally clean up. "
The politician announced: "In the Occupational Health and Safety Act, which we intend to adopt in the cabinet at the end of July, there are also measures that do not only affect the meat industry - for example, higher testing rates for occupational health and safety or clear criteria for community accommodation."
The draft presented to the dpa includes amendments to the law on safeguarding workers' rights in the meat industry and the Occupational Health and Safety Act.
Brandenburg's Consumer Protection Minister Ursula Nonnemacher (Greens) believes that more intensive controls are needed.
I would like us to be able to carry out even more checks in many areas of supervision: Food inspections, animal welfare, everything possible, including animal transport, said Nonnemacher on Sunday on the RBB programme "Brandenburg aktuell."
But more staff positions are also needed for more checks.
Three dead in crash of ultralight aircraft in Germany
According to the police, three people died when an ultralight plane crashed into an apartment building in Wesel in the German federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia.
One child was slightly injured.
Two other people were rescued injured in the accident, said a spokesman for the Wesel district control center.
A parachute was found at the scene of the accident, according to the police.
The "Rheinische Post" reported, citing eyewitnesses, that before the crash the plane had collided with a hot air balloon.
The house is a one- or two-family house.
Further details were not initially revealed.
Eviction of Frankfurt's Opernplatz proceeded peacefully
One week after the riots in Frankfurt, the eviction of the opera square in the night to Sunday was also peaceful.
At last a few dozen people stayed in the square, but left it before the curfew began at 1 o'clock.
The police had been on duty since the early evening with numerous officers, and a larger police force could be seen throughout the city.
For the first time this weekend, starting at midnight, there was a ban on entering the Opera Square, where riots had occurred a week ago.
Police officers had been attacked with bottles from the crowd of revellers.
According to police reports, at least five officers were injured and several police vehicles were damaged.
The night to Saturday was also quiet.
Car overturns: Young woman seriously injured in accident on federal highway 83 near Hofgeismar
A 21-year-old suffered serious injuries in an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme at around 1.25 p.m. on Sunday.
She was taken to the Klinikum Kassel.
The fire department used thermal imaging cameras to look for possible passengers.
According to the police, the woman was driving on the federal highway 83 in the direction of her home town of Hümme, when her car came off the road for a hitherto unknown reason and flipped over several times.
In order to rescue the victims, the fire department had to clear the roof of the car.
Since it was unclear whether there was anyone else in the vehicle, the adjacent corn field was searched from the rotary ladder with a thermal imaging camera.
The drone squadron from Warburg, which also works with thermal imaging cameras, had also been ordered to search for people.
However, the volunteers did not find anyone between the tall maize plants.
The seriously injured person was taken by ambulance to the hospital in Kassel for further treatment.
Almost 50 emergency personnel from the Hofgeismar, Hümme and Schöneberg fire departments were on site.
The federal highway was closed for two hours due to the accident.
Juventus Turin champion in Italy
Turin - After a redeeming goal by Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin has secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in a row.
The team around the five-time world footballer made perfect the 36th Scudetto in the club's history with a 2: 0 (1: 0) on Sunday evening in the home game against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo scored 1-0 before halftime.
With 83 points, Turin, which competed without the long-injured former international Sami Khedira, can no longer be pushed out of first place two matchdays before the end of the Serie A season.
The runner-up Inter Milan is seven points behind.
Juventus was harmless despite optical superiority in the first half, then Ronaldo scored after a free-kick variant with the last action.
The 35-year-old recycled a game played by Miralem Pjanic directly from the boundary of the penalty area with a flat shot (45th + 7).
Against the now more offensive guests Ronaldo was also involved in the 2: 0, after his shot Federico Bernardeschi (67.) dusted off.
This secured the lacklustre but decisive success.
The foul penalty shot to the bar in the 89th minute should only have been scored by Ronaldo himself in view of the goalscoring classification.
It's complicated to stay mentally and physically at ball level for 90 minutes.
The games are strange and the momentum is changing very slightly, explained coach Maurizio Sarri after the 1-2 draw at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Above all, the mental exhaustion of his players is great, said the Juve coach.
Because of the defeat, the Turin team had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
In the end, Juve's reassuring lead at the top of the table was mainly due to the weakness of its competitors.
Because in the eleven games before Sunday's game, the Sarri team had managed only five wins.
Whether Ronaldo will also be the top scorer is questionable.
While the Portuguese superstar has scored 31 goals so far, the former Dortmund Ciro Immobile has already scored 34 goals after his three-pack in the 5: 1 (1: 1) of fourth place Lazio Roma at Hellas Verona - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to FC Bayern's title win.
The current Juve pro Gonzalo Higuaín holds the record in Italy.
The Argentine scored 36 goals for SSC Napoli in the 2015 / 2016 season.
In August the next title chance awaits the "Old Lady" of Italian football.
Juventus are in the round of 16 of the Champions League, but on August 7 against Olympique Lyon they have to make up for a 0-1 first leg failure to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next knockout round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would be waiting as opponents.
Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal car races recorded
Stuttgart - Despite all the threatened penalties and court rulings, drivers continue to accelerate in countless illegal races on the roads of Baden-Württemberg: Last year and the first four months of this year, the police in the southwest have already registered more than 250 illegal car races.
There are no comparative figures for the years before, but the racers are increasingly doing the judicial authorities work: In 2018, a total of 155 investigations for illegal races were conducted at the public prosecutor's offices between Konstanz and Mannheim, a year later there were already 252 and in the current year until the beginning of June 151.
The races were less about organised events, according to the response of the Ministry of the Interior to an inquiry from the state parliament SPD.
In most cases, the drivers spontaneously competed against each other or escaped from the police - this is also reported as an illegal race.
At the wheel were mainly German men between the ages of 18 and 60.
113 fines - 15 times imprisonment
Only in comparatively few cases are the racers caught and asked to pay: According to the Ministry of the Interior, a total of 113 fines have been imposed since 2018 and 15 prison sentences have been pronounced.
However, there is no evidence that the number of illegal car races is actually increasing.
Rather, other drivers reacted more sensitively than before due to the numerous tragic accidents and trials of past years and reported more frequently, said a ministry spokesman.
The motorway 8 is particularly popular with racers. Again and again, motorists slow down traffic there in order to gain space and use the free track for a race.
Last August a dozen drivers were caught near Kirchheim unter Teck, three months earlier there were even 18 drivers on the A8 near Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular "race track"
On the A81 the police registered even more races than on any other federal motorway.
With a speed limit, an attempt is made to slow down the racers on the particularly affected section between Engen and Geisingen.
The mostly high-priced and souped-up sports and luxury cars often have Swiss license plates, because the drivers switch to the grass in Germany because of the heavy penalties for driving too fast and racing in the neighbouring country.
For the SPD, the speed limit must not be reduced to a few distances: "With a general speed limit of 130 kilometres per hour, we would tackle this problem on motorways," says Martin Rivoir, the transport expert of the SPD parliamentary group.
The inhibition threshold for racers would be significantly higher if you were not allowed to travel here and there legally with 200 kilometres per hour or more. "
Rivoir thinks less about education or image campaigns: "Anyone who ignores all rules in such a way and puts not only their own lives but also the lives of other road users at risk, can hardly be reached with reason."
ADAC calls for stronger police crackdown
However, this is not enough for the ADAC: "We assume that speeders will not be deterred by the speed limits," says Holger Bach, Head of Transport and Environment at the ADAC Württemberg.
It calls for additional and tougher controls on the affected routes.
Not infrequently, the high-speed test of strength turns into painful and consequential seriousness: Since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people across the country have died in the races, two of them uninvolved in a night crash in downtown Stuttgart and one in Gerlingen.
Two young men are said to have engaged in a car race there in November.
One of the vehicles came off the road, crashed into a garden wall and remained lying on its side, the 18-year-old passenger died.
21 other people have been injured in the races over the past two years.
However, according to Interior Minister Thomas Strobl, tougher penalties are not necessary: "There is no need for legislative action to toughen illegal motor vehicle races," says the Interior Ministry's paper.
Blue light from July 23: Thirsty burglar steals drinks from a snack bar
Rohrdorf: On Thursday a man broke into a snack bar in Rohrdorf (Calw district) and stole drinks and cash.

Ackermann sprints to victory on the final stage at Sibiu Tour
Professional cyclist Pascal Ackermann won his second day victory on the final stage of the 10th Sibiu Tour.
The 26-year-old Palatinate rider from Team Bora-Hansgrohe prevailed in the mass sprint on the 109 kilometre long section with start and finish in Sibiu, having already won a stage on Saturday.
It was the season's wins three and four for Ackermann.
His Austrian team mate Gregor Mühlberger prevailed in the overall standings.
The 26-year-old had confidently won the mountain time trial in the morning and thus took over the top of the classification.
Only 104 riders had entered the final stage in the evening.
No fewer than 18 starters fell victim to the time limit in the mountain time trial.
I am really happy to start the restart of the season with a win, Ackermann explained after his success on Saturday.
The sprint was really hectic, said the 26-year-old.
300 meters before the finish, he simply put on his sprint, "and it worked out perfectly."
According to the rules of the world governing body UCI, a Corona test was carried out for all race participants and their companions six days before the start of the race.
During the entire tour, drivers and supervisors in isolated hygiene bubbles were separated from the organisation team and the media.
Spectators at the start and finish were not allowed.
Control center gave instructions for amateur resuscitation
Düsseldorf - Tragic accident on Sunday lunchtime in Düsseldorf-Garath.
In an apartment building, a child (4) suddenly lay lifeless in the water while bathing.
According to the fire department, the emergency call was received shortly before 1 p.m.
A control center disponent immediately gave instructions for lay resuscitation, a fire department spokesperson told BILD.
The arriving rescue forces took over the resuscitation shortly afterwards.
The child, who was in danger of his life, was transported to the university hospital under resuscitation.
Why the accident occurred is unclear.
The police have routinely started an investigation into the accident.
The fire department spokesman said: "We assume a tragic accident in the apartment."
Nuremberg: Unauthorized tuning meeting - police intervene, 700 vehicles and around 1100 people
On Saturday night hundreds of cars and at times over 1000 people took part in a "tuning meeting" in the parking lot of a furniture store.
The police implemented their announcement to increase the control of such events.
A big tuning meeting took place on Saturday evening (July 25, 2020) in Nuremberg's southern city.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the Middle Franconian police, at around 10.30 p.m. the Nuremberg traffic police detected an increased volume of vehicles in the area of a large parking lot in Ingolstädter Straße.
As a result, the police carried out a large number of vehicle inspections.
Only recently the police announced their intention to step up action against so-called autoposers.
Illegal tuning meeting in Nuremberg: Only a small part of the "scene"
The officers at the top counted about 700 vehicles and about 1100 people, according to the police.
However, only a small proportion of those present can be attributed to the "Autoposer" and tuning scene.
Apparently, the majority of the relevant scene responded to the police appeal.
Based on the vehicles and persons on site, it can be assumed that these were mostly onlookers.
In addition, the vast majority of attendees adhered to the applicable infection protection regulations, in particular compliance with the minimum distance and the wearing of mouth-nose protection.
The inspection measures carried out on site were completed at 1: 00 a.m.
In total, the officials noticed such structural changes in 10 vehicles that the operating license had expired.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No car racing
There were no illegal car races.
The police headquarters of Middle Franconia will continue to keep an eye on the events and will continue to carry out increased control measures, also in connection with the emergence of onlookers, "it said.
The News5 agency spoke to Jürgen Schrödinger from the participating towing company: "They all have nice rims, we must not scratch them," said Schrödinger.
Special tapes would be used for this purpose.
Also because the cars are wider, the company must be careful not to cause any damage.
After all, the young people should get their cars back unscathed. "
Figures from the Employment Agency: 900 suspected cases of short-time work abuse
Berlin - According to its own statement, the Federal Employment Agency (BA) is investigating around 900 suspected cases of abuse of short-time worker benefits.
This is extremely little for more than 880,000 companies that have reported short-time work, Daniel Terzenbach, CEO responsible for operations, told the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung."
When many companies suddenly applied for short-time work at the beginning of the Corona crisis, the BA had to react quickly.
Normally, the examination takes up to three weeks.
We didn't have that much time in this hot phase.
We will take a closer look at the final accounts.
There will certainly be a lot more to come.
We are not naive and have a long breath. "
Indications of abuse often come from the affected employees or trade unions.
In addition, the BA uses analysis software to identify patterns of abuse.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is preparing for a possible wave of insolvency in the autumn.
Will there be significantly more bankruptcies than in the previous year?
The assessments differ, but we prepare ourselves for the case and are already training our employees in the employment agencies to process applications for insolvency money. "
The figures are still inconspicuous, said Terzenbach.
World Heritage in Potsdam: Party in the New Garden dissolved
Potsdam - On Friday evening about 40 young people celebrated a party in the New Garden.
The collection was dissolved at 8: 48 p.m. by the precinct drivers of the Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation (SPSG), the foundation reported on a PNN request.
As a result, the young people left the park.
On Saturday evening some youngsters played rugby in the New Garden.
The meadow had been cleared by precinct drivers, said SPSG spokesman Frank Kallensee on Sunday.
There are always illegal celebrations in the parks
In the parks of the foundation there are frequent accumulations where the distance and hygiene rules of the Covid 19 Coordination are not complied with.
At the end of June there was a celebration with about 300 people in the park Babelsberg, a week later about 150 people celebrated in the New Garden.
Even without the Corona Ordinance, the parks will be closed at nightfall.
Storage in the meadows is prohibited according to the parking regulations, there are only a few exceptions.
The foundation has been complaining for a long time that visitors are leaving more and more rubbish behind and destroying protected biotopes.
Meanwhile, illegal park parties in Berlin have reached a different dimension.
On Sunday night in the Hasenheide in the district of Neukölln, 5000 people celebrated an illegal techno party.
The event was dissolved by the police.
Austria: Mass tests after Corona outbreak in tourist resort
With hundreds of tests, authorities have responded to a Corona outbreak in the popular Upper Austrian tourist resort of St. Wolfgang.
The number of confirmed cases rose to 48, according to the state authorities in Linz.
More than 100 results were still pending in the evening.
Accordingly, many of those infected are young interns in tourism businesses, but at least one holiday guest has also tested positive.
Residents, guests and tourism staff were asked to stay in their accommodation on Saturday evening.
The curfew was set at 11 p.m.
There are cancellations and cancellations of bookings there and there, the head of the Wolfgangsee Tourism Association, Hans Wieser, told dpa.
Occasional guests also left prematurely.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist resort in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 overnight stays last year.
In a normal season, about a third of the guests are Germans.
On Friday the first infections were publicly reported.
On Saturday, the head of the district authority, Alois Lanz, defended the behaviour of the interns, who had celebrated in several restaurants and may have been infected there.
We all enjoyed doing this in our youth, he told the radio station Ö1.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The tourism association launched an information campaign to raise awareness among young employees about the dangers of Covid-19.
Starting on Saturday, hundreds of employees, holidaymakers and locals were tested.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang from July 15th were contacted.
The eruption evokes memories of the Austrian ski and party resort Ischgl in Tyrol, which in the early stages of the pandemic was a center of the Corona spread throughout Europe.
In total, more than 1,500 people in Austria are currently infected with the virus.
The focus of the new infections is on Vienna and Upper Austria.
Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualified for Champions League
London (dpa) - English football champion Manchester United returns to the Champions League after a year's absence.
The Red Devils secured third place in the table on the last match day of the Premier League with a 2-0 (0-0) win over their direct rivals Leicester City.
The Foxes now have to settle for the Europa League, because Chelsea FC passed by and also qualified for the premier league in fourth place.
In the fight against relegation, Aston Villa was able to cheer.
Manchester United took the lead with a penalty kick from Bruno Fernandes (71st minute).
After a red card for Leicester City in injury time, Jesse Lingard (90th + 8) scored the final score.
Chelsea, opponents of FC Bayern in the Champions League round of 16, won in parallel 2-0 (2-0) against Wolverhampton Wanderers thanks to Mason Mount (45th + 1) and Olivier Giroud (45th + 4).
That means a lot to me, said coach Frank Lampard, who is also in the final of the FA Cup against Arsenal in his first season as Chelsea coach.
Chelsea's win over Wolverhampton also benefited Tottenham Hotspur, which passed the Wolves with a meagre 1-1 (1-0) at Crystal Palace and started in sixth place in the Europa League.
Aston Villa won the long-distance duel with FC Watford and AFC Bournemouth, but had to tremble for a long time for class retention at West Ham United.
The late lead of Jack Grealish (84th) was immediately compensated by Andrej Jarmolenko (85th).
The 1-1 (0-0) was enough because Watford lost 2-3 (1-3) at Arsenal.
The club, which had three coaches in the season, is relegated after five years in the first league.
Just like Bournemouth, which could not save itself by a 3: 1 (2: 1) at Everton FC.
In the end, one point was missing.
Liverpool FC, which has been the English champion since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3-1 (1-1) victory at Newcastle United.
99 points is the highest score the Reds have ever scored in a football season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp and his team narrowly missed the points record in English football.
Manchester City holds the record with 100 points in the 2017 / 18 season.
After the Newcastle lead in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38th), Divock Origi (59th) and Sadio Mané (89th) shot the game for Liverpool on Sunday.
It was an extraordinary season for this wonderful club, said goalscorer van Dijk after the match, "which should encourage us to defend the title.
It will be difficult. "
The Premier League bosses should also be satisfied in the end.
Due to the coronavirus crisis, football operations in England were suspended from 13 March to 17 June.
In the meantime, there were even discussions about a premature abandonment or a staging of the remaining games on neutral ground.
After all, the season ended without any special occurrences - but as in Germany without spectators in the stadiums.
Arrests and violence during demonstrations against Netanyahu
The protests in Israel against Netanyahu's head of government are becoming increasingly intense.
During the night there were violent clashes.
On Sunday night in Jerusalem, the Israeli police violently cracked down on participants in a demonstration against the right-wing conservative Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Twelve people have been arrested for participating in riots, said police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld.
Among other things, the police used water cannon to break up the rally.
According to media reports, about 6,000 people gathered near Netanyahu's official residence on Saturday evening.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu's handling of the Corona crisis.
The protesters beat drums, blew horns and called on Netanyahu to resign.
Participants in a counter-demonstration supported by Netanyahu were also arrested, reported the news site "Ynet."
People also demonstrated in many other places in Israel, including in front of the head of government's private villa in the coastal town of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
According to police reports, a man was arrested near Tel Aviv because he was suspected of spraying pepper spray from a moving car on demonstrators on the side of the road.
Another man was arrested after a stabbing attack on a demonstrator in the south of the country.
The demonstrator was slightly injured in the neck.
There have recently been several demonstrations against Netanyahu in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.
The rallies accompany the corruption trial against the head of government.
Most recently, Netanyahu has also been criticized for his handling of the Corona crisis.
Among other things, he is accused of hasty relaxation and a lack of preparation for a second Corona wave.
The Corona crisis has badly affected the country's economy.
The unemployment rate recently stood at more than 20 percent.
The number of new infections with the coronavirus in Israel has recently risen to new record levels.
Accident near Ahlen (NRW) - Transporter crashes into a car - nine injured - Ruhr area - Bild.de
Ahlen - A rear-end collision on Saturday afternoon on the B58 near Ahlen caused nine minor injuries.
A car driver was driving with her two children (3, 5) in the direction of Beckum.
The police said: "Presumably she had braked suddenly because she wanted to turn."
The driver of a Mercedes van driving behind her must have seen this too late.
He crashed into the back of the car.
Three passengers in the car and six in the van were slightly injured in the accident.
Several ambulances took her to a nearby hospital.
North Korea seals off border town after Corona suspected case
North Korea has so far seen its own measures to ward off the coronavirus as a "shining success."
Now the country is reporting a case of suspicion for the first time.
Because of a first official Corona suspected case in the country, North Korea has completely sealed off a big city for fear of a catastrophe.
Despite the strictest epidemiological defense measures in the past six months, "the malignant virus may have been introduced into the country," state media reported.
A state of emergency has been declared for the region around the border town of Kaesong.
The communist leadership declared the highest level of alert.
If the suspected case is confirmed, it would be the first official case of infection with Sars-CoV-2 in the isolated country.
North Korea has not yet registered a single infection and described its defensive measures as a "shining success."
The information was doubted abroad.
The symptoms of the disease were reportedly detected in an "outlier" who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on July 19.
The person had fled to South Korea three years ago and has now returned across the border.
There was initially no confirmation from South Korea of the border crossing within the four kilometres wide and largely mined military buffer zone.
However, according to reports from the national news agency Yonhap, South Korea's military acknowledged the possibility of crossing the border illegally into North Korea as high.
Investigations were conducted on a number of people.
On Saturday, North Korea called an emergency meeting of the Politburo of the Workers' Party, chaired by ruler Kim Jong Un, because of the suspected case.
The "dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive disaster."
Kim had already ordered on Friday as a preventive measure to "completely block Kaesong and isolate each district and region from others," it continued.
The person concerned, as well as all the people in Kaesong who had been in contact with her, were quarantined.
Accordingly, the party's central military commission is to investigate the "outlier" and the behaviour of the responsible military unit and, if necessary, impose severe penalties.
It is estimated that about 300,000 people live in Kaesong.
Tension ahead of Council meeting: City East and noise protection are still up for discussion before the big summer break
In addition to environmental issues, the committee members will also vote on the development plan for the large-scale project Innenstadtentwicklung-Ost, "it says casually in the middle section of the municipal press release for the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, July 28, at 4.30 p.m. in the Great Hall of the Congress Center Pforzheim.
Above all, the upgrading of the eastern city is controversial until the end.
The majorities for this are scarce, most recently even negative in individual committees, depending on their presence.
Project opponent Reinhard Klein criticized an appeal from the economy (construction, real estate, trade and IT) not to let the project developed out of the citizenry and then by the administration and the municipal council fail after almost ten years of preparation as an "extra-parliamentary opposition," "clueless," "speculation," "vilification" and "deliberate false statements."
Everyone thinks they know better, says Klein, who has been a member of the municipal council for a year as the only representative of the citizens' list of Pforzheim.
In fact, after reading the contracts, he is in this position: "I know what I'm talking about."
The exit is cheaper for the city and, contrary to statements by the city administration, the Technical Town Hall is to be renovated for 8.5 million euros after grants, of which Klein is convinced.
The city will develop very differently from what is predicted in the town hall and by business advocates.
Shaping the city through its own efforts and not an investor: This is his plan B. One day after Klein, the FDP / FW / UB / LED faction, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
It also essentially envisages the renovation of the Technical Town Hall, the keeping of the Schloßberg open, the rental of the ex-Thale for administrative space and a smaller downtown transformation ideally with local agencies.
Environmental issues play a central role
In addition, environmental issues will play a central role.
Among other things, the municipal council will vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the population of Pforzheim from health noise pollution caused by road traffic, many of which include speed reductions.
In a press release, the local transport club Germany welcomes the widespread introduction of speed 30. However, the political leaders in the city are not innocent of the fact that this has to happen, because they have only contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus noise due to the neglect of regular bus traffic with thinned cycles and little commitment to bicycle traffic, according to the VCD.
The municipal council also votes on the city's participation in the energy and climate protection agency Pforzheim / Enzkreis.
Also on the agenda are the accession to the climate protection pact of the state of Baden-Württemberg, the reassessment of parental contributions in the municipal daycare centres and the application for inclusion in the federal government's smart city funding.
Citizens are welcome, but must bear in mind Corona protection measures.
Tim Zimmermann starts the new season with a lot of delay
With a delay of almost half a year, Tim Zimmermann will start his premiere season in the ADAC GT Masters on July 31.
Before the league of super sports cars can commence regular operation, the first test drives were scheduled.
For Zimmermann, it was all about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3 better.
The Corona crisis has long prevented Tim Zimmermann from embarking on his first business trip in Grasser Racing's new Lamborghini Huracan.
This was now possible under special hygiene conditions.
The 23-year-old from Langenargen made his first laps at the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his premiere in the GT3 car.
There are already a few things that are different from the pre-season Porsche, says Zimmermann.
With the ABS, for example, you have to go into the corners in a different way.
But it was a lot of fun. "
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite his only 25 years, the Dutchman is already experienced in GT sports and was able to help his new team-mate in many things.
I'm not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series also brings new challenges, says Zimmermann.
Steijn and I get along brilliantly and we have made enormous progress from session to session at the Lausitzring. "
This is exactly where - at the Lausitzring - the GT Masters will host its first race.
From July 31, the 33 super sports cars will race through Lusatia.
Zimmermann, who is one of 15 newcomers to the series, knows the track.
In 2015 he was the last guest at the Motodrom.
It worked quickly and I didn't have to get used to the track, says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafen racing community Graf Zeppelin.
The Lausitzring has many fast passages that you have to hit optimally in order to be fast. "
How fast Zimmermann really is then, it turns out in two weeks.
Of course, the teams play a bit of poker during the tests, he says.
In the end, we are very satisfied and are looking forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring. "
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a densely packed calendar.
Seven races are scheduled until the beginning of November.
The current situation is that no spectators will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
Ex-Formula 1 driver Niko Hülkenberg will grab the GT steering wheel at the Nürburgring in mid-August.
British Transport Secretary caught cold by quarantine decision
The British government's decision to quarantine holidaymakers to Spain for two weeks after their return has caught the country's transport minister cold, according to press reports.
Accordingly, Grant Shapps is currently on vacation in Spain, of all places, while his colleagues at home decided on the measure on Saturday.
Because of the rising Corona numbers in Spain, the cabinet in London removed the country from the list of countries from which entry without quarantine conditions is possible.
The new regulation will apply from today, Sunday, so Shapps will also have to be quarantined after his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returnees.
But the rule applies to those who are only on vacation on the deadline, only from Saturday, August 1, and has not been introduced overnight.
By the way, Spain is still regarded as one of the "safe countries" in Austria for which no quarantine is required in Austria.
Many ministers may have known in advance that there is a possibility of a quarantine being imposed on holidaymakers in Spain, commented Labour MP Diane Abbot.
But apparently nobody bothered to tell Grant Shapps. "
Less than a month after the end of the Corona emergency in Spain and the expiry of the strict curfew, the number of infections in the country is rising again.
Virologists mainly blame the nightlife for the new spread.
Spain is one of Britain's favourite holiday destinations.
The British government is currently advising against unnecessary travel to mainland Spain, with the exception of the Canary Islands and Balearic Islands, which are particularly popular with British holidaymakers.
So far, more than 272,000 infections with the novel coronavirus and more than 28,000 deaths have been recorded in Spain.
Russia: Naval Day: Putin announces hypersonic weapons for warships
On the occasion of Naval Day in his country, Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced that warships will be equipped with state-of-the-art hypersonic weapons.
These weapons, which are unique in the world, would extend the fighting capabilities of the Russian naval forces, Putin said on Sunday in St. Petersburg during the central naval parade.
According to the Interfax agency, the Ministry of Defense also informed about successful tests of the zircon hypersonic missile built for the navy.
The hypersonic weapons have many times the speed of sound of around 343 meters per second.
They are seen as weapons of the future.
Underwater tropedeo will continue to be built
It was reported that construction will continue on the nuclear-capable underwater torpedo Poseidon.
The planned sea drone is planned for the destruction of coastal targets.
The president, who himself also sailed on a military boat, said that this year alone 40 new vessels would be commissioned by the individual naval units of the largest country in the world.
Russia has such a large coastal area as no other country in the world.
The navy has been reliably protecting Russia for 300 years, said Putin at the day celebrated by sailors nationwide.
Also in many other Russian coastal towns the naval forces celebrated the day of the navy with parades.
In Syria, where Russia is fighting alongside ruler Bashar al-Assad, the military demonstrated strength at an arms show in the Mediterranean port of Tartus.
Ammunition was also fired there.
A video published by the Ministry of Defense showed not only warships, including a submarine, but also combat helicopters and jets.
Hurricane "Hanna" reaches Texas: Help made more difficult because of Corona
Washington - This year's first hurricane over the Atlantic has made landfall in Texas.
Life-threatening floods, strong winds and heavy rainfall are now threatening parts of the US state, the National Hurricane Center of the US climate agency NOAA reported in the night to Sunday (local time).
Governor Greg Abbott declared a state of emergency for many districts.
The Corona pandemic, which is rampant in Texas, is complicating the work of the aid workers, said Abbott according to the US media.
Evacuees called for caution
Every hurricane is an enormous challenge, said Abbott, according to the Houston Chronicle newspaper.
Referring to the cyclone in Texas, he added: "This challenge is complicated and exacerbated considering that it is sweeping through an area that is the state's most affected area by Covid-19."
According to Johns Hopkins University, around 5,000 people have died in Texas alone as a result of the Corona pandemic.
Abbott called on people who had to leave their homes to exercise caution.
They should not disregard practices "that we have become accustomed to," such as wearing masks, the governor said, according to CBS.
It was important that everyone kept their distance.
Therefore, hotel rooms have been made available in some places.
In addition, it should be tested in emergency shelters on Corona.
Damage was initially reported only from the coastal town of Port Mansfield.
Storm warning withdrawn again
With wind speeds of up to 150 kilometres per hour, according to authorities, "Hanna" made landfall on the island of Padre Island just off the Texas coast.
The tropical storm had previously been upgraded to the lowest level one hurricane.
For the coastal stretch from Port Mansfield to Sargent, a storm surge warning was issued and later withdrawn.
Authorities expected a slowdown, while "Hanna" moved further inland and headed for northeastern Mexico.
"Douglas" moves towards Hawaii
In the Pacific, hurricane "Douglas" was heading for Hawaii during the night to Sunday with winds of around 150 kilometres per hour.
However, the hurricane center expected it to weaken further.
It is predicted to be near Hawaii's largest islands on Sunday (local time) - then as a storm just below the hurricane threshold.
According to a forecast in May, NOAA expected an above-average hurricane season over the Atlantic this year.
Up to ten hurricanes are expected from June to the end of November, of which up to six could be very strong hurricanes, the agency said.
On average, there are six hurricanes per year over the Atlantic, three of which develop into storms of great magnitude.
Given the available climate data and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and Caribbean, the probability of a normal season is only 30 percent, the probability of a below-average season is only ten percent, it was said at the time.
US President Donald Trump wrote via Twitter that his government was closely monitoring the storms and was in contact with the affected states.
Four goals stripped: Video assistant "punishes" Sassuolo
Sassuolo's Filip Djuricic was stripped of two goals
Napoli - Four goals scored, four goals scored: Sassuolo Calcio experienced a raven-black evening at the 0-2 (0-1) at SSC Napoli in the Italian football league Serie A - and was really angry with the referee's video assistant.
A festival of ungiven goals for Sassuolo.
The VAR has never been so tough on a team, commented the "Corriere dello Sport."
Host Napoli had taken the lead by a goal from outside defender Elseid Hisaj in the 8th minute, in the 32nd minute Filip Djuricic initially cheered the equaliser.
The Video Assistant Referee (VAR) withdrew the hit due to an offside position.
Five minutes later Djuricic shot the ball into the net again - the VAR intervened again.
The team of referees also took back the goals from attackers Francesco Caputo (50th) and Domenico Berardi (61st), according to the VAR.
In injury time, Allan made perfect the 2-0 score for Napoli and the bitter evening for Sassuolo.
The VAR is worse for Sassuolo than a radar trap on the road and punishes Sassuolo like no team before.
The new technology sets records, writes the "Gazzetta dello Sport."
FC Bayern Munich: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start of the hot preparation phase for the Champions League began for double winners FC Bayern with a setback.
Hansi Flick, who recovered "reasonably well" after a short vacation and a few days of training, has to think about how he can rebuild his successful defense after the injury of world champion Benjamin Pavard.
The Frenchman, who has the third most minutes of action behind captain Manuel Neuer and midfielder Joshua Kimmich, suffered a ligament injury to his left foot root and threatens to be missing in decisive premier-class duels.
In the Munich Schmuddelwetter the right defender stopped a training game and was driven off the court with a golf kart.
How long the unrestricted regular player has to take a break in the battle for the title is an open question.
It will be difficult to play in the round-of-16 second leg against Chelsea FC on August 8. The 24-year-old can hope for the final tournament starting on August 12 in Lisbon.
However, Bayern do not want to be stopped by the mishap from Sunday's training.
Flick mentioned in his personal triple formula the three attributes he wants to see from his stars on their way to Portugal's capital.
His victory-hungry title collectors will show quality, intensity and concentration in the 28 days that will ideally follow until the premier class final on August 23rd.
We have mastered the mandatory tasks with the championship and the cup simply very well.
Now it's time to do something special, said Flick.
Until the Munich team can concretely deal with the final tournament and previously a training camp in the Algarve, the round of 16 against FC Chelsea is scheduled for the first time.
After the 3: 0 in the first leg before the Corona break, the Londoners in the home arena should not become a Bayern nightmare again as in the lost "final at home" in 2012.
We have to go through the door first.
We want to win, create good conditions and recharge our batteries with a good game, demanded Flick.
A test to get in the mood is scheduled for Friday against Olympique Marseille.
With a long speech, Flick had sworn his stars, who had 13 days of vacation after the double, to a unique August.
He welcomed 31 players to Säbener Straße, including the new players around noble purchasing Leroy Sané, who met all his new colleagues on the pitch for the first time after his move from Manchester City.
Like all the newcomers, Leroy has fitted in well, reported Flick.
But instead of talking about the new season, when Sané & Co. Are no longer allowed to train, Flick preferred to talk about the current title project of the German series champion.
After days of individual and small group training, the team is now being trained for the Londoners, who, in contrast to the Flick ensemble, are in the rhythm of play.
After that the Munich team could face a quarter-final against FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, in the semi-finals Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin are possible opponents.
A way to the final in Lisbon "is not so easy," said the head coach, who can rely on the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training from Tuesday onwards.
The World Cup record goalscorer Klose and Flick know from many joint tournament preparations, what is particularly important in the 0-to-100 mood.
With his current team, working is "a pleasure," praised Flick.
The "focus on winning" is an impressive characteristic of his team.
The tournament with nine teams was also ambitious on Sunday.
Everyone of the top performers were there, including the reluctant Thiago and defender David Alaba, whose whereabouts are not assured beyond the premier league season.
Formula One needs a special rule to choose its world champion
Since it is not possible to race on the required number of continents, the FIA has to improvise to award the world championship titles.
All American races were cancelled.
The racing calendar is becoming more and more concrete
The racing calendar of the current Formula One season continues to take shape.
In addition to the ten Grand Prix confirmed so far, three more race tracks were added during the week.
In October the race will take place at the Nürburgring in Germany and in Portimão, Portugal.
On the first of November, Lewis Hamilton and Co. Will compete for world championship points on the traditional Italian race track in Imola.
As it stands, the 2020 racing calendar comprises 13 races.
We are delighted that we continue to make great progress in completing our plans for the 2020 season, said Formula One boss Chase Carey.
A total of 15 to 18 races in the premier class of motorsport are to be completed in this extraordinary season.
Formula One wants to conclude its season in Asia.
The final race calendar will be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
Before the officially scheduled races in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December, according to media reports, appearances in Vietnam and Malaysia could take place at the end of November.
Regulations require races on three continents
However, the regulations of Formula 1 require at least races on three continents for the awarding of the world championship.
Even if, as currently planned, only two continents will be raced, there will be a world champion.
With the help of a special rule, the FIA wants to award the titles, citing "exceptional circumstances" due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The traditional start of the season in Australia in March had to be cancelled at short notice due to the impending Corona crisis.
A return to the continent later this year is not an issue.
In addition, Formula One will not be a guest in America this year.
Cancellation is met with criticism in Brazil
Due to the tense Coronas situation, the races will not take place in Canada, the USA, Mexico and Brazil.
We're looking forward to joining them again next season, said Carey.
The cancellation of the American races was met with criticism, especially in Brazil: "The cancellation came as no surprise to us, but we cannot accept the reasons for this," said Tamas Rohonyi, promoter of the Grand Prix in São Paulo.
For example, the number of infections in the São Paulo area is significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
Moreover, the concerns of some teams about not wanting to drive in Brazil would not justify a rejection.
They are prepared for the required security measures.
Greta Thunberg: Evil eye against Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest on Stephen Colbert's well-known latenight show via video and revealed in an interview what she had in mind when she met Donald Trump.
Climate activist Greta Thunberg was a guest on a popular US latenight show via video switch.
Among other things, she talked about her struggle against the world's powerful.
The teenager also spoke about her famous "evil eye" during her encounter with Donald Trump.
New York City - Over the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has attracted attention with her tireless commitment to the "Fridays For Future" movement.
Now she spoke in a well-known latenight show about her plans for the future and her encounter with US President Donald Trump at the UN climate summit last year.
Latenight host Stephen Colbert welcomed 17-year-old Thunberg to your show on Tuesday and conducted a lengthy interview with the Swede.
She spoke not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the world's powerful.
There are some things that surprised me, she said.
She was shocked by how far people go to shift the focus away from the climate crisis.
She said she experienced everything from organized hate campaigns to threats just because a group of children are taking to the streets.
She finds heads of state and leading politicians who scoff at her on social media or even try to silence her "funny" because the reactions show her "because they have no other answer."
It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was approached about a well-known scene in which she cast a bitterly nasty glance after US President Trump.
At the 2019 UN Climate Summit in New York, for which the activist sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive gaze was captured by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
The short clip resulted in a GIF, an animated image that ultimately became one of the most frequently used images for Trump opponents.
But what was the 17-year-old thinking about the US president at that moment?
To Stephen Colbert's relatively open question, she answered only briefly and dryly: "To be honest, I don't think there is any need for further explanation."
The experienced satirist Colbert did not expect the quick-witted answer and briefly disappeared from the picture laughing.
With her "How dare you?" Speech on the principles of climate protection, she was remembered by many at the climate conference.
Ex-Dortmund real estate with a three-pack for Lazio Rome
In the race for Europe's Golden Boot, Ciro Immobile is now on par with Bavaria's Robert Lewandowski.
The former Dortmund Ciro Immobile still has the best chance of becoming the top scorer in the Italian football championship.
The former BVB professional scored three goals in Lazio's 5-1 (1-1) win over Hellas Verona, including two converted penalties in the injury times of both halves.
This means that the 30-year-old from fourth in the standings now has 34 goals for the season on his account - just as many were scored by Robert Lewandowski of FC Bayern Munich in the past Bundesliga season.
In Italy, Cristiano Ronaldo follows with 30 goals so far, the Portuguese superstar faced Sampdoria Genoa with the leader in the evening.
Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green died
His life was like a rollercoaster ride: After a rapid climb with Fleetwood Mac it went steeply downhill and then slowly uphill again.
Now the blues rock guitarist Peter Green has died at the age of 73.
Brilliant guitarist, drug junkie, cult fan: The co-founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He had died peacefully in his sleep at the age of 73, family members said in an official statement on Saturday that a further statement would be announced for the next few days.
Top musicians like Peter Frampton praised Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional reaction of a "monumental loss" for all former and current members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
The drummer Fleetwood and the guitarist Green formed the now legendary band in London in 1967, his dreamy instrumental hit "Albatross" is still unforgotten.
The musician's life ("The End Of The Game," "In The Skies") was like a rollercoaster ride.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a rapid rise - but the band celebrated their greatest successes without him.
Among other things, there was a dispute because Green wanted to donate all the group's profits to charity.
He began to perform in wide robes and with a big crucifix.
Psychological problems are also said to have played a role.
Three years after the band was formed, Green left the band in 1970.
This was followed by a social decline.
The blues rock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, biographers reported.
For a long time Green was treated in psychiatry.
During much of the 1970s, the musician disappeared from the scene.
He is said to have temporarily lived on the street, worked as a cemetery gardener and spent some time in an Israeli kibbutz.
Green was born in 1946 as the son of a Jewish working-class family in the London district of Bethnal Green.
From a young age he was enthusiastic about US blues musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At the age of eleven he learned the first guitar grips.
At the age of 15, the teenager started playing guitar professionally and five years later got the chance to play lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners.
Shortly afterwards he was hired as a replacement for his idol Eric Clapton with the Bluesbreakers.
In the middle of the blues boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967 together with his Bluesbreakers colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross," composed by Green, gave the group the first number 1 hit in the winter of 1968 / 69 and catapulted them to the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid rise soon showed its downsides: Green could not cope with the media hype, his experiments with the drug LSD became more and more extreme.
He later commented on the life between music and addiction in an interview: "The worst thing that happened to me in life is drugs - the best thing was to land a number one hit."
Towards the end of the decade, Green achieved a surprising success in 1979 with an album inspired by religious themes.
Meanwhile, Fleetwood Mac swam without him in a new formation on a wave of success.
Their 1977 album "Rumours" sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
