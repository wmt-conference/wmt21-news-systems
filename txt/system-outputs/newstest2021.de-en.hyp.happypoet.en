Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 harvests
After a mass corona infection on a large vegetable farm in Mamming, Lower Bavaria, almost 500 people are under quarantine and are no longer allowed to leave the farm.
A security service monitors the ban.
A total of 174 harvest workers were tested positive for the corona pathogen Sars-CoV-2 during the screening, as the district office of Dingolfing-Landau announced on Saturday evening.
"In order to avoid further spread, we have to go to the protection of the population this step," said Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Previously, seven employees had already been infected in the company - this was the reason for the row test.
The operation is a large vegetable farm, which builds strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and red beams - but the cucumbers only for single glasses.
Mamming is a rural community with about 3300 inhabitants not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW plant.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to keep calm: "According to our information it is a closed circle of persons."
On the farm, infected employees were separated from non-infected employees, the area is now surrounded by a barrier fence.
Green and SPD were responsible for the Government of State.
The two opposition factions accused Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet of neglecting control of the accommodation of seasonal workers.
"This can be traced in a bitter way when such local infection events have to intervene and have to be arranged regional lockdowns," said Jürgen Mistol, the Parliamentary Managing Director of the Greens.
The SPD takes a similar view: "Following the corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof slaughterhouse in mid-May, we have already called for a special control programme for farms with harvest helpers," said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
"The requirements of hygiene in the workplace and the living conditions must be sharply controlled from our point of view.
That obviously didn't happen. "
The outbreak had come "with saying."

"My client has been cooperative," lawyer Quentin Chabert told the newspaper.

Discuss the abolition of the 50 + 1 rule
The former DFB president Reinhard Grindel has recommended thinking about the abolition of the 50 + 1 rule.
"At least, German football should discuss terms and conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission has completed facts," said Grindel of the "picture on Sunday."
He stressed: "For the clubs that are most likely to be dangerous to Bayern and Dortmund, the 50 + 1 rules do not work anyway: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, the debate is not all about whether it is not commanded to facilitate clubs who want to break into this phalanx, to facilitate the inclusion of investors. "
However, he has doubts whether there is a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority shareholdings, which are prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50 + 1 rule.
"It remains a legal risk to attract investment fences in a European internal market to the Bundesliga's economic location," said Grindel.
The former DFB boss sees the danger that "the attempts to ensure a more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will ultimately only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but will not lead to more tension in the championship."
Even a balance of TV funds will not achieve a decisive effect.
"FC Bayern have a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million.
Thus, the differences are already immense among the first three clubs.
The other 15 clubs have an average budget of 130 million, "said the 58-year-old.
With a view of the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Unfortunately, there have been people who have noticed this mistake and pushed it through to the press instead of addressing me," said Grindel about the adoption of an expensive watch that led to his resignation in April 2019.
"This has been very busy for me."
He had received the gift worth around 11,000 euros from a Ukrainian official.
"I have committed a compliance violation, and it was right to draw the consequences from this," said Grindel.
"I handled the ominous watch gift completely transparently and innocently.
Many of them knew in the DFB. "
He never "made a secret of the gift," the 58-year-old assured.
"This may be called naively, at least this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption."

Argentina rejects creditors' counter-offer
The new demands could not be met, the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Buenos Aires announced on Saturday.
"That would be not only irresponsible, but also unfair," it said in a statement.
"While 50% of children live in poverty in Argentina, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors."
The debt of the second largest economy in South America is no longer sustainable under current conditions.
Therefore, Argentina requests from his private creditors to renounce a part of their claims of approximately $66 billion (approximately 59 billion euros).
If no agreement is reached, the country is once again threatened with bankruptcy.
It would be the ninth default in Argentina's history.
Most recently, lenders had demanded higher interest rates on government bonds and changes to some contractual clauses.
The Argentine government, however, adheres to its last offer and is not ready for further concessions.
Argentina is in a severe financial and economic crisis.
The inflation rate was more than 50 percent.
For the current year, experts expect economic power to decline by around ten percent.
At the end of May, Argentina had not paid interest receivables amounting to $503 million, and was thereby violated in a limited payment failure.
Arrived professionally - not yet privately
"It runs supergood" - this conclusion attracts Dr. Stefanie Kramer after their first days in the notariate in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything happened very quickly: In mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she would succeed Lutz Feller at the notary office in Eggenfelden.
Six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the PhD-fourth lawyer took the work, the normal day business runs long on full tours.
"Privately, however, I still have to arrive," she explains in an interview with the Rottaler Anzeiger and laughs.
The short period of course did not pass, of course, to store the food point from Regensburg completely to Eggenfelden, reports the door fingerprint.
She is currently looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city with her husband, who works as a judge at the regional court in Regensburg.
At least, in the short term, her husband could apply for parental leave in order to guarantee the care of the two daughters (3 ½ and 1 ½ years old).
In order not to have to commute every day from Regensburg, she also has an overnight stay with her parents in Dingolfing, explains the 39-year-old.
Growing up in the neighbouring district, the city of Eggenfelden is of course a long term.
During visits on site with her family in recent months, she found out again: "Eggenfelden is a really beautiful small town."
All the more, they rejoiced that they made the race in the selection process around the free place.
Her native Lower Bavaria also plays a central role in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's professional career: After studying law in Passau, she completed her legal clerkship and the 2nd state examination in Regensburg.
After several stations as an emergency professor, among others in Rehau and Hof in Oberfranken, Babenhausen in the Unterallgäu and Regensburg - in this time, she also shoulder the promotion in Labor Law - in 2012, she entered her first place as an emergency in Rotthalmünster in the county of Passaan.
In 2016, she took parental leave and moved to Regensburg.
Since then, she took over representative services in various emergencies.
When the position in Eggenfelden was advertised due to the approaching retirement of Lutz Feller, she saw the right time for a full return to work, explains the 39-year-old.
The team of their predecessor, who will take over the holiday representation in the emergency office in the future, took over Dr. Stefanie Kramer completely - and has equal a praise for the team of the firm: "It runs supergood!"
The fact that she can rely on well-established processes here makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming relocation of the private center of life.
In terms of child garden - respectful cribs, she has already taken contact with a local facility.
And if everything goes as desired, she hopes to be able to pursue her hobby here soon - and get to know the most beautiful jogging routes of the Rottal.
BVB plans to start with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be 20 percent full at the start of the season in the event of a fan return.
"Due to the abolition scheme which is imperative to comply, we plan to plan with 12,000 to 15,000 spectators," said Borussia Dortmunds Managing Director Carsten Cramer the "Day Mirror."
Normally, the arena in the district city holds a little more than 81,000 spectators at Bundesliga matches.
In the Corona pandemic, the BVB-Corona-Pandemic played last season, about four million euros were lost.
Cramer, who is responsible for marketing, digitisation and internationalisation at BVB, hopes that, in addition to the normal spectator seats, some of the approximately 4,000 seats in the hospitality sector can also be opened again: "It is of course a blow to the office if this income completely collapses."
In view of the ongoing Corona crisis, all "are well advised to take a stable side long."
"If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people in Germany alone are in short-time work, then the need for entertainment is limited," explained Cramer.
The Dortmunder Marketing Boss praised the BVB professionals for their salary sharing, which should contribute to overcoming the crisis: "Of course, the players know that their salary has a different effect than when we work 100 people working in the merchandising are working on short work."
Tiny miracle: Early start into life with a few hundred grams
Barely heavier than a pack of butter, just three tablespoons of blood in his entire body: that was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The bub is one of about 400 early days, which are converted annually at the Grazer Kinderclinic.
A quarter of them weigh less than 1,500 grams, a few - like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael - are extreme lightweights with a birth weight of less than one kilogram.
They are so small and so early, that neither lung, nor intestine, nor muscles are fully trained.
Their skin is sometimes so delicate that they could hurt the electrodes of an ECG.
And they are so tiny that they sometimes wear doll clothes and specially made for them mini-diaper.
But not so small that they wouldn't be in the voice - "and how," smiles Berndt Urlesberger.
"Even if they do not write as loud as big babies."
If the whiteboard becomes a stage
Despite Corona theatre in the classroom: the whiteboard as a stage was experienced by the 9th grade of the Sankt-Jakobus-Gymnasium in Abtsgmünd shortly before the start of the holiday.

Afterwards, the students were able to exchange information about the play and the performance via Skype with the actress and the director Winfried Tobias.
The idea for the performance format was born from the current Corona situation.
Teacher Teresa Nar was happy about the enrichment of the lessons.
Even if all participating parties agreed that the direct encounter in the theater and stage would still offer additional stimuli, in the theater, one sees the potential for contact in schools.
"If we further improve the technical framework, it could be an interesting addition to the game operation," emphasized director Winfried Tobias.

Kalbitz expulsion from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "fig leaf"
From the point of view of the FDP, the exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is only a "fig leaf" and does not change in the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the far right in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the tip of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD, "said the FDP Interior politician Benjamin Strasser of the news agency dpa in Berlin.
After several hours of negotiations, the AfD's Federal Arbitration Court in Stuttgart on Saturday confirmed the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Executive Board had decided by a majority in May.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD Group in the Brandenburg Land Day.
"If the AfD really wanted to consistently remove right-wing extremists from its party, functionaries like Björn Höcke and his supporters would have been excluded long ago," said Strasser.
"However, there is no political will in the AfD, because the right-wing extremism now belongs to the party."
CSU General Secretary Markus Blume expressed a similar view: "The fact that Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded says nothing and changes nothing," he told "Welt am Sonntag."
"Instead, it speaks volumes, as many frenetic supporters have a right-wing right wing in the middle of AfD."
Blume assumes that the AfD will again end up below five percent in elections in the future.
"The days of the AfD in the parliaments are counted."
Kalbitz was one of the spokesmen of the officially now dissolved "wing" around the Thuringian AfD state and parliamentary group chairman Björn Höcke; the Verfassungsschutz classifies the current as a "secured right-wing extremist aspiration."
In May, the AfD Federal Executive Board Kalbitz had thrown out of the party.
As a reason, he stated that Kalbitz had not indicated a previous membership in the now banned right-wing extremist "Heimattreuen Deutschen Jugend" (HDJ) and the Republicans when he joined the party.
Kalbitz denies membership in HDJ.
The chairman of the Left Party in the Brandenburg Landtag, Sebastian Walter, also stressed that the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court did not change the character of the AfD: "The wolf only ate chalk.
The AfD remains a right-wing party, whether with or without Kalbitz. "
Neither the federal party nor the right wing would be weakened by this decision.
"The maneuver of the Meuthen truppe is manageable.
They want to avoid further observation by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution and try to get through under the radar, "said Walter.
"The AfD will not get rid of the spirits they called.
An expulsion does not change anything, "commented the Brandenburg SPD general secretary Erik Stohn on the decision in the Kalbitz case.
"The AfD State Association and the Group still held its right leader."
The legal dispute over Kalbitz's membership in the AfD will continue.
This announced on Saturday, he will act against the decision of the Federal Tribunal in civil law.
North Sea wind farms supply a good 21 percent more electricity
In the first six months of the year, the wind power stations on the German North Sea have fed electricity into the network 11,51 hours.
This is a good 21 percent more than in the same period of the previous year, announced the network operator Tennet in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transfer of the North Sea electricity to the mainland and the line through the German electricity grid.
The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of Tennet's grid area, have fed in a further 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
Overall, the wind electricity from North and Baltic Sea comes to 13.73 TWh, compared to good 11,64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind harvest at sea thus accounts for almost 19 percent of the total wind power in Germany; this is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms provide higher production capacities
In addition to wind conditions, the increased contribution of offshore wind energy results from higher generation capacities, as new wind farms have been connected to the grid in the past twelve months.
If the 1270 wind power stations in the North Sea all run at the same time with full power, they could generate electricity 6,7 gigawatt.
The transmission capacity is sufficient for this; according to Tennet, it is 7.1 gigawatts.
By 2030, it should rise at 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea.
"In Germany and the Netherlands, we are investing 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore grid connections," said Tim Meyerjürgens, Managing Director of Tennet.
In reality, wind farms can not exploit their capacity at sea, but reach about 40%.
The record day so far this year is 2 January, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind turbines produce about 2.5 to 3.0 Gigawatt electricity, which corresponds to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could supply almost seven million households with electricity.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the Gmünder Kunstverein.
This was almost a small anniversary celebration for the 130.
Birthday of the Gmünder Kunstverein: The exhibition opening "Skirmish" with works by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold broke the usual framework after the Corona break.
Much more art friends than usual pursued the dialogue between the artist and the chairman of the Kunstverein, Professor Dr. Klaus Ripper.
The musical equivalent was provided by the band "Defenders of the Universe" on the southern Kornhausplatz.
North of the gallery, the club "Sandtogether."
Freital: Windbergfest cancelled due to Corona
The wind farm does not take place this year.
The city of Freital has cancelled the three-day festival planned for September.
Over 30,000 people had visited this city festival in other years.
"We really did not make this decision easy and - aware of how difficult it is economically for those involved - hoped until the last minute," explained Lord Mayor Uwe Rumberg (independent).
"But ultimately, we are responsible for the health of many thousand people here."
If tens of thousands had flocked to the festival grounds and marquee, minimum distances, hygiene regulations and contact tracking in accordance with the current corona protection regulation could not have been complied with.
Or the limitations would have been so strong that there would not have been much left by a folk festival.
In addition, the organisational and monitoring effort would increase disproportionately many times over.
Rumberg comforted next year.
The city of Freital will then celebrate its 100th anniversary with the Winter Mountain Festival from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the Day of the Saxons from 10 to 12 September 2021.

Rescue helicopter lands on the A 45
About 30 minutes the A 45 motorway was fully closed on Saturday at Aschaffenburg, as after a traffic accident the rescue driver was in use.

Heil wants to examine other industries after meat industry
The Corona crisis once again brought the conditions into light in parts of the meat industry.
Law tightening is imminent.
But are they right - and will it stay?
Federal Minister of Labour Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to review other sectors after the now planned strict regulations against grievances in the meat industry.
"We will look at industry for industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective industry if necessary," said Salvation of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany's employers are already warning against restricting work contracts in general.
After the mass outbreak of Corona in the flesh shouted Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Bundeskabinett wants to decide on this Wednesday a law of salvation.
Large-scale slaughterhouses should no longer be allowed to use external personnel in slaughter, dismantling and meat processing.
To do this, the use of contract contract and temporary workers shall be banned there.
Employer President Ingo Kramer told dpa: "Hands off a general restriction of work contracts and temporary employment if you do not want to completely choke off the economy."
For example, working contracts are essential for wide areas of the craft, construction industry and plant construction, for example, the basis for their value added to the customer.
"The transgressions of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument."
Salvation assured: "My goal is not to prohibit work contracts anywhere in the German economy."
Work contracts make sense.
"If an industrial operation instructs a craftsman to build a security system, this is a very normal work contract."
The German meat industry considers a ban on work contracts and temporary work in its sector alone to be unconstitutional.
It is not explicable why in future other labour law should apply to portioning and packaging of cheese than in Wurst, it is said in an opinion on the legislative project, as the "New Osnabrücker Newspaper" reports.
In the event of a ban, the consumer price would increase by 10 to 20 percent per kilo and product.
In many cases, Eastern European employees from working contract companies worked in the industry according to the results of an audit of the NRW Labour Protection Administration (NRW), some 16 hours a day.
Often they didn't have a break.
Wage has been retained for protective equipment or rental.
It was also noted that the situation in the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Salvation said that a relatively sharp law had already entered into force in 2017.
However, these were circumvented by "tricky constructions."
"Now it has to be cleared up."
The politician announced: "In the Occupational Safety and Health Act, which we want to adopt in the cabinet at the end of July, there are also measures that do not only affect the meat industry - for example, higher inspection quotas for occupational safety and health or clear criteria for communal accommodation."
The draft of the dpa includes amendments to the Law on Protection of Labour Rights in the Meat Economy and the Labour Protection Act.
Brandenburg's consumer protection minister Ursula Nonnemacher (Greens) considers more intensive controls necessary.
"I would like to be able to make more controls in many supervisory areas: food controls, animal welfare, everything possible, for example animal transport," said Nonnemacher on Sunday in the RBB broadcast "Brandenburg currently."
However, more staff positions are also needed for more controls.

Car crosses: Young woman in accident on Bundesstraße 83 seriously injured at Hofgeismar
A 21-year-old suffered serious injuries in an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme at around 1: 25 p.m. on Sunday.
She was taken to the Kassel Hospital.
With thermal imaging cameras, the fire brigade searched for possible passengers.
According to police, the woman was on the Bundesstraße 83 in the direction of her place of residence Hümme, when her car came from the train and beat several times.
In order to save the victims, the fire department had to cut the roof of the car.
Since it was unclear if someone was still in the vehicle, the adjacent maize field was searched from the ladder with a thermal image camera.
The drone squadron from Warburg, which also works with thermal imaging cameras, had also been ordered for the search for persons.
However, the forces did not find anyone between the high maize plants.

Juventus Turin Champion in Italy
Turin - After a redeeming goal by Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin has secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in a row.
The team around the fifth world footballers made the overall 36. scudetto of the club's story with a 2: 0 (1: 0) on the Sunday night in the home match against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo scored 1-0 before half-time.
With 83 points, Turin, which took place without the last long-last ex-national player Sami Khedira, is no longer pushing for two seasons before the season end of the series A.
Inter Milan, second in the table, is seven points behind.
Juventus was harmless despite optically superiority in the first half, then Ronaldo met after a release version with the last action.
The 35-year-old exploited a pass from Miralem Pjanic directly from the penalty area with a flat shot (45. + 7).
Ronaldo was also involved in the 2: 0, following his shot, Federico Bernardeschi (67.).
This ensured the lackluster but decisive success.
The foulelfmeter disappeared at the 89th-minute, only Ronaldo himself should have correctly refused with a view to the Torjäger rating.
"It's complicated to stay on the ball mentally and physically for 90 minutes.
The games are strange, and the momentum changes very easily, "said trainer Maurizio Sarri still after 1: 2 at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Above all, the mental exhaustion of his players is great, said the Juve coach.
Because of the defeat, the Turiner had not been able to make the championship perfect yet.
In the end, Juve's reassuring lead at the top of the standings was mainly due to the weakness of its competitors.
Because in the eleven games before the game on Sunday, the Sarri team had only achieved five victories.
Whether Ronaldo will also be the top scorer is questionable.
For while the Portuguese superstar previously achieved 31 goals, the former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile after his three-pack of the 5: 1 (1: 1) of the tabernacle Lazio Rome at the Hellas Verona already has 34 hits on his account - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the title win of FC Bavaria.
The record in Italy is held by the current Juve professional Gonzalo Higuaín.
In the 2015-2016 season, the Argentine scored 36 goals for the SSC Naples.
In August, the next title chance awaits the "Old Lady" of Italian football.
Juventus stands in the eight-finals of the Champions League, but has to compete against Olympique Lyon against Olympique Lyon on 7 August.
In the next knockout round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would be waiting as opponents.
Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal car races recorded
Stuttgart - Despite all threatened punishments and court sentences, car drivers continue to give gas at numerous illegal races on the Baden-Württemberg roads: Last year and the first four months of this year, the police in the southwest already registered more than 250 illegal car racing.
Although there are no comparative figures for the years before, the speeders are increasingly doing work for the judicial authorities: In 2018, a total of 155 investigations were conducted at the public prosecutors between Konstanz and Mannheim for illegal races, a year later there were already 252 and in the current year by the beginning of June already 151.
The race was less organised events, as from the response of the Interior Ministry, on a request of the Landtag-SPD.
In most cases, the drivers spontaneously competed against each other or they fled from the police - this is also reported as an illegal race.
On the tax, German men were sitting between 18 and 60 years ago.
113 fines - 15 times imprisonment
Only in comparatively few cases, the Raser is caught and also asked to pay: According to the Ministry of Interior, 113 fines have been imposed since 2018, and 15 penalties were pronounced.
However, there is no evidence that the number of illegal car races is actually increasing.
Rather, other drivers responded more sensitive than earlier than before because of the budget tragic accidents and processes of recent years and showed more frequently, a ministries spokesperson said.
The Autobahn 8 is particularly popular with speeders. Again and again, motorists slow down the traffic there in order to get space and use the free track for a race.
Last August, a dozen riders were caught near Kirchheim under Teck, and three months previously there were even 18 drivers on the A8 at Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular "race track"
On the A81, the police even records more races than on any other federal highway.
A speed limit is used to try to slow down the speeders on the particularly affected section between Engen and Geisingen.
The mostly high-priced and painted sports and luxury carts often have Swiss characters, because the drivers differ from the high punishments for fast driving and car racing in the neighbouring country to the lawn.
For the SPD, the speed limit must not be reduced to a few routes: "With a general speed limit of 130 kilometers per hour, we would solve this problem on motorways," says Martin Rivoir, the traffic expert of the SPD parliamentary group.
"The threshold for Raser would be much higher if you are not here and there are still legal with 200 km and more on the road."
Rivoir thinks less of education or image campaigns: "Anyone who flouts all rules in such a way and puts not only their own lives, but also the lives of other road users at risk, is hardly achievable with reason."
ADAC calls for stronger assault by police
For the ADAC, however, this is not enough: "We assume that speeders will not be deterred by the speed limits," says Holger Bach, Head of the Transport and Environment Department at ADAC Württemberg.
It demands additional and harder controls on the affected routes.
Not infrequently, the high-speed trial of strength becomes more painful and momentous seriousness: Since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people across the country died in the races, two of them bystanders in a night crash in Stuttgart city center and one in Gerlingen.
In November, two young men should have delivered a car race.
One of the vehicles came off the road, crashed into a garden wall and remained on its side, the 18-year-old passenger died.
21 other people were injured in the race of the past two years.
However, according to Interior Minister Thomas Strobl, tougher penalties are not necessary: "There is no need for legislative action to sanction illegal motor vehicle races more severely," says the Interior Ministry paper.

"After all, the young people should get their cars back undamaged."
Employment Agency figures: 900 suspected cases of abuse in short-time work
Berlin - The Federal Employment Agency (BA) (BA), according to its own statement, is about 900 cases of abuse of short-workers money.
"With more than 880,000 companies that have reported short-time work, this is extremely little," said Daniel Terzenbach, the CEO responsible for operational business, to the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung."
When, at the beginning of the Corona crisis, many companies had suddenly applied short work, the BA had to react quickly.
Normally, the exam takes up to three weeks.
"So much time was not available in this hot phase.
All the more we will take a closer look at the final accounts.
There will be a lot to offend.
We are not naive and have staying power. "
Evidence of abuse often comes from the affected employees or trade unions.
In addition, the BA uses analysis software to detect patterns of abuse.
According to Terzenbach, BA is preparing for a possible insolvency wave in autumn.
"Will there be significantly more insolvencies than in the previous year?
The assessments are dealt with, but we are looking for the case and already schools our employees in the employment agencies for insolvency money. "
The figures are still inconspicuous, said Terzenbach.

North Korea charges the border city to Corona-Verda case
North Korea has so far seen its own measures to defend against the coronavirus as a "shining success."
Now the country reports for the first time about a disaster.
Due to a first official suspected Corona case in the country, North Korea has completely sealed off a major city for fear of a catastrophe.
Despite the strictest epidemiological defence measures in the past six months, "the malicious virus could have been introduced into the country," the state media reported.
A state of emergency has been declared for the region around the border town of Kaesong.
The communist leadership summoned the highest level of alarm.
If the suspected case is confirmed, it would be the first official case of infection with Sars-CoV-2 in the isolated country.
North Korea had previously not registered a single infection and described its defensive measures as "luminous success."
The information was doubted abroad.
The symptoms of illness were identified in a "outsider" which illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on 19 July.
The person fled to South Korea three years ago and has now returned across the border.
For cross-border crossing within the four kilometre, and largely reduced military buffer zone was initially not confirmed in South Korea.
However, according to reports by the national news agency Yonhap, South Korea's military acknowledged the possibility of an illegal border crossing into North Korea as high.
These studies have been conducted on some people.
North Korea, according to its own information, called an emergency meeting of the Politburo of the Workers' Party chaired by ruler Kim Jong Un on Saturday because of the suspected case.
The "dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive disaster."
Kim had already ordered on Friday, as a preventive measure, "to completely block Kaesong and to isolate each district and the region from others," it added.
The data subject as well as all people in Kaesong, who had contact with her, had been put under quarantine.
The central military commission of the party is to investigate the "runaway case" as well as the behavior of the responsible military unit and, if necessary, impose harsh punishment.
According to estimates, about 300,000 people live in Kaesong.
Voltage before Council meeting: City-East and Noise Protection are still available for discussion before a large summer break
"In addition to environmental issues, the committee members will also vote on the development plan for the large-scale project Inner City Development East," it says rather casually in the middle section of the city press release for the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, July 28, at 4.30 pm in the Great Hall of the CongressCentrum Pforzheim.
Above all, the appreciation of the eastern city is discussed controversial until the end.
The majorities for this are narrow, most recently in individual committees even negative depending on the presence.
A call from the economy (construction, real estate, trade and IT), which is out of citizenship and then not to fail after almost ten years of preparation, the project opponents Reinhard Klein criticized as "non-parliamentary opposition," "" speculation, "" "" Disability "and" conscious false statements. "
"Everyone thinks they know better," says Klein, who has been a member of the municipal council for a year as the only representative of the Pforzheim citizens' list.
In fact, after reading the contracts, he was in this position: "I know what I am talking about."
The exit is cheaper for the city, the technical town hall is, contrary to statements of the city administration, according to subsidies, of whose existence Klein is convinced, to be renovated for 8.5 million euros.
The city will develop differently than forecast in the city hall and on the part of the supporters of the economy.
To shape the city by its own strength and not an investor: that is his plan B. One day after Klein, the FDP / FW / UB / LED faction, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
It is also essential for the renovation of the Technical Hall, the open position of the Schloßberg, the fortification of the Ex-Thales for administrative areas and a smaller city center redesign in the ideal case with local bearings.
Environmental issues play a central role
In addition, environmental issues will play a central role.
Among other things, the local council will vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the Pforzheim population from health noise pollution, caused by road transport, including speed reductions.
In a press release, the local traffic club Germany welcomes the widespread introduction of speed 30. However, the political leaders in the city are not innocent that this must come about, because they have only contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus noise by neglecting the regular bus traffic with thinned-out intervals and by little commitment to cycling, according to the VCD.
The community also agrees on the involvement of the city of the energy and climate protection agency Pforzheim / Enzkreis.
In addition, the agenda includes accession to the Climate Protection Pact of the State of Baden-Württemberg, the redefinition of parental contributions in the municipal day care facilities and the application for inclusion in the Federal Smart City funding.
Citizens are welcome, but they need to take care of Corona protection measures.
Tim Zimmermann starts the new season with a lot of delay
With almost half a year delay, Tim Zimmermann starts in his premium season at the ADAC GT Masters on 31 July.

For zimmermann, it was above all about to get to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3 closer.

Under special hygiene conditions, this was now possible.

"There are already a few things that are different than the Porsche from the pre-season," says Zimmermann.
"With the ABS, for example, you have to go into the curves differently.
But it really has made a lot of fun. "
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite his only 25 years, the Dutch countries have already experienced in GT-Sport and could help his new team colleagues in many things.
"I'm not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series also brings new challenges," says Zimmermann.
"Steijn and I understand blending and we made enormous progress on the Lausitzring from session to session."
Exactly there - at the Lausitzring - the GT Masters will also hold its first race.
From 31 July, the 33 supercars will be lawn through the Lausitz.
Zimmermann, who is one of 15 newcomers to the series, knows the track.
In 2015, he was a guest in the Motodrom.
"It worked quickly and I didn't have to get used to the track much," says Zimmermann, who is competing for the Graf Zeppelin racing team in Friedrichshafen.
"The Lausitz ring has many fast passages that you have to meet optimally in order to be fast."
How fast Zimmermann really is will be revealed in two weeks.
"Of course, the teams have a little in the tests," he says.
"In the end, however, we are very satisfied and look forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring."
The race in Brandenburg will be the opening of a close-crowded calendar.
There will be seven races until the beginning of November.
Current stand is that no audience will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
In mid-August at the Nürburgring, ex-Formula 1 driver Niko Hülkenberg will take the GT steering wheel.

FC Bayern Munich: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start into the hot preparation phase for the Champions League began for Doublewinner FC Bayern with a setback.
Hansi Flick, who recovered "reasonably well" after a short vacation and a few days of training, has to think after the first team training how he can restructure his successful defense after the injury of world champion Benjamin Pavard.
The Frenchman behind Captain Manuel New and Midfielder Joshua Kimme has to reject the third most operational minutes, suffered a band violation at the left foot root and threatens to be missing in decisive king duels.
In the bad weather in Munich, the right-back broke off a training game and was driven off the course with a golf kart.
As long as the unrestricted master player has to match the title, is open.
An appearance in the second leg of the round of 16 against Chelsea on 8 August should be difficult, the 24-year-old can hope for the final tournament starting on 12 August in Lisbon.
But the Bavaria do not want to stop from the mishistory of training on Sunday.
In his personal triple formula, Flick named the three attributes he wants to see from his stars on their way to Portugal's capital.
Quality, intensity and concentration should show his winning title collector in the following 28 days in the case of the King's final game on 23 August.
"We have mastered the compulsory tasks with championship and cup simply excellently.
Now it is to still create the special, "said Flick.
Until the Munich team can concretely deal with the final tournament and before that a training camp in the Algarve, however, the first round of the last 16 against Chelsea FC is on the agenda.
After the 3: 0 in the game before the Corona break, the London in the home arena should not become the Bayern nightmare as in the lost "final dahoam" in 2012.
"We have to go through the door first.
We want to win, create good conditions and share trust with a good game, "said Flick.
A test to get in the mood is on Friday against Olympique Marseille.
With a long language, Flick had picked up his stars after the double 13 days on a unique August.
He welcomed 31 players on Säbener Straße, including the new players around high-end purchasing Leroy Sané, who met all new colleagues on the pitch for the first time after his move from Manchester City.
"Leroy has worked well like all new," said Flick.
But instead of talking about the new season, when Sané & Co. are no longer allowed to train, Flick preferred to talk about the current title project of the German series champion.
After days of individual and small group training, it is now trained in team strength for the London, as opposed to the Flick ensemble in playing rhythm.
After that, Munich could face a quarter-final against FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, in the semi-finals Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin are possible opponents.
A way to the final in Lisbon "is not so simple," emphasized the chief coach, who can trust in the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training from Tuesday.
The World Cup record goalscorer Klose and Flick know from many a joint tournament preparation, which is particularly important in the 0-on-100 set-up.
With his current team, the work was "a pleasure," praised Flick.
The "focus on winning" is an impressive trait of his team.
At the tournament with Ninth teams, it was also ambitious on Sunday.
All of the top performers were there, including Thiago and defender David Alaba, whose whereabouts are not guaranteed beyond the Champions League season.
Formula 1 needs a special rule to shorten their world champion
Since it is not possible to race on the required number of continents, the FIA has to improvise to award the world titles.
All America races were cancelled in the event.
Race calendar is becoming more and more concrete
The racing calendar of the current Formula 1 season continues to form.
In addition to the ten Grand Prix confirmed so far, three more racetracks were added during the week.
In October, the Nürburgring will be driven in Germany and in the Portuguese Portimão.
On the first of November, Lewis Hamilton and Co. will fight for world championship points at the traditional Italian race track in Imola.
With this, the 2020 race calendar covers 13 races.
"We are pleased to continue to make great progress in completing our plans for the 2020 season," said Formula One boss Chase Carey.
In this exceptional season, 15 to 18 races should be completed in the Motor Sports Class.
Formula 1 wants to conclude its season in Asia.
The final race calendar should be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
According to media reports, before the already officially planned races in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December, appearances in Vietnam and Malaysia could take place at the end of November.
Regulations demands race on three continents
However, the regulations of Formula 1 require at least races on three continents for the awarding of the World Championship.
Even if, as planned, only on two continents, there should be a world champion.
With the help of a special rule, the FIA wants to award the titles, citing "exceptional circumstances" due to the coronavirus academy.
The traditional seasonal start in Australia in March had to be cancelled due to the railway station.
A return to the continent this year is not an issue.
In addition, Formula 1 will not be guest in America this year.
Cancellation meets with criticism in Brazil
Due to the tense Coronasituation, the race in Canada, the USA, Mexico and Brazil will not take place.
"We're looking forward to being back with them next season," said Carey.
The rejection of the America race was above all in Brazil: "The rejection came not surprising for us, but we cannot accept the reasons for this," said Tamas Rohonyi, promoter of the Grand Prix in São Paulo.
For example, the number of infections in the São Paulo area is significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
In addition, the concerns of some teams not wanting to drive in Brazil would not justify an excuse.
They were prepared for the required security measures.
Greta Thunberg: Bad view against Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest in the well-known Latenight show of Stephen Colbert by video schalte and ripped in an interview with Donald Trump in her encounter with Donald Trump.
Climate activist Greta Thunberg was a guest on a popular US Latenight show via video.
She talked about her fight against the powerful of the world.
The teenager also spoke about her famous "evil look" during her meeting with Donald Trump.
New York City - In the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg made attentive with its tireless commitment to the "Fridays For Future."
Now she spoke in a well-known Latenight show about her plans for the future as well as her meeting with US President Donald Trump at the UN climate summit last year.
Latenight moderator Stephen Colbert welcomed the 17-year-old Thunberg on your broadcast on Tuesday and led a long interview with the Schwedin.
She spoke not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the powerful of the world.
"There are some things that surprised me," she said.
"How far people go to shift the focus away from the climate crisis," she said.
"Everything from organised hate campaigns to threats, just because a group of children goes on the street" has experienced them.
Heads of state and leading politicians who scoff at her on social media or even try to silence her find her "funny," because the reactions show her "because they have no other answer to it."
It was particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was addressed to a well-known scene in which she threw US President Trump a bitter evil look behind.
At the 2019 UN climate summit in New York, for which the nudist sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive gaze was caught by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
From the short clip a GIF was created, so an animated picture, which ultimately became one of the most frequently used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think about the US president at that moment?
On the relatively open question of Stephen Colbert, she only answered dry briefly: "To be honest, I believe that no further explanation needs."
The experienced satirist Colbert had probably not expected the quick-witted answer and disappeared from the picture with a short laugh.
With her "How dare you?" -rede on the principles of climate protection, she remained remembered for many at the climate conference.

Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green died
His life was like a roller coaster ride: After a rapid ascent with Fleetwood Mac, Fleetwood Mac went steep and then slowly upward again.
Now the blues rock guitarist Peter Green has died at the age of 73.
Ingenious guitarist, drugs junkie, cult pendant: The co-founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully in his sleep at the age of 73, family members announced in an official statement on Saturday, a further statement would be announced for the next few days.
Top musicians such as Peter Frampton worshipped Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarist.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional reaction of a "monumental loss" for all former and current members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
The drummer Fleetwood and guitarist Green had founded the now legendary band in 1967 in London, until now its unforgotten instrumental hit "Albatross."
The musician's life ("The End Of The Game," "In The Skies") resembled a rollercoaster ride.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a fast climb - but the band celebrated its greatest successes without him.
Among other things, there was a dispute because Green wanted to donate all of the group's profits to charity.
He began to step up in wide garments and with large crucifix.
Psychological problems are also said to have played a role.
In 1970, Green left the band in 1970.
A social decline followed.
The blues guitarist suffered drug abuse and schizophrenia, as biografen reported.
For a long time, Green was treated in psychiatry.
During a large part of the 1970s, the musician disappeared from the picture.
He is said to have lived on the street for a time, worked as a cemetery gardener and spent some time in an Israeli kibbutz.
Green was born in 1946 as a son of a Jewish family in the London district of Bethnal Green.
From an early age he was enthusiastic about US blues musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
With eleven years, he studied the first guitarist.
At the age of 15, the teenager began playing guitar professionally and five years later got the chance to appear on stage as lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners.
Little later, he became a substitute for his idol Eric Clapton in the blood breakers.
In the summer of 1967, in the midst of the blues boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac with his Bluesbreakers colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross," composed by Green, summed the group in the winter of 1968 / 69 the first number 1 hit and catapulted it to the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid rise soon showed its downsides: Green could not cope with the media hype, his experiments with the drug LSD became more and more extreme.
He commented on the life between music and searching later in an interview: "The worst thing happened to me in life is drugs - the best to land a number 1 hit."
Towards the end of the decade, Green achieved a surprising success in 1979 with an album inspired by religious themes.
Fleetwood Mac pigs this without him in new formation on a success wave.
Their 1977 album "Rumours" sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Despite various small solo successes, Green did not win a bigger comeback until he restarted with a group of friendly musicians in 1996.
The British "Daily Telegraph" spoke at the time of a rock star returning to Earth.
Green released several albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group, until the band released in 2004.
For music experts, he was already a blues legend during his lifetime - and with his soft sound one of the most influential guitarists of the past decades.
