He added that so far in the six years since the party's inception, 512 million Naira has been in the party's treasury.
He said his understanding as the governor was to be part of the national interim committee set up on July 25, 2020, which was chaired by the president to lead the process of resolving disputes between party members and withdraw complaints. in court among party members.
He said the money we received was used to pay the salaries of party secretary. staff, as well as other party-related activities, by-elections and to address other party members' problems such as medical benefits due to lack of access to support the government, not any party money that we have spent illegally, we challenge anyone to bring us the evidence of wasting party money.

For this reason, they are the trusted party leaders approved in the state, in paragraph 21 and paragraph 6 on page 87 of the party constitution, anything contrary to this shall not be used.
Because the decision of despair by the interim leaders was wrong.
He said those who presented and approved it at yesterday's session at an unsuccessful meeting, which was attended by Alhaji Abubakar Magaji, General Muhammed Garba, and Hon. Ahmed Dogonkoli, including Allah Ibrahim Balarabe and all the commissioners, are not members of the party's executive committee in the state.

The letter commended the members of the Federal Parliament who refused to attend the meeting and called for reconciliation on all issues between the two parties, which is not surprising to MPs who have known their pain, and for refusing to act as party law.

China Achieves Food Achievement Success-Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
Food is the lifeblood of all living things, and we cannot live without food.
That is why the Chinese government is working harder to ensure food security for its people.
In the 71 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the country has made great strides in food security, which has surprised the world with a population of over 1.4 billion..
This effort has helped pilots the issue of why China has made huge contributions to eradicating hunger around the world, as the head of China's grain preservation and agricultural products Zhang Wufeng has never stated that since 1949 until now, China has always put the issue on hunger at the forefront of all the country's affairs processes.
But in recent days, some people and some Western media outlets have once again expressed "concern" over the question of whether China can nurture its own people in the shadow of the COVID-19 pandemic.?
We thank them very much for always keeping an eye on the Chinese presence in the world.
Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the country has made great strides in food security through its efforts.
The issue of adequate food supply for the Chinese is one of the main topics of the ruling CPC's daily agenda.
Last weekend, General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee and President of the People's Republic of China Xi Jinping issued an important order to stop wasting food, noting that everyone knows that it is a work in progress.
Although the impact of COVID-19 on the world this year is also hurting China's economy, China will be able to provide enough food for its people.
According to figures released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the country's rice production in the first quarter of 2020 will reach 27.29 million tons. increased by 1.08 million tons, an increase of 3.9% compared to the same period in 2019.

Huang Jikun, director of the China Agricultural Policy Research Center at Peking University, said in an interview with The China Science Daily that the biggest challenge facing China is in the next 2 or three years, or China could reduce the amount of wheat and rice it stores in grain mills.
Now the average grain yield is 474 kilograms instead of the 400 kilograms that every person in the world should get every year.
And now China has installed millions of tons of agricultural products just for raising livestock.
Therefore, those who are concerned should calm down, take a bath and go to sleep, or focus on the internal affairs of their country.
The Chinese are able to feed themselves and produce their own food.

BBC Hausa has published an interview with Mamman Daura in which  He explains.
This rotating presidential election in Nigeria has not yielded any positive result since it   was in 1999.
Instead, Daura said the focus should be on determining who is eligible and not on the rotation process.
However, i,  The Igbos responded to Daura's remark.
They said it was only when he and his brother President Buhari took over the reignof government that he would now come out and say he was recommending that this method shouldn’t be used for  2023.

The country's top security officers, who have been in office for many years, have not been removed and are no better off.

The Contribution of Northern Media Writers to Northern Unity.
Social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram, Bacandamia and others, have long been instrumental in creating forums for dialogue, cooperation and friendship between different communities of the world, as well as the delivery of messages, news., and promoting political, educational and business policies.
Young people in Nigeria have embraced this new technology by using social media, to keep abreast of the latest trends to contribute their voices to the latest developments in their lives.
We can say that these platforms have brought us a lot of development that the youth of the North are benefiting from in the business, economy, education and politics of the region.
Many feed by writing and posting messages online, get jobs or develop projects they manage.
It is unfortunate that some young people, instead of taking advantage of this development, are following in the footsteps of the corrupt children of the southern part of the country who have become notorious for cheating inside and outside the country, or writing articles insulting and abusing the authorities and their predecessors.
It shows the lack of civilization in the development of the youths of this country.
The arrival of the Arewa Media Writers Association in the country is a great achievement, as it provides the youths of the North with a clear vision, a clear direction and a clear focus on what the youths are doing on Social Media, so that they can be creative writers.
It is imperative that we give this organization the cooperation it needs, in order to achieve its noble goals, which will bring benefits not only to our Northern region, but to Nigeria as a whole.
I urge our youths, especially social media users, to come together to protect the integrity of the North and its independence, and to create a system that will make a difference for all.
As our late Northern leaders such as Sardaunan Sakkwato, the first Northern Prime Minister Sir Ahmadu Bello, and his contemporaries aspire to provide for the people of the North.
It has been reported that the late leader of the fight against oppression and poverty, Malam Aminu Kano, once said that Nigeria is one country, but everyone knows his father's house!
So we say, of course, as we call for national development and good governance, at every level, we are further calling for the unity of the people of the North, regardless of religion or ethnicity, to bring about development and growth  to our region
If we look at the North as it was then it is not the same now.
We should therefore use our God-given talents to contribute and adviseto provide the North with a satisfactory way to revitalize its economy.
The North should provide revenue streams to implement its budget without waiting for the federal government to spend money.
In addition, if we want to develop the North, we must give priority to education, agriculture, tourism, health and science and technology.
We don't have to contribute money, there are different ways to do it.
We think that the North will fulfill the aspirations of our forefathers!
North is something we are proud of

He proclaimed that, even if they did it for the sake of idols, they should turn their backs on God because He is the One who removes all sadness and poverty from the nation.

A Man Is A King, For Their Praise.
Beyoncé's song "Black is King" continues to be praised and criticized around the world for its expression of African culture.
In South Africa, where the 85-minute film was filmed, many said it was more than a movie.
Black is King is a full-length film directed by American singer and songwriter Beyonce.
The film is best known for its song "The Lion King: The Gift."
Last year the film was made in the United States, South and West Africa, and Europe, and featured many African artists.
The film, released in July, has been well-received by audiences, but there has also been some criticism.
Some say that Beyoncé, who was born in Houston, Texas, in the United States, borrowed African elements illegally, especially the features that characterize Africa in the film, while traditionally she has no base on the African continent.
But in South Africa, those who made the film are happy.
Sibusiso Mathebula, a student of filmmaking, said he was honored to be included in the cast.
He said the film impressed him.
The film touches on many things that were not taught in school about black history.
He said it was only when he saw the film that he first saw the story and the clothes she was wearing and all the elements of the film, which developed a lot more than expected.
Beyoncé-based singer Kgosi Motosoane says Africans abroad-including black Americans-have access to what some see as cultural artifacts.
He said he was interested in the film.
Kgosi said black women are mostly at the grassroots level in society.
So their emergence in such highly influential issues is encouraging.
Mathebula, a film student, says that Beyonce's film inspired him to start making his own film to spread the word about Africa.
Beyoncé's Africans agree on one thing: If Man's Mouth is King, then Beyonce is queen.

The plan comes days before the expiration of the initial funding period for millions of Americans who lost their jobs as a result of COVID-19.
On Sunday, after days of talks with Republicans in Congress, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the aid included expanding funding for those who lost their jobs.
But according to them, this time around, Americans will see only 70 percent of their previous funding.
On Friday, the initial subsidy period will protect those who have been paid a certain amount of money to those who lost their jobs, and are being paid 600 per week in addition to those provided by the states.
Republicans have complained that the plan means more people are being paid more than they are paid when they work, combined with federal and state pay.
But Democrats, for their part, have challenged this claim, saying that given the growing number of coronavirus cases, some workers are not confident enough to return to work.
Why I joined the APC after leaving the PDP.
Former Speaker of the House of Representatives Yakubu Dogara has revealed his reasons for defecting from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC) after the caretaker chairman of the party Mai Mala Buni announced his return to the party.
In a letter to the PDP in his Bogoro constituency, Dogara said the collapse of the leadership in his home state of Bauchi under the Bala Muhammed administration that helped him win was the reason he left the party.
Dogara said he could not open his mouth to question how the state government was being run until he was accused of disobedience, so he took off his shoes to leave the party.
The former Speaker of the House of Representatives said that if he wrapped up his arms, he would be a traitor to Bauchi State under the rule of Bala Muhammed, after the then governors Isa Yuguda and Mohammed Abubakar had their voices heard if he saw wrong.
The Federal Government has launched an agricultural program to provide food and employment.

The statement came from the Minister of Agriculture, Sabo Nanono, during the launch of the program in Katsina.

He said the plan included the government's plan to distribute 100,000 metric tons of food to the needy to alleviate hunger and malnutrition during the Coronavirus outbreak.
He said in one year, the initiative is expected to create between 5 million and 10 million jobs.

Nigeria's New Places of Worship Law Debated
SERAP, a human rights and economic development group, has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to reprimand Nigerian Minister of Justice Abubakar Malami and the Director General of the Companies Registration Commission for suspending the registration of places of worship.
According to SERAP, the move is a clear violation of human rights as contained in the Nigerian constitution.
Before human rights groups complained about the government's move, religious leaders also called on the Buhari administration to refer the bill back to lawmakers for review and approval, as it would not infringe on the constitutional rights of religion and liberty.
Pastor John Buro, a Christian leader in Kaduna State, told VOA that the law was unfounded unless the government sought to ban worship or impose sanctions.
It should only use the means of monitoring and prosecuting all violators without imposing a new law.
For his part, Dr Bashir Yankuzo, imam of the University of Minna, said that although it was not wrong for the government to monitor companies and organizations for national security, it did not mean that there would be a crackdown on the rights of someone or others.
It is now a wait to see whether the government will listen to this public complaint.

On the other hand, if he tries to infiltrate the PREMIUM TIMES database with a computer, he then launches another attack with his GSM phone.
He spent five days waiting for the entrance to the PREMIUM TIMES archives, but did not succeed, despite the use of various modern weapons.
He did not succeed in penetrating, because the university did not know that PREMIUM TIMES had a strong plan in place, which built the foundation and the foundation of the door which was not broken by a young man.

It was 90 minutes later that he began attempting to infiltrate with the help of modern script technology.
It was morning and he made every effort to use the computer magic to shut down the PREMIUM TIMES page completely.
How a Farmer Treats Monkey Abuse:
The intruder was unaware that PREMIUM TIMES had successfully tampered with small rats and large mice that had entered the fields of social networking sites to infiltrate the site or seize the site.
This ignorance of his is why all the weapons he used, completely old ones that could do no harm to PREMIUM TIMES.
On this day, he was exhausted by the DDOS attack on the NTP's Likau Road, an old road that has been used since the village of Kano.
On March 3, he tried his best to clear his mind and mind, but he did not succeed.
The attempt to break the PREMIUM TIMES archive comes just days after PREMIDES reported on a scuffle between President Muhammadu Buhari's Security Adviser, Babagana Monguno and former Chief of Staff to the late Abba Kyari.
Some members of the Federal University of Technology in Akure have told PREMIUM TIMES that the university has recruited some of the biggest rats to infiltrate the Internet, in order to commit to infiltrating the PREMIMIUM MES archive. eagle-eagle, destroying or destroying it.
However, when contacted by PREMIUM TIMES, FUTA University distanced itself from the attempt to attack the PRESIDES Internet Archive.

The Kano State Anti-Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) Kano State has arrested three traffickers and rescued 71 others in the state.
The commissioner of Kano State, Shehu Umar, made the announcement on Friday in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria.

Effort, Perseverance, and Self-Sufficiency Is What Is In The Heart-Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
Longyuan Village, Hongsipu County, Wuzhong, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, Northwest China.
There is a brave woman named Li Yaomei or Sadiya (her Islamic name) who is famous for her struggles in life and her success in trying to get out of poverty.
Her story tells us that effort, perseverance, and self-seeking are things that are in the heart.
At first, Li Yaomei or Sadiya never sat in class to study, which is why she could not read or write.
But Allah has endowed her with a wealth of ingenuity and wisdom, making her a model in the fight against poverty.
About 20 years ago, Li Yaomei suffered from stomach cancer, which led to three operations on her abdomen.
After regaining consciousness, she suffered a serious accident and is now walking with the implant in her foot.
These challenges put her in a difficult position in addition to her health, as well as the issue of medical bills, which is why she took out a loan of about 3 thousand Yuan, equivalent to more than N16 million.
Surprisingly, this challenge faced by Malama Sadiya has been a source of inspiration and inspiration for her to improve her life.
The support from the Chinese government has also strengthened her.
Her job is to make different types of brooms based on the use of vegetation.
Due to her tireless efforts, her profession has flourished, with various companies ordering her to pick up.
In addition, she has created several machines that help her simplify the task.
For example, it used to take 15 minutes to assemble one large broom, but now during this time, it will assemble up to 5 brooms.
In addition, it provides some additional cleaning machines that restore the broom.
Then there are the extra machines that clean the animal feed for women, and now these machines are still available to buyers.
Considering the challenges that Ms. Sadiya has faced, and the efforts she is still making to improve her life and that of her staff, it is clear that the applicant is with me.
Fighting poverty and improving the quality of life is not the sole responsibility of the government.
If the government is going to provide support, but the people are not motivated or interested in improving their lives by finding jobs based on their situation, then the backlash will only continue without achieving a goal.
Her story shows that running a business or earning a living does not require any large sums of money or travel to other cities or abroad.
Because she is aware of her situation, she uses the resources available to her to improve her life.
In addition, Ms. Sadiya performed these tasks on her own feet without relying on her husband, for he ran away and left her.
That is to say, effort, perseverance and self-seeking are at the heart of it.
It also shows the power of women to change their lives and stand on their own two feet without seeking someone else's help.
This is also a lesson that shows that, whatever a person does, he should stand on his own two feet, because dependence on someone is uncertain.
Malama Sadiya is a courageous, intelligent and talented woman who is a role model and role model for others.
Also, by March this year, Ms. Sadiya had paid off all her debts and stopped receiving support from the government at her own discretion.

Us Politicians Fear Could Destroy COVID-19-Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
The director general of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has expressed concern over the steps being taken by some countries to save the expected COVID-19 vaccine, saying it must be to avoid showing favoritism to different communities, while distributing vaccines against the epidemic.
And the vaccine should be distributed evenly across the globe, as it will be in the best interests of different countries.
Indeed, some American politicians are pursuing a policy of prioritizing their own interests, in terms of sharing the vaccine, and they are undermining international cooperation in the fight against the pandemic.
Currently, the total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide has already exceeded 23 million.
In that number, more than 800 people have died as a result of the disease.
Under such extreme conditions, more attention is being paid to the effectiveness of vaccines, and it is gratifying that, in recent days, there have been great results in the study of vaccines in other countries, a phenomenon that has produced skin, and belief in the entire international community.
But sadly, some American politicians have expressed a desire to get vaccinated.
According to Science, the US government has already signed contracts worth more than $6 billion with COVID-19 from several pharmaceutical companies.
Although the US government's policy is understood to be that the United States is at the forefront of the spread of the virus, other developing countries also need to be vaccinated, given that they suffer from poor health resources.
The Ecologist also points out that if the United States achieves the goal of vaccination, the number of vaccines to be produced in developing countries will decrease.
The director general of the CDC Africa Center for Disease Control, Mr. John Nkengasong, also expressed concern over the issue.
According to some current affairs commentators, even if the vaccine has been successfully developed, it will not be possible to achieve the goal of the disease until the distribution of the vaccine is designed, which is a very important point for the international community.
It is also important for the international community to strengthen cooperation.
Who Director-General Tedros also said that if the disease was to be eradicated, it would be possible for some parts of the world, or even a few countries to achieve the goal of recoveration from the impact of the pandemic alone.

He said it was the judge's job to issue a summons to all the defendants to sign.
Because he did what Nigerian law gives him the right to do in court.
