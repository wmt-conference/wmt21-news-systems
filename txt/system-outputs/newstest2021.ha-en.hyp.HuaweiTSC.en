Why I left the PDP.
Former chairman of the Federal Assembly, Yakubu Dogara, explained some reasons why he left the PDP to join the APC.
It is not forgotten that the former chairman of the Federal Assembly, Yakubu Dogara, has contacted the PDP and returned to the APC this week.
Dogara said he had stopped suffering the abuse of Governor Bala of the PDP in Bauchi State, which helped the greatest victor in the 2019 election, and had gathered him to leave the party and return to his APC.
The main reason why I dropped out is how the PDP is ruling in Bauchi State.
Everybody knows the role I played in the election of the state governor, which former Abuja minister Bala Mohammed beat Governor Mohammed Abubakar.
But now I am scattered in the Bala government.
Instead of continuing to live on the PDP, I was given the opportunity to avoid giving them a place, and to return to where I came from.
Dogara wrote a letter of withdrawal from the PDP that he sent to the party's resident chairman, Bogoro C, in Bauchi State.
Finally, he said that as he pointed out to other governors where they had failed and where they had to repair earlier, he and Bala were not anointed with oil.
Garage, let me go and let them go.
Gobara wakes up at a Kano oil house.
The fire departed at about 10 a.m. overnight, which lasted nearly two hours eating, despite allowing officials of the Kano State Fire Department, security officials and the community to reach the scene.
During Freedom Radio's visit, she found the public in distress and various security officers there everywhere, being connected to the main station known as Kuka Station, which transports passengers from Kano to other states and neighboring countries.
In addition to the Water Gate market, which is outstanding in Northern Nigeria.
Freedom Radio has met with some eyewitnesses, who say the fire has led to a survival among the public.
A customs officer at the Water Gate station said they cooperated with patrol officers to rescue passengers who were injured in the fire.
The Kano State Fire Department has confirmed the incident, saying it is as far as we are preparing this report that it is continuing to collect information to identify the damage caused by the fire, as Sa'idu Commission spokesman Muhammad Ibrahim explained.
On the other hand, there have been reports of incidents that attempted to break into the Water Gate Market to steal, but police officers and officers have tried to oust them and protect the property of the community.
In this regard, we contacted Kano State Police spokesperson Abdullahi Haruna Kiyawa, who confirmed the incident.
KORONA: We have not yet finished testing the efficacy of the combined drug in Nigeria.
As European countries continue to test the efficacy of corona vaccines, Nigeria has not been left behind to include its own drug testing.
The National Food and Drug Administration (NAFDAC) has stated that it is testing 40 coronavirus medicines handed over to the agency by traditional pharmacists.
The Chairman of the Board, Mojisola Adeyeye, made the announcement on Tuesday in Abuja.
Mojisola said the drug's efficacy is being tested so as not to find compensation for obesity.
Since the outbreak of the coronavirus, traditional medicine collaborators have launched research to see that they have not been left behind to see the treatment included.
Many of them have handed over samples of their medicine to the authorities for testing and assessing its efficacy.
The NAFDAC also stipulated certain criteria and rules for combining the drug.
The drug's efficacy will be tested in animals for the first time.
Mojisola warned the drugmakers not to dare to test a drug without allowing the agency to do so.
In May, the NAFDAC revealed that social media and newspapers are the only news that claims to have discovered traditional medicine to cure Coronavirus.
Adeyeye said that even one person approached the NAFDAC to look at the efficacy of the drug, which he claimed included traditional medicine, saying it could cure Coronavirus.
The other person, who is not a cure for the disease, was told not to be identified.
He said he had identified the symptoms of illness that are considered to be the symptoms of infection.
However, some drugmakers have since approached the agency with their own cooperation.
Ramaphosa faces questions at the council.
This is the first time that President Ramaphosa has faced a series of questions before parliamentarians since the crackdown on corruption between senior government officials and some members of his party.
Ramaphosa promised in-depth research and even reform in the area responsible for managing the purchasing sector against the Covid-19 pandemic.
South Africa is the fifth country in the list of countries in the world hit by the coronavirus pandemic, but the president said corruption plays a key role in fighting the disease in the country.
Nigeria will open international airports on Saturday.
Authorities in Nigeria have said they will open airports for exit and entry into the country, from next Saturday, for the first time after five months of closure.
Since March 23, the country's government has stopped fucking flights, in order to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.
The government said the first four planes to land from overseas would land in Abuja.
So the city of Lagos, but so far it is not clear where these flights will come from.
According to Aviation Minister Hadi Sirika, this is the opening step, seeing as there has not been any problems since the opening of domestic flights on July 8.
Sirika added that it would be confirmed that all the necessary guidelines were followed in order to ensure a successful return of flights.
591 COVID-19 cases have been recovered in Nigeria.
On Friday, 591 new cases of COVID-19.
With this new Covid-19 infection in the country, the total number of people infected to 39,539 is 16,559 have recovered and 845 have died.
The Nigerian Center for Disease Control, NCDC, has posted numbers of people and states on its Twitter page.
Corona members have been added to our group - Marseille.
The Marseille Football Association in France said three more players contracted the coronavirus, after five cases last week.
The group made this known in a statement issued to reporters on Tuesday.
Moreover, the club said France's League 1 tournament, which was intended to start last Friday, was postponed as a result of five COVID-19 cases.
Marseille also said it had already announced stakeholders in preparing for the League 1 tournament as a result of an increase in three people infected after the first five people contracted, in order to find a solution to the issue.
APC Repudiates Niger Governor's Attempt to Bring Peoples to the Party - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
In a statement issued by the APC this week, Talatar accused the governor of Niger State, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, of attempting to bring riots into the party.
The document, signed by the Chairman of the Engineering Party Muhammad Jibrin Imam and the Secretary of the Barista Party Muhammed Liman, stated that over the six years that the party has ruled the state, only 512 million naira has been received.
The statement went on to say that the governor's stakeholder meeting, which he chaired on Sunday night last week, would help continue the riots in the party, saying they had written to the secretariat of the national party about the ongoing events in the state.
According to Engineer Imam, "We understand the governor of Niger State is trying to divide the heads of the members of the party by organizing a meeting of stakeholders, which is illegal, because any complaint against the leaders of the party is written to the secretariat of the party for investigation".
He went on to say that so far in the six years since the founding of the party, the sum of 512 million is in the party's fund.
He said what he understood as the governor was to be on the National Holding Committee, which was established July 25, 2020, led by the president to lead the preparation of the problems between the members of the party and the withdrawal of complaints in court between the members of the party.
That is why the funds we receive are paying the salaries of the party's secretariat staff, as well as other activities related to the association, choosing to expel skilled workers and alleviating some of the problems facing the party's pupils such as health support due to lack of access to government funds, not any illegal party funds, we each challenge us to justify the guarantee of party funds.
As I explained, the expulsion election of the state governments last year was the most important expulsion election in the country, which we conducted with the former commissioners and commissioners who now hold supreme power in all twenty-five local governments in the state, whose funds in the elections were allocated by the commissioners to bring their husbands.
In other words, it is wrong for anyone to say that party funds are being spent illegally, this is almost unfair in trying to protect the bad name and try to hang it, saying to a committee that has been set up to investigate how party funds are spent and who has formed it.
Among the funds that the complainant said were the funds he alleged to have been granted, the funds provided by the secretariat of the national association, the funds given to others like that son, so I challenge each person on this issue who has brought his testimony to prove this allegation in any way.
Imam (r.a.) said that we have stood firm against protecting the APC from any movement or organization from the uprising of the party, adding that any allegations against the party or any party leader from the state level will be written by the committee in charge of the party as stated in section 21 (B) (bi), (d) on page 82 of the party system.
Therefore, party stakeholders have no role to play, especially if they attempt to seize committee power and therefore their decision has no effect.
For this reason, they are the most prominent leaders of the party that has been approved in the state, in the 21st rank and sixth paragraph on page 87 of the party's constitution, whatever is usual for this not to be used.
Because of the disappointment of the leaders, you are wrong.
He said those who presented the book with approval yesterday at the unsuccessful meeting, which was attended by Alhaji Abubakar Magaji, General Muhammed Garba, Hon. Ahmed Dogonkoli, including Alhaji Ibrahim Balarabe and all commissioners, were not members of the executive committee in the state.
Only the executive committee of stakeholders chairman of the association Engineering Mohammed Imam will chair him and not the governor will lead the heads of the state party.
The statement added that Governor Abubakar Sani Bello recalled that the issue of fulfilling the promises made to the people of the state during the elections, and moving with the parents of the party in the government would benefit everyone in the state and all districts through political positions, which is the problem of the governor and the party.
The letter commended the members of the Federal Parliament who refused to attend the meeting and drew attention to reconciling all the problems between the members of the party, which is not surprising to members of parliament who are aware of their own illness, who refuse to accept falsehood as a law of the party.
Therefore, there is a need for the chairman of the National Committee to draw the attention of Governor Abubakar Sani Bello on the right position not to attempt to undermine the state's policies.
Nigeria is ready for the Internet economy - Freedom Radio Nigeria
The Minister of Communications and Economic Development, Dr Isa Ali, Pantami, said the country is ready on the right for a revolution in the economic sector of the internet.
He also said the government is prepared to work with experts in universities and other stakeholders to ensure access to the country in any modern technology case.
Dr Isa Ali Fantami made this known during an international conference on the development of communication technology that is conducted through the internet.
Similarly, the minister added that one of the first steps taken by the government to see this country access to communication technology was to change the ministry's name from the Ministry of Communications to the Ministry of Communications and Economic Development.
The deterioration of food restrictions is detrimental to people's health in Nigeria.
Some scientists have warned people to avoid eating foods that are harmful to human health.
The scientists issued the warning after studies conducted on the quality of food in the country.
The results of the study showed that some foods were being added to them to prevent them from rubbing.
The study also showed that this chemical is most commonly used in beans, spotted and dried fish populations.
The chemical is used because when one sees it he is interested to buy it and use it.
Eating foods containing this chemical then cause cancer, kidney disease, heart attacks and many others.
It has called on the people of this country to pay attention to protecting against the use of these foodstuffs for their health.
It should be noted that Food Quality Expert Grace Olasumbo has called on Nigerians to avoid eating Calcium Carbide grinded trees.
Olasumbo explained that Sindarin Calcium Carbide is the most common chemical used by the market to grind crude trees, that is, luxury goods.
Research shows that short patience and greed are among the factors that make marketers use this chemical because it produces trees in one day.
Olasumbo explained that one thing marketers have failed to recognize is the use of this chemical to produce luxury goods that are harmful to people's health.
For this reason, there are diseases including vomiting and diarrhoea, eye pain, abdominal cancers, throat cancers, mouth, liver and many others.
The president of the African Development Bank has been washed away from criticism - Freedom Radio Nigeria.
A panel of experts led by former Prime Minister of Ireland Mary Robinson has washed away the chairman of the African Development Bank AfDB Akinwumi Adesina.
According to the committee, Mr Akinwumi Adesina is not guilty of alleged bribery.
The AFP news agency reported that earlier this year, a fifteen-page report accused Mr. Adesina, aged in, of showing priority, inability to lead and self-sufficiency.
However, a panel of experts led by Robinson, Gambia's Chief Justice Hassan Jallow and World Bank Deputy Governor Leonard McCarthy, have cleared the former Nigerian minister of agriculture from all allegations he has made.
In the past, the United States has insisted that Mr. Adesina be investigated for allegations, followed by an incident by the AfDB Banking Board, which led to the establishment of a committee of experts to investigate the allegations.
COVID-19 Stops Trump's Election Summit in Florida.
U.s. President Donald Trump yesterday announced that he had canceled the Republican Party's congress scheduled to be held in Jacksonville, Florida, next month, as a result of a surge in coronavirus cases.
Nevertheless, the general assembly will be held in North Carolina.
Trump said in Jacksonville that holding a large meeting was not appropriate this time.
President Trump moved part of the GOP convention to Florida last month after they had a dispute with Democratic leaders in North Carolina over holding a closed meeting room with his supporters without wearing masks.
Republican representatives will gather in Charlotte, North Carolina, to officially elect Trump on August 24.
Trump said he would make endorsement remarks in a separate draft.
Trump, who has spent months showing an all-in-one attitude to the impact of the pandemic, recently said 99 percent of the cases seen increasing in the United States would not be harmful.
Buhari Will Not Receive Prayer Greetings.
The chief media adviser, Malam Garba Shehu, made this known in a statement issued by the palace today Wednesday.
The statement also said that this year the president would not accept those who used to come to bring him a greeting of prayer.
Shehu said the move was taken as a result of proposals from the Islamic Supreme Council to curb the coronavirus pandemic.
President Muhammadu Buhari also emphasized the measures recommended by the Parliament to avoid gatherings where many people will be in the same place.
At this year's prayer ceremony, the president celebrated his celebration at home with his family rather than going to mosques as he usually does every year.

China Achieves Its People's Riches And Food - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
Food is the spirit of life of all creatures, it cannot be lived necessarily except with food.
This is why China's rulers are increasingly determined to ensure the nation's supply of food.
In the past 71 years since the foundation of the People's Republic of China, the country has achieved major achievements in the field of food supply, which has surprised the world with the population of the country, which according to the report shows the number of Chinese has reached 1.4 billion.
This effort has contributed greatly to the fact that China has made a major contribution to eradicating hunger in the world, as China's Chairman of the Food and Agriculture Commission Zhang Wufeng once stated that since 1949 until now, China has always been putting the issue of curbing hunger before all operations of the country's affairs.
But in recent days, some Western media have repeatedly "worried" over the issue of whether China can raise its own people in the shadow of the COVID-19 respiratory epidemic across the globe?
We thank them very much for their constant care for the presence of the Chinese in this world.
Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the country has managed to produce enough food based on its efforts.
The issue of providing sufficient food to the Chinese is one of the main agenda of the ruling CPC party on a daily basis.
At the end of last week, the general secretary of the CPC Supreme Committee, who is the president of China, Xi Jinping issued an important order to stop barning food, pointing out that everyone knows that any foodstuffs and labor difficulties are obtained.
Although this year the impact of the COVID-19 respiratory disease that has hit the world is also detrimental to China's economy, China will be able to provide enough food for its people.
Alkalines released by the Chinese Bureau of Statistics on the quantity of agricultural products, especially the rice that the country will receive this year 2020, showed that the amount of rice produced in the country in the first quarter of 2020, reached 27.29 million tons, increasing by 1.08 million tons, that is, it increased by 3.9% compared to the same period of 2019.
Ke Bingsheng, the former chairman of the Chinese Agricultural University, said China has achieved great achievements in the face of the country's food supply compared to the earlier implementation of the policy of making changes at home and opening doors to foreigners.
Huang Jikun, the head of Beijing University's China Agricultural Policy Research Center, made the remarks during a meeting with China Science Daily correspondent, according to China's current challenge over the next 2 or three years, whether China will be able to reduce the amount of wheat and rice it stores in grain stores.
Now the amount of grain each receives is 474 kilograms instead of the 400 kilograms that each person in the world should receive annually.
And now China is importing some millions of tons of agricultural products for domestic livestock only.
Nevertheless, those who are concerned about the issue should calm their minds, take a bath and fall asleep, or focus on the affairs of their home.
The Chinese are able to raise themselves with the food they produce themselves.
Why I prosecuted Ganduje in court - Abba K. Yusuf - Freedom Radio Nigeria.
Kano Governor's candidate for the PDP, Abba Kabir Yusuf, has explained his reasons for prosecuting Kano Governor Dr Abdullahi Umar Ganduje and other businessmen before the state high court.
Abba Kabir made this known through his lawyer, Bashir Tudun wuzirci, who said he had filed a lawsuit alleging the possession of some merchants of government buildings that the people of Kano State benefit from.
In addition to the Kano governor and entrepreneur, Abba Kabir Yusuf has also filed a lawsuit against the State Ministry of Works, Housing, Transport, Attorney General, Justice Commissioner of Kano State and the State Land Commission.
Abba Kabir Yusuf accused the Kano State government of possessing individuals of former Daula hotels that are now under the supervision of Wudil City University of Science and Technology and Shahuci Station, saying this went against the provisions of the country's laws.
Abi is eligible only, in accordance with the acceptance process in 2023.
Mother's son and friend of President Muhammadu Buhari, Mamman Daura, said that the style of governing in Nigeria is now old.
Mamman Daura said Nigeria had already done well by now abandoning the recruitment process in focusing on the most eligible candidate in 2023.
BBC Hausa has published an interview with Mamman Daura, in which he explained this.
The process of accepting the presidential election in Nigeria has not resulted in an eye-catching son that has been started since 1999.
Instead, Daura said that attention should be paid to determining who is eligible, not until the acceptance process is followed.
However, the members of the Igbo people, namely Inyamai, have reacted to Daura based on his statements.
They said that he and his cousin, President Buhari, would become homosexual and would now come out saying he was recommending not to do so in 2023.
He himself is not elected better than all Nigerians.
Similarly, the chief security officers of the country who have been in their seats for decades have not been removed, and they are also not more capable than others.
Martanin Inyamai.
Never miss important updates! A storm of policies by the Nigerian presidency broke out on Wednesday, while the Igbo People's Organization for the Protection of Peoples, Ndigbo, denounced Mamman Daura for his speech to the Inyamurai tribe.
In a conversation with Daura, who is a cousin of President Muhammdu Buhari, he said the process would be Shiyya in the presidential election that will take place in 2023.
Nevertheless, since his statements have not finished social media, Ndigbo has hastened to issue a statement to Mamman Daura, calling his kitesurfing algorithm a secular one.
In a statement issued by Ndigbo on Wednesday, the Igbo People's Association of Southern Peoples and the South East Shield will be allowed to emerge as president in the 2023, that is, the Igbo people.
Speaker of the Igbo People's Association, Emeka Attamah, said Mamman Daura's words, like bottles of the Nigerian presidency in 2023, were against the Igbo people.
In addition to greed, what has prevented Mamman Daura from speaking acceptance since 2019.
They have repeatedly expelled Jonathan, and now Daura is fighting for the southern region that will lead Nigeria in the 2023.
He will finish telling the story of his brother, the current president of the country, and will bring us an unknown topic of acceptance in 2023.
He should, as an elder, embrace the truth and hold it well.
He did not lead the country's presidency in 2023, nor did he lead the country voluntarily.
Negotiations on Fighting.
The issue of abusing women and young children by raping them is common in northern Nigeria, where there are reports of children being deprived of their rights.
People from many sectors attended the hall on July 23 to discuss how the situation is getting worse in the country and how it should be overcome.
Participants attributed the problem to things like advertising for girls and the neglect of some parents.
One of the mothers who attended the meeting of Hajiya Fathi'a Sha'ibu, the wife of former governors of Plateau and Niger State in the reign of the late Sani Abacha, described poverty as one of the factors that parents impose on their children.
Hajiya Maryam mamman Nasir, chairman of a group that is fighting to see the tragedy fought, said "First of all, we should go around educating mothers about the consequences of allowing their children to go out for advertising, because then a child leaves will be missed to the point of harming him".
We will also call on teachers to begin preaching with a loud voice to parents and family members who rape their children with their teeth.
He, a member of the House of Representatives representing Maiyama, Koko and Besse of Kebbi State Honorable Shehu Mohammad, has expressed his condolences and support in ensuring that a rigorous law has been put in place to punish anyone convicted of rape in the country.
From the end, Hajiya's wife, David and Nasiru El-hikaya, who led the meeting hall, expressed their gratitude to those who attended the meeting on behalf of the Niger state agency who accepted their invitation.
Media Writers' Contribution to Northern Cooperation.
Modern social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram, Bakanda and many others have long played a role in fostering dialogue, solidarity and fellowship between different communities around the world, as well as delivering messages, stories, and promoting political, educational and business interests.
Young people in Nigeria have become involved in this new technology using social networks, to move with modernity, to make contributions or to splash their mouths in ways that affect their lives.
We can say that these centers have brought us many advances that Northern youth benefit from in business, economics, education and politics of the region.
Many others eat food by writing and delivering messages online, getting jobs or developing jobs.
However, it is unfortunate to see some young people instead of using this opportunity to benefit from the progress that has been made, there have been some who follow the corrupt children of the South who have excelled in the world in disturbing the public, inside and outside the country, or in writing comparisons and abuses of judges and predecessors.
This is a sign of a lack of awareness in the development of the country's youth.
The arrival of the North Media Writers Association in the country is a great honor for providing Northern youth with a view, good judgment and cleaning up the things young people do in Soshi Midaya, so that they can be writing meaningful and promoting the interests of the Northern people.
It is necessary to give this organization the cooperation it needs to achieve its good goals that will bring benefits not only to our Northern Territory, but also to Nigeria as a whole.
I advise our youth, especially users of social networks, to come together to protect the dignity of the North and its rights, and to create a system that will make a difference for everyone.
As our Northern leaders who have fallen asleep such as Sardaunan Sakkwato, First Northern Prime Minister Sir Ahmadu Bello, and their allies, they have sought to provide for the Northern people.
It has been reported that the late fighter against oppression and poverty, Malam Aminu Kano, once said that Nigeria is one country, but everyone knows his father's home!
So we say, surely, while we call for the development of the country and the improvement of governance, at each stage, we call on the unity of Northerners, without discrimination of religion or ethnicity, to bring our region forward.
Considering how North is not the case now.
We should therefore use the insight that God has given us to make contributions and suggestions, in order to provide North with a satisfying way to revive its economy.
The North should provide revenue streams to implement its budget without waiting for the federal government to waste money.
In addition to our desire for Northern development, we attach importance to education, agriculture, tourism, health and science and technology.
There are no lawyers but we donate money, there are different ways to do so.
We think that North will fulfill our predecessors' goals!
North is proud of us.
The government has allocated 126 billion naira to repair hospitals in the country.
The federal government has allocated 126 billion naira from the country's economic improvement plans to repair hospitals in the country.
Hospitals to be repaired include FMC Hospital, infectious disease screening facilities, the emergency care department, the quarantine department for unwanted diseases in the United States, and teaching hospitals in 36 states in the country.
Last year, health professionals called on government departments to cooperate to allocate sufficient funds to improve the health sector of the country.
The experts made the call at a conference on providing good health to people easily and that took place in Abuja.
In his speech, Senate candidate representing Kwara North under the shadow of the APC, Sadiq Umar, said he should commit the Nigerian government to improving the health of the country with seriousness.
Failure to do so has caused the sector to suffer from a lack of funding, which has made it increasingly dependent on the support it receives from abroad.
Umar said that despite the support being provided, the government did not play a role in the health sector, so they began to withdraw their subsidies.

People killed by famine in Africa will go up those killed by Coronavirus -IFAD.
The International Institute for Agriculture Development (IFAD) has stated that at least 23 million more people will be killed by famine in the African Sahara region in 2020.
IFAD Chairman Gilbert Houngbo made this known at the World Economic Forum.

Houngbo said Coronavirus has shown that there is a serious problem with food production, distribution and repairs.
Many farmers are struggling with the fact that they are unable to obtain fertilizers due to traffic restrictions.
And they are unable to go to the field and those who cultivate the crops for sale, markets are closed not to sell their crops.
The report added that in 2019, famine killed 135 million people worldwide, of which 73 million came from Africa, in 36 countries.
In Northern Nigeria, 5 million people were killed by famine in 2019.

Yes, the federal government has the right to safeguard public life, but those who are close to these people should first of all say that we think we have a problem with these things.
Alhaji Sabo Nanono added that the federal government is doing its utmost to promote agriculture and food production in the country.
President Trump Wants to Reduce Drug Pricing.
On Friday, July 24, US President Donald Trump signed four presidential legislation reducing Americans' spending on medications written for them by doctors, as he faces a struggle for re-election and anxiety over his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic in the country.
Trump had earlier said he would make almost all changes to the law, which he signed on Friday, but this is the first time the law has been signed.
One of the legislation would allow for the import of medicines that doctors write for cheaper medicines from countries like Canada officially, while another law would require pharmaceutical companies to reduce their prices, Trump said.
Another law requires a reduction in the cost of insulin injections while a fourth law, which is unlikely to be implemented if drug companies are successful, would require Medicare Insurance schemes to buy medicines at prices that other countries buy, Trump said.

Alhaji Bashir Othman Tofa, the chairman of the group, said it was almost impossible to say that Kano State had borne more debt than the one that had already been dumped in the past.
Decisions on Fighting in Nigeria are the only cases.
A community fighter in Kaduna State, Alhaji Aliyu Maigidaje, pointed out that the execution of a rape victim in the country, especially in Northern Nigeria, is the only solution.
Alhaji Aliyu Maigidaje made the announcement in his interview with Leadership Today in Kaduna, adding that if the authorities confirmed this after investigation, the execution was the only solution.
He added that the decision would reduce the number of cases of rape that could be easily achieved, but it is very easy for us to correct our hearts.
Alhaji Aliyu Maigidaje said that in our species of Muslims, we should ask the Prophet to stop and correct our hearts, because one does not always know the day he will die.
It is a shame to say that it is absolutely a male or an elderly man to say that he has received a little girl or a three-month-old girl, a three or five-year-old raped her.
He added that, between God and God, we will not insult leaders, or rulers of the country, pointing out that there is no way to fail to make progress if such sacrifice is achieved.
He added that "that is why we are in distress and suffering in the country, because the country has refused to move forward, including Sarakauna, Governors and the President, they have lost their way.
He added that until they stitched that barracks and then the moon broke out, it was necessary for us to correct our hearts please bring us a solution to the issue of rape.
He announced that even if they are for idolatry, everything should be abused by God because he is the one who removes all sadness and poverty from the community.
According to him, whatever behavior one gets into, God is aware of you not what you are going to do, but you always think you are going to die and you always think you are backward, as soon as you are born.
He pointed out that the police are also officially doing their best because they are sending suspected rape victims to Kotukuma Alkali to make their own efforts for this tragic event, in our Northern Territory and in the country.
He called on parents in particular to keep a close eye on their brothers and sisters, setting an example of how their parents' ads add to the problem.
He said some parents do not follow the lives of their brothers, whether they go to school or not, or they return home on time or they do not return, adding that some parents are guilty of wrongdoing because they should know that they are given the children by God and that tomorrow he will ask them what kind of education they have given their brothers.

Nigerian students in Cyprus have denied Abike Dabire, who said students are being killed in the country.
Nigerian students studying in Cyprus, the TRCN, have denied the chairman of the Nigerian Foreign Residents Commission (NiDCOM), warning their parents to stop sending their pupils to Northern Cyprus, saying they are being raped.
On Monday, Abike Dabiri-Erewa warned that hundreds of Nigerians are being killed in Northern Cyprus without the government investigating.
Dabiri made the confession after he learned of the murder of a student named Ibrahim Khaleel.
The student, who is a Nigerian, was killed and to this day no further information has been heard.
The killing of Ibrahim Khaleel will be a lesson for parents to stop sending their children around the world, being killed in vain, especially in Northern Cyprus.
The problem is that people don't know that the whole world is not believed to be Northern Cyprus.
The United Nations has not even approved the country.
But thousands of Nigerians live in their country studying, but then hundreds of Nigerians are killed in the country.
Dabiri even said that Nigeria would disclose the names of hundreds of Nigerians who have been killed in the country.
However, as they reacted, Nigerian students studying in the country said that peace in Northern Cyprus is far better than that of Nigeria.
Evidence Akhayere, chairman of the National Association of Nigerian Foreign Students (NANS), said that although Nigerian students in their countries are facing challenges, readers in Northern Cyprus are not suffering from problems, challenges or any interference.
Evidence also told PREMIUM TIMES during their briefing.
He said it was not true that hundreds of Nigerian students died in Cyprus.
He said the word of 100 student deaths was false.
The few who have died are all chronic pain, not murder.

Religious leaders tell their followers the truth that there will be no violence.
Kaduna State Parliament Speaker Yusuf Zailani has warned religious leaders to tell their followers the truth rather than inciting their followers to worship and promote parties.
Zailani made this known during his speech at the Kaduna State House of Assembly during the state government's visit to Kaduna last week.
Zailani added, "It is true that you do not want to be told, if you go to other places of worship you hear their guides instigate them and promote hatred for their non-religious friends.
This is what tore up trials among people.
Finally, he said that unity must be restored and religious leaders must teach followers of God's almighty message as it comes in our religious books, peace will not be achieved.
The senator representing Central Kaduna, Father Sani, who attended the meeting, also urged non-residents of Kaduna to chew their words before making their comments.
The conflict has been raging for more than 40 years.
For the first time, the governor has won the sword until this problem comes to an end.
But also because of the way others are distracted by the realities of what is happening, many people only hear from one party apart from other parties.
Thousands of N-Power youth are part of the program.
The Minister of Mercy and Support, Sadiyya Farouk, has testified that many of the beneficiaries of N-Power, that is, receiving Alawus every month, work in other facilities, research shows.
In a statement issued by the minister on Thursday, she said there were definitely those who had not been paid but that the problem had not been experienced by her office, and her office had already handed over more than 500,000 people's names to be assessed for their previous fees.
She said names were being assessed for board members' banks, receiving funds after working elsewhere.
This program is for those who are unemployed but some thousands of those who are receiving contact are working elsewhere and are receiving N-Power.
Tanking and rationing are now being carried out to identify them with the wealth to be paid.
She asked the beneficiaries of their previously unpaid funds not to be more sorry that they would soon feel weaponized.

They also called for funding to see that the youth have long benefited from this government support.
After meeting with some of the members of parliament who listened to the complaint, they flocked to the Federal Department of State Employees to see if they would railway with the Minister of National Support, Sadiya Farouk.
The prominent Commissioner for the Protection of Human Rights, Komared Mustapha Soron Dinki, who has travelled from Kano to Abuja with the youth, said the rally was held to remind the minister so that those who benefit from the program do not have rights to their enemies before they are suspended.
Earlier in the morning, young people had a taste at the National Assembly.
We hope that the government will hear the cries of these youths to provide them with solutions that will help them continue to live as before.
The youths hold boards with letters calling on the government to recover them with mercy.

Immigrants are King, I praise them.
The film, full of songs by Beyonce, titled "Black is King," continues to be praised and praised around the world for its expression of African culture.
In South Africa, where the 85-minute film is included, many say this is far beyond film.
Black is King is a song-filled film directed by the famous American singer and songwriter Beyonce.
The film stands out for its song "The Lion King: The Gift," "The Lion King: The Gift."
Last year, it was filmed in the United States, Sudan, West Africa, and Europe, and features several African musicians.
The film, which was released in July, received a great deal of approval from audiences, but it was also won by audiences.
Some say that Beyonce, who was born in Houston, Texas, then the United States, illegally borrowed African objects, especially the characters that captured Africa in the film, while traditionally having no foundation in the African continent.
But in South Africa, even those who have played the role in making this film are delighted.
Sibusiso Mathebula, a graduate film reader, said he was ranked among the filmmakers.
He said he was impressed by the film.
The film touches on a number of things that are not taught at school about black history.
He said it was when he saw the film that he first saw the story and the clothes she wore and the glory of the film, which resulted in a lot more than expected.
Beyonce's poetry lover Kgosi Motosoane said overseas African pupils - including American peasants - had access to what some consider to be African heritage.
He is also interested in the film.
Kgosi said there were mostly black women on the national level in the community.
So their involvement in very effective matters is encouraging.
Film reader Mathebula said Beyonce's film inspired him to start producing the film in order to spread information about Africa.
Beyonce's African supporters have taken refuge in one thing: If Man is King, then Beyonce is queen.

In a statement shared by Women's Media Correspondent Halima Oyelade, the minister noted that this year has been a year full of challenges and passions that we have learned how to reach out to the public and manage natural disasters, but throughout the work we have focused our attention on fulfilling the work we have been given to the public, preventing catastrophic events from occurring with musicians, and developing ways to mitigate disasters when it happens, which has helped us improve our work for the future.
When commending the President for his vision to create the ministry that has been at the forefront of the coronavirus pandemic, Hajiya Sadiya Umar Farouk thanked him for putting her in his ministry driver's seat.
She also recalled that during this year, the other learned important lessons and gained a new understanding of the emerging and non-invasive ways in which this work took place.
While she praised the media, the minister said these were travel companions who had to join forces to succeed.
She said, "I want to make it clear to you today that the job you are doing is right".
She also said it was not her responsibility to score points for her achievements, but she was ready and her colleagues to continue their work in a dedicated and committed manner to fulfilling their commitments, which is consistent with their one-year commitment, Service2Humanity.
The minister paid special tribute to "our humanitarian workers and partners in this section from United Nations agencies such as OCHA, IOM, UNHCR and the World Food Commission, the World Bank, USAID and the European Union (EU), as well as other cooperative agencies that continue to provide relief despite the current insecurity situation and the hardships they face.
She also raised awareness of those who died in insecurity areas during this year's meeting.
The minister explained that the one-year anniversary of the creation of the ministry made it necessary for them to stand firm.
She said, "While we are delighted to be one year old, I want to say that it is time to be insulted again in carrying out our work".
We must find ways to expand disaster management, provide relief and develop public support solutions that will help us improve our performance in the future.
At the same time as farmers are exploiting their farming in Nigeria, farmers in the Sokoto State region have begun to struggle against threats posed by birds, which may hamper the crops that are thought to be obtained.
The threat of red birds in Sokoto State's private area like joy has receded, as there are signs of a good food season this year 2020.
On the other hand, some local farmers embraced a traditional strategy of dropping the birds, as a young man named Faruk from the Dange Shuni area explained.
Sambo Abubakar, one of the local farmers, said the birds are now attacking all the plants that have begun to melt in the fields.
The chairman of the Nigerian Farmers' Association, Sokoto State Branch, Murtala Gagado Minannata, said this is now the case in two-thirds of Sokoto State.
He also said they are now waiting to hear the situation of local governments in the state to put together a report to the State and Federal Ministries of Agriculture to take action to help farmers.
Federal Ministry of Agriculture Officer in charge of the Department of Birds and Pests, Ya'u Maƙeri Kagara, said it was not more than a month before the completion of the treatment for birds in the Sokoto area.
He added that the birds are imported from the Nijer republic and Benin, and international affairs must have an agreement before the problem can be resolved.
In June, the federal government launched a bird spraying operation in 12 northern states of Nigeria, which are neighboring and abroad, and which is where the birds enter Nigeria.
However, the recovery of this problem could turn the clock back to the progress that is being seen in agriculture, which governments claim to be paying special attention to.

African King asks students to learn to control the language of Hausa - Freedom Radio Nigeria.
The King of Hausa and the King of Agadaz State, Dr. Abdulkadir Koguna, urged students to focus on learning and managing the language.
Dr. Abdulkadir News made this known today in the "Welcome in the Morning" program of Freedom Radio, which focuses on Hausa International Day to be held tomorrow Wednesday.
Dr. News also said that the language plays a role in promoting culture, saying that the youth are now trying to borrow the culture of certain languages that are wrong.
According to him, the french language occupies fifty-nine countries around the world, allowing them to dominate other countries in the french language.
Also on the program, the chairman of the National Association of Hausa Students, Malam Nura Sulaiman Janburji, said the language of enmity is so sacred that in countries across the country, students are given the opportunity to establish an empire.
The two guests called on governments in all stages to promote the language in the country's parliaments to protect it in the eyes of the world.
Germany tightening coronavirus measures
Angela Merkel is a 50 euro tax supporter, equivalent to 22,000 naira, for anyone arrested wearing black and white face masks in public.
It even requires legislation to reduce gatherings at home and abroad.
The government chief said he was supporting the health minister to demand that free testing be stopped for returnees from overseas.
In the past, Germany has managed to overcome the epidemic but, following the withdrawal of rules imposed earlier this year, new cases are often reported now.
New COVID-19 relief funds will be reintroduced in the United States.
While the judges point out that the number of COVID-19 cases continues to increase in the United States, today Monday Republican Party members in the country's Senate are expected to submit a grant.
It is thought that the funding will amount to $1 trillion to alleviate the radiation caused by the coronavirus pandemic in the country.
The plan comes days before the expiration of the first funding deadline for millions of Americans who have lost their jobs due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Yesterday Sunday, after days of talks with Republicans in parliament, the chief of staff of the U.S. government, Mark Meadows and Secretary of the Treasury- Mali Steven Mnuchin said the subsidy consisted of an expansion of the grants program for those who lost their jobs.
But they said, this time, Americans would see 70 percent of the money they were given earlier.
On Friday, the initial subsidy deadline will protect those who are paid some package of funds to those who have lost their jobs, and they are given 600 each week in addition to the one provided by the states.
Republicans are complaining that the plan is aimed at some people who are paid more than they are paid when they are working, if the federal government subsidies are combined with those paid by the state.
But Democrats, for their part, have challenged the claim, saying that noticing the coronavirus pandemic is increasing, some workers are not comfortable with returning to work.
Why I joined the APC after leaving the PDP.
Former chairman of the House of Representatives of Nigeria Yakubu Dogara explained the reasons why he switched from the PDP to the APC after the chairman of the ruling party Mai Mala Buni announced his return to the party.
In a letter to the PDP in his Bogoro constituency, Dogara said the breakdown of leadership in his Bauchi State under the Bala Muhammed government that helped win was the reason why he left the party.
Dogara said he could not openly question how the state government was being run until he was accused of disobedience, so he had to buy a shoe out of the party.
The former chairman of the Assembly said that if he wrapped up his hands, no matter how things are deteriorating in Bauchi State under the Bala Muhammed government, he would be treacherous, after Governor Isa Yuguda and Mohammed Abubakar heard his voice expressing his opinion if he was wrong.
The Federal Government has launched an agriculture program for food production and employment.
The Federal Government has launched the Agriculture Program for Food Production and Employment (AFGP), which is a branch of the Economic Sustainability Program.
The agricultural program was launched to reduce the embarrassment of farmers due to the coronavirus outbreak.

The minister, as reported, said the launch event represents more than 1, 100,000 small farmers across the country.
He said the total number of more than 1,100,000 smallholder farmers is in the Farmers Group, which is under 6 companies including AFEX, BabanGona, Value Seeds, Universal, Thrive Agric and Oxfam.
We will shortly declare the second group B, of those who will benefit from this agricultural program.
Nanono reminded President Muhammdu Buhari of the establishment of the Recovery and Advertising Committee from the disabilities he suffered after the coronavirus outbreak.
He said one of the country's economic recovery methods, including the AFJP's plan, was that the plan would boost agriculture from being a hand-to-hand food production facility to a modern and food-rich facility.
He said the plan consisted of a government plan to distribute up to 100,000 metric tons of food to the disadvantaged from the emergence of food shortages and hunger during the Coronavirus outbreak.
He said within a year of this massive project, it would announce employment for 5 to 10 million young people.
And it will produce about 10 million metric tons of food from 20,000 to 100, 000 in each state, for at least 2.4 million farmers.
There is a need for people to be aware of the 2019 Constitution of Justice - the KCSF.
A combination of Kano State's Kano Civil Society Forum (KCSF), in cooperation with the European Union, the British Council, and the Rule of Law and Anti-corruption (Rolac), have raised awareness about the 2019 criminal justice process.
The meeting, which took place at the Democratic Center and the expansion of Aminu Kano research in Mumbayya House, looked at the new rules and how they are governed by the community organized by 150 civilian groups in Kano and journalists.
Speaking to the Chief Prosecutor, Dr. Noah Musa Idris, of Bayero University's Department of Justice in Kano, he commented on some of the most stringent laws.
He called for a review of some of the old laws as a result of the travel and modern law.
At his altar, the chairman of the Kano State Civil Society (KCSF) Ibrahim Wayya, said the lack of awareness of the legislation had played a serious role in violating the rights of the people who needed to know how they were.
Some participants of the meeting, which is the third time that has been planned in three Senate districts in Kano, from civilian groups, explained how they viewed the legislation and its messages.
Our correspondent Aminu Halilu Tudunwada, who attended the awareness meeting, told us that the problems of some legislation that society faces were discussed.
Those who are mostly unaware of their rights against them, were the law had more than 400 laws, they made more awareness-raising statements.
The new Iberian Places Registration Act is being debated in Nigeria.
SERAP, a human rights and economic development organization called SERAP, has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to rebuke Nigerian Justice Abubakar Malami and the Executive Director of the Corporate Registration Board to suspend plans to start registering places of worship.
According to the SERAP, this step is like a violation of human rights as it is included in the Nigerian Constitution.
Before human rights groups complained about this governmental action, various religious leaders had already submitted their cries to the Buhari administration, saying that the law should be reinstated for review and approval, so that it would not collide with the religious and welfare rights granted by the national constitution.
Pastor John Buro, the chief of Christians in Kaduna State, told the American Voice representative that this law has no basis for weapons, unless the government seeks to ban worship or impose sanctions.
Simply, he should use the methods to monitor and follow all violators of the law without imposing a new law.
On his part, Dr Bashir Yankuzo, the clergyman of the University of Science in Minna, said that although there is no fault with the government monitoring companies and organizations for national security, this does not mean rigorously agreeing that the rights of neither one nor others will be revoked.
Now the only thing to be seen is whether the government will listen to this public outcry.
How the Akure University of Technology (FUTA) tried to crush the PREMIUM TIMES site on the internet.
Akure University of Technology (FUTA) has recruited an experienced adviser to websites, in order to crush the site PREMIUM TIMES, the outstanding "online" newspaper based in Nigeria.
This experience of crossing the internet has made every strategy that hackers follow on people's sites to access their sites, but it has not succeeded.
He began an investigation into interference, that is, "hacking," since February 28, where he dumped bad weapons on his university campus, and attacked him using the university's "data."
On the other hand, if he tries to penetrate the PREMIUM TIMES internet store with a computer, he again attacks his GSM phone.
Five days ago he pursued the door to the site of the Great PREMIUM TIMES, but it was unsuccessful, even though he used various modern weapons.
He did not succeed in penetrating, because the university did not know that the PREMIUM TIMES newspaper had the chips of its program, which built the foundation and the door of a spouse was not enough to break it.
Then PREMIUM has security officers on the state-of-the-art Internet site including the King of PREMIUM TIMES and the General Doctor, the PREMIUM TIMES website.
These security officers have modern skills in crushing any group of attackers or bards who seek to cheat alone, or carrying out martyrdom attempts to attack in the PREMIUM TIMES database.
The kind of weapons that Internet users have attacked PREMIUM TIMES:
At 8 a.m. he started the race by sliding the door of the Great PREMIUM TIMES, to see how he would crash into it, completely knocking down the arch.
It was unsuccessful at night, the next day and early in the morning, at 6:15 p.m. that he was lucky again, this time by using the "WPScan", which is being done to identify the strength or inadequacy of security measures for large Internet sites such as PREMIUM TIMES.
After 90 minutes, he began attempting to penetrate the power of the state-of-the-art computer script, the "custom script".
It was in the morning that he made every effort to use a computer to lock down the PREMIUM TIMES site completely.
How the Agriculture Treats the Tradition of Preparation:
This interlocutor did not know that PREMIUM TIMES had engaged in the treatment of small mice and large cities entering modern network farms to interfere with page closures or seize the site.
This lack of awareness makes all the materials he uses, generally old ones that are unable to harm or harm PREMIUM TIMES.
That day he suffered badly and was tired of attacking DDOS in the NTP's Likau Railway, which is an old road that has been used since Kano village.
It was March 3 that he made every strategy that remained in his brain and mind, but it all failed.
The attempt to break the door of the PREMIUM TIMES General House came just days after PREMIUM TIMES published news of the day-to-day dispute between President Muhammadu Buhari's Security Adviser, Babagana Monguno and former President's Palace Chief of Staff, Marigayi Abba Kyari.
Some members of the Federal University of Technology in Akure have gossiped to PREMIUM TIMES that the university has recruited a soldier to install large rats on Internet sites, in order to infect, destroy or destroy the huge PREMIUM TIMES.
However, when PREMIUM TIMES contacted the FUTA University, it distanced itself from the attempt to attack the Internet's Great PREMIUM TIMES.
The FUTA said that unless only a student at the university tried alone, not a FUTA spokesman.

Yoruba leaders have threatened to curb the 2023.
Leaders of Yoruba organizations in Nigeria have threatened to curb the country's elections for 2023, as long as their demand for a reform of the country's constitution, "Restructuring," is rejected in English.
The charities vowed in a statement issued after the meeting, saying that only the reform of the Nigerian Constitution would save the country from the most difficult situation it has faced, especially in the face of security and the economy.
The leaders who attended the joint meeting included Afenifere leader pa Reuben Fashoranti, professor Banji Akintoye chairman of the Yoruba World Congress and former governor of Ondo State Dr. Olusegun Mimiko.
The Yarbawan Association has also struggled against the lack of balance in dividing positions held by the Nigerian government, under the leadership of Muhammadu Buhari.
While the Kano State government reduced its budget for this year by about 70 billion naira due to the negative impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the state's economy, the State Parliament passed a new regulation on the management of the state government's finances.
However, local governance groups say the issue of creating a law is a simple matter, but implementing it is a challenge.
Creating a new standard for government funding based on democracy is one of the objectives of the new law in Kano State, which has been created in recent years at the federal level as well as in some Nigerian states.
The chairman of the Kano State House of Representatives, Honarabul Kabiru Hassan Dashi, told Voice that the law would give workers and the state government a theory on how to spend their money, as well as how the state would allocate its money.
The local leadership groups have now welcomed the bill, as long as it will be reviewed on a regular basis.
The director of the Organization for Community Civic Engagement in Kano State, Comrade Abdulrazak Alkali, said they hoped government officials and the state government would implement the law effectively.
But Kano State Commissioner for Finance and Economic Affairs Alhaji Shehu Na'Allah said they were well prepared to work out the bill.
The Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, signed the new law at the end of last week, and it is expected to take effect immediately.
INEC has prepared for the Edo -Professor Jacob election.
The chairman of the National Electoral Commission (INEC), Professor Mahmood Yakubu, has said that his commission is ready to hold the election of the governor of Edo State, which will be voted on September 19.
Yakubu made this encouraging statement on Thursday, during a meeting with the Electoral Affairs Committee in Benin, the capital of Edo State.
The professor said INEC had so far successfully implemented 10 of the 14 plans that were planned to be implemented in connection with the election.
Jacob added that the reason for the visit was to see what preparations had begun since before Election Day.
Of course, we are receiving all the reports of preparations going on.
Yet we find it appropriate to come upon us, so that we may see and see.
This agency has issued a schedule for how the Edo and Ondo elections will take place, since February 6, 2020.
Kenan spent nearly seven to eight months to prepare for the two elections.
Today I am delighted that we have implemented 10 of the 14 plans that INEC has planned to implement.
And no one has received an extension until it is released from the date on which it will be implemented.
The last thing is to register all of the voters in total for the 14 parties that will contest Inji Yakubu.
He said the four remaining tasks for INEC included publishing a ballot announcement to be held next Tuesday, presenting the ejan-ejan names of each party that participates in the contest, all on the same day.
Then the campaign was suspended 24 hours before the elections.
Kenan's 12 campaigns will be suspended Thursday night, before Saturday's elections.
Therefore, we should say that we have already estimated, but we are just waiting for election day.
Jacob said.
However, he predicted that the election of the governor of Edo State would be the first election that INEC would hold during the COVID-19 period.
He said the governing body had issued guidelines on how to conduct elections in these circumstances.
We tested the rules in a small poll in Nasarawa State.
And we have planned to repeat the process at this general election in Edo.
Earlier, the Edo State Electoral Commissioner, Johnson Alalibo, said there were 2,210,534 million registered voters in Edo State.
He said 1,159,325 million were men and 1,051,209 million were women.
The dispute has emerged between the United States and Chaina.
Chaina has reacted to the U.S. closure of the U.S. Embassy in Chengdu this Friday.
The Chainan Department of Foreign Affairs said it had decided as a result of the closure of its embassy in Houston, Texas, and the United States earlier this week.
Beijing has rightly warned against retaliation, as long as Washington's palace does not rush to withdraw its steps.
Thirty-five years ago, the United States opened a Chengdu office with about two hundred employees.
The relationship between the two countries has been in a difficult situation since the outbreak of the Coronavirus pandemic at the same time as they are trying to resolve the conflict, over securing trade agreements.
Atyap, Hausa-Fulani Achieve Peace Agreement Among Them.
The tribes of Atyap, Fulani and Hausa people living in the Kataf Local Government Area of Kaduna State have successfully concluded a peace meeting, to provide lasting peace in their own territory.
Participants of the meeting, who expressed their resolve and commitment to securing peace and pardoning one another, condemned the killing and endowment of property they attacked in their own territory.
They have also announced their mission to help security agencies and personal data, in order to seize any allegations they are hiding in their own territories.
The meeting also commended the government's efforts to appoint security officials in the region, as well as commended various youth groups for their commitment to embracing and distancing anything that could bring about worship in the region, including their youth's efforts to successfully establish this reconciliation agreement among themselves.
The meeting, which was held under the leadership of Agwatyap's Chief Executive, Dominic Gambo Yahaya, formed a meeting of the three nations to discuss peace.
The meeting was held at the Mariyamu and Yakubu Ebent Centre in Wakili.
The meeting was also chaired by ABM Stephen Shekari (rty) and Dr. Salim Umar, who represented the Emirate of Atyap, to settle between the communities and stop the shedding of blood and the preservation of the treasures that represent between them.
All the leaders of the three communities of Atyap, Fulani and Hausa people signed the post-conference bill, including the chief executive of Agwatyap.
In a statement after the meeting, which contained 14 positions, the residents of the Emirate of Atyap called on you and someone to take the law into their own hands, instead of crying out to the security agencies.
The meeting also highlighted the assurance that the Constitution provides for any Nigerian to live self-sufficiently in any part of the country in which he is in need, including the Emir of Atyap, without fear or showing him any threat from anyone in any way.
The meeting also called on the authorities to speed up the process of returning all refugees to their homes.
The meeting also recommended the establishment of a peacekeeping committee consisting of the tribes, Hausa, Fulani and Atyap and their youth to organize large gatherings and discuss security issues from time to time in order to safeguard peace in their empire.

Ganduje's reinstatement of the rulers fired by King Ado and Sanusi will reinstate the appointment of rulers in Kano.
Governor Abdullahi Ganduje wants the Kano State House of Representatives to amend the 2019 state law, so that it will ensure the appointment of two major rulers of the Emir of Kano dismissed by the late King Ado Bayero and King Sanusi, so that state law would confirm their appointment as chief rulers appointing King in Kano.
Kano Assembly Speaker Abdullahi Gafasa read Ganduje's request in front of the Congress hall, and they are expected to discuss the matter before the end of July.
The people who were returned to the Emirate of Kano are Aminu Babba Son of Agundi and, who made King Dawaki Mai Tuta and Ciroman Kano, Sanusi Ado-Bayero.
The two were removed by King Ado and King Muhammad Sanusi on charges of conspiracy.
The Chief Apostle challenged his impeachment in court.
The trial has been revoked for 17 years and the Supreme Court has ruled that it has been revoked.
Ganduje also wants to restore his sovereignty, and in amending the law he is one of the appointees of the Emir of Kano.
Ado Bayero removed Agundi in 2003 after he was convicted of conspiracy and political crimes.
A committee was set up to investigate him, but he was invited to refuse to go before a committee to defend himself.
He then challenged his removal from the Kano State High Court to the Supreme Court.
Before the Supreme Court, the Federal Court of Appeal ruled that Aminu Babba be returned to his seat.
But the Emir of Kano, under the rule of Muhamamdu Sanunmsi II, has appealed, with the Supreme Court reaffirming his removal as Eastern Lawyer and King of Dawaki on June 5.

NAPTIP seized the transports and rescued 71 people in Kano State.
The National Commission on Human Rights (NAPTIP), the Kano State branch, has arrested three detainees and rescued 71 people in the state.
The Kano State Commissioner Shehu Umar made the announcement on Friday in a meeting with the Nigerian Freight Company.
He said the agency struck the transports after it obtained Siri information on transporting people in the state.
For this reason, the agency hunted these people from July 15 to 19, where they were successfully seized.
Among the three victims of two Cameroonians are one Nigerian and all of them are less than 21 to 36.
These people were arrested while en route to Algeria, Morocco and Libya.
After that, 18 of the 71 people to be transported from Cameroon were 14 men, 4 women.
The remaining 19 people are from Nigeria, 11 men, 8 women and 8 children from Kano State.

Efforts, Struggles and Self-Determination are at the heart of - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
In Longyuan, Hongsipu, Wuzhong, Ningxia State, by the independent Hui tribe, in northwestern China.
There is a committed woman named Li Yaomei or Sadiya (that is, her Islamic name) who is famous for her struggle in life and her efforts to escape poverty.
Her story tells us that effort, determination and self-sufficiency are in the heart.
First of all, Li Yaomei or Sadiya, never lived in class intending to take lessons, so she was unable to read text.
However, God gave her a wealth of insight, intelligence and wisdom, so that she was an example in the area of war and poverty.
About 20 years ago, Ms. Li Yaomei, suffered from stomach cancer, where she underwent surgery up to 3 times.
After her recovery, she encountered a terrible accident, and now she is walking with a metal strap in her foot.
These challenges have thrown her into trouble in addition to her health, as well as the issue of medical expenses, why she received a loan of about 3 hundred thousand yuan, equivalent to more than 16 million naira.
Surprisingly, the challenge faced by Ms. Sadiya made it possible for her to choose and insult her in order to see her improve her life.
She was encouraged by the Chinese government's support.
Its practice is to broom different species based on the use of weeds.
Because of her efforts, her profession has grown significantly, with various workers ordering nurses.
In addition, she has created a number of machines that help her simplify the work.
For example, it takes 15 minutes to connect a large broom, but now in this time, it will connect 5 stones.
In addition, it has provided additional machines to clean the weeds it turns into brooms.
Then there are additional machines that clean animal feed for women, and these machines are still sold to applicants.
Given the challenges that Ms. Sadiya has faced, and the efforts she is still making to improve her life and that of her staff, it will be understood that the applicant must accompany it.
The work of fighting poverty and improving life is not the only thing that hangs on the government.
If the government is to provide support, but people are not motivated or interested in improving their lives by seeking jobs based on their situation, then only day after day will it continue without achieving a goal.
Her story shows that running a profession or income project does not require any fundraising or travel to other cities or overseas.
Because she took into account her situation, she used the resources available in her environment to improve her life.
Furthermore, teacher Sadiya carried out these tasks by standing by her feet without relying on her husband to run away from her.
That is to say, efforts, determination and self-sufficiency are in the heart.
He then showed women the strength to change their lives and stand by their unity without asking for anyone's help.
This is also a lesson that shows that whatever one does, one should stop at one's feet, so that one's trust is uncertain.
Of course, Ms. Sadiya was committed, intelligent and capable of being an example and a role model for the general public.
Again, until March of this year, Malama Sadiya completed the payment of all debts owed, and suspended the acceptance of subsidies from the government on her own behalf.

There is a Reason for U.S. Politics to Improve COVID-19 Cancellation Efforts - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
In recent days, World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has expressed concern over measures other countries are taking to preserve the COVID-19 vaccine that is expected to be produced, stating that priority must be avoided for communities of different countries, while vaccines are being distributed.
And the injection should be distributed in an appropriate way around the world, as it will be suitable for the great benefit of different countries.
Indeed, some U.S. politicians are implementing a policy of prioritizing self-sufficiency, distributing vaccines, and undermining national and international cooperation in the fight against the epidemic.
Meanwhile, the total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 around the world has already reached 23 million.
In addition, there are people who have lost their lives as a result of the disease that has reached more than 800 thousand.
Under such severe circumstances, more attention is being paid to the effectiveness of the vaccine, and fortunately, in recent days, there have been great results in the study of the vaccine in some countries, which has generated hope, and faith in the dignity of the people of the world as a whole.
But sadly, some U.S. politicians have expressed a desire to seize the injection.
Even the journal "Science" clarified that the U.S. government has already scrapped COVID-19 vaccine purchasing agreements worth more than $6 billion, from several pharmaceutical companies.
Although the US government's objective is understood to be to be at the forefront of the spread of the disease, other developing countries are also in need of injections, considering that they are more likely to suffer from shortage of health resources.
The Ecologist magazine also pointed out that if the United States achieves the goal of producing a vaccine, the number of injections to be produced in developing countries will decrease.
Mr. John Nkengasong, the director general of the African Center for Disease Control (CDC), also expressed concern over the issue.
As some analysts on daily matters have explained, even if the vaccine has been successfully produced, it is not possible to achieve the goal of preventing the disease, but how to divide the vaccine, which is an important issue for the international community.
And it is appropriate for countries around the world to strengthen the cooperation between them.
Tedros, the Director General of the WHO, also pointed out that if the disease is to be seen after, it must be stopped from all sectors around the world, it is not possible for some parts of the world, or a few countries to achieve the goal of recovery from the effects of the epidemic alone.

The chiefs of the Buhari administration who accompanied the body of Abba Kyari cemetery have been sent to court.
A Nigerian celebrity advocate has told all the chiefs of President Muhammadu Buhari's government who accompanied the body of Abba Kyari cemetery.
Kyari, the Chief of Staff of the Presidential Palace, was buried in Makabartar Gudu, Abuja, on April 18, after he died of coronavirus.
Prosecutor Tope Akinyade appealed to Legislators in Kado, Abuja, where he asked the court to prosecute them for breaking the law on quarantining people at home imposed by the federal government at the time.
He said there is a serious injustice to Nigerians who have been arrested and punished during mandatory stay at home, but also for a group of people breaking the law, none of them have been punished.
He said that as long as the Buhari administration is screaming for justice, he does not see why ordinary people are being arrested if they violate the Korona law.
They and a group of government bodies broke the law but were allowed.
Among Tope's court cases are Federal Secretary of State, Boss Mustapha, Minister of Transport, Hadi Sirika, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey,ama, Minister of Humanitarian Affairs and Humanitarian Affairs, Sadiya Umar.
There is also a spokesperson for the Presidential Palace, Garba Shehu, a media officer for social media, Bashir Ahmed, President Buhari's Adviser on Security Affairs, Babagana Monguno, Inspector General of Celebrity Police, Mohammed Adamu and many other government chiefs.
Attorney Celestine Odo sought to show that the plaintiff had made a mistake since the plaintiffs did not sign their petition.
However, Tope reminded the Attorney that he had brought a lawsuit directly to the court and did not follow up on it by the police.
He said it was the judge's duty to send a summons to all those who are being sued to sign it.
It was because he did what the Nigerian law granted him the right to file a case in court.
The judge insisted on hearing the case and asked it to return to court on August 4, in order to continue listening.

We Must Return to the Truth to Be Healthy in Nigeria.

After completion, the foundation for the construction of a twenty-five-bedroom for women and children, which will be built by a businessman at the main hospital in the town of Katsina, who is the chairman of the meeting.
Tsohan, the chairman of the International Court of Appeal, added that the reconciliation with the instigator should not be carried out.

Walin Hausa went on to say that the whole world refuses to lead to victory, should be reconciled with them, by improving the lives of herdsmen, that is, by providing them with pasture facilities, schools, drinking water and health facilities.
Since the Ministry of Animal Welfare exists in the northern province, and every year the government at all levels only spends money on farmers, but as shepherds apart from them, reform and justice must come, and lasting peace will be achieved.
But this war will not give birth to the country with the Son of the Eye, because all of them are members of the country, reconciliation is the right way.
To do it and with good intentions, peace will be achieved.
We are not affected by this alone.
Our children and grandchildren will live in the future, this is a big problem.
In this world, there is no battle with a gun that is finished with a gun and it is reconciled at the table.
Security experts say that terrorists are not reconciled, this is a false suggestion, because even if America, which says it does not reconcile with terrorists, is not their own terrorists, it is the people of another country who attack them.
We are also the gunmen of our country, but they will not be reconciled.

Whom we expect before our work takes place, we will try to bring the rest of the products we need.
In addition, Gadaka said, "On the other hand, we urge the Yobe government to give us more equipment, trucks and vehicles that we will use to carry out our work easily, especially to transport our staff to the office so as to avoid coming late, when we start working at low cost".
He also said that in the current situation, the company has sent 25 young people to get training on how to operate machines and devices as well as manage the products that the company uses in its operations and how to engage with the businesses and the people they interact with.
Finally, he said the company has now begun producing various colourful medals, including 100kg, 50kg and 25kg as well as offering retailers based on the colour and condition of their bags, the company is ready to satisfy them.
