The main reason why I was outstanding is the ruling PDP in Bauchi state.
Everyone knows what role I played in the election of the governor of the state, which the former minister of Abuja, Bala Mohammed, beat the governor, Mohammed Abubakar.
But now I am the transmitter and charger in the Bala government.
Instead of continuing to live in the PDP, I was asked to avoid going to the place, going back to where I came from.
The governor of Bauchi state, Bogoro C, has said that he will not be allowed to leave the PDP.
Finally, he said as he advised other governors where they failed and where they would repair earlier, he and Bala were not anointed with oil.
For me to walk and let them.

The National Food and Drug Administration (NAFDAC) has stated that it is testing up to 40 corona healing drugs handed over to the agency by traditional drug makers.
The chairman of the Mojisola Adeyeye Commission announced this on Tuesday in Abuja.
Mojisola said the efficacy of the drugs is being tested so that it does not seek obesity to get compensated.
Since the emergence of the coronavirus pandemic, traditional drug makers have splashed out research to see they are also not left behind in seeing the vaccine being included.
Many of them have handed over their medicine to the authorities in order to test and assess its efficacy.
The NAFDAC also established a number of criteria and rules to follow in combining the drug.
The quality of the drugs will be tested in animals for the first time yet.
Mojisola warned the drugmakers not to be tempted to add a drug without the agency giving the opportunity.
In May, the NAFDAC stated that in social media and newspaper pages only news of claimants that they have discovered traditional medicines that will cure the coronavirus pandemic is seen.
Adeyeye said that even one person contacted the NAFDAC to look at the efficacy of the drug he claimed to include traditional, saying it could cure the coronavirus.

FG To Restructure FG's Plan To Restructure FG's Plan - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
In a statement issued tuesday by the APC, the governor of Niger State, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, accused the party of attempting to bring violence into the party.
The document, signed by the Chairman of the Party of Engineers, Muhammad Jibrin Imam and the Secretary of the Barista Muhammed Liman Party, stated that over the six years the party has ruled the state, only Naira 512 million has received.
The paper continues to say that the meeting called by the governor of stakeholders, which he led on Sunday night last weekend, will help to continue the crisis in the party, saying they have written to the secretary of the national party about the developments in the state.
According to Imam Khomeini(r.a.) " We understand that the Governor of Niger State has tried to distribute the heads of the party by arranging an illegal stakeholders' meeting, in order to make any complaint against the party leaders, to write to the secretariat of the party to investigate.
He said that so far in the six years of the party's founding, N512 million is in the party's account.
He said that what he understood as the governor was being on the National Records Committee, which was established July 25, 2020, led by the president to lead the planning of the problems between the party's leaders and withdraw the court's decisions between the party's leaders.
He said that we pay the salaries of the party's secretariat staff, as well as other activities related to the party, the election and the adjustment of other union problems such as health care support due to the lack of government funding, not an illegal cost of the party, we challenge everyone to justify the dishonesty of the party's funds.
As I said, the previous state election was the most important election in the country, which we have held with the former commissioners and commissioners who are now holding power in all twenty-five local government areas of the state, whose funds have been distributed to the committees to bring their members.
Therefore, it is a mistake for each person to say that the funds of the party are being spent illegally, this is almost unjust and try to protect the bad ones to try to hang it, saying it is not a committee that has been formed to investigate how to spend the money of the party and which has established it.
Among the funds that the complainant said were alleged to have been misused, are the funds provided by the secretary of the national association, and idolise other funds such as this, so I challenge everyone on this issue to testify to him in any way.
Imam Khomeini (r.a.) said that we stand firm against the protection of the APC from the movement of any party or organization from the deception of the party, adding that any accusations against the party or any other party leader from the state level will be written by the party's board, as stated in section 21 (B) (bi), (d) on page 82 of the party system.
So party stakeholders have no role especially if they attempt to grab the power of the committee so their decision has no impact.
For this reason, they are the effective leaders of the party that you have approved in the state, in the 21st and sixth paragraphs on page 87 of the party's constitution, and anything that is contrary to this will not be used.
Because the decision of despair and the leaders of their grip is a mistake.
He said that those who presented with approval at yesterday's meeting, which was not promoted by Alhaji Abubakar Magaji, General Muhammed Garba, and Hon. Ahmed Dogonkoli, including Alhaji Ibrahim Balarabe and all committees, were not members of the party's election committee in the state.
Only the chairman of the party, Injiniya Mohammed Imam, will lead the governor to not lead the heads of the state party.
The governor, Abubakar Sani Bello, has said that the issue of fulfilling the promise that the people of the state should be promised during the elections, and traveling with the parents of the party in the government so that everyone can benefit from the state and all its activities through political appointments, which is the problem of the governor and the party.
The document commended the members of the federal parliament who refused to attend the meeting and focused on reconciling all the problems between the members of the party. This is not surprising to the leaders of the parliament who know their own pain, who refuse to accept falsehood as the law of the party.
Therefore, there is a need for the president of the National Committee to attract Governor Abubakar Sani Bello to the appropriate position not to attempt to corrupt the politics of the state.

How food inhibition is harmful to people's health in Nigeria.
Some scientists have warned people to avoid eating foods that have been used to prevent food damage that eating such foods harm human health.

The results of the study show that there are some foods that are poured into chemicals to prevent them from rubbing.
The study also showed that this chemical is most commonly used in beans, a wallet town and busasshhen fish that are said to be available to the public.
The substance is used because if a person sees it, he will be interested in buying and using it.
Then eating foods containing this chemical causes cancer, kidney disease, cardiovascular disease and others.
The people of the country have been called on to focus on safeguarding the use of these food products for their health.
In a statement issued by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has called on The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).
Olasumbo said that The Chemical Calcium Carbide is the most commonly used marketplace for grinding crude trees, that is, vegetables.
Research shows that short patience and greed are among the factors that make marketers use this substance because in one day it shows trees.
Olasumbo said that another thing that market leaders fail to understand is the use of this substance to show the desired materials to harm people's health.
For this reason, there are diseases including vomiting and diarrhea, eye pain, stomach gyambon, throat cancer, mouth, liver and others.
The president of the African Development Bank has been washed away from criticism - Freedom Radio Nigeria.
The board of experts led by former Irish Prime Minister Mary Robinson has washed the head of the African Development Bank AfDB Akinwumi Adesina.
According to the committee, Mr Akinwumi Adesina is not guilty of corruption charges.
According to AFP, earlier this year, a fifteen-page report accused sixty-year-old Mr. Adesina of prioritizing the inability to govern and prosper himself.
However, the panel of experts led by Robinson along with Gambia's Chief Justice Hassan Jallow and the deputy chairman of the World Bank's executive director, Leonard McCarthy, has washed the former Nigerian agriculture minister out of all allegations against him.
In the past, the United States insisted on the necessity of investigating Mr. Adesina on the charges, following the washing of the AfDB's board of directors, which led to the establishment of an expert committee to investigate the proposals.

Food is the spirit of the life of all creatures, cannot live compulsory except with food.
This is why Chinese rulers are making more determination to ensure the prosperity of the people of the country with food.
In the 71 years since the foundation of the People's Republic of China, the country has achieved great achievements in food supply and has given the world a surprise to look at the population of the country, which according to estimates shows the number of Chinese people has exceeded 1.4 billion.
This effort has helped greatly the cause of China's huge contribution to the elimination of hunger in the world, as the president of the Chinese Government, Zhang Wufeng, has said that since 1949 until now, China has always put the issue of tackling hunger in front of all the activities of the country' affairs.
But in recent days, some people and other Western media have again "expressed concern" over the issue of whether China can raise its nation itself in the shadow of the COVID-19 respiratory outbreak worldwide?
We thank them for their constant lying in charge of the Chinese presence in this world.
Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the country has managed to produce enough food based on its male efforts.
The issue of providing Chinese food is one of the main agendas of the ruling JKS party on a daily basis.
Last week, the Secretary-General of the JKS, Xi Jinping, issued an important order to stop food shortages, pointing out that everyone knows that all food and labor are available.
Although this year the impact of the world's COVID-19 respiratory disease is also affecting the Chinese economy, China can provide enough food for its people.
According to a report by the Chinese Bureau of Statistics on the number of agricultural products, especially rice produced by the country in 2020, the number of rice produced in the country in the first quarter of 2020 reached 27.29 million tons, an increase of 1.08 million tons, that is to increase by 3.9% compared to the same period of 2019.
Ke Bingsheng, former president of the Chinese Agricultural University, said That China has achieved great achievements in the face of the country's riches and food compared to the early stages of implementing the concept of making changes at home and opening doors to foreign countries.
Huang Jikun, director of the Peking University's China Agricultural Policy Research Center, stated during a meeting with the representative of the newspaper "The China Science Daily", according to the severe challenges China faces now is in the next 2 or three years, whether China can reduce the amount of wheat and rice stored in grain storerooms.
Now the number of grains each received reaches 474 kilograms instead of 400 kilograms that every international person should get every year.
And now China has to install some farm products millions of tons to raise domestic animals only.
Therefore, those who are concerned about the issue should calm their minds, bathe and go to sleep, or focus their attention on the affairs of their country.
The Chinese can raise themselves with the food they produce themselves.

Abi qualificationonly, a wancakalar and system pick-up in 2023.
President Muhammadu Buhari, Mamman Daura, has said that the ruling party has become the old esteem.
Mamman Daura said Nigeria has already been in the valley that has now dispersed the pick-up process in the 2023 presidential election.
BBC Hausa has published an interview with Mamman Daura, in which he explained this.
This process of pick-up in the presidential election in Nigeria has not resulted in an eye-catching son that has been started since 1999.
Instead, Daura said that it is necessary to pay attention to the qualifications and not to follow the acceptance process.
Inyamirai, the Igbo leaders of the Igbo community, reacted to Daura's comments.
He said that he and his cousin, President Buhari, had been in charge of the ruling party by accepting it and would now say that he recommended not to follow it in 2023.
Buhari himself is not more than all Nigerians were elected.
Similarly, the chief security officers of the country who have been sitting in their seats for many years have not been removed, and they are not more active than others.
Inyamirai's response.
Ndigbo, a former governor of Nigeria, has said that he will not be able to do so in the next few weeks. He said that he will not be able to do so in the next few weeks.
In a statement issued by Daura, who is a cousin of President Muhammdu Buhari, said that the presidential election will be held in 2023.
On the other hand, since his words did not complete the spread of social media, Ndigbo hastened to issue a statement to Mamman Daura, calling it a disgusting kiss.
In a statement issued by Ndigbo on Wednesday, the Igbo group will be formed in the South Region, and in the south of The South-East, they will be allowed to run for president in 2023, igbo.
The spokesperson for igbo group Zalla, Emeka Attamah, said Mamman Daura's words are like the leadership of Nigeria in 2023.
What is meant by Sidratul-Muntaha that the Quran has mentioned?
They have dismissed Jonathan, and now Daura has ruled the south region in 2023.
He will come to us with a point that we do not know about in 2023.
He should do as a set of elder to embrace the truth to hold her well.
It is not that he has made a speech of the presidency in 2023, and that I am willing to express myself.
VOA's Interview Hall on Rape.
The issue of sexual abuse of women and children by rape has become common in northern Nigeria, where there have been reports showing how children are being abused for their rights.
People from many areas attended the hall on July 23 to discuss the worsening situation in the country and how it should be overcome.
Participants of the hall attributed the problem to things such as advertising for women's children and the neglect of other parents.
One of the mothers who attended the meeting of Hajiya Fathi'a Sha'ibu, the wife of the former governor of Plateau and Niger state in the reign of the late Sani Abacha, described poverty as one of the factors that made parents wear advertising for their children.
In a statement issued by the Federal High Court in Abuja, the Federal High Court in Abuja has ordered the Federal High Court sitting in Abuja to investigate the case of the Federal High Court sitting in Abuja.
We will also call on Teachers to start preaching loudly to parents and siblings who rape their children and their children.
The governor of Kebbi State, Koko and Besse, Honorable Shehu Mohammad, has expressed frustration with the issue and support for the insertion of a strict law to punish anyone arrested for rape in the country.
From the end of Hajiya Medina David and Nasiru El-hikaya who led the meeting expressed gratitude to those who attended the meeting on behalf of VOA who accepted their invitation.
The Contribution of 'Arewa Media Writers' to the North's Partnership.
Social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram, Bakandamiya and others have long played a role in creating options for discussion, cooperation and fellowship among different nations of the world, with the delivery of messages, stories, and the spread of political, educational and business policies.
Young people in Nigeria have entered this new technology using social media, in order to travel in the modern era, to contribute or spite them in their lives.
We can say that these options have brought us a lot of progress that the North's youth benefit from in business, economy, education and regional politics.
Many others eat by writing and delivering messages on the Internet, obtaining jobs or developing their services.
It is disappointing to see how some youth instead of using this opportunity to benefit from the progress that has been made, some who follow the corrupt children of the southern part of the country who have been outstanding in the world in the interest of the public, in and outside the country, or in writing about the corruption and abuse of rulers and predecessors.
What is indicative of the lack of civilization is the progress of the youth of the country.
The arrival of Arewa Media Writers in the country is a great achievement, in order to provide the youth of the North with a positive view, a good goal and to clean up the interests of the youth in Soshiyal Midaya, so that they can write meaningfully and promote the goals of the North.
It is necessary to give this organization the cooperation it needs, in order to achieve its good goals, that will bring benefits not only to our North region, but also to Nigeria as a whole.
I advise our youth, especially social media users, to come together to protect the integrity of the North and its sovereignty, and to create a system that will be transformative for all.
As our North leaders, such as Sardaunan Sakkwato, the first North Premier Sir Ahmadu Bello, and his close allies, have reached out to the North.
It has been reported that the late governor of Kano state, Malam Aminu Kano, has said that Nigeria is one country, but everyone knows his father's house!
Therefore, we say, surely when we call for the development of the country and the improvement of the governing body, in every step, we call for the unity of the North, without religious or ethnic prejudice, to bring our region to progress.
Considering how the North is now.
Therefore, we should use the insights that God has given us to contribute and negotiate, in order to provide the North with a sustainable way to revive its economy.
The North should provide revenue sources to implement its budget without waiting for the federal government to spend money.
In addition, if we want to advance the North, we will be important for education, agriculture, tourism, health and science and technology.
Not lai but with money we will contribute, there are different ways to do so.
We think that the North will fulfill our predecessors' goal!
The North is proud of us.
The government has set up N126 billion to repair the hospitals of the country.

Hospitals to be renovated include FMC hospital, infectious disease testing facilities, emergency care department, quarantined department symptomatic patients who do not want other people to be infected, and teaching hospitals in 36 states in the country.
In the past year, some health professionals called on government departments to cooperate in isolating adequate funding to improve the health of the country.
The experts made this call at the meeting on providing good health care to people in Abuja.
In his speech, the senator representing Kwara North under the leadership of the APC, Sadiq Umar, said the Nigerian government should take the issues of improving the health of the country seriously.
He said that the lack of doing so has caused the area to suffer from lack of funding, which is why it is often relying on foreign support.
Umar said that despite these supports, the government has no role in health care, so they have begun to withdraw their support.

He added that the decision will reduce the number of cases of rape that can be easily achieved, but the main ease is to repair our hearts.
Alhaji Aliyu Maigida said that in our opinion of Muslims, we should give Allah our Prophet to stand up and strengthen our hearts, because one always does not know how to die.
He said it is shameful to say that he had been raped by a man or an elderly girl in a three-month-old girl, three or five years old.
He reiterated that by Allah, we will not be insulting leaders, or rulers of the country, pointing out that there is no way to make progress if such a declaration is made.
He added that we are in the midst of difficulty in the country, because the country has refused to progress, and Sarauna, Gomfarononi and the president have lost their way to the issue.
He added that they had dined that barracks and the moon had launched, so it was necessary to correct our hearts so that God could bring us solutions to the issue of rape.
He announced that even if they are doing for idols, everything should be falling to Allah because it is spreading all sadness and poverty to the nation.
According to him, all the attitudes that a person enters, Allah knows you not what you will do, but istingifari and menstruation, and you always think you will die and always think about you back, and if you have been given what you have born.
He pointed out that the police are also doing their best because they are sending such rape suspects to The Federal High Court and The Federal High Court in Abuja to try this thing as a tragedy, in our northern region of Nigeria and in the country.
He called on parents to keep a close eye on their children, and he set an example of the sales that women's parents impose on them to increase the problem.
He said that some parents do not follow their children's lives whether they go to school or do not go to school or return home on time or not, adding that the fault is part of the neglect of other parents because they should know that God has given them the children and tomorrow he will ask them what kind of education they have given their children.

According to the SERAP, this action is like a violation of human rights as contained in the Nigerian Constitution.
Before human rights organizations complain about this government action, already different religious leaders have also presented their complaints to the Buhari administration, according to the repeal of the Sanhedrin of the House of Representatives in order to review and approve it, so that it will not clash with the sanctuary of the national constitution.
Pastor Yohanna Buro, the head of Christians in Kaduna state, told the U.S. Representative that this law is not based on blindness, except if the government seeks to prevent godly devotion or sanctions.
He should only use the methods by monitoring and tracking all criminals without wearing a new law.
On the other hand, Dr Bashir Yankuzo, the clergyman of the University of Science in Minna, said that although there is no fault the government has monitored companies and organizations for national security, this does not mean strict compliance will be imposed on someone not or others.
Now the waiting thing to see is whether the government will listen to this public complaint.
How the Akure University of Technology (FUTA) tried to kneel down the PREMIUM TIMES page on the internet.
The Akure University of Technology (FUTA) has sponsored an initiative to make websites accessible, in order to kneel down on PREMIUM TIMES, the most popular "online" newspaper in Nigeria.
This internet crossing has done every trick that interferents on people's sites follow to enter their sites, but it has not succeeded.
He began to be tempted to enter the university, namely "hacking" since February 28, where he was attacked by his weapons on campus, and he was attacking him by using the university's "data."
On the other hand, if he tries to penetrate PREMIUM TIMES' internet hard drive and computer, he again attacks his GSM phone.
The five-day cur has spent a lot of time entering the PREMIUM TIMES main site, but he has not succeeded, despite the fact that he has used various advanced technology weapons.
He did not succeed in interfering, because the university did not know that PREMIUM TIMES had a copy of its program, which built a short and short door that was not enough to smash it.
Premium also has a large number of security officials on the site of the modern Internet Giants, including THE KING OF PREMIUM TIMES and the Great Dakare, PREMIUM TIMES Website Shield.
These security officials who have modern experience in crushing any group of multiple or other bardens who seek to fight alone, or to martyrdom- try to escape in premium TIMES databases.
BY ISAIAH BENJAMIN, Abuja The Federal High Court in Abuja has ordered the Federal High Court sitting in Abuja to investigate the case of the Federal High Court sitting in Abuja.
8 a.m. he started to ride the sliding door of premium TIMES, in order to see how he would make a suicide bomb erupt in it, completely rusting the booth.
If he had not succeeded in the night, the next day and early morning, 6:15 pm he was tempted again, this time by using "WPScan", which is being done to detect the power or lack of security measures of many Internet sites such as PREMIUM TIMES.
It was 90 minutes later that he began to attempt to interfere with the technology strategy of the "custom script".
In the morning, he made every effort to make it through a computer device to lock the PREMIUM TIMES page completely.
How a Farmer Deals With Biri's Misfortune:
This interference provider does not know that PREMIUM TIMES has committed to the treatment of small mice and large mice entering the farms of modern networking sites to close the page or grab the sukutum site.
This lack of knowledge makes all the hardware he uses, generally old similarities that are not able to do PREMIUM TIMES any harm or harm.
On that day, he suffered invasion in order to follow through on the attack by DDOS in the NTP Likau Rayar, which is an old way that has been used since Kano of the village.
It was March 3 that he performed all the strategies that remained in his brain and mind, but all did not succeed.
The attempt to break the door of premium TIMES came just days after PREMIUM TIMES published the news of the meeting between President Muhammadu Buhari's advisor in security, Babagana Monguno and the former President of the House of Representatives, Abba Kyari.
Some members of the Federal University of Technology in Akure have gossiped to PREMIUM TIMES that the university has adopted a soldier-hired some large rats that have been installed on Internet sites, in order to make a page with PREMIUM TIMES, to destroy or deceive him.
However, when PREMIUM TIMES contacted the FUTA University, she distanced herself from this attempt to reach the PREMIUM TIMES Internet.
FUTA said that unless only a distinguished student at the university tried it alone, not the FUTA spokesman.

In longyuan village of Hongsipu, Wuzhong, Ningxia, an independent Hui tribe, located in the northwestern chinese region.
Li Yaomei or Sadiya (that is to say, her Islamic name) is famous for her struggle in life and her success on the basis of her efforts to get out of poverty.
Her story tells us that, effort and commitment and self-search, is something that is in the heart.
First of all, she was Li Yaomei or Sadiya, she never lived in class with the intention of taking a lesson, which was why she could not read bare text.
Allah has bestowed upon her the gift of insight, fertility and abundant wisdom, where she is an example in the field of war and poverty.
About 20 years ago, Madam Li Yaomei, suffered from stomach cancer, where she was taken to have surgery on her stomach up to 3 times.
After her recovery, she encountered a terrible accident, now walking with an iron placed in her foot.
These challenges she faced have thrown her into a difficult situation in addition to health, even with the issue of treatment, why she received a loan of about 3 thousand yuan, equivalent to more than 16 million Naira.
Amazingly, this challenge faced by Malama Sadiya slips through a psalm of abusive speech in order to see her improve her life.
Then the grant summoned by the Chinese government, increased her cognitive skills.
Its profession is to make different kinds of plants based on the use of weeds.
Because of her male efforts, her profession has flourished greatly, where different ministries give her a prediction order.
In addition, she has created several machines that help her facilitate the project.
For example, it takes 15 minutes to connect one major projection, but now in this time, it will connect the projections until 5.
In addition, she produced some additional machines that clean the weeds that restore the stripes.
Then there is an additional machine that cleans her animal feed, and now it is still selling these machines to applicants.
Given the challenges that Malama Sadiya has faced, and the efforts she is still making to improve her life and that of her staff, it will be understood that the applicant must have been with the receipt.
The work of fighting poverty and improving life is not something that hangs kacokan on the government.
If the government is to provide support, but people do not have the desire to improve their lives by seeking their own jobs based on their situation, then only the future will be achieved without a goal.
Her article shows that running a profession or income project does not require other expenses or trips to other cities or countries.
In order to consider her situation, she used the resources available in her environment to improve her life.
In addition, Sadiya's teacher conducted these activities on the basis of standing by her foot without relying on her husband, in order to flee and leave her.
That is to say, self-sacrificing efforts are in the heart.
Then he showed the courage of women to change their lives and stand by their foot without seeking the help of someone else.
This is also a lesson that shows that whatever a person should do, he should stand by his foot, because relying on someone is uncertain.
Of course Malama Sadiya was a jittery, smart and hazardous person who was an example and a role model for the rest of the population.
Also, by March of the year, Malama Sadiya completed the payment of all the debts she was owed, and stopped receiving support from the government on the basis of her self-confidence.

FG To Restructure FG's Plan To Restructure COVID-19 - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
In recent days, THE World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus expressed concern over the measures taken by other countries, preserving the hoped-for COVID-19 respiratory vaccine, saying that priority must be avoided on different nations, while sharing the epidemic vaccine.
And the injection should be shared in a proper way across the world, because it will be suitable for the great benefit of different countries.
In fact, some U.S. politicians are implementing the goal of prioritizing their own benefit, sharing the vaccine, and undermining international cooperation in the fight against the epidemic.
Currently, the total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 across the world has already exceeded 23 million.
In the number also, there are people who have lost their lives as a result of the disease that has reached more than 800 thousand.
Under such severe circumstances, the impact of the vaccine is increasingly being focused on, and the happiness is that in recent days, there have been great results in the study of vaccines in other countries, the issue that has produced hope, and faith in the glory of all nations of the world.
But sadly, some American politicians have shown the goal of seizing the injection.
Even the journal "Science" stated that the U.S. government has already approved agreements to purchase COVID-19 vaccines worth more than $6 billion, from several pharmaceutical companies.
Despite the fact that the u.S. government's policy is understood, the U.S. is at the forefront of the spread of the disease, but other developing countries also need to inject pilots, looking at the fact that they are more likely to suffer from shortages of health resources.
The magazine "The Ecologist" also pointed out that, if the United States achieves the goal of carrying out vaccines to be produced, the number of vaccines to be produced by developing countries will decrease.
The Director-General of the African Disease Control Center CDC, Mr. John Nkengasong, also expressed concern over this issue.
As some commentators on daily matters have explained, even if the vaccine has been successfully produced, it is not possible to achieve the goal of seeing after the disease, but to set out how to share the vaccine, which is a very important issue for the international community.
And it is appropriate for countries in the world to strengthen their cooperation.
WHO Director-General Tedros also pointed out that, if it is to be seen after the disease, it must be prevented from all aspects across the world, it is not possible for some parts of the world, or few other countries to achieve rehabilitation goals from the impact of the epidemic alone.
