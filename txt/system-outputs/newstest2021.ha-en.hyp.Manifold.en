Why I left the PDP.
Former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, has explained some reasons why he left the PDP and returned to APC.
Never miss important updates! The former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, has joined the PDP this week.
Dogara said he stood up for the humiliation of Governor Bala of Bauchi State in which he helped the end win the 2019 election, adding that he had gathered from the party and returned to the APC.
The main reason I stand out is that the PDP is ruling in Bauchi State.
Everyone knows what role I played in the election of the state governor, whom the former minister of Abuja, Bala Mohammed, beat the defeated governor, Mohammed Abubakar.
But now Nine is watered down and pained in the Disaster government.
Instead of continuing to live in the PDP, I would like to avoid going back to my destination.
Dogara wrote a letter from the PDP that sent to the party's chairman, Bogoro C, Bauchi State.
Finally, he said that as he advised other governors where they failed and where they would be reformed in the past, he was not anointed by Bala.
Termite me to let them.
Firefighters set off at a house in Kano.
The gobarar rose at about 10 p.m., which spent almost two hours eating, despite officials from Kano State firefighters, security forces and the community reaching the scene.
During Freedom Radio's visit, she found the public in dimuwa and various security officers there, being the site connected to the truck station's most widely known Kuka Station, which passengers are being transported from Kano to other states and neighboring countries.
In addition to the Kofar Ruwa market which has been outstanding in Northern Nigeria.
Freedom Radio has been criticised by some eyewitnesses and eyewitnesses, who say the violence has resulted in the escape of life among the people.
A truck driver at the Kofar Ruwa station said they cooperated with patrol officers to flee the passengers who were in panic due to the gobarar.
The Kano State firefighters confirmed the incident, where it said that by the time we included this report it continued to collect information to identify the disruption and loss caused by the gobarar, according to Sa'idu Muhammad Ibrahim.
On the other hand, reports say there have been a number of batants who have been trying to disperse into the water market for theft, but police officers and sinturi officers have tried to dismantle them and protect the property of the community.
On the other hand, we contacted Kano State Police spokesman DSP Abdullahi Haruna Kiyawa, who confirmed the incident.
Coronavirus vaccine: We have not yet finished testing the quality of the vaccine included in Nigeria.
While European countries continue to perform tests for the quality of the coronavirus vaccine that includes, Nigeria has not previously been allowed to include testing its own drugs.
The National Food and Drug Administration (NAFDAC) has announced that it is testing positive for coronavirus treatments for up to 40 traditional Chinese medicine makers to extend the commission.
Mojisola Adeyeye, the chairman of the commission, announced this Tuesday in Abuja.
Mojisola said the efficacy of drugs is being tested so that obesity should not be compensated.
Since the disappearance of the coronavirus pandemic, traditional therapists have fantsama research to see that they have not previously been allowed to see the vaccine included.
Many of them have handed over their white medicine to the authorities for testing and assessing its efficacy.
Also, NAFDAC has set certain criteria and rules to follow in combining the medicine.
The efficacy of drugs will be performed in animals for the first time.
Mojisola warned the drug makers not to allow them to undergo any treatment without the agency allowing it.
In May, the NAFDAC announced that in social media and newspapers alone news outlets claimed they had discovered traditional medicine that would cure Coronavirus.
Adeyeye explained that only one person contacted the NAFDAC to look at the efficacy of the drug he claimed was traditional, saying it could cure Coronavirus.
That person, too, is not the cure for the disease, he said he found out.
That he did find the cure for symptoms of illness that are considered to be symptoms of the disease.
But since then some therapists have approached the commission with their own cooperation.

APC Zargi Niger Governor and Yunkurin Kawo Tarzoma A Jam 'iyyar - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
In a statement issued by the APC on Talatar this week, the governor of Niger State, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, attempted to bring civil unrest into the party.
The document, signed by the Chairman of the Engineering Party, Muhammad Jibrin Imam and Secretary of the Party, Barista Muhammed Liman, stated that over the past six years the party has ruled the state, only $512 million has received.
The document went on to say that the governor's meeting of stakeholders, led last Sunday night, will help continue to bring civil unrest to the party, where they say they have written to the Secretary of State for things that continue to happen in the state.
According to Imam Engineering, "We understand the Governor of Niger State has been trying to distribute the heads of the party's children by preparing a meeting of stakeholders, which is illegal, for any complaint against party leaders, written to the secretaries of the association, to investigate."
He went on to say so far in six years the establishment of the party, N512 million is in the party's account.
He said that what he understood as the governor was being part of the Board of Directors, which was set up July 25, 2020, led by the president to lead to organizing problems between the party's children and withdrawing social distancing in court between the party's children.
He said the funds we receive are paid to the salaries of the party's secretaries, as well as other activities related to the union, staffing and equating some of the problems of union members such as health support because of the lack of access to government subsidies, not any union money we have spent in principle, we challenge the commons to justify wasting union funds.
As I explained, the last general election of the state government was the most important election in the country, which we have done with former Commissioners and Commissioners holding power now in all twenty-five counties in the state, whose funds spent in the elections were shared by the Commissioners to bring their constituencies.
However, it is a mistake for each person to say that union funds are being spent in principle, this is almost unfair and an effort to protect the bad reputation of trying to impel him, saying that he is not a commission set up to investigate how to spend money on the association and who set it up.
Among the funds the complaint says that the money he allegedly received was barred, funding provided by the National Secretary of State, giving some funding to such a person, I challenge the commons on this matter to bring his testimony to the person to prove this allegation in any way.
Imam said that we stand firm against the defection of the APC from the party or the party from the party, adding that any allegation against the party or any party leader from the state level would be written by the committee in charge of the party as stated in section 21 (B) (follow), (d) on page 82 of the party system.
So party stakeholders have no role especially when they attempt to seize the commission's strength so their decision has no effect.
For this reason, they are the most trusted party leaders in the state, borrowed by 21 and six paragraphs on page 87 of the party's constitution, and anything contrary to this will not be used.
Because of the decision of despotism by the leaders of their grip you are mistaken.
He said those who presented together with confidence in yesterday's books at an event that did not promote, which Alhaji Abubakar Magaji, and General Muhammed Garba, and Hon. Ahmed Dogonkoli, including Alhaji Ibrahim Balarabe and all Commissioners, were not members of the constitutional committee in the state.
The chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Mohammed Imam, is the only one to lead the governor to lead state union leaders.
According to the statement, Governor Abubakar Sani Bello recalled the matter of fulfilling the promises made to the people of the state during the polls, traveling with the parents of the association in the government as everyone would benefit in the state and all voices by giving political positions, which is the problem of the governor and the union.
The document praised federal legislators who refused to attend the meeting and drew attention to reconciling all the problems between members of the party, this is not surprising for members of parliament who know their own pain, who refuse to accept arrest as a union law.
Therefore, there is a need for the chairman of the Board of Directors to attract Governor Abubakar Sani Bello on the right position not to attempt to undermine state politics.

The results of the study show that there are other foods that are being poured out to prevent them from ruining.

In the past, the United States has insisted mista Adesina must be investigated for the allegations, following allegations made by the AfDB Bank's administration, which resulted in the establishment of a committee of professionals to conduct an investigation into the badges.

China Cimma Nasarorin Wadata Jama 'a Da Abinci - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
Food is the spirit of the life of all creatures, and it is not necessary to live with food.
This is why Chinese judges are increasingly determined to ensure the prosperity of the people of the country and food.
Over the past 71 years since the foundation of the People's Republic of China, the country has achieved great achievements in the food supply, which has given the world a surprise look at the population of the country, which estimates the number of Chinese wastes 1.4 billion.
This effort has helped China to make the greatest contribution to global hunger, as China's chairman Zhang Wufeng said since 1949, China has always put the issue of combating hunger in front of all the country's affairs.
But in recent days, some people and other Western media have again "expressed concern" over the issue that is whether China can raise its own community in the shadow of COVID-19 respiratory disease worldwide?
We thank them very much that they constantly maintain the presence of Chinese people in this world.
Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the country has successfully produced enough food on its television efforts.
The issue of providing sufficient food to the Chinese is one of the main constituencies of the ruling JKS on a daily basis.
At the end of last week, the JKS Supreme Committee's Secretary, you're President of China, Xi Jinping issued an important mandate to stop her food, pointing out that everyone knew that any food and hard work was being done.
Although this year the impact of COVID-19 and the world's respiratory disease is also harmful to China's economy, China can provide sufficient food for its communities.
The figures released by China's National Bureau of Statistics on agricultural products, especially rice that the country will receive this year 2020 show that the total amount of rice available in the country in the first phase of 2020, accounting for 27.29 million tons, which increased by 1.08 million tons, that is, increased by 3.9% compared to the same period in 2019.
Ke Bingsheng, China's former chief agricultural officer, said China has achieved great achievements in the face of supply to the country and food compared with the beginning of the process of making changes at home and opening the door to the outside world.
Huang Jikun, Director of China's Peking Agricultural Policy Research Center, made the announcement during a meeting with the reporter, "The China Science Daily," according to China's serious challenge now in the next 2 or three years, whether China can reduce the amount of wheat and rice it has stored in grain store rooms.
Now the amount of grain each receives is 474 kilograms instead of 400 kilograms that each person in the world should receive every year.
And now China has installed millions of tons of agricultural products to raise pets only.
In addition, those who show concern for the issue should calm their minds, wash and sleep, or focus their attention on the affairs of their country.
The Chinese are able to raise themselves with the food they provide themselves.

Abi qualifies only in connection with the withdrawal process in 2023.
Dan Uwa and the Chief Executive of President Muhammadu Buhari, Mamman Daura, made the announcement that the resumption of power in Nigeria is now too old.
Mamman Daura said Nigeria has already made it clear that it has now disregarded the prosecution process in concentrating on the most qualified candidate in 2023.
BBC Hausa has published an interview with Mamman Daura, which is in it.
The proposal to withdraw from the presidential election in Nigeria has not resulted in an eye which began since 1999.
Instead Daura said the focus was on imposing a qualified person but that process was followed by a no-pick.
However, members of the Igbo tribe, Inyamirai, have responded to Daura in response to his comments.
They said he and his brother, President Buhari, had promised a romon rule by resuming and would now come out and say he is recommending not to follow that in 2023.
He himself was not better than all Nigerians were elected.
The country's top security forces who have been sitting in their seats for years have not been removed, and ay they are no better than the rest of the capacity.
The Inyamirai response.
A storm of Nigerian leadership policies that took place on Wednesday, while the Igbo Kabilar Igbo Protests Association, Ndigbo bombed Mamman Daura, for the words of the Nigerian presidency that he spoke to the Inyamurai tribe.
In a statement signed by Daura, the brother of President Muhammdu Buhari, he said the plan would be made in the presidential election in 2023.
On the other hand, since his words did not finish off middle-class answers, Ndigbo hastened to announce that he was wretched by Mamman Daura, calling him a scroll of brave.
In a statement issued on Wednesday by Ndigbo, the group of Igbo people in the South West, and in the South East, they will be allowed to come out with the president in the 2023 elections, that is, the Igbo people.
The Speaker of the Kabilar Igbo Association of Nigeria, Emeka Attamah, said the words of Mamman Daura are like the Nigerian presidency in 2023.
In addition to hadama, what prevented Mamman Daura from speaking karba-karba since 2019.
They were about to expel Jonathan, and now Daura is in charge of the southwest region which will lead Nigeria in the 2023 elections.
When he finishes what he tats from his current leadership brother, he will come up with no matter who we know he receives in 2023.
He should act as an elder to embrace the truth and hold it well.
He did not immediately respond to the words of the presidency in 2023, but also expressed favoritism.
VOA Discussion hall On Rape.
The issue of abuse of women and young children by rape is rampant in northern Nigeria where reports show how children are being violated.
People from many sectors attended the hall on July 23 to discuss how the situation worsened the country and how it should be overcome.

One of the mothers who attended Hajiya Fathi'ibu, the wife of the former governor of Plateau State and Niger State in the late Sani Abacha era, described poverty as one of the things that puts parents on advertising for their children.
Hajiya Maryam Mamman Nasir, the chairman of a fadi-tashi organization to see the fight against this tragedy, said "First of all, we should tour the woman and mothers on the side effects of letting their children go out of advertising, so that a child is out and will be seen to be harassed."
We will also call on Teachers to start preaching and voice communication to parents and brothers who rape their children and children.
He is also a member of the House of Representatives representing Maiyama, Koko and Besse of Kebbi State Honorable Shehu Mohammad, who expressed frustration over the matter and support for seeing a dynamic law that will punish anyone convicted of rape in the country.

Contributions to 'North Media Writers' to the North Coalition.
Modern social media such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram, Bakandamiya and others have long played a role in creating dialogue, cooperation and fellowship between different nations of the world, and delivering messages, stories, and spreading political policies, education and business.
Young people in Nigeria have been involved in this new technology using social media, to travel with the modern world, to donate or support them in new ways that affect their lives.
We can say that these options have brought us a lot of progress that Northern youths benefit from in business, economic, education and local politics.
A number of people eat through writing and delivering messages online, get jobs or enhance the services they manage.
It is very sad to see how some youths instead of using this opportunity to enjoy the progress that has been achieved, some followed by the contamination of southern children of the country who have been outstanding around the world in the benefit of the people, inside and outside the country, or documenting batting and abuse of judges and enemies.
What a lack of enlightenment, in the development of the lives of the youth of the country.
The advent of the Northern Media Writers Association in the Country is a great deal of kindness, in order to provide a view to the youth of the North, a good keynote and clean up of what the youth are doing in Soshiyal Midaya, as they will be writing meaningful and advocating policies of the North.
It is necessary to give this organization the cooperation it needs, to achieve its good objectives, that will bring alfanu not only to our North region, but also to Nigeria as a whole.
I advise our youth, especially social media users to come together to protect the integrity of the North and its freedom, and to create a system that will make a change for everyone.
As our North leaders, who lay down opportunities such as the Sardaunan Sakkwato, the first North Sir Ahmadu Bello, and his predecessor, they were determined to provide for the North.
It was reported that Marigayi madugun yaki da violence and poverty Malam Aminu Kano, had once said that Nigeria is a country one, but everyone knows his father's house!
So we say, of course, when we call on the development and development of the country to promote the affairs of governance, at every step, we further call on the unity of the North, without religious discrimination or ethnicity, to bring our region forward.
Considering the North is at its present point.
Therefore, we should use the skills that God has given us in providing donations and suggestions, in order to provide for the North as a means of reviving its economy.
The North should provide revenue cuts to implement its budget without waiting for the federal government to borrow money.
In addition, if we want North development, we give priority to education, agriculture, tourism, health and science and technology.
We are not ignorant but money to donate, there are different ways to do so.
We think the North will fulfill our goals!
North is proud to say.
The government allocated N126 billion to renovate the country's hospitals.

The experts made the call at a meeting to get a clue on providing good health to people in a simple way and done in Abuja.
In his speech, the senator representing Kwara North under the shadow of the APC Sadiq Umar said the Nigerian government should take matters to improve the health of the country seriously.
He said the lack of doing so has caused the area to suffer from financial problems, which is why it relies heavily on the subsidies it receives from abroad.
Umar said despite these support there was no role for the government in the health sector, they began withdrawing the support they opposed.

According to SERAP, this action is like a violation of human rights as contained in the Nigerian constitution.
Before human rights groups complained about the government's action, various religious leaders had already submitted their dismissal to the Buhari administration, according to Congress's resignation to members of Congress for review and recognition, as it would not collude with the freedom provided by the national system of religion and welfare.
Pastor John Buro, the head of Kaduna State, told the representative of the Voice of America that this law is not based alone, but if the government seeks to ban godly devotion or sanctions.
He should simply use the methods by monitoring and tracking all violators of the law without putting a new law.
On his side, Dr Bashir Yankuzo, a professor of science at Minna, said that even though the government was wrong to look forward to companies and organizations for national security, it does not mean that listening is acceptable to be taxed by someone or others.
Now the waiting thing to see is whether the government will listen to this public outcry.
How Akure University of Technology (FUTA) has tried to draw closer to PREMIUM TIMES on the internet.
Akure University of Technology (FUTA) has taken charge of a gogarman for social media outlets, in order to move to the PREMIUM TIMES, the "online newspaper" in Nigeria.
This gogarman crossing online casinos, has made every strategy that social media users follow to join their sites, but has not succeeded.
He began his trial for entering kutsen, namely, "hacking" since February 28, in which he destroyed his equipment facility on the University campus, and advised his attacks by using the "data" of the university.
On the other hand, if he tries to thwart PREMIUM TIMES and computer, he attacks his GSM phone again.
Five days later, he left the door to enter the PREMIUM TIMES, but he did not succeed, even though he used various modern technology weapons.
He did not succeed in screaming, because the university did not know that the PREMIUM TIMES had a coherent plan, which built the front line and the doors of an out-of-staff member was not enough to sack her.
And PREMIUM also has the latest Internet security officer including PREMIUM TIMES and General Dakare, PREMIUM TIMES.
These security forces who have modern skills in crushing any group of multiple members or Barden who sought to fight alone, or perform martyrdom efforts in PREMIUM TIMES.
Similar Makaman and Internet Enforcement Agency Reports to PREMIUM TIMES:
At 8 a.m., he began to fall down the front door of PREMIUM TIMES, to see how he would disperse the beans completely.
Unsuccessfully during the night, and early morning, at 6: 15, he tested again, this time using "WPScan," what is being done to identify the strengths or inability of the security of adult Internet sites such as PREMIUM TIMES.
It was 90 minutes later that he began attempting to scream with the strength of modern machine technology, that is, "custom script."
It was early morning that he made any effort to do it through a computer strategy to completely lock up the PREMIUM TIMES.
How the Gona has dealt with bosses:
The kutsen did not know that PREMIUM TIMES had cooperated with small mice and large cities entering the farms of modern communication sites to close the page or confiscate the site.
This lack of knowledge makes it possible for all the tools he used to use, completely old and unable to treat PREMIUM TIMES any harm or harm.
On the other hand, he suffered unease because he followed through an attack on DDOS in NTP, which is an old way to use since Kano is eradicated.
On March 3, he made every strategy left in his brain and mind, but all he did was not succeed.
The attempt to break the door of PREMIUM TIMES comes a few days after PREMIUM TIMES published an article about the rumor between President Muhammadu Buhari's Expert Advisor at Fannin Security, Babagana Monguno and former Chairman of the Presidential Staff, Marigayi Abba Kyari.
Some members of the Federal University of Technology in Akure, gossip to PREMIUM TIMES, said the university had recruited large rats to enter Internet sites, to affect PREMIUM TIMES, to destroy or destroy it.
However, when PREMIUM TIMES contacted the FUTA, she distanced her from trying to deploy PREMIUM TIMES on the Internet.
She said that if only a student who was a student at the university had tried it alone, she would not have been a spokesman for the FUTA.

The Emir of Kano State, Aminu Babba Dan'agundi and Emir of Dawaki Mai Tuta and Ciroman Kano, Sanusi Ado-Bayero.
The two were removed by Emir Ado and Emir Muhammadu Sanusi, according to allegations of constipation.
The Chief of Staff challenged his impeachment in court.
17 years of trial, however, the Supreme Court has ruled that he is impeached.
Ganduje also wants to convert on his rule, and the amendment of the law remains part of the emperor's appointees in the Kano Emirate.
Ado Bayero removed Brother in 2003 after he was found guilty of constipation and political misconduct.
The committee was set to investigate him, but was invited to refuse to go before the committee to protect him.

Efforts That Make Your Loving, It's a Heart - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
In the Longyuan village of Hongsipu, Wuzhong, Ningxia, an autonomous Hui tribe, located in northwestern China.
A woman named Li Yaomei or Sadiya (her Islamic name) is famous for her struggle in life and her success is based on her efforts to get out of poverty.
Her story tells us that the effort and commitment of self-seeking is something that is in the heart.
First of all, Li Yaomei or Sadiya, had never been in a classroom aimed at taking lessons, which is why she was unable to read the text.
However, God gave her the gift of insight, insight, and wisdom, so that she could be an example in the fight against poverty.
About 20 years ago, Madam Li Yaomei, had been suffering from depression, where she was diagnosed with surgery at least 3 times.
After her fall, she encountered a tragic accident, and now she walks with the strength placed inside her leg.
Those challenges have brought her into critical condition in addition to health, even with the issue of medical treatment, why she received a loan of about 3 thousand yuan, equivalent to more than $16 million.
Surprisingly, the challenge Ms. Sadiya faced was a way of choosing and insulting her to see her improve her life.
Then the Chinese government grants it, adding it to it.
Her profession is to get picked up by different kinds based on vegetation use.
Because of her efforts, my business has developed a lot, where various staff are not eager to find it.
In addition, she invented several engines that help her to simplify the project.
For example, it took 15 minutes to connect one big one, but now in this period, it will connect up to 5.
In addition, it has provided additional engines to clean up the weeds.
Then there is an additional machine that cleans animal feed, and now it's selling these engines to the applicants.
Given the challenges Ms. Sadiya has faced, and her efforts to improve her life and that of her staff, it will be understood that the applicant must be with her.
The work of fighting poverty and improving life is not something that hangs over the government.
If the government is to provide support, but people are not interested in improving their lives by advocating themselves for jobs based on their situation, then the future alone will continue to do without achieving a goal.
Her record shows that running a business or income project does not require some money laundering or travel to other towns or overseas.
Because she considered the situation, she used the resources available in Muhallinta to improve her life.
Moreover, Sadiya's teacher carried out those duties on her leg without relying on her husband, to flee and leave her.
That is, the effort and commitment of self-seeking is something that is in the heart.
It also shows the strength that women have to change their lives and stand firm without asking for help.
This is also a lesson that, whatever a person will do, he should stand by his shoulders, in order to rely on someone unsure.
Of course Ms. Sadiya was a committed, smart and talented person who became an example and a model for the rest of the population.
Also, to March of the year, Ms. Sadiya completed the payment of all loans owed, and also suspended receiving support from the government over its own rainfall.

There are fears US Siyasar will Lalata Kokarin Dakile COVID-19 - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
In recent days, the World Health Organization's director, WHO Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, expressed concern over the measures taken by other countries, to preserve the COVID-19 vaccine that is hoped to be produced, in which he explained that priority must be avoided in different countries, while vaccination against the epidemic is being distributed.
And the injection should be distributed in a timely manner across the world, so it would be appropriate for the great benefit of different countries.
Of course some US politicians are implementing a policy of prioritizing their own morals, in terms of separating the vaccine, and thus paralyzing international cooperation in the fight against the epidemic.
Meanwhile, the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases worldwide has already lost 23 million.
In the number, there are people who have lost their lives due to the disease that reaches more than 800 thousand.
Under such severe conditions, the impact of the vaccine is increasingly focused, and the content is that in recent days, there have been great results in studying the vaccine in other countries, an issue that provides optimism, faith in the views of the international community.
But the sad thing is that some US politicians have signaled a goal of injecting the vaccine.
Even the journal "Science" clarifies that the US government has already set aside agreements to purchase COVID-19 vaccines worth more than $6 billion, from several pharmaceutical companies.
Although the US government's policy is understood, the presence of the United States is on the forefront of the spread of the disease, but other developing countries also need a vaccine, considering that they are more likely to suffer from low health resources.
The journal "The Ecologist" also pointed out that if the United States achieves the goal of taking the vaccine to be produced, then the number of vaccine to develop developing countries will decrease.
Chicken lika, director of the African CDC Centers for Disease Control, Mr. John Nkengasong, also expressed concern over this matter.
As some daily commentators have explained, even if the vaccine is successfully produced, it is not possible to achieve the goal of seeing after the disease, but how to separate the vaccine, which is an important issue for the international community.
And it is appropriate for the countries of the world to further strengthen the cooperation between them.
The WHO Director-General Tedros, also pointed out that if it is to be seen after the disease, it must be detained from all sectors around the world, it is impossible for other parts of the world, or that few countries achieve the goal of rehabilitation from the effects of the epidemic alone.
