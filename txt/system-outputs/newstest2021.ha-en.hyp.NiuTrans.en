The main reason I stand out is that the PDP is ruling in Bauchi state.
Everyone knows my role in the state governorship election in which the former minister of Abuja, Bala Mohammed beat the incumbent governor, Mohammed Abubakar.
But now I am a watcher and carer in the Bala government.
Instead of staying in PDP, I have a lot to do with it.
Never miss important updates! Never miss important updates! Never miss important updates! Never miss important updates!
He said that as he has always shown other governors where they have failed and where to fix the past, Bala is not an anointed one.
Better to walk and leave them.
A fire broke out at a petrol station in Kano.
The blaze broke out around 10 pm, which lasted about two hours, despite takeoff by Kano State Fire Service officials, security agencies and the community.
When Freedom Radio visited the site, it found the people in diaspora and various security forces there everywhere. The presence of the site is connected to the main bus station known as Kuka station, which is transporting passengers from Kano to other states and neighbouring countries.
Apart from the Water Door market which is prominent in Northern Nigeria.
Freedom Radio approached some and other eyewitnesses, who said the fire had led to a mass escape.
A bus stop at the Port of Kofar said that they had been partnering with patrol officers to save passengers who had been in shock by the fire.
The Kano State Fire Service confirmed the incident, saying as of the time we are putting together this report it is still gathering information to identify the shelling and loss caused by the fire, according to spokesperson Saidu Muhammad Ibrahim.
On the other hand, reports that there were some miscreants who tried to infiltrate the Kofar Water market to steal, but police officers and swarms tried to evade them and secure the property.
On this basis, we contacted Kano State Police spokesperson DSP Abdullahi Haruna Kiyawa, who confirmed the incident.
MODEL KORONA: We are yet to finish testing the efficacy of the combined vaccine in Nigeria.
While European countries are still testing positive for the novel coronavirus, Nigeria is also not left behind in integrating and testing its own drugs.
Never miss important updates! The National Food and Drug Administration (NAFDAC) has revealed that it is testing up to 40 COVID-19 vaccines submitted by traditional medicine practitioners.
President Mojisola Adeyeye made the announcement Tuesday in Abuja.
Mojisola said the efficacy of the drugs is being tested so as not to look for obesity to find retaliation.
Since the emergence of the coronavirus pandemic, traditional medicine practitioners have spearheaded research to make sure they are not left behind in the process of getting the vaccine together.
Many of them have submitted samples of their vaccine to the authorities for testing and assessing its efficacy.
NAFDAC also set certain criteria and rules for the inclusion of the vaccine.
The effectiveness of the drugs will be tested in animals for the first time yet.
Mojisola warned pharmacists not to venture into addiction to a drug without the agency allowing it.
In May, NAFDAC revealed that only on social media and newspaper pages are seeing stories of claimants finding a traditional cure for Coronavirus.
Adeyeye explained that only one person approached NAFDAC and asked it to check the efficacy of the drug he claimed to include traditional ones, saying it could cure Coronavirus.
The other person, however, is not the cure for gidigat.
That he did find a cure for the symptoms of the illness that seemed to be the symptoms of the infection.
However, some pharmacists have since approached the agency with their own cooperation.
Ramaphosa faced questions in the council.
It is the first of a series of questions President Ramaphosa has faced before lawmakers since corruption scandals among senior members of his government and even some members of his own party.
Ramaphosa promised to deepen research and reform the sector responsible for overseeing the procurement sector against the covid-19 pandemic.
South Africa is becoming the fifth country in the world to be hit by the coronavirus pandemic, but the president said corruption is playing a key role in the fight against the virus in the country.
Nigeria Will Saturday Open International Airports.
Nigerian authorities have said they will open airports for outbound and incoming flights, from next Saturday, for the first time after five months of closure.
Since March 23, the government has suspended the immigration of planes, citing the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.
The government said the first four flights to come in from abroad will begin landing in Abuja.
So did Lagos, but it is not clear where these flights will come from.
According to Civil Aviation Minister Hadi Sirika, the decision to open this is that there has been no problem since the opening of domestic flights on July 8.
Sirika, however, added that all necessary protocols are in place to ensure the safe return of flights.
591 COVID Cases Reported in Nigeria.
On Friday, 591 new COVID cases were reported.
With this new number of Covid cases in the country taking the total number of people infected to 39,539 with 16,559 recoveries and 845 deaths.
The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, NCDC, gave the number of people and states on its Twitter handle.
There have been more corona cases in our team - Marseille.
Marseille, France, has said three more pupils have tested positive for the corona virus, following five cases last week.
The team made the announcement in a statement to reporters Tuesday.
Moreover, the league said the French League 1 tournament that was intended to start last Friday was postponed as a result of five pupils contracting COVID.
Marseille also said that it had already informed stakeholders in preparing for the League 1, resulting in a rise of three cases after the first five deaths, to find a solution to the situation.
APC Accuses Niger Governor of Trying To Bring Tazoma To The Nation
In a statement issued by the APC, the governor of Niger State, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, has been accused of attempting to bring about riots within the party.
The petition, signed by the Chairman of the Engr. Muhammad Jibrin Imam and the Secretary to the Party Barrister Muhammed Liman, stated that over the six years the party has ruled the state, only N512 million has been received.
The petition further stated that the meeting called by the governor of stakeholders, which he chaired on Sunday night last weekend will help keep the party afloat. They said they have written to the national secretariat of the party about the ongoing developments in the state.
According to Engr Imam, "we understand the Governor of Niger State has been trying to divide the party's children by organising a stakeholder meeting, which is illegal, so that any complaint against the party leaders is written to the regional secretariat, so that they can investigate."
He went on to say that so far in six years of forming the party, N512 million is in the party fund.
He said that what he understood as the governor was being part of the National Standing Committee which was set up July 25, 2020, chaired by the president to lead the preparation of the problems between the party members and the withdrawal of the complaints in court between the party members.
He said the money we received was paying the salaries of the party secretariat staff, as well as other activities related to the party, primaries and coordinating other issues of party children such as health support due to lack of access to government support, not any party money we spent illegally. We challenge anyone to make excuses for the waste of party funds.
As I stated, the last two local government primaries were the most important primaries in the country which we have had with former commissioners and commissioners who are currently holding office in all the twenty-five local government areas of the state, whose funds in the elections have been distributed to the commissioners to bring their wards.
He said, "It is not a matter of fact, it is not a matter of fact."
I challenge anyone on this issue to bring his evidence to prove this allegation in any way.
Imam said we stand firm on protecting the APC from the movement of any party or group from the breakdown of the party, adding that any allegations against the party or any party leader from the state level will be written by the regional governing committee as stated in section 21 (B) (bi), (d) on page 82 of the party structure.
The party stakeholders therefore have no role especially when they attempt to seize the power of the committee and therefore their judgment has no effect.
For this reason, they are the best leaders of the party in the state, in chess 21 and paragraph six on page 87 of the party constitution.
Because the decision to desegregate the leaders is a mistake.
He said that those who presented and approved yesterday at the invalidated meeting, which was attended by Alhaji Abubakar Magaji, General Muhammed Garba, Hon. Ahmed Dogonkoli, as well as Alhaji Ibrahim Balarabe and all commissioners, were not members of the party executive committee in the state.
It will be chaired by the Executive Committee of the party chairman Engr Mohammed Imam and not led by the governor of the state party.
According to the report, Governor Abubakar Sani Bello recalled that the issue of fulfilling the promise made to the people of the state during elections, going with the parents of the party in government so that everyone can benefit in the state and all the states through political appointments, which is the problem of the governor and the party.
The petition commended the federal legislators who refused to attend the meeting and drew attention to the reconciliation of all the problems between the party members. This is not surprising for the legislators who know their own pain, to reject dictatorship as party law.
Therefore, the chairman of the National Grief Committee needs to attract Governor Abubakar Sani Bello to the right position not to attempt to destroy the politics of the state.
Nigeria Is Ready for Internet Economy - Freedom Radio Nigeria
The Minister of Communications and Internet Economic Development Dr Isa Ali, Pantami said the country is ready for a revolution in the economic sector of the internet.
He also said the government is ready to work closely with experts in universities and other stakeholders to make the country accessible in any case of digital technology.
Dr Isa Ali Fantami stated this during an international conference on the development of communication technology which was held via the internet.
The minister also noted that one of the first steps taken by the government to get the country right on communication technology is to change the name of the ministry from the Ministry of Communications to the Ministry of Communications and Economic Development of the internet.
How perishable food is impacting the health of people in Nigeria.
Some scientists have warned people against eating foods used to prevent food from being damaged that eating such foods harms human health.
The experts made the warning after their findings on the quality of food consumed in the country.
The results show that there are some foods that are dumped to prevent them from rotting.
The study also showed that this chemical is most commonly used in beans, alabo flour and dry fish sold to the public.
The chemical is used because when one sees it he will be interested in buying and using it.
Then eating foods containing this protein causes cancer, kidney disease, cardiac arrest and others.
The people of the country have been urged to focus on keeping away from using these kinds of food items for their health.
Never miss important updates! Food Quality expert Grace Olasumbo has called on Nigerian pupils to avoid eating the vegetables of trees grinding with Calcium Carbide.
Olasumbo explained that Sindarin Calcium Carbide is a chemical most pupils use to grinding raw fruits, namely vegetables.
Studies have shown that the stresses of patience and greed are among the factors that make pupils use this chemical because within a day it nudges down trees.
Olasumbo explained that one thing pupils fail to understand is that using this chemical to nudge vegetables negatively affects people's health.
For this reason there are diseases including vomiting and diarrhea, eye infections, gynaecology, throat cancer, mouth, liver and others.
President of the African Development Bank acquitted of charges - Freedom Radio Nigeria.
The panel of experts chaired by former Irish Prime Minister Mary Robinson has acquitted African Development Bank President AfDB Akinwumi Adesina.
According to the committee Mr. Akinwumi Adesina is innocent of the alleged bribery.
AFP reported that earlier this year, a fifteen-page report accused six-year-old Mr. Adesina of being prioritized, incompetent and prospering himself.
However, the panel of experts chaired by Robinson along with Gambian Chief Justice Hassan Jallow and World Bank Vice President for the integrity sector Leonard McCarthy, acquitted the former Nigerian agriculture minister of all charges against him.
In the past, it was the United States that insisted Adesina must be investigated over the allegations, following his acquittal by the management of the AfDB, prompting the formation of an expert committee to investigate the scandal.
COVID Prevents Trump Campaign Meeting in Florida.
President Donald Trump Thursday announced he was canceling the Repubican convention to be given a ticket scheduled for Jacksonville, Florida, next month, citing a surge in coronavirus cases.
However convention activities will be held in North Carolina.
Trump said in Jacksonville that having a convention was not appropriate at this time.
President Trump moved part of the GOP convention to Florida last month after they conflicted with Democratic leaders in North Carolina over holding the event in a closed conference room with supporters without wearing masks.
A few Republican delegates will gather in Charlotte, North Carolina, to officially nominate Trump on August 24.
Trump said he would make an acceptance speech in a different format.
Trump, who has been characterizing the impact of the pandemic for months, recently even said that 99 percent of the number of cases seen increased in the United States, would not be affected.
Buhari Will Not Receive Prayers.

President Muhammadu Buhari also stressed the measures recommended by the House to avoid meetings where many people will be in one place.
In celebration of the small prayer this year, the president offered his Eid prayers at home with his family rather than going to the mosque the way he normally does every year.

China Achieves Its Social and Food Supplies
Food is the soul of the life of all beings, it cannot be lived necessarily with food.
This is why Chinese judges are increasingly determined to ensure the prosperity of the nation with food.
In the 71 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the country has made major gains in food supply surprising the world in view of the population which according to estimates shows the number of Chinese has topped 1.4 billion.
This effort has been instrumental in the fact that China has made a major contribution to eradicating hunger around the world, as Chinese grain and agricultural products chief Zhang Wufeng once said that since 1949 until now, China has always put the issue of tackling hunger ahead of all the countrys management activities.
But in recent days, some people and some Western media have once again "expressed concern" over the issue namely, can China raise its own nation in the shadow of the new coronavirus-19 respiratory disease worldwide?
We thank them very much for constantly paying attention to the Chinese presence in this world.
Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the country has achieved enough food on its own.
The issue of providing the Chinese with adequate food is one of the main pillars of the ruling JKS daily.
At the end of last week, the General Secretary of the JKS Supreme Committee, the President of China, Xi Jinping gave an important directive to stop food waste, pointing out that everyone knows that every food pill and hard work is available.
Though this year the impact of the COVID-19 respiratory disease that has ravaged the world is also impacting the Chinese economy, China can provide enough food for its people.
The figures released by China's statistics agency on the number of agricultural products, especially rice produced by the country in 2020 show that the total rice production in the country for the first quarter in 2020 was 27.29 million tonnes with an increase of 1.08 million tonnes, an increase of 3.9% compared to the same period of 2019.
Ke Bingsheng, a former president of the Chinese University of Agriculture, also said that China has made major gains in terms of supplying the country with food compared to the early phase of the implementation of the policy of making changes at home and opening up foreign exchange.
Huang Jikun, director of the China Agricultural Policy Institute of Peking University, said during a meeting with the reporter "The China Science Daily," that the greatest challenge facing China now is that in the next 2 or three years, whether China can reduce the amount of wheat and rice it has stored in grain warehouses.
Now the amount of grain each gets is 474 kilograms instead of the 400 kilograms that every international person should get annually.
And now China imports millions of tonnes of agricultural products to raise only domestic animals.
Notably, those who are concerned should calm down, take a bath and go to sleep, or focus their attention on the affairs of their country.
The Chinese can raise themselves with their own food.
Why I prosecuted Ganduje - Abba K. Yusuf - Freedom Radio Nigeria.
Never miss important updates! Never miss important updates! Never miss important updates! Never miss important updates! Never miss important updates!
Abba Kabir disclosed this, through his lawyer, Bashir Tudun wuzirci, who said that he filed the suit, allegedly possessing some pupils of public buildings that the people of Kano state benefit from.
In addition to the Kano governor and the pupils, Abba Kabir Yusuf also sued the state Ministry of Works, Housing and Transport, the Attorney General and the Kano Commissioner of Justice and the state land management agency.
Abba Kabir Yusuf has accused the Kano State government of mishandling some individuals of the former Daula hotel now under the supervision of Wudil City Science and Technology University and Shahuci station grounds. He said this was in violation of the provisions of the laws of the country.
Abi qualifies only, in waning the withdrawal process in 2023.
Never miss important updates! The brother and close friend of President Muhammadu Buhari, Mamman Daura, has said that the current style of governance in Nigeria has become old.
Mamman Daura said Nigeria is already confident of now abandoning the withdrawal process in concentrating on selecting the most qualified person in 2023.
This was revealed by the BBC.
This process of acceptance in electing a leader in Nigeria has not resulted in an eye-catching son starting since 1999.
Instead Daura said the focus was on reprimanding the deserving person and not on following the process of acceptance.
However, Igbo pupils, the Inyamirai, responded to Daura over his comments.
He said he and his brother, President Buhari, had complied with the constitution by accepting it and would now say he was recommending that it not be followed in 2023.
Bushiri himself is no better than all Nigerian pupils elected.
The Chief of Defence Staff who have been sitting in their seats for many years have not been removed.
Martyrdom.
A storm of Nigerian leadership politics flared on Wednesday, as the Igbo Zalla Coalition, Ndigbo, bombarded Mamman Daura, for his botched declaration of the Nigerian presidency to the Indigenous people.
In a televised interview with Daura, who is the brother of President Muhammdu Buhari, he said the regional process will be done in the presidential election in 2023.
On this basis, since his statement was not finished on social media, Ndigbo quickly issued a statement denouncing Mamman Daura, calling him almutter of partisanship.
In a statement issued by Ndigbo on Wednesday, the group is purely Igbo pupils of the South Region and in the South East will be allowed to produce a president in the 2023 general elections.
Never miss important updates! A spokesperson for Igbo Zalla, Emeka Attamah, said Mamman Daura's words are like a bottle of Nigerian leadership in 2023.
What is meant by Sidratul-Muntaha that the Quran has mentioned?
They are about to sack Jonathan, and now Daura is suing the south region for the 2023 general election.
It is a matter of fact that it is not a matter of fact, it is not a matter of fact.
He should as an elder embrace the truth and handle it well.
Not to come out juggling the declaration of the presidency in 2023, the juggling is also biased and voluntary.
VOA Interview Debate on Deterrence.
The issue of violence against women and children by raping them is common in northern Nigeria where there have been reports showing how children are being deprived of their rights.
People from a range of backgrounds attended the hall on July 23 to discuss how the situation is getting worse in the country and how it should be handled.
Participants in the hall attributed the problem to things like adverts being put on girls and the messaging of other parents.
One of the mothers who attended Hajiya Fathi'a Sha'ibu, the wife of the former governor of Plateau and Niger state during the late Sani Abacha regime, described poverty as one of the factors that made parents impose advertising on their children.
In a statement issued on Monday, February 13, by the director-general of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NGOs), Hajiya Maryam mamman Nasir, the chairman of a group that is fighting this catastrophe, said: "First of all, we should go around and talk to mothers about the effects of letting their children go out of advertising, because a child is going to be seen to be affected."
We will also urge Teachers to start preaching loudly to parents and siblings who rape their children and younger siblings.
The federal lawmaker representing Maiyama, Koko and Besse constituencies of Kebbi State Honorable Shehu Mohammad, expressed frustration with the matter and support for the imposition of a strict law to punish anyone convicted of rape in the country.
At the end of Hajiya madina David and Nasiru El-hikaya, who chaired the meeting hall, thanked those who attended the meeting on behalf of VOA for accepting their invitation.
Contributing to "North Media Writers" to Northern Cooperation.
Social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram, Bakandamiya and others have long played a role in creating lobbies for dialogue, cooperation and fellowship between different nations of the world, delivering messages, stories, and promoting political, educational and business goals.
Young people in Nigeria have been involved in this new technology using social media lobbying, to go digital, donate or spit on their livelihoods.
We can say that these lobbies have brought us a lot of development that the youths of the North benefit from in business, economy, education and local politics.
Many others are eating through writing and delivering messages online, have found jobs or have developed their own operations.
But it is unfortunate to see that some youths instead of using this opportunity to take advantage of the progress that has been made, there have been some who follow the corrupt southern boys who have excelled in the world to target the people, both inside and outside the country, or to write insults and abuse of judges and their predecessors.
It shows a lack of awareness, in the development of the lives of the youth of the country.
The arrival of the Northern Media Writers Association in the country is a great blessing, to provide the youth of the North with a positive outlook, a positive direction and to clean up the things that the youth are doing in Soshiyal Maya, so that they can write meaningful and promote the policies of the people of the North.
It is imperative that we give this group the cooperation it needs, in order to achieve its goodwill goals, that will bring benefits not only to our Northern region, but to Nigeria as a whole.
I would like to advise our youths, especially the users of the social media lobby to come together to protect the dignity of the North and its children and create a system that will make a difference for all.
As our Northern leaders, such as Sardaunan Sokoto, the First Lady of the North, Sir Ahmadu Bello, and his immediate family have aspired to provide for the people of the North.
Never miss important updates! Never miss important updates! Never miss important updates! Never miss important updates! Never miss important updates!
So we are saying, certainly as we call for national development and promotion of governance, at all levels, we are increasingly calling for the unity of Northern pupils, without religious or ethnic discrimination, to bring our region forward.
When we consider how the North was before it is not now.
So we should use the skills that God has given us to contribute and negotiate, in order to provide the North with a satisfactory way to revive its economy.
The North should create revenue sources to implement its budget without waiting for the federal government to waste money.
In addition, if we want the development of the North, we give importance to education, agriculture, tourism, health and science and technology.
There are different ways of doing so.
We think the North will thus fulfill our enemies goal!
The North is our pride.
The government has allocated N126 billion to rehabilitate hospitals in the country.
The federal government has allocated N126 billion from the National Economic Development Programme to rehabilitate hospitals in the country.
The hospitals to be renovated include FMC hospital, screening facilities, emergency care department, isolation department for non-communicable diseases, and teaching hospitals in 36 states in the country.
In recent years, some allies in the health sector have called on government departments to jointly allocate adequate funds to improve the health sector of the country.
The experts made the call at the virtual meeting on providing quality healthcare to people easily and held in Abuja.
In his speech the candidate for Kwara North senatorial seat under the guise of the APC Sadiq Umar said the Nigerian government should take matters of improving the health of the country seriously.
He said the failure to do so had caused the sector to suffer from funding constraints making it often dependent on foreign support.
Umar said despite these support there was no role for the government in the health sector which led them to start withdrawing their support.

People killed by hunger in Africa will surpass those killed by Coronavirus -IFAD.
The International Centre for Agriculture Development (IFAD) has said that there are at least 23 million more people who will be displaced by hunger in Saharan Africa in 2020.
This was stated by IFAD President Gilbert Houngbo at the Economic Discussion Forum, the World Economic Forum.
This year's meeting was discussed in Africa, during the Coronavirus pandemic.
Houngbo said studies, projections and calls for food insecurity, show that in 2020 those killed by hunger in the African region will surpass those killed by Coronavirus, far behind.
IFAD is a hub which is famous for supporting people living in the countryside to develop agriculture, increase the supply of their children with nutritious food and provide for themselves through agriculture.
Houngbo said Coronavirus has shown that there is a stellar problem with the food supply chain, distribution and rehabilitation.
Many farmers are struggling with being unable to afford fertilizers because of the restrictions.
And then they are unable to go to the farm and those who grow crops sell, businesses are closed let alone sell their crops.
The report added that in 2019 hunger hit 135 millionaires worldwide, of whom 73 millionaires were from Africa, among 36 countries.
In Northern Nigeria hunger hit 5 million people in 2019.

The Minister of Agriculture, Alhaji Sabo Muhammad Nanono, has challenged state and local governments over the security crisis in Nigeria.
In an interview with Radio France International on how the security crisis has affected the agriculture sector.
The minister said, "It is not a matter of fact that the federal government is entitled to the security of this thing, the state and local governments, if you go to the ground as far as Dagatai and the locals are concerned, they are going to let this security situation become what it has become, but everyone is up and says the federal government."
Yes, the federal government has the right to protect the lives of the people, but those who are close to these people should first of all speak that we think we have a problem with these things.
Alhaji Sabo Nanono added that the federal government is doing its best to boost agriculture and food production in the country.
President Trump Signed the Drug Reduction Act.
On Friday, July 24, US President Donald Trump signed four presidential decrees aimed at reducing US spending on drugs prescribed by doctors, as he faces a battle for re-election and clashes over his handling of the COVID pandemic in the country.
Trump would have even previously said he would make almost all the changes brought by the law which he signed on Friday, but this is the first time the law has been signed into law.
One of the laws would allow drugs written by doctors to be officially imported from countries like Canada, while another law would require pharmaceutical companies to lower their prices, according to Trump.
Another law requires insulin injection parcels to be reduced while the fourth law, which is likely not to be implemented if there is a successful meeting with drug companies, would require the Medicare Insurance system to buy drugs at the parcels bought by other countries, according to Trump.
Nigerian Wins Award In UNICEF Competition.
80,000 youths from Nigeria have taken part in a project sponsored by the United Nations Children's Fund, UNICEF, to create a technology on the COVID-19 pandemic to provide a community solution to the pandemic, called the "UNICEF COVID-19 Innovation Challenge."
The awards from Nigeria range from pupils aged 14 to 35.
One of the youths, 28-year-old Chukwuma Nwachukwu, proposed how to use solar panels for water supply to help fight the virus.
The solar panel designed by Chukwuma Nwachukwu won the first week of the tournament.
Chukwuma Nwachukwu said his goal is to provide clean water to communities of Abuja that do not have access to clean water.
Nwachukwu is among tens of thousands of young Nigerians who took part in the "UNICEF COVID-19 Innovation Challenge" launched in May and continued for six weeks.
UNICEF said the new inventions show how young people can contribute significantly during difficult times.
About 60 million Nigerian pupils, or about a third of the population of pupils, do not receive clean water, according to the Water Support Agency.
Kano Elders Take Action Against Buhari
A coalition of Kano people has sued the state governor, Abdullahi Ganduje to President Muhammadu Buhari over his attempt to borrow from a Chinese bank to build a railway network.
A coalition of more than 15 groups under the guise of Kano Forum has described what it calls the giant debt that the Ganduje administration wants to nourish for the construction of the first phase of the railway line in Kano as futile to see the major challenges facing the state.
The group alleged that Governor Ganduje would borrow 684 million euros (about N3 billion) which they said was only 50 years old.
The chairman of the group Alhaji Bashir Othman Tofa said it was almost impossible for Kano state to bear the burden of a debt beyond the one already bequeathed even earlier.
Deciding Deterrence in Nigeria is the only solution -Mahomes.
Never miss important updates! A community activist based in Kaduna state, Alhaji Aliyu Maigida, has pointed out that the death penalty for rape in the country, especially in Northern Nigeria is the only solution.
Alhaji Aliyu Mahomes made the announcement in his interview with Leadership Today in Kaduna, adding that if the authorities confirm this after making an investigation, the execution is the only solution.
He added that the decision will reduce the number of incidents of rape that can be easily reported, but the main relief is to fix our minds.
He said, "We are not going to be able to do this."
He said it was shameful to say absolutely that an adult or elderly man should have had a little girl or three months old, three or five years old raped her.
He went on to say that between God, we will not be insulting leaders, or rulers of the country, pointing out that there is no way for the country to progress if such a bailout is achieved.
He added that we are in despair and suffering in the country, because the country has refused to move forward, and Sarakuna, Governor and President, have lost their way with the situation.
He added that they had to dump that bar and another one came out and therefore, it was an obligation to correct our minds and please bring us a solution to the rape case.
He said that even if they are doing it for charms, everything should fail God because he is the one who weds all the grief and poverty of the nation.
According to him, whatever situation a person is going through, God knows that you are not going to do, but stigma and hailstones and you always think that you are going to die and you always think that you have your back, if you are going to be born.
He pointed out that the police are officially doing their best because they are sending such alleged rapists to Kotuand the judge is doing their best to do this.
He called on parents to keep a close eye on their children, citing an example of the ads that parents are putting on them that are adding to the problem.
He said that some parents do not follow the lives of their children whether they go to school or do not go to school or come home in time or do not return, adding that the fault of some parents is that they should know that they are given the children by God and that tomorrow they will ask them what kind of education they have given their children.

Shinkafi Farmers In Biniwe Expect Harvest And Location In Bana Village
rice farmers in Biniwe State expect to harvest as much as two months after planting.
Some of them trucked in Makurdi expressed hope that harvest would be available anytime between October and November.
A small farmer in Mbatiab-Gboko, Titus Atondo, said he planted his rice in a two hectare area in July.
Atondo said he sourced seeds from the market in his area and they are in two groups of CP and OC rice as he uses Dazzle powder to clear land for planting and composting.
According to Titus Atondo, the challenges of growing rice in the countryside such as maina are huge because we rely so much on labor as customers can't find farm alternatives.
Titus Atondo added that we are recruiting people to do agriculture from the national level to the harvest, adding that this is tired and too much.
Atondo said all the expenses on his farm which are now in place include planting, clearing, composting applications and their harvest is expected to be N2020,000.
Titus Atondo went on to say, however, that he was expecting at least 50 bags of bags as harvest from two hectares that would likely be sold at a cost of N29,000 per 100k bag.
Another major rice farmer, Bitalis Tarnongu, also planted sows in June to July in 274 hectares of the farm whose prices stand at N14, 500 per hectare while the ground floor pays N25,000 a hectare.
He planted 44 varieties (Supi) and Faro 61 (OC) varieties derived from the National Agricultural Development Council (seeds) and some originated from Olam Nigeria.
He added that growth levels at this time are in different areas while some are in the breeding programme, others are in the early stages of killing animals as the farm is farmed in stages.
Tarnongu added that the challenges so far include financial ones since the cost of producing selected animals is expensive and labor costs have increased.
He said the harvest is expected to start in October to November.
He added that the total price of raw materials at the end of the day will be a minimum of N246,000 per hectare while production is expected to honey three tonnes which could translate into N360,000 at a rate of N120 per kilo.
Tarnongu does not use medicines on his rice farm. Instead, he advocates and implements traditional agriculture, adding that, therefore, we use highly pesticide plants, pesticides and medicinal fertilizers.
The Chairman of the National Farmers Union (AFAN) Benue State chapter, Comrade Aondongu Saaku, also expressed hope that the rainfall situation this year will be conducive to high rice production.
According to the chairman of the National Farmers Union (AFAN) rehen Benue state, Comrade Aondongu Saaku, more farmers have been involved in rice production at the end of this year due to the coronavirus pandemic which has prevented many from leaving offices and staying in their fields.
He said this year it will harvest 20 per cent of 2019 production valued at over one million tons.
According to him, the collectors are now taking the statistics of various farmers and when the project is completed, the number of rice farmers in the state will be determined.
The chairman of the National Farmers Union (AFAN) Benue State chapter, Comrade Aondongu Saaku who said that he has farmed three hectares of rice farm, noted that some farmers planted the rice in June while those in short-term farming do so during the harvest season expected in late November or early December.
The AFAN chief added that rice farmers are using raw materials to kill aging vegetation, chemical particulates, and pesticides.
He expressed his concern about the animal challenges that threaten rice production, adding that farmers are making barriers, putting up ropes and clearing the land sidewalks to solve the problem.

He advised the public to celebrate prayers in care of ways to protect against Covid 19 infection.
Safety protocols should continue to be followed by health authorities especially at Eid prayers.

A Review of the National Electoral Commission (Nijer) was held.
The issue of respecting the deficit provided by national laws for gender identity and the aim of giving them full access to the electoral lobby being ushered in so that they can play a greater role in the governance lobby was one of the key issues discussed by the CNDP meeting as Dr Dita Idrissa spokesperson for the MRN alliance of the ruling party.
The liberal parties called our pupils have also adopted the proposal to bring women into political interest, starting from the point of giving them electoral tickets within political parties, as stated by the coalition leader of these parties, Mr Hambali Dodo.
Reviewing the process under which elections are held in Nijer is one of the requirements that the participants of this meeting have come to terms with because they are a way that can allow irregularities to be curbed.
But this request did not gain entry, because according to the electoral commission any legal amendment at this point about to take place is illegal.
The opposition which continues to boycott all electoral planning lobbies did not attend this meeting, a move linked to the lack of legitimacy they say has bedevilled the CENI electoral commission.
On December 13, 2020, local government elections are expected as the first round of presidential and pupils elections will be held after just 2 weeks (27).

A Black Man Is King, I Take Their Praise.
A film full of songs by singer Beyonc titled "Black is King," the Black Man is King continues to receive praise and praise around the world for his depiction of African culture.
In South Africa, where this 85 minute film is included, many say this is even beyond film.

This film made its debut titled "The Lion King: The Gift," the Lion King: The Gift.
Bara was filmed in the United States, South and West Africa, as well as Europe, and features several African musicians.
This film, released in July, received a lot of attention from audiences, but there were also critics.
Some say that Beyonc, who was born in Houston, Texas, USA, has borrowed illegal African content, especially the features that befell Africa in the film, though it has traditionally had no roots in Africa.
But in South Africa, there is a lot of joy in making this film.
Sibusiso Mathebula, a film student, said he was honored to be included in the filmmakers.
He said he was impressed by the film.
The film touches on many things that were not taught at school about black history.
He said it was when he saw the film that he began to see the story and the clothes she was wearing and the entire content of the film, which developed a lot more than expected.
Beyonc music lover Kgosi Motosoane says African pupils abroad - including American characters - have access to what some consider African cultural material.
He said he was just interested in the film.
Kgosi said women are largely blacklisted there step down in society.
So their disappearance into very impactful matters is so encouraging.
A student reading how to make films, Mathebula said Beyonc's film made him interested in starting the film so that he could spread more about Africa.
Euronews fans of Beyonc mused over one thing: If the Black Man Is King, then Beyonc is queen.

At a time when farmers are about to take advantage of their nomads in Nigeria, farmers in Sokoto state have begun to struggle with the threat posed by birds, which could hinder the thought crop.
The threat of red birds in Sokoto state is as cheering back in, considering that there have been signs of a good food season this year 2020.
On the dole, some local farmers embraced a traditional strategy to evict the birds as a young man named Faruk from the Dange Shuni area.
Sambo Abubakar, one of the local farmers, said the birds are now culling all the plants that started to grow on farms.
The chairman of the Association of Farmers of Nigeria Sokoto State chapter, Murtala Gagado Minannata, said that now in two-thirds of Sokoto state this is being affected.
He also said they are now waiting to hear the situation of local government areas in the state to put together a report to send to the state and federal Ministry of Agriculture to take action to help farmers.
The Federal Ministry of Agriculture official in charge of the department of bird and pesticide, Ya'u Neweri Kagara, said there was no more than a month to complete the spraying of bird flu in Sokoto area.
He added that the birds are coming in from the Republic of Nijer and Benin, and international business must have an agreement before the issue is jointly addressed.
In June, the federal government launched a bird spraying operation in 12 northern states of Nigeria that are neighbouring foreign countries by which the birds are coming into Nigeria.
But a resurgence of this problem may turn back the clock on the progress seen in agriculture which governments claim to be giving it special attention.

New COVID Support Funds Will Be Reintroduced in the US.
As figures show that the number of COVID cases continues to rise in the United States, Monday Republican pupils in the Senate are expected to introduce a funding bill.
It is thought that the support will be worth $1 trillion to ease the pain caused by the coronavirus pandemic in the country.
The plan comes days ahead of the expiration of the first funding relief deadline for millions of Americans who have lost their jobs due to the COVID pandemic.
On Sunday, after days of negotiations with Republican pupils in the National Assembly, the U.S. chief of staff, Mark Meadows and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the funding involved expanding the funding program for those who lost their jobs.
But according to them, this time, Americans will see 70 percent of their previous funding.
On Friday, the initial support deadline will end in which some package of funding is paid to those who have lost their jobs. They are also given 600 per week in addition to the one provided by states.
Republicans, however, argue that this program means some people who are paid get higher rates than they are paid when they work, when federal government subsidies are combined with those paid by the state.
But Democratic lawmakers, for their part, challenged that authority saying that noting the coronavirus pandemic is rising, some workers are not comfortable enough to return to their jobs.

The Federal Government has launched an agriculture programme for food production and employment.
The Federal Government has launched the Agriculture Programme For Food and Employment (AFGP), which is a branch of the Economic Sustainability Plan.
This farming programme has been launched to alleviate the stigma of farmers due to the Coronavirus pandemic.
This statement was made by the Minister of Agriculture, Sabo Nanono, at the launch in Katsina.
The statement was issued by the press spokesperson of the Ministry of Agriculture, Ezeaja Ikemefuna, on Thursday.
This initiative will address the stigma people have gone through as a result of the Coronavirus outbreak in the country and around the world.
The programme will also further inspire farmers to grow food, repair and transport links in Nigeria.
The minister, as reported, said the launch event represented over 1, 100,000 smallholder farmers across the country.
He said these number of over 1 million, 100,000 smallholder farmers are part of the Farmers Group under 6 companies including AFEX, Babangona, Value Seeds, Universal, Thrive Agric and Oxfam.
We will soon also unveil the second group B, of those who will benefit from this farming initiative.
Nanono reminded how President Muhammdu Buhari set up the Economic Recovery Committee from his disability after the Coronavirus outbreak.
He said one of the ways to revive the economy, including the AFJP Programme, with the fact that the programme will boost agriculture from being the cultivation of hand-in-hand food to modern and rich produce.
He said the scheme was made up of a plan by the government to distribute up to 100,000 tons of food to the scheme to tide the poor out of the shutdowns of food shortages and hunger during the Coronavirus pandemic.
He said within a year this stellar project is expected to inform 5 million to 10 million youths.
And it will provide about 10 million tons of food a hectare from 20,000 to 100, 000 per state, to at least 2.4 million farmers.
People need to know the 2019 legal code - the KCSF.
A coalition of independent civil society organizations in Kano State, the Kano Civil Society Forum (KCSF), in partnership with the European Union, the British Council, and the Law Enforcement and Anti-Corruption Commission (Romac), have put forward an awareness campaign based on the 2019 criminal justice code.
The meeting which took place at the Aminu Kano Democracy and Research Centre in Mumbayya House, took a look at the new laws and management of the community which were organised by 150 civil society organisations in Kano and journalists.
Speaking to the Chief Prosecutor, Dr. Noah Musa Idris, of the Bayero University School of Law, Kano, commented on some of the most complex laws.
Where he called for a look at some outdated laws as a result of legal travel and Modern.
In his statement, the chairman of the Kano State Civil Society (KCSF) Ibrahim Witya, said the lack of knowledge of the laws has played a huge role in the rights of the people and that there is a need to know how they are.
Some participants of the event which was the third such event, at the shores of the three Kano Senators, from civil society groups described how they viewed the regulatory framework and their message.
Our correspondent, Aminu Halilu Tudunwada, who attended the sensitisation meeting, gathered that the issues of some mediated laws which the nation is facing challenges have been discussed.
Those who often do not know their rights over them, being the law has more than 400 laws, that have made more awareness statements.
The New Register of Places of Worship in Nigeria is being debated.
SERAP, a human rights and economic development activist called SERAP, has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to reprimand the Minister of State for Justice Abubakar Malami and the Executive Director of the National Registry to stop the planned commencement of the registration of places of worship.
According to SERAP this action is like a violation of human rights as contained in the Nigerian Constitution.
Before human rights groups complained about this government action, various religious leaders had already made their appeal to the Buhari administration, saying that pupils should be reassigned to this law for inspection and approval, so that it would not clash with the constitutional freedoms of religion and welfare.
Pastor John Buro is a Christian leader in Kaduna state. He told Voice of America that this law is unconstitutional unless the government is seeking to ban worship or impose restrictions.
It should just use its methods to monitor and track all violators without putting in place a new law.
On his part, Dr Bashir Yankuzo, the bishop of the University of Science in Minna, said that while it is not wrong for the government to monitor companies and organisations for national security, it does not mean that the incentive to accept the rights of anyone or others will be compromised.
Now the expectation is that the government will listen to this public outcry.
How Akure University of Technology (FUTA) tried to crack down on PREMIUM TIMES online.
The Akure University of Technology (FUTA) has hired an experienced cybersecurity expert to crack down on PREMIUM TIMES, a prominent "online" newspaper in Nigeria.
This experienced crossing of the barriers to the internet has made every strategy for the hardest-hit people to access their sites, but it has not been successful.
He began his addiction to "hacking" since February 28, where he stationed his equipment munitions on campus, and carried out his attacks using the university's "data."
On the other hand when he tries to infiltrate PREMIUM TIMES internet hard drive and computer, he again attacks another GSM phone.
Five days cur spent poaching the entrance to the site of the PREMIUM TIMES Great Archive, but he was unsuccessful, despite using various high-tech munitions.
He did not succeed in infiltrating, because the university did not know that PREMIUM TIMES had a clear plan for it, which built the precinct and the bed of the door by a dagger was not enough to smash it.
Then PREMIUM has the security giants of its Great Internet Archive including the King of the Battle of PREMIUM TIMES and the Great Depression, PREMIUM TIMES Web Warning.
These security forces who have modern experience in crushing any group of multiple or a barden who seek to mumble alone, or perform martyrdom are trying to attack the PREMIUM TIMES Information Archive.
What is meant by Sidratul-Muntaha that the Quran has mentioned?
8 a.m. he started stabbing and sliding the door of the PREMIUM TIMES Great Archive, to see how he would make a suicide and break in, ruining the hard drive completely.
He failed in the night, and the next morning, 6: 15 he became addicted to luck again, this time by using the "WPScan," which is being done to identify the strength or impotence of the security measures of adult Internet sites such as PREMIUM TIMES.
After 90 minutes, he began to attempt to infiltrate the digital skills of the machine, the "custom script."
In the morning, he made every effort by sidelining the computer software in order to completely lock down PREMIUM TIMES.
How the Goa Treated the Key Monkey:
This plaintiff did not know that PREMIUM TIMES had disproportionately treated small rats and large monkeys entering the land of their social networks to crack down on a page or seize a tricycle.
It was his lack of knowledge that caused all the parcels he used, completely old looks that could not do PREMIUM TIMES any harm or harm.
On this day he suffered futile exhaustion because he went through a DDOS attack at the NTP Likau Secretariat, which is an old method that has been used since Kano's village.
March 3, he performed every remaining technique in his brain and mind, but all failed.
The attempt to break the door of the PREMIUM TIMES General Archive came just days after PREMIUM TIMES published a comparison of the takeover between President Muhammadu Buhari's Adviser on Security, Babagana Monguno and former Head of State, Late Abba Kyari.
Some inside the Federal University of Technology in Akure, gulped to PREMIUM TIMES that the university had recruited a cavalry of large rats who were infiltrating Internet sites, so that they could target the page and the Great Archive of PREMIUM TIMES, destroy or destroy it.
However, when PREMIUM TIMES contacted the FUTA university, it distanced itself from this attempt to try to attack the PREMIUM TIMES Internet Archive.
FUTA said unless only a tamper with a student at the university tried it alone, not a FUTA spokesman.

Never miss important updates! Never miss important updates! Never miss important updates! Never miss important updates! Never miss important updates! Never miss important updates!
Yarrawan groups vowed in the petition after the meeting, saying only a change in the Nigerian constitution would save the country from its dire situation, especially in terms of security and the economy.
The leadership present at the joint meeting included Afenifere pa Reuben Fashoranti, professor Banji Akintoye chairman of Yoruba World Congress and then former Ondo State governor Dr. Olusegun Mimiko.

While the Kano State government has reduced its budget for the year by about N70 billion due to the negative impact the coronavirus pandemic has had on the state economy, the state House of Assembly has passed a new law governing the state government finances.
But good governance groups say that the issue of law enforcement is simple, but implementation is the challenge.
Creating a new direction of running government funds based on democracy is part of the purpose of the new law in Kano state which has since been developed at the federal level and in some Nigerian states.
The majority leader of the Kano State House of Assembly, Hon. Kabiru Hassan Dashi, told Voice of America that the law will give employers and the state government a theory of how to spend their money, along with how the state will market its money.
That rule is now welcomed by good governance groups, as long as it will be revised times.
The Director of the Organization for Community Civic Engagement in Kano State, Comrade Abdulrazak Alkali said they hoped government officials, and the state government would effectively enforce the law.
But the Kano State Commissioner for Finance and Economic Affairs Alhaji Shehu Na'Allah said they were well prepared to work out the rule of law.
The governor of Kano state, Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, had already signed this new law late last week and was immediately expected to take effect.

We have a lot to do with it.
James said.
However, he predicted that the Edo State governorship election was the first election for INEC during the coronavirus.
On this basis he said the electoral commission has come up with guidelines for the conduct of the election in this situation.

Atyap, Hausa-Fulani Achieve Peace Agreement With Them.
The communities of the Atyap, Fulani and communal communities that live in Zangon Kataf Local Government Area of Kaduna State have managed to complete a negotiation meeting, to create lasting peace in their own region.
The participants who expressed their determination and intention to see peace and forgiveness, denounced the killings and vandalism of property in their own region.

How Ganduje made the princes sacked by King Ado and Sanusi, he will make them kings in Kano.
Governor Abdullahi Ganduje wants the Kano State House of Assembly to amend the 2019 state law, thereby ensuring the appointment of two senior Kano emirates by the late Emir Ado Bayero and King Sanusi, so that state law will ensure their appointment as senior appointees in Kano.
The Kano Assembly Speaker, Abdullahi Gafasa, read the Ganduje request before the House of Representatives, and they are expected to have a session to discuss the matter before the end of July.
The princes who were brought back to Kano Emirate were Aminu Babu Dan'agundi and, who made the Emir of Dawaki Mai Tuta and Cyrus Kano, Sanusi Ado-Bayero.
The two were removed by King Ado and King Muhammadu Sanusi, over alleged constipation.
The Great Son challenged his impeachment in court.
17 years of legal wrangling until the Supreme Court ruled that it had stalled.
He said, "I have no idea what I am doing."
Ado Bayero removed Son in 2003 after being convicted of constipation and embezzlement in a political incident.
A committee was set up to investigate him, but he was invited to refuse to go before the committee to defend himself.
He then challenged his removal in the Kano State High Court up to the Supreme Court.
Before the Court of Appeal, the Federal Court of Appeal ruled that Aminu Babu be reinstated to his seat.
But the Emir of Kano under the rule of Muhamamdu Sanunmsi II, appealed, with the Court of Appeal emphasizing his removal as Hakimin Gabasawa, also the Emir of Dawaki Mai Tuta, on June 5.
After Sanusi Bayero was removed, Cyrus Kano for refusing to accept the Emir of Kano appointed Muhammdu Sanusi II in June, 2014.
He was later appointed Chairman of the National Ports Authority in the Jonathan era.
He was appointed Wamban Kano, under the current Emir of Kano.

NAPTIP apprehended transporters, rescued 71 in Kano state.
Never miss important updates! NAPTIP Kano state chapter has apprehended three sailors and rescued 71 persons from their custody in the state.
The Board of Directors of Kano State Shehu Umar made this known Friday in a meeting with the News Agency of Nigeria.
He said the agency had targeted the transporters after receiving siri information on transport services in the state.
For this reason, the agency hunted these men from July 15 to 19 where they were successfully intercepted.
Of the three we intercepted two were Cameroonian pupils one Nigerian and their age was both 21 to 36.
These men were arrested while on the way to Algeria, Morocco and Libya.
After that 18 of the 71 persons to be transported from Cameroon were among them 14 men, 4 women.
The remaining 19 are from Nigeria, 11 men, 8 women all and pupils from Kano state.

Trying To Deliberate and Seeking My Self Is a Mind - Leadership Newspaper.
In Longyuan village of Hongsipu region of Wuzhong, Ningxia, Hui Autonomous Region, in northwestern China.
There is a determined woman named Li Yaomei or Sadiya (her Islamic name) who is famous for her struggles in life and her success in her efforts to get out of poverty.
Her story tells us that the effort, determination, and self-seeking are at heart.
At first, she was Li Yaomei or Sadiya. She never sat in class with the aim of taking lessons, making her unable to read bare text.
However, God has given her the gift of insight, patience, and wisdom.
About 20 years ago, Ms. Li Yaomei, suffered from stomach cancer, leading to surgery on her stomach 3 times.
After her recovery, she encountered a serious accident. She is now walking with a metal placed in her foot.
These challenges have hit her hard in addition to health, even the issue of medical expenses, which is why she received a loan of about 3 hundred thousand yuan, worth more than $16 million.
Ironically, the challenge Ms. Sadiya faced slipped away from her a way of choosing and scrambling to make her life better.
Then the support of the Chinese government increased her confidence.
Her business is to broach different species based on vegetation use.
Because of her naivety, her profession has grown exponentially, with various employers ordering her crumbs.
In addition, she invented several machines that helped her simplify the process.
For example, she takes 15 minutes to attach one large broom, but now in this time, she will attach up to 5 brooms.
In addition, she has developed some additional machines that clean the weeds she repels.
Then there are more machines that clean her pet food, and now even sell these machines to applicants.
Given the challenges Ms. Sadiya has gone through, and the efforts she still makes to improve her life and that of her staff, it will be understood that the applicant is indeed with the receipt.
The task of fighting poverty and betterment is not entirely on the government.
If the government is to provide support, but people have no frustrations or desire to improve their quality of life by finding themselves jobs based on their situation, the egg yolk alone will continue to be done without achieving any goals.
Her story shows that running a business or income project does not require any large sums of money or trips to other towns or abroad.
For her to consider her condition, she used the resources available in her environment to make her life better.
Moreover, educator Sadiya carried out these tasks on standing by her foot without relying on her husband, in order to flee and leave her.
That is to say, efforts, determination, self-determination are at heart.
It then shows how powerful women are to change their lives and stand by their shoulders without asking someone else for help.
This is also a lesson that, whatever one has to do, he should stand by his shoulders, because relying on someone else is uncertain.
Ms. Sadiya was indeed a committed, smart and hapless woman who became an example and a role model for others.
Also, by March this year, Ms. Sadiya had completed the payment of all her loans and also stopped receiving support from the government over her own whisky.

In a statement issued on Monday, February 13, by the president of the All Progressives Congress (APC)
In recent days, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has expressed concern over the steps taken by some countries to preserve the COVID-19 respiratory vaccine that is hoped to have been developed, noting that priority must be avoided on the communities of different countries, while sharing the vaccine for the pandemic.
And the vaccine should be distributed in a timely manner across the world, as it will be in line with the great interests of different countries.
Some US politicians are indeed implementing the policy of prioritising their own interests, regarding vaccine sharing, and also undermining international cooperation in the fight against the pandemic.
Currently, the overall number of confirmed COVID cases worldwide has already topped 23 million.
In the total, there are people who have lost their lives to the virus of more than 800 thousand.
Under such severe circumstances, the focus is increasingly on the effectiveness of the vaccine, and the good news is that in recent days, there have been great results in vaccine studies in other countries, creating hope, and faith in the entire international community.
But sadly, some US politicians have expressed desire to seize the vaccine.
Even the journal "Science" noted that the U.S. government has already brokered deals to buy COVID-19 vaccines worth more than $6 billion, from several pharmaceutical companies.
While the policy of the US government is understood to be the US at the forefront of the spread of the virus, other developing countries also need the vaccine pilots, considering they are more likely to suffer from limited medical resources.
The journal "The Ecologist" also pointed out that if the United States achieves the goal of mass vaccination, the number of vaccines available to developing countries will decrease.
Chicken lika executive director of Africa CDC Mr. John Nkengasong, also expressed concern over this issue.
As some commentators have noted, even if a vaccine is successfully developed, it is impossible to achieve the goal of seeing beyond the pandemic unless the vaccine is designed to be distributed, which is a very important international issue.
And the international community is right to strengthen their cooperation.
WHO Director-General Tedros, too, pointed out that if it is to see beyond the pandemic, it must be curbed from all fields across the world, making it impossible for some parts of the world, or a few other countries to achieve the goal of recovering from the impact of the pandemic alone.

We Must Go Back to the Truth In Nigeria.
Never miss important updates! A former chairman of the National Court of Appeal, Shariah Umaru Abdullahi (Wallin Hausa) has said that the sighting of the Katsina State Government, by bandits, was a serious mistake and a waste of money.
Because it has not been effective or symbolic of ending the killings of pupils that have plagued Katsina state.
Justice Umaru Abdullahi made this known during a special interview with newsmen at his residence in Katsina, including Leadership Today.
After the completion of the laying of the foundation for the construction of the Women and Children's Room, with twenty-five beds, which will be built by a businessman at Katsina City General Hospital, who is the Chairman of the Conference.
The chairman of the National Court of Appeal, however, added that the sighting of the gun was not supposed to be carried out.
Because he said, he would be asked by a terrorist to bring a gun to him two hundred and fifty thousand, and when he returned to the bush, he bought an AK 47 rifle.
In a statement issued on Monday, February 13, by the minister of state for petroleum resources, Rotimi Akeredolu, the minister of state for petroleum products and petroleum products, said the minister of state for petroleum products and petroleum products.
In the past, the Ministry of Animal Welfare was in the northern province, and every year the Government at all levels budgeted on farmers only, but they were herders other than them. There must be reforms and justice, and there will be lasting peace.
But this war will not give birth to this country with an eye-catching Son, because all of them are pupils. Reconciliation is the right path.
Do it and with good intentions, there will be peace.
We are not alone.
The future of our children and grandchildren is going to live the future.
In this world there has never been a war with a gun that ends with a gun, on the table it is reconciled.
Security experts say that terrorists are not reconciled. This is a grotesque decision because even if the U.S. says it is not negotiating with terrorists, their own terrorists are not U.S. citizens, they are attacked by people of another country.
We are the citizens of this country.

The Executive Secretary of FEPSAN, Mr. Gideon Negedu, has been briefed on the efforts of FEPSAN to tackle mismanagement practices that pollute compost in the country.
According to FEPSAN Executive Secretary Mr. Gideon Negedu, the cost of composting which is now legal will be very helpful in addressing the issue.
Also, the Executive Secretary of FEPSAN Mr. Gideon Negedu said that it would also allow the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development to use the law to punish anyone caught polluting fertilizers.
The Executive Secretary of FEPSAN Mr. Gideon Negedu also issued two new numbers of poker lodges that the public will call for exposing the perpetrators of the prohibition as such, 08175077773 and 08175777724.

He also noted that the organisation has done a lot of work to curb the shortage of compost, this is, the only way we have done a lot of work.
The Executive Secretary of FEPSAN Mr. Gideon Negedu We have worked on a legal framework.
He also said that the FEPSAN as a group under the leadership of Mr. Thomas had worked diligently to turn the bill into law.
FEPSAN Executive Secretary Mr. Gideon Negedu said there was much they could do.
The law was passed into law.
He said that any FEPSAN member knows to break the proximity of fertilizers, and not only that, every FEPSAN member is encouraged to ensure that he takes note of the quality of his fertilizers because there are legal penalties in that law when he destroys fertilizers.
"We have worked on this and are working on it to ensure that together with the Ministry of Agriculture which is presiding over them, they are the ones enforcing the law."
FEPSAN Executive Secretary Mr. Gideon Negedu We are working with them to ensure that there is a good quality pursuit.
The Executive Secretary of FEPSAN Mr. Gideon Negedu said FEPSAN has its own monitoring committee to work from time to time to investigate, but the idea is that as soon as we can get these things done we can now have the Ministry of Agriculture or the Ministry of Civil Engineering that directly implements this law.

The South African president has made a bewildering statement because of the corruption in the ruling ANC.
Cyril Ramaphosa, in a letter Sunday, August 23, sent to all members of the ANC, began by citing the issue of deliveries on contracts to help the country fight the coronavirus.

This decency of millions of South African pupils affected by the COVID situation will not be forgiven, facing daily hunger, and lack of jobs.
In the letter Ramaphosa also wrote that millions of national money that should be used to improve transport, provide infrastructure for the poor, and better electricity, help black farmers developing and develop the whole country, which the wicked stole and put in their pockets.

The Nigeria Bureau of Statistics has announced that the economy has experienced an unprecedented recession in the past 10 years, with a recession surpassing the more than 6 percent seen between April and June this year.
Figures released today by the Commission show that between April and June, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic that has engulfed countries around the world and the suspension of normal activities, the Nigerian economy entered a state that never entered between 2010 and 2020.
The agency listed the reasons for the problem including forcing people to stay home across the country, banning vehicle traffic, banning flights and closing schools and businesses.
The agency added that similar measures in countries around the world have caused oil prices to fall sharply, while factories in countries around the world have also been closed to tackle the problem.
In May, Nigerian Finance Minister Zainab Ahmed said the Bureau of Statistics predicted a fall in such a situation, as a result of these problems that have hindered day-to-day operations, forcing the government to slash its budget.

Yobe Pledges Over N78.8m in Recovery of Leda Corporation.
The efforts of the Yobe State government, under Governor Mai Mala Buni, have been commended for revitalising the plastic and plastic bags, owned by the state (Yobe state Polythene Bag and Woben sacks Company), after over 10 years in the flock not working.
This was disclosed by the chairman of the company (General Manager), Engr. Sha'aib Adamu Gadaka, in a conversation with our representative at his office in Damaturu, Yobe state capital, earlier in the week.
He said that the company has been in lockdown for over 10 years, but after the arrival of Governor Buni it was difficult to forge a restructuring plan, which immediately ordered the disbursement of N78.8 million to rehabilitate key parts of the company with an additional N48 million of management, while allowing the company to step on its feet.
Eng. Gadaka further stated that this gave them the opportunity to buy the products needed to start working in the company, including a new 500 KbA power supply device, a 500 KbA power distribution device, a 500 KbA power distribution device, a new vacuum cleaner, a vacuum cleaner (modern) and other equipment that the company needs.
He said, "Even today, the main objective of Governor Buni's move to revitalise this company is to create jobs for the youth, reduce social distancing and provide Yobe state with income."
Gadaka said.
On the other hand, he said the company has won the favor of masaya hajar it alleges, as the state government has revitalised the flour and animal feed plant (Yobe Flour and Feed Mill) in Potiskum and other traders who are targeting the produce produced by the company.
He said that the flare-up and the attempts by the state government to rehabilitate the composting company are also an outlet for the procurement of goods controlled by the company.
On the other hand, he said, "There are some challenges that we are facing, on the basis that the company has been in lockdown for over 10 years, while the machines are starting to work but there is a need to shift us to other products in order to be able to operate without any fear."
Which we expect before our operations kick off, we will try to bring in other products that we need.
Furthermore, Gadaka said, "On the other hand, we are asking the Yobe government to give us more equipment, a truck and vehicles that we will be using to do our jobs more easily, especially for transporting our workers to the office so as to avoid coming late, when we start working on the bed."
He also said that in the current situation, the company has sent 25 youths to train how to work with drinkers and machines as well as manage the products used by the company in its operations and how to interact with the people they are in contact with.
He said the company has now started producing various types of plastic bags, which include even the size of 100kg, 50kg and 25kg as well as offering footprints to traders depending on the colour and nature of their bags. The company is ready to satisfy them.
