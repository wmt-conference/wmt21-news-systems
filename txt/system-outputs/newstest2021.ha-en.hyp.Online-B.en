China Achieves Food Achievement Success - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
Food is the lifeblood of all living things, and we cannot live without food.
That is why the Chinese government is working harder to ensure food security for its people.
In the 71 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the country has made great strides in the field of food security. .
Zhang Wufeng, chairman of the China Grain and Agricultural Products Administration, said that since 1949, China has made significant contributions to eradicating world hunger. China has always put the issue of hunger at the forefront of all national affairs.
But in recent days, some people and some Western media have once again expressed "concern" over the question of whether China can nurture its own people in the shadow of the COVID-19 pandemic. ?
We thank them very much for always keeping an eye on the Chinese presence in the world.
Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the country has made great strides in food security through its efforts.
The issue of adequate food supply for the Chinese is one of the main topics of the ruling CPC's daily agenda.
Last weekend, General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee and President of the People's Republic of China Xi Jinping issued an important order to stop wasting food, noting that everyone knows that it is a work in progress.
Although the effects of COVID-19, which has plagued the world this year, are also hurting China's economy, China will be able to provide enough food for its people.

Huang Jikun, director of the China Agricultural Policy Research Center at Peking University, said in an interview with The China Science Daily that the biggest challenge facing China now is within two years. or the next three, or China could reduce the amount of wheat and rice it stores in grain mills.
Now the average grain yield is 474 kilograms instead of the 400 kilograms that every person in the world should get every year.
And now China imports millions of tons of agricultural products just for raising livestock.
Therefore, those who are concerned should calm down, take a bath and go to sleep, or focus on the internal affairs of their country.
The Chinese are able to raise their own food.

BBC Hausa has published an interview with Mamman Daura in which she explains.
This rotation process in Nigeria's presidential election has not resulted in an eye-opener that began in 1999.
Instead, Daura said the focus should be on determining who is eligible and not on the rotation process.
However, the Inyamirai, an Igbo, responded to Daura's remarks.
They said it was only when he and his brother President Buhari took over the reins of government that he would come out and say he was recommending that this not be done in 2023.

They have ousted Jonathan, and now Daura is vying for the presidency of Nigeria in the 2023 elections.
He has to sort out what he has snatched from his current brother-in-law, and then he will come up with an unfamiliar issue of rotation in 2023.
He should as an elder embrace the truth and hold it well.
Not only did he come out with the presidency in 2023, but the presidency was also selfish.

It shows the lack of civilization in the development of the youth of this country.

I urge our youth, especially social media users, to come together to protect the integrity of the North and its independence, and to create a system that will make a difference for all.
As our late Northern leaders such as Sardaunan Sakkwato, the first Northern Prime Minister Sir Ahmadu Bello, and his cronies aspire to provide for the people of the North.
It has been reported that the late leader of the fight against oppression and poverty, Malam Aminu Kano, once said that Nigeria is one nation, but everyone knows his father's house!
So we say, of course, as we call for national development and governance, at every level, we are further calling for the unity of the people of the North, regardless of religion or ethnicity, to bring about to our region to develop.
If we look at the North, it is not the same now.
We should therefore use our God-given talents to contribute and advise, to provide the North with a satisfactory way to revitalize its economy.
The North should provide revenue streams to implement its budget without waiting for the federal government to spend money.
In addition, if we want to develop the North, we must focus on education, agriculture, tourism, health and science and technology.
We don't have to contribute money, there are different ways to do it.
We believe that the North will fulfill the aspirations of our forefathers!
North is something we are proud to say.

But in South Africa, those who made the film are very happy.
Sibusiso Mathebula, a student of filmmaking, said he was honored to be included in the cast.

The film touches on many things that were not taught in school about black history.
He said it was only when he saw the film that he first saw the story and the clothes she was wearing and all the elements of the film, which developed a lot more than expected.

He said he was interested in the film.
Kgosi said black women are mostly at the grassroots level in society.
So their emergence in such highly influential issues is encouraging.
Mathebula, a film student, says Beyoncé's film inspired him to start making his own film to spread the word about Africa.
Beyoncé's Africans agree on one thing: If Man's Mouth is King, then Beyonce is queen.

There is a brave woman named Li Yaomei or Sadiya (her Islamic name) who is famous for her struggles in life and her success in trying to get out of poverty.
Her story tells us that effort, perseverance, and self-seeking are things that are in the heart.
At first, Li Yaomei or Sadiya never sat in class to study, so she could not read or write.
However, God has endowed her with a wealth of ingenuity, talent and wisdom, making her a model in the fight against poverty.
About 20 years ago, Li Yaomei was diagnosed with colon cancer, which led to her undergoing three operations on her abdomen.
After regaining consciousness, she suffered a serious accident and is now walking with the implant in her foot.
These challenges have put her in a difficult position in addition to her health, as well as the issue of medical bills, which is why she has taken out a loan of about 300,000 yuan, equivalent to more than N16 million.
Surprisingly, this challenge faced by Malama Sadiya has been a source of inspiration and inspiration for her to improve her life.
The support from the Chinese government has also strengthened her.
Her job is to make different types of brooms based on the use of grass.
As a result of her hard work, her profession has flourished, with various companies ordering her to pick up.
In addition, she has created several machines that help her simplify the task.
For example, it used to take 15 minutes to assemble one large broom, but now during this time, it will assemble up to 5 brooms.
In addition, it provides some additional cleaning machines that restore the broom.
Then there are the extra machines that clean the animal feed for women, and now these machines are still available to buyers.
Given the challenges that Ms. Sadiya has faced, and the ongoing efforts she is making to improve her life and that of her staff, it is clear that the applicant is with me.
Fighting poverty and improving the quality of life is not the sole responsibility of the government.
If the government is going to provide support, but the people are not motivated or interested in improving their lives by finding jobs based on their situation, then the backlash will continue. with the achievement of a goal.
Her story shows that running a business or earning a living does not require any large sums of money or travel to other cities or abroad.
Because she is aware of her situation, she uses the resources available to her to improve her life.
In addition, Ms. Sadiya performed these tasks on her own feet without relying on her husband, for he ran away and left her.
In other words, effort, perseverance, and self-seeking are at the heart of it.
It also shows the power of women to change their lives and stand on their own two feet without seeking anyone else's help.
This is also a lesson that shows that, whatever a person does, he should stand on his own two feet, because dependence on someone is uncertain.
Malama Sadiya is a courageous, intelligent and talented woman who is a role model and role model for others.
Also, by March this year, Ms. Sadiya had paid off all her debts and stopped receiving support from the government at her own discretion.
