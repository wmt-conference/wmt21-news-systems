Why I left the PDP.
Former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara has explained some reasons why he left the PDP and returned to APC.
It will be recalled that the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, left the PDP and returned to APC this week.
Dogara said when he stood by and suffered the mistreatment of Governor Bala of the PDP in Bauchi State that helped him ultimately win the 2019 general election, Gara collapsed and left the party and returned to his home state of APC.
The main reason why I voted is that the PDP governs Bauchi State.
Everybody knows what role I played in the state governorship election in which the former Abuja minister, Bala Mohammed beat the incumbent governor, Mohammed Abubakar.
But now nine scandals and chokeholds in Bala's government.
Instead of staying in the PDP, I am allowed to do what I am allowed to do to avoid my place, and go back to where I came from.
Dogara wrote a letter from the PDP in which he sent a letter to the party chairman of his constituency, Bogoro C, in Bauchi State.
He lastly said that as he repeatedly pointed out to other governors where they had failed and where to fix it in the past, he and Bala were not anointed with oil.
Gara walked in and allowed them.
Fires broke out at an oil refinery in Kano.
The blaze broke out around 10 p.m., which lasted almost two hours, despite the fact that officers from the Kano State Fire Service, security forces and the community were on the scene.
During Freedom Radio's visit to the site, she found the people in close proximity to various security agencies at the location everywhere, being connected to the main bus station known as Kuka station, in which passengers were being transported from Kano to other states and also to the neighboring countries of the country.
Apart from the Water Gate Market which is outstanding in Northern Nigeria.
Freedom Radio quoted some eyewitnesses, who said the explosion had resulted in the loss of life among the public.
A bus driver at Kofar Water station said they were working with patrol officers to escape passengers who were involved in the collision.
The Kano State Fire Service confirmed the incident, saying that as of the time of commissioning this report it was continuing to gather information to identify the causes and losses caused by the blaze, the spokesman of Sa'idu Muhammad Ibrahim said.
Meanwhile, reports emerged that there were some batteries that attempted to break into the Water Gate Market to steal, but police and patrol officers attempted to disperse them and guard the community's properties.
In this regard, we have contacted the spokesman of the Kano State Police Command DSP Abdullahi Haruna Kiyawa, who confirmed the incident.
Drug KORONA: We have not yet finished testing the efficacy of the drug combined in Nigeria.
As European countries continue to conduct tests for the efficacy of Corona vaccine combined, Nigeria is also unstable in integrating and testing its drugs.
The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration (NAFDAC) has said that it is conducting 40 trials of Corona cure drugs that have been developed by traditional medicine makers.
Chairman Mojisola Adeyeye made the announcement on Tuesday in Abuja.
Mojisola said the drug's efficacy was being tested so as not to seek obesity.
Since the appearance of the coronavirus pandemic, traditional medicine practitioners have taken to Twitter to see if they are also unstable enough to see the drug combined.
Many of them have submitted their medicine to the cabinet for testing and assessing its efficacy.
NAFDAC has also set certain criteria and rules for the treatment.
The drug's efficacy in animals will be tested for the first time in pot.
Mojisola warned therapists not to tempt any medication without the agency giving the opportunity.
In May, NAFDAC revealed that only a handful of newspapers and newspapers were seeing stories of people claiming to have discovered traditional medicine to cure coronavirus.
Adeyeye explained that even one person had approached the NAFDAC and asked it to look into the efficacy of the drug, which he claimed included traditional medicine, which he said could cure Coronavirus.
That is also the case with the other person, and it is not the cure for the disease that gidigat said he found out.
He said he had discovered a cure for the symptoms of the illness that are thought to be the symptoms of the infection.
However, some therapists have since approached the commission with their own cooperation.
Ramaphosa faced questions in parliament.
This is the first time in a series of interviews that President Ramaphosa has faced in front of lawmakers since a wave of corruption between top officials in his government and some members of his own government.
Ramaphosa has made an appointment to deepen research and also to bring about reform in the area responsible for overseeing the covid-19 response.
South Africa ranks fifth in the global list of countries hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, but the president says corruption plays an important role in the country's fight against the disease.
Saturday Nigeria Open International Airports.
Authorities in Nigeria have said they will open airports for flights out and coming into the country, from Saturday onwards, for the first time after five months of closure.
Since March 23 the government has banned flights, in view of the spread of coronavirus.
The government said the first four planes to be imported from overseas would begin landing in Abuja.
Then Lagos, but it has not been revealed where these flights will come from.
According to Civil Aviation Minister Hadi Sirika, the decision to open this is to see how there are no problems since the opening of domestic flights on July 8.
Sirika, added that all necessary regulations would be ensured in view of the successful return of flights.
591 COVID-19 Deaths in Nigeria Recovered.
On Friday, 591 new COVID-19 cases were reported.
With this new number of people infected with Covid-19 in the country, the death toll rose to 39,539 and 16,559 have recovered and 845 have died.
The Nigeria Center for Disease Control and Prevention, NCDC, has issued a record number of people and states on Twitter.
There have been more Corona cases in our team - Marseille.
Marseille, meanwhile, in the country, say three more players have tested positive for coronavirus after five deaths last week.
The association made the announcement in a statement released to reporters on Tuesday.
Moreover, the association said the French League 1 season that was originally scheduled to start last Friday had been postponed due to five positive COVID-19 cases.
Marseille also said it had already notified stakeholders in preparing for League 1, as a result of an increase in three cases after the first five deaths, in order to find a solution to the situation.
APC Urges Niger Governor to Praise Tarzoma In Party - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
In a statement released by the APC this week, the APC accused the Governor of Niger State, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, of attempting to bring dissent within the party.
The document, which was signed by Engineer Muhammad Jibrin Imam and Party Secretary Barista Muhammed Liman, stated that during the six years since the party ruled the state, only N512 million has been received.
The document goes on to say that the governor's call for a stakeholder meeting, which he chaired last Sunday night, will help to continue to bring together the party, in which they say they have written to the party's national secretary the developments in the state.
According to Engineer Imam, "we understand the Governor of Niger State has been trying to divert the attention of party members by organizing a stakeholder meeting, which is illegal, so that any complaint that is being made against party leaders is written to the secretary of the association by the association, so that they can investigate."
He said that so far in the six years since the founding of the party, 512 million naira has been in the party's account.
He said what he understood as the governor was that he was part of the National Executive Committee which was set up July 25, 2020, led by the president to lead the preparation of problems among party members and withdraw court complaints from party members.
He said the money we received was to pay the salaries of the staff of the party's secretariat as well as other union work, gubernatorial elections and to stabilize some of the problems of union affairs such as health support due to lack of access to government support, not any party money we spent illegally, we challenge each one to bring us an excuse to misappropriate union funds.
According to me, the last assembly elections in the state were the most important election in the country which we had with former commissioners and current commissioners in all the twenty-five local government areas in the state, in which the money spent in the elections was distributed to the commissioners of their respective constituencies.
In that regard, it is a mistake for anybody to say that union funds are being spent illegally, that is almost unfair and to try to give the defendant a bad name by trying to hang him up, to say that neither committee has set up a committee to investigate how union funds were spent and who set it up.
Out of the money that the complainant claimed was misappropriated, the money was donated by the national secretariat of the association, and I am not raising any such money so I challenge each one on this matter to bring his testimony to prove this allegation in any way.
Imam Khomeini said we stand firm in protecting the APC from attempts by anyone or group to disrupt the party, adding that any allegation against the party or any party leader from the state level will be written to the committee that oversees the affairs of the party as described in section 21 (B) (bi), (d) on page 82 of the party system.
Party stakeholders therefore have no role to play, especially when they attempt to take over the committee so their judgement has no impact.
For this reason, they are the valid leaders of the party that are recognised in the state, in compensation for the 21st and sixth paragraphs on page 87 of the party's constitution, and any eventuality that this may not be used.
It is because of the decision of the leaders to make a mistake.
He said those who presented with approval at yesterday's book session at the unimproved meeting, chaired by Alhaji Abubakar Magaji, General Muhammed Garba, Hon. Ahmed Dogonkoli, including Alhaji Ibrahim Balarabe and all commissioners, were not members of the association's executive committee in the state.
The executive committee of the All Progressives Congress (APC) will be led by only party leader Engineer Mohammed Imam, and the governor will not be led by state party leaders.
The statement added that Governor Abubakar Sani Bello recalled that the issue of fulfilling the promises that were made to the people of the state during the elections, as well as travelling with union parents in the government so that everyone would benefit in the state and all parties by giving political positions, which is the problem of the Governor and the association.
The document credits federal lawmakers for refusing to attend the meeting and for drawing attention to reconciliation on all problems among party members, this is not surprising for legislators who are aware of their own pain and who refuse to accept arrest as a party law.
Therefore, there is a need for the chairman of the National Executive Committee to attract the attention of Governor Abubakar Sani Bello on the appropriate position not to attempt to disrupt the politics of the state.
Nigeria ready for Internet Economy - Freedom Radio Nigeria
The Minister of Communication and Economic Development, Dr Isa Ali, Pantami said the country was ready for a revolution in the internet economy.
He said the government was ready to work shoulder to shoulder with experts at universities and other stakeholders to see that the country is constantly troubled in any case of modern technology.
Dr Isa Ali Fantami made the remarks during an international conference on the development of communication technology which was held via the internet.
The minister added that one of the first steps the government has taken to see that the country is being concerned about communication technology is to change the name of the ministry from the Ministry of Communications to the Ministry of Telecommunications and Economic Development.
How food insecurity is damaging to the health of people in Nigeria.
Some scientists have warned people to avoid eating foods that prevent food from deteriorating that eating such foods harms a person's health.
The experts issued the warning after a study conducted on the quality of the food in the country.
The results of the study showed that there are certain foods that are pumped into them to prevent them from lining up.
The research also shows that the same ingredients are commonly used in beans, pork flour and dried fish that are preserved in public.
The ingredient is used because if a person sees it he will be interested in buying it.
Eating foods that contain this ingredient cause cancer, kidney disease, heart attacks and so on.
The people of this country have been called on to focus on conservation from the consumption of such food items for their health.
It will be recalled that expert dietitian Grace Olasumbo has called on Nigerians to avoid eating grinding treats with Calcium Carbide.
Olasumbo explained that Sindarin Calcium Carbide is an ingredient most traders use to grind crude treats, that is, luxuries.
Research shows that greed and greed are among the factors that make it difficult for shoppers to use this ingredient because within a day it belongs to treats.
Olasumbo explained that another factor that traders have failed to identify is the use of this ingredient to target people's health.
For this reason, diseases including vomiting and diarrhoea, eye pain, stomach bloating, throat bloating, mouth, liver and so on.
President of the African Development Bank has been barred from criticising - Freedom Radio Nigeria.
The expert committee chaired by former Prime Minister of Ireland Mary Robinson has bashed African AfDB President Akinwumi Adesina.
According to the committee, Mr. Akinwumi Adesina is not guilty of bribery charges.
The AFP news agency reported earlier this year that a fifteen-page report blamed six-year-old Mr. Adesina for his lack of ability to lead and enrich himself.
But the expert committee chaired by Robinson, Gambia's Chief Justice Hassan Jallow and the World Bank's vice president for goodwill, Leonard McCarthy, exonerated the former Nigerian minister of agriculture of all allegations against him.
The United States has previously insisted Adesina must be investigated over the allegations, following his departure from the AfDB, prompting an expert committee to investigate the scandal.
COVID-19 Hits Trump's Battle in Florida.
On Thursday, US President Donald Trump announced that he was cancelling the Repubican Convention for the Democratic ticket scheduled to be held in Jacksonville, Florida, next month due to an increase in coronavirus cases.
The convention is yet to be held in North Carolina.
Trump said in Jacksonville that holding a large gathering was not appropriate at this time.
President Trump shifted part of the GOP convention to Florida last month after they disagreed with Democrat leaders in North Carolina over holding a closed conference room with supporters without wearing face coverings.
A few Republican state representatives will gather in Charlotte, North Carolina, to officially vote for Trump on August 24.
Trump said he would make the remarks in a separate order.
Trump, who has been outspoken about the impact of the pandemic for months, has recently said that 99 percent of the cases seen in the U.S. have increased uncontrolled.
Buhari Will Not Receive Salaries.
The Chief Information Adviser to the President, Malam Garba Shehu, made the announcement in a statement issued by the palace on Wednesday.

Shehu said the decision was taken as a result of recommendations from the Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs to restrict the spread of Coronavirus.
President Muhammadu Buhari also stressed the steps recommended by the Council to avoid gatherings in which more people should be present.
At this year's Eid prayers, the president held Eid prayers at home with his family instead of going to a mosque the same way he normally would.

China Continues to Succeed its People's Food - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
Food is the spirit of life of all worlds, it is not possible to live compulsively except for food.
This is why Chinese authorities are increasingly sensitive to ensuring the country's food security.
In the 71 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, China has achieved major successes in the area of food security and has surprised the world with its large population, which according to estimates shows that the number of Chinese has passed 1.4 billion.
The efforts have contributed to the fact that China has made a major contribution to the eradication of hunger in the world, as the chairman of the China Grain and Agricultural Export Council Zhang Wufeng once said that since 1949 until now, China has always put the issue of addressing hunger before all the country's affairs processes.
But in recent days, some people and some Western media outlets have once again "expressed concern" over the issue - can China raise its own people in the shadow of the worldwide COVID-19 respiratory disease outbreak?
We thank them for being so new that they constantly take care of the Chinese presence in this world.
Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, China has achieved sufficient food production based on its efforts.
The issue of providing food to the Chinese is among the top agents of the ruling JKS party on a daily basis.
Late last week, the Executive Secretary of the JKS Supreme Committee, Xi Jinping, issued an important order to stop food waste, stating that everyone should be aware that any food insecurity and hardship caused by it are exacerbated.
Although this year the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak that has swept the globe is also having a devastating effect on the Chinese economy, China can provide sufficient food for its people.
Figures released by China's National Bureau of Statistics on the number of agricultural products, especially rice that China will receive this year, 2020 show that the amount of rice that was found in the country in the first quarter of 2020 was 27.29 million tons, an increase of 1.08 million tons, that is an increase of 3.9% compared to the same period in 2019.
Ke Bingsheng, also the former president of the National University of Agriculture, said China has made huge successes in facilitating the country's supply of food compared to the beginning of the implementation period of the policy of making changes at home and opening up to the outside world.
Huang Jikun, director of the Peking University China Agricultural Policy Center, said during a meeting with a reporter for "The China Science Daily," that the serious challenge China faces now is in the next 2 or three years, whether China can reduce the amount of wheat and rice it has stored in grain storage rooms.
Now the amount of grains each receives is 474 kilograms instead of the 400 kilograms that each person in the world should receive annually.
And now China has installed millions of tons of farm products to raise domesticated animals.
And so, those who are concerned about the issue should rest assured, bathe and sleep, or focus on their country's internal affairs.
The Chinese are able to raise themselves with the food they produce themselves.
Why I prosecuted Ganduje in court - Abba K. Yusuf - Freedom Radio Nigeria.
Kano State governorship candidate in the PDP Abba Kabir Yusuf has explained his reasons for prosecuting Kano State Governor Dr. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje and some other businessmen before the State High Court.
Abba Kabir made the remarks through his lawyer, Bashir Tudun Wuzirci, who said he filed the lawsuit, alleging that the ownership of some government buildings was benefitted by the people of Kano State.
In addition to the Kano State Governor and the businessmen, Abba Kabir Yusuf also filed a lawsuit against the State Ministry of Works, Housing and Transportation, and the Attorney General of Kano State Commissioner for Justice and the State Pilgrims Board.
Abba Kabir Yusuf has accused the Kano State government of possessing some precious ancient Daula hotels that are now under the supervision of Wudil town's University of Science and Technology and Shahuci station, saying it violates the provisions of the country's laws.
Only Abi qualifies for the 2023 semi-finals.
The son of Uwa and a close friend of President Muhammadu Buhari, Mamman Kwankwaso has said that the centuries-old style of governance in Nigeria has become old now.
Mamman Lawal said Nigeria was already in the valley and had now scrapped the end-of-year process to focus on electing the most qualified person in 2023.
BBC Hausa has published an interview with Mamman Lawal in which he explained this.
The process of endorsing the election of a president in Nigeria has not resulted in an eye-opener which began in 1999.
Instead, Kwankwaso said that the focus should be on realising who is eligible unless the receipt process is followed.
However, members of the Igbo ethnic group, the Inyamirai, also responded to the tweet.
They said that he and his brother, President Buhari, had laid down the romance of power through scrutiny and that he would now come out and recommend that this not be followed in 2023.
The Bureau of Investigation itself is no better than all Nigerians elected.
So the Chief of Defence Staff who has been sitting in their seats for decades has not been removed, and is also ay no more than the rest of the capacity.
Indigenous responses.
A storm of Nigerian presidential politics erupted on Wednesday, while the Igbo Zalla Voice Protection Team, Ndigbo, lambasted Mamman Kwankwaso for his botched statement to the Indigenous Peoples' Association.
In a tweet, Hajiya, who is a cousin of President Muhammadu Buhari, said the showdown would take place in the 2023 presidential election.
On the contrary, since his words have not finished the canvassing process, Ndigbo has hastily released a statement condemning Mamman Kwankwaso, calling him a puppet of sectarianism.
In a statement issued by Ndigbo on Wednesday, the Igbo ethnic group, at least in the South Region, and in the South East, will also be allowed to run for president in the 2023 elections, that is, the Igbo tribe.
The spokesman for the Chairman of the Igbo Zalla Association, Emeka Attamah, said the words of Mamman Kwankwaso like the Nigerian presidential aspirant in 2023 were against the Igbo ethnic group.
With the exception of greed, what has prevented Mamman Lawal from speaking openly since 2019.
They were about to oust Jonathan, and now Kwankwaso is aspiring for the southern region which will govern Nigeria in the 2023 elections.
He finishes his account of what he deems to be his current boss's brother, and then he will come out with an issue that we don't know for sure in 2023.
He should as an older man embrace the truth and hold it accountable.
He did not come out against the president's statement in 2023, nor was the president's rhetoric biased.
VOA Interview hall set to begin.
The issue of abuse of women and children by raping them is common in northern Nigeria where there have been reports of child abuse.
People from a number of backgrounds attended the hall on July 23 to discuss the worsening situation in the country and how it should be overcome.
Hall participants attributed the problem to factors such as young girls' advertising and the negligence of other parents.
One of the female parents who attended the Hajj Fathi'a Sha'ibu, the wife of the former governor of Plateau and Niger State in the late Sani Abacha era, described poverty as one of the factors that makes parents advertise for their child.
Maryam Mamman Nasir, the leader of a right-wing organization that fights against this calamity, said "First we should go around educating mothers about the effects of letting their child out on advertising, because a child is out and will be seen to be harmed."
We will also call on Teachers to start preaching loudly to parents and siblings who are raping their children and children.
And the Member of Parliament representing Maiyama, Koko and Besse constituencies of Kebbi State Honorable Shehu Mohammad, expressed frustration at the matter and backed the imposition of a strict law to punish anyone arrested for rape in the country.
At the end of the day, David and Nasiru El-hikaya who chaired the forum thanked those who attended the event on behalf of VOA for their invitation.
Contribution of 'Northern Media Writers' to Northern Cooperation.
Social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram, Bakandamia and many others have long played a role in promoting dialogue, cooperation and interaction between diverse communities of the world, as well as conveying messages, stories, and spreading political policies, education and commerce.
Young people in Nigeria have taken part in this new technology using social media, to go about their lives, to make donations or to raise awareness about their new lives.
We can say that these settlements have brought us numerous improvements that the youth of the North are benefiting from in the business, economy, education and politics of the region.
Many others are eating by writing and delivering online, have found jobs or have boosted their operations.
But it is unfortunate that some youths instead of taking advantage of this opportunity to enjoy the progress that has been made, there have been some who follow the pollution of Southern children who have been around the world benefiting the public, inside and outside the country, or who have written insults and insults against their constituents and enemies.
That is what shows lack of enlightenment, in the development of the lives of the youth of this country.
The advent of the Northern Media Writers Association in the Country is a great experience, to provide Northern youth with insight into the good fortune and to clean up the things that young people are doing in Soshiyal midaya, so that they become meaningful writers and spread the policies of the people of the North.
It is imperative that we give this organization the cooperation it needs, in order to achieve its gracious goals, that will bring legitimacy not only to our Northern Territory, but also to Nigeria as a whole.
I advise our youths, especially the users of social media, to come together to protect the dignity of the North and its sovereignty and to create a system that will bring about change for all.
As did our Northern leaders who laid down their lives such as Sardaunan Sakura, the first prime minister of the North, Sir Ahmadu Bello, and his appointees, he aspires to provide for the people of the North.
It has been reported that the late ruler of the war against oppression and poverty, Malam Aminu Kano, once said that Nigeria is one country, but everyone knows his father's house!
We say, therefore, that while we call for the promotion of national development and the promotion of enterprise governance, at every step, we further call for the unity of the North, without religious or ethnic discrimination, to bring our region together.
Consider how the North is at that point it is not.
We should therefore use the insight that God has given us in making contributions and recommendations, to provide the North with a satisfactory way to revitalize its economy.
The North should develop revenue streams to implement its budget without waiting for the federal government to waste money.
In addition, if we want the development of the North, we must attach importance to education, agriculture, tourism, health and science and technology.
We don't have money to contribute, there are different ways to do that.
We think this way the North will fulfill our enemies' goals!
The North is our pride.
The government has allocated N126 billion to renovate the country's hospitals.
The federal government has set aside N126 billion from the country's economic development plans to renovate hospitals in the country.
The hospitals to be renovated include the FMC hospital, infectious disease laboratory facilities, the department for emergency care, the department for quarantining those who are not intending to be infected with the disease, and teaching hospitals in the 36 states in the country.
In recent years, some allies in the health sector have called on government departments to work together to allocate sufficient funding to improve the country's health sector.
The experts made the call at a milestone conference on providing good health to the people as easily as possible in Abuja.
In his speech, the junior senator representing Kwara North under the shadow of the APC, Sadiq Umar, said the Nigerian government should take the issues of improving the health of the country seriously.
He said the lack of doing so left the sector with funding problems, resulting in a high dependence on foreign funding.
Umar said despite these support, there was no role played by the government in the area of health, so they began withdrawing their support.

People killed by hunger in Africa will go up against those killed by Coronavirus - IFAD.
The International Center for Agricultural Development (IFAD) has said that there are at least 23 million more people who will go hungry in sub-Saharan Africa, in 2020.
IFAD President Gilbert Houngbo made the remarks at the World Economic Forum.

Houngbo said Coronavirus has shown that there is a serious problem with the food security system, sharing and repairing.
Many farmers are struggling as they are unable to get fertilisers due to traffic restrictions.
They were unable to go to the farm and those who cultivated crops for sale, markets were closed after all.
The report added that in 2019 hunger hit 135 million people worldwide, of whom 73 million are from Africa, among 36 countries.
In Northern Nigeria hunger hit 5 million in 2019.

Yes, the federal government has a duty to protect the lives of the people, but those who are close to those people should first also start talking about these things.
Alhaji Sabo Nanono added that the federal government was doing all it could to improve agriculture and food production in the country.
President Trump Plans to Reduce Drug Practices.
Friday, July 24, US President Donald Trump signed four presidential laws aimed at limiting Americans' spending on prescription drugs, as he faces an uphill battle for re-election and accusations of his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic in the country.
Trump had previously said he would make almost all the changes to the law, which he signed Friday, but this is the first time it has been signed into law.
One of the rules would authorize the import of cheaper drugs by doctors from countries like Canada, while another law would require pharmaceutical companies to reduce their prices, Trump said.
Another law would require a reduction in insulin injection costs while a fourth law, which is likely to be implemented if successful in a meeting with pharmaceutical companies, would require the Medicare Insurance Scheme to buy medications in the wake of other countries' acquisitions, Trump said.

Kano Elders Reach Out Of Buhari - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
A coalition of groups for the protection of the dignity of the people of Kano has reached out to the state Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje to President Muhammadu Buhari over his attempt to borrow from a Bank of China for the construction of a railway line.
A coalition of more than 15 groups under the shadow of the Kano Forum has described what it calls the Ganduje administration's debt relief package for the construction of the first phase of the railway line in Kano City as reckless given the serious challenges facing the state.
The group alleged that Governor Ganduje would borrow 684 million euros, that is, about three hundred billion naira, which they said was only 50 years old that the government had not finished the payment.
Alhaji Bashir Othman Tofa, the chairman of the association, said it was almost impossible to say that Kano State had taken on more debt than it had already borrowed in the past.
Decriminalization of Explosives in Nigeria Is Less Mistakes -Maigidaje.
A fighter in the community in Kaduna State, Alhaji Aliyu Maigidaje, pointed out that the death penalty for those arrested for rape in this country, especially in North NIjeriya is the only solution.
Alhaji Aliyu Maigidaje made the announcement in a Leadership interview today in Kaduna, adding that the very fact that the authorities confirmed this after investigating, the death penalty was the only solution.
He added that the decision would reduce the incidence of rape that can be achieved easily, but the biggest inconvenience was to make our minds heard.
Alhaji Aliyu Maigidaje said, he said in our Muslim gender, we should give Allah to give the Prophet and stand by our hearts and minds, so that man does not always know that he will die.
It is shameful to say that an adult or an older man supposedly had a three-month-old girl, aged three or five, raped her.
He continued, saying internally, we will not tolerate presidents, or rulers of the country, pointing out that there is no way to make progress if there is such a crisis.
He added that, that is why we are in shock and distress in the country, because the country has refused to move forward, both Kings, Governors and the President have lost track of the situation.
He added that they had to seal the barricades and then the moon peaked and therefore, it is necessary for us to change our minds so that God can bring us solutions to the issue of rape.
He explained that even if they are doing it for the sake of good, everything should be done for God because he is the one who eradicates all sorrow and poverty for the people.
According to him, whatever the situation in person, God knows you will do nothing but praise and indulge and always think you will die and always think about yourself and your past, and if you do what you did.
He pointed out that the police officially are also doing their best because they are sending those accused of rape to Kotuda Alkali to do their best to curb this scourge, both in our Northern part of Nigeria and in the country.
He called on especially parents to keep a close eye on their children, citing the example of ads and how their parents' daughters are doing so.
He said some parents do not miss their older brother's life or go to school or they do not go to school or they come home on time or they do not come back, adding that in part there is negligence on some parents because they should be aware that God has given them the children and tomorrow he will ask them what kind of discipline they have given their older brother.

Farmers In Biniwe Protest Growth And Place In Bengal - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
Rice farmers in Biniwe State are expecting a massive harvest as little as two months after planting.
Some of them who were gathered in Makurdi expressed hope that the harvest would take place anytime between October and November.
Titus Atondo, a smallholder farmer in the state town of Mbatiab-Gboko, said he planted his rice in a two-acre area in July.
Atondo said he sourced seeds from a market in his area and they were in two groups of CP and rice OC while he was using Dazzle to clear the grounds for planting and fertiliser.
According to Titus Atondo, the challenges of rice farming in the countryside such as Mecca are huge because we rely so heavily on labour as customs agents are unable to access the farm roads.
Titus Atondo added that we are recruiting people to do agriculture from the national level as far as the harvest is concerned, adding that this is exhausting and overwhelming.
Atondo said all the money spent on his farm which is now located includes planting, planting, fertiliser applications and was expected to be harvested at N2020,000.
Titus Atondo continued, but he expects at least 50 bags of rubbish to be harvested from two hectares that will likely be sold at a cost of N29,000 per 100k purse.
A large rice farmer, Bitalis TARNONGU, also planted the plant in June to July on 274 hectares of the farm which costs N14, 500 per hectare while the ground floor costs N25,000 a hectare.
He sowed 44 seeds (Supi) and 61 Faro (OC) seeds derived from the National Council for Strength of Agricultural Projects (Seeds) and some originated from Olam Nigeria.
He added that high levels at this time are in various fields while some are in breeding programmes, and others are in the early stages of killing livestock as farming has been underway in stages.
TARNONGU added that the challenges so far have included financial penalties since the price of producing selected animals is low and the price of cocoa has increased.
He said the harvest was expected to start in October to November.
He added that the total price of basic commodities at the end of the day will be a minimum of N246,000 per hectare while production is expected to be three metric tonnes which could translate into N360,000 at a cost of N120 per kilo.
TARNONGU does not use medicines on its rice farm, instead, he advocates and implements traditional agriculture, adding that as such, we use insecticide plants, pesticides and medicinal fertilisers.
Also the Chairman of the National Farmers' Union (AFAN) Benue State branch, Comrade Aondongu saaku, expressed hope that the rainfall conditions this year will be favorable for the cultivation of large quantities of rice.
According to the Chairman of the National Farmers' Union (AFAN), Benue State, Comrade Aondongu saaku, more farmers entered the rice farming sector at the end of this year due to the coronavirus crisis which has prevented many from leaving offices and being on their farms.
He said this year it would harvest 20 percent of what was being produced in 2019, estimated to be more than one million tons.
According to him, the collectors are now taking statistics of various farmers and if the work is completed, the number of rice farmers in the state will be assessed.
The chairman of the National Farmers Association (AFAN) Benue State branch, Comrade Aondongu saaku, who said he had cultivated three hectares of rice farm, noted that some farmers had sown rice in June while those in short-term farming were doing so at the same time as the harvest season expected in late November or early December.
The AFAN chairman added that the rice farmers were using fresh produce to kill aging weeds, kebabs, pesticides.
He expressed concern about the challenges of livestock threatening rice farming, adding that farmers were taking shelter, putting up ropes and clearing the edges of the farms to deal with the problem.

Nigerian students studying in Cyprus, that is, TRCN, have rejected the Chairman of the Nigerian Council for Foreign Relations (NiDCOM), who warned their parents to stop sending their children to Northern Cyprus, saying they are being bullied.
On Monday, Abike Dabiri-Erewa warned that hundreds of Nigerians were being killed in Northern Cyprus, without government scrutiny.
Dabiri made the claim after news of the murder of a student named Ibrahim Khaleel emerged.
The student, who is Nigerian, was killed and to this day no further information has been heard.
The murder of Ibrahim Khaleel will be a lesson for parents to stop sending their children around the world, killed in vain, especially in Northern Cyprus.
The problem is people don't know that the whole world is not allowed to exist in Northern Cyprus.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has not endorsed the move.
But thousands of Nigerians are living in their country to study, but hundreds of Nigerians are killed in the country.
Dabiri even said that Nigeria would release the names of hundreds of Nigerians who were brutally murdered in the country.
But while responding to her, Nigerian students studying in the country say that peace in Northern Cyprus is far greater than in Nigeria, far away.
The President of the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS), Evidence Akhayere, said that despite Nigerians studying in countries facing challenges, then Readers in Northern Cyprus are not suffering from problems, challenges or any interference.
The same Evidence told PREMIUM TIMES during their discussion.
He said it was not true that hundreds of Nigerian students had died in Cyprus.
He said the statement about the death of 100 students was false.
The few who died were all sicknesses, not kidneys.

Now eyes have been turned to see how it will play out.
Religious leaders would have told their followers there would be no violence.
The Speaker of the Kaduna State House of Assembly, Yusuf Zailani, has cautioned religious leaders to always tell their followers the truth no matter what it is rather than inciting their followers to engage in harassment and advertising hatred.
Zailani made the remarks during a news conference at the Kaduna State Government House during which the state government was hosting the president of the Christian Association of Nigeria who visited Kaduna last week.
Zailani added that "It is true that it is not intended to be said that when you go to certain places of worship, you hear their guides stare at them and advertise their hatred of their non-religious partners.
That is fueling the trial among people.
Finally, he said that it must come back to haunt you and that religious leaders are giving followers the message of the almighty God as it comes in our religious books, and there will be no peace.
The senator representing Kaduna Central, Uba Sani, also attended the meeting and appealed to those who are not residents of Kaduna to always speak their words before expressing them.
The conflict has been going on for more than 40 years.
It was the first time a brave governor had lashed out at the governor and put an end to this problem.
But also because of the fact that some are inclined to tell the true story of the contagion, many people are only one side of the aisle.
Thousands of N-Power youths are slashing the program.
The Minister of Humanitarian Affairs and Relief, Sadiyya Farouk, said that many of the beneficiaries of N-Power, that is, receive a monthly allowance, work in other places, so the investigation showed.
In a document issued by the minister on Thursday, she said there were indeed unpaid leave but that it was not from her office that there was this problem, that the office had already handed over the names of more than 500,000 people to be assessed in compliance with their previous obligations.
She said there was an assessment of names being offered to bankrupt board members, receiving funding after working elsewhere.
The program is for those who are unemployed but thousands of others who are receiving allowances are already working elsewhere and are receiving N-Power allowances.
Savings are now being made to identify them and wander them out of those payments.
She appealed to beneficiaries of the previous unpaid leave program to be more patient that they will soon hear back.
N-Power members protest their suspension by Minister Sadiya in Abuja

One of the attendees of the rally and a representative from Kano State, in an interview with PREMIUM TIMES HAUSA, said that they were calling on the government to delay the decision and pay those who have not yet been paid their three month loan.
They also called for financial support to be given to the fact that the youths have been benefiting from this government support.
After meeting some of the legislators who listened to the cries and went to the Federal Government's staffing department, they asked if they would vote for Sadiya Farouk, the Minister of State for Relief, Sadiya Farouk.
The eminent Human Rights Defender, Komared Mustapha Soron Dinki, who has been gathering since Kano to Abuja with the youths, said this deliberation was made to remind the minister that the beneficiaries of the program had not abdicated their rights before they were suspended.
Young people have been mobilizing in the National Assembly since morning.
We hope that the government will hear the cries of the youths here and provide solutions that will help them to continue living as well.
The youths holding a bottle containing text call on the government to keep them in the eye of mercy.

Sorry Man Is The King, I Drink Praise Them.
The film, full of songs by singer Beyonce, entitled "Black is King," is a continuation of the King's Praise and criticism around the world for its evocative African heritage.
In South Africa, where this 85 minute film has been included, many say this has even gone beyond film.
Black is King is a singer-songwriter and American singer-songwriter, and Beyonce has directed, compiled and completed.
The film features a song entitled "The Lion King: The Gift," by Zaki Kapoor: The Son of Baiwa.
Last year, the film was filmed in the US, South and West, as well as Europe, and features several African musicians.
The film, which debuted in July, received an endorsement from listeners, but was also a hit.
Some say that Beyonce, who was born in Houston, Texas, USA, illegally censors African American content, especially features that nerve Africa in the film, and that it traditionally has no roots in the African continent.
But in South Africa, we are delighted that those who played the role in this film did so.
Sibusiso Mathebula, a film studio graduate, said he was welcomed into the film industry.
He said he was impressed with the film.
The film touches on a number of untaught experiences in school regarding black history.
He said when he saw the film, he even started seeing the story as well as the clothes it wore and the coverage of the film, which developed a lot more quickly than it had been expected to.
Kgosi Motosoane, a fan of Beyonce's music, says African Americans overseas - including American immigrants - have access to what some think is African cultural heritage.
He is passionate about the film.
Kgosi said foreigners are more likely to be sent to the community on the other side of the country.
So their participation in very effective matters is very encouraging.
A student reader of the films, Mathebula said Beyonce's film had earned him the desire to start making the film in order to spread more information about Africa.
Fans of Beyonce have debated one thing: If The Man Is The King, then Beyonce is The Queen.

At a time when farmers are yet to enjoy their farming in Nigeria, Sokoto State farmers have begun to struggle against threats adopted by birds, a possible obstacle to crops thought to pose.
The threat of red birds in Sokoto State is very exciting to see, as there are indications of a good food season this year 2020.
On the contrary, some local farmers have embraced the traditional strategy of expelling the bird as described by a young man named Faruk from the Dange Shuni area.
Sambo Abubakar, one of the local farmers, said the birds were now targeting all the plants they had started trying on farms.
The chairman of the Sokoto State Farmers Association, Murtala Gagado Minannata, said that in two-thirds of Sokoto State this problem is now being exacerbated.
He said they were now waiting to hear about the situation in the local government areas of the state to include a report to be sent to the state and federal Ministry of Agriculture for action to help farmers.
The Federal Ministry of Agriculture official in charge of the department of bird and odor medicine, Ya'u Kagara, said it was less than a month before the completion of the bird feeding centers in the area of Sokoto.
He added that the bird was coming from Niger Republic and Benin, and that international intervention was necessary before any agreement was reached to resolve the issue.
In June, the federal government launched a bird feeding operation in 12 northern Nigerian states that are home to foreign neighbors whose birds are coming into Nigeria.
But the repercussions of this crisis may turn back the clock on the perceived progress being made in the agricultural sector which governments claim gives him special attention.

Germany tightens corona measures

It also needs to be put in place to reduce the number of people meeting indoors and outdoors.
The chancellor said he supports the Minister of Health's demand that free testing for returning travellers be stopped.
Germany had previously managed to control the epidemic but according to withdrawal rules imposed earlier this year, new infections are now rising.
New COVID-19 Response Funds To Be Introduced in US.
While numbers of COVID-19 cases continue to rise in the U.S., Republican lawmakers in the Senate are expected Monday to introduce a spending bill.
It is thought that the advertisement will cost a trillion dollars to settle the effects of the coronavirus pandemic in the country.
The plan comes days before the expiration of the first federal relief package for millions of Americans who have lost their jobs due to COVID-19.
On Sunday, after days of talks with Republican lawmakers in the House of Representatives, US Secretary of State Mark Meadows and Treasury Secretary - Mali Steven Mnuchin said the relief package included an expansion of the program to provide loans to those who have lost their jobs.
But according to them, in this crisis, Americans will see only 70 percent of their previous stimulus checks.
On Friday, the first relief package will provide paid leave for those who have lost their jobs and 600 weekly payments to those who have lost their jobs.
Republicans, meanwhile, argue that the program aims to get people who are paid less than they were when they were working, if the federal government's subsidies are combined with that which the state subsidizes.
But Democrats, for their part, have challenged the claim, saying that given the coronavirus crisis, some staff are less secure returning to their workplaces.
Why I returned to APC after defecting from the PDP.
Former Nigerian House of Representatives Speaker Yakubu Dogara has explained the reasons why he switched from the PDP to the APC after the party's interim leader Mai Mala Buni announced his return to the party.
In his letter to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in his Bogoro constituency, Dogara said the collapse of leadership in his Bauchi State under the Bala Muhammed administration that helped win was the reason he left the party.
Dogara said he cannot be open to questioning the handling of the State government unless he is accused of civil disobedience, so he has taken the shots and left the party.
The former chairman of the House of Representatives said if he wrapped his hands up the fight that everything that matters in Bauchi State under the Bala Muhammed administration would be trustworthy, after which Governor Isa Yuguda and Mohammed Abubakar everyone would hear his voice and express their opinion if it went wrong.

We will also unveil a second Group B, which will benefit from the agricultural program.
Nanono reminded how President Muhammdu Buhari set up a committee for the Promotion of Economic Growth from the Disabilities caused by the Coronavirus outbreak.
He said one of the ways to revitalize the country's economy, including the AFJP Plan, was that the plan would boost agriculture from being cultivated in the production of hand-meals to a modern and reliable food producer.
He said the plan was to include the government's plan to distribute up to 100,000 metric tons of food to the homeless shelter from food shortages and hunger during the coronavirus outbreak.
He said in one year, the important program was expected to announce to 5 million to 10 million young people.

People need to be aware of the 2019 law - the KCSF.
The Kano State Civil Society Forum (KCSF), in partnership with the EU, the British Council for Cultural Affairs, the Rule of Law and Anti-corruption (Rolac), has delivered a phone call relating to the 2019 criminal justice reform bill.
The event, which took place at the Aminu Kano Center for Democracy and Research in Mumbayya, took a look at the new laws and how the system of conduct is for the community in which 150 civil society groups in Kano and Journalists are organised.
Addressing the Chief Prosecutor, Dr. Nuhu Musa Idris, of Bayero University's legal training department in Kano, he commented on some of the most controversial laws.
He called for looking into old laws as a result of modern travel law.
At his altar, the chairman of the Kano State Coalition for Islamic Affairs (KCSF), Ibrahim Wayya, said lack of knowledge of the laws had played a role in violating the rights of the people and why there was a need to know how they were.
Some participants, who were the third of its kind to be hosted in three Kano Senatorial districts, from civil society groups, described how they viewed the legislative process with their message.
Our correspondent Aminu Halilu Tudunwada, who attended the phone call, told us that the problems of some of the laws that have been put in place have been discussed internally.
Those who do not know their rights are mostly detained, as the law has more than 400 laws, plus more phone records.
New Voter Registration Act is being debated in Nigeria.
The SERAP, a humanitarian and economic development organization called SERAP, has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to reassure Nigeria's Minister of Shariar Abubakar Malami and the Director General of the Pilgrims Registration Board that they are suspending the planned start of the registration of places of worship.
According to SERAP, the move is a violation of human rights as contained in the Nigerian Constitution.
Before human rights groups complained about the government's move, various religious leaders had already also submitted their cries to the Buhari administration, urging Congress to rescind the law for review and approval, as it would not clash with the constitutional amendments to religion and welfare.
The Pastor John Buro, a chief-of-staff in Kaduna State, told VOA that this law is baseless and inexcusable if the government is seeking to ban worship or the wearing of masks.
She should just use the methods to monitor and trace all violators without imposing any new laws.
Also on his part, Dr Bashir Yankuzo, a professor of science at Minna University, said that although the government was not wrong to monitor companies and organizations for national security, it did not mean that strict compliance would be limited to anyone else's freedom or others.
What remains to be seen is whether the government will listen to this public outcry.
How Akure University of Technology (FUTA) tried to drag PREMIUM TIMES off the internet.
The Akure University of Technology (FUTA) has recruited a foreigner to target websites, in order to target PREMIUM TIMES, the popular "online" newspaper in Nigeria.
The ban on crossing internet barriers has made it easier for people to log on to their sites, but to no avail.
He was first tempted to engage in "hacking" since February 28, where he wielded his deadly weapons on campus, and carried out his attacks using the university's "data."
On the other hand, if he tries to smash the hard internet of PREMIUM TIMES with a computer, he also attacks another GSM phone.
Five days later, he left the entrance to the site of the Great PREMIUM TIMES, but was unsuccessful, despite using various sophisticated technologies.
He did not manage to break through, because the university did not know that PREMIUM TIMES had a robust program in place, in which it built a corridor and a corridor was destroyed by a helicopter.
And PREMIUM also has several high-level security officials on its website including the Emir of the Battle of PREMIUM TIMES and the Chief of Staff, PREMIUM TIMES.
These security forces, who have modern experience in crushing any gang member or gang member who seeks to inflame alone, or martyrdom, are trying to break into the PREMIUM TIMES umbrella.
Type Of Weapons Attacked by Internet Trader PREMIUM TIMES:
At 8 a.m., he began siding with the doorbell of the Great PREMIUM TIMES, to see how it would turn out to be inside, completely destroying the storefront.
He would not have succeeded in the night, and the next morning, at 6: 15, he would be tempted again, this time by using "WPScan," a move to identify the strengths or weaknesses of adult internet security measures such as PREMIUM TIMES.
After 90 minutes, he began attempting to break into the power of machine learning techniques, the "custom script."
In the morning, he made every effort to do it by sidestepping a computer device to completely lock down the PREMIUM TIMES page.
How a Burner Treated Migrants:
The barrister did not know that PREMIUM TIMES had provided medicine to small rats and big brides entering the farms of social networks to cover up or destroy the site.
This lack of awareness has caused all the instruments it used, in general, the old captures that were unable to do PREMIUM TIMES any harm or harm.
On this day he suffered from depression and became tired to go through an attack with DDOS on the NTP License, which is an ancient road that has been used since Kano belonged to the village.
On March 3, he had all the mental and mental health problems, but it was all but over.
The attempt to break the door of the Great PREMIUM TIMES came days after PREMIUM TIMES published an article comparing tensions between President Muhammadu Buhari's National Security Adviser, Babagana Monguno and his former Chief of Staff to the President, the late Abba Kyari.
Some in the Federal University of Technology in Akure, told PREMIUM TIMES that the university had hired a large number of rats for Internet sites to smash a page with a large PREMIUM TIMES umbrella, destroy or destroy it.
However, when PREMIUM TIMES contacted the FUTA, it distanced itself from the attempt to hijack the Great PREMIUM TIMES Internet.
Futa said only if a receptionist who is a student at the university tries it alone, not with an FUTA spokesperson.

Yoruba leaders have threatened to boycott the 2023 election.
Leaders of Yoruba groups in Nigeria have threatened to boycott the country's 2023 elections, as long as their demand for reforms to the country's "Restructuring" constitution is refused.
The Yoruba groups took part in the document after the meeting, in which they said that reforming the Nigerian constitution alone would save the country from the very difficult situation it has suffered, especially in the face of security and economic crisis.
The leaders who attended the joint meeting included Afenifere Pa leader Reuben Fashoranti, professor Banji Akintoye, chairman of the Yoruba World Congress and former Ondo State Governor Dr. Olusegun Mimiko.
A coalition of Yoruba groups has also complained of inconsistencies in sharing positions with the Nigerian government, under the leadership of Muhammadu Buhari.
While the Kano State government has reduced its budget by about N70 billion due to the negative impact the coronavirus pandemic has had on the state economy, the State House of Assembly has passed a new law to oversee the state government's financial services processes.
However, local leadership groups say the issue of proposed legislation is very simple, but implementing it is the challenge.
The introduction of a new law for the procurement of government funds based on democracy is part of the aim of the new law in Kano State which has since been introduced at the federal level as well as in other Nigerian states.
The majority leader of the Kano State House of Assembly, Hon. Kabiru Hassan Dashi, told VOA that the law would give employers and the state government the principle of how to spend their money, along with how the state would allocate its money.
Now, local leadership groups have welcomed the legislation, as long as it is under review.
The Director General of the Organization for Community Civic Engagement in Kano State, Comrade Abdulrazak Alkali said they hoped government officials, and the state government would implement the law properly.
But the Kano State Commissioner for Finance and Economic Affairs, Alhaji Shehu Na'Allah, said they were well prepared to enforce the law.
Kano State Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje had already signed the new law late last week, and it is expected to go into effect.
INEC prepares for Edo -Prof. Yakubu.
The chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, has said that his commission is preparing to contest the Edo State governorship election, in which a vote will be cast on September 19.
Yakubu made the encouraging statement on Thursday, while meeting with the Electoral Management Committee in Benin, the Edo State capital.
The professor said INEC had so far successfully implemented 10 of the 14 plans that it is committed to implementing in relation to the election.
Yakubu added that the reason for this visit was because he had seen what preparations had been made since now before the introduction of the election day.
Of course we get all the reports of the programs that are ongoing.
Yet we find it hard to come to terms with it, to see with our eyes.
This commission has set out a schedule for how the Edo and Ondo elections will take place, since February 6, 2020.
That is, we have given the space of about seven to eight months to prepare for the two elections remotely.
Well today I am happy to say that we have implemented 10 of the 14 plans that INEC plans to implement.
And no one has yet received any extension until it has been released from the date of implementation.
The last thing is to register the total number of black voters for the 14 parties that will contest Yakubu.
He said the four remaining tasks for INEC included publishing the announcement of the upcoming elections, the presentation of the names of the ejan-ejan of each party that participates in the contest, all on the same day.
Campaigns were suspended 24 hours before the election.
That will be the 12th of Thursday night's campaigns, before Saturday's election.
So we just have to say we have already evacuated, just waiting for the arrival of Election Day.
Jacob said.
He also predicted that the Edo State governorship election would be the first election INEC would hold during the coronavirus crisis.
On the contrary, he said the electoral commission has set out guidelines for how to conduct the election in this situation.
We tested the system and the rules in a small, polling station in Nasarawa State.
And we plan to repeal the system in this general election in Edo.
Earlier the Edo State Electoral Commissioner, Johnson Alalibo, said there were 2,210,534 registered voters in Edo State.
He said 1,159,325 are male, female and 1,051,209 are female.
Tensions have flared between the US and Chaina.
Chaina responded in response to the closure of the US embassy in Chengdu this Friday.
The Chainan State Department said the decision was made as a result of the closure of its embassy in Houston, Texas, by the Americans earlier this week.
Beijing has warned of retaliation, as long as Washington does not immediately withdraw from the talks.
Thirty-five years ago, the United States opened an office in Chengdu with about two dozen employees.
The two countries' relations have been at a critical juncture since the outbreak of the Coronavirus pandemic at a time when they are trying to stabilize the conflict, over trade agreements.
Atyap, Hausa-Fulani Agreement for Peace Between Them.
The communities of Atyap, Fulani and Hausa ethnic groups living in Kaduna State's Zangon Kataf Local Government Area have successfully concluded a reconciliation, to promote sustainable peace in their own region.
The participants, who expressed resolve and willingness to see peace and forgiveness, condemned the killing and destruction of properties in their own region.
They also proclaimed their willingness to help security agencies with personal information, to catch any batteries hiding inside their own areas.
The meeting also commended the government's efforts to appoint security agents in the area, and similarly commended the various youth groups for their tireless efforts to embrace each other and maintain distance from others which could jeopardize the region including their youths' efforts to successfully establish this reconciliation agreement between them.
The meeting, held under the leadership of Agwatyap's son-in-law, Dominic Gambo Yahaya, was convened by the three nations to discuss the peace process.
The event was held at the Mariyamu and Yakubu Ebent Centre in Wakili.
The meeting also earned the leadership of ABM Stephen Shekari (rty) and Dr Salim Umar, who represented the Atyap Emirate, for solidarity among the communities and for stopping the bloodshed and destruction of the sovereign wealth between them.
All the leaders of the three communities of Atyap, Fulani and Hausa communities signed the document after the meeting including the honorable civil servant of Agwatyap.
In the document after the meeting, which contained up to 14 pilgrims, the residents of the Atyap Emirate called on anyone to take the law into his own hands and instead take a rallying cry to the security agencies.
The meeting also highlighted the guarantees given by the country's constitution for any Nigerian to live and self-isolate in any section of the country in need, including the Atyap Emirate, without fear or any threat from anyone else.
The meeting also called on the authorities to speed up the process of returning all the kingdom's refugees back to their homes.
The meeting also recommended the establishment of a peace committee comprising tribes, Hausa, Fulani and Atyap as well as their youth to arrange high-level meetings and discussions on issues relating to security from time to time for peace in their constituency.
The peace reconciliation meeting came hours after the Kaduna State government relaxed its curfew in the local government areas of Zangon Kataf and Kaura, of the State to block the spread of the conflict among the residents of the area.
How Ganduje restored the dignitaries who were fired by Emir Ado and Sanusi, he will return them to their appointees in Kano.
Governor Abdullahi Ganduje wants the Kano State House of Assembly to amend the 2019 State law, so that he can confirm the appointment of two former executives of the Kano Emirate that the late Emir Ado Bayero and Emir Sanusi submitted, so that the state legislature can confirm their appointment as princes appointing the Emir in Kano.
Ganduje's request was read out by the Speaker of the Kano House of Representatives, Abdullahi Gafasa before the House of Representatives, and they are expected to hold a session to discuss the matter before the end of July.
The dignitaries relocated to the Kano Emirate are Aminu the Great Son of'agundi and his accomplice the Emir of Dawaki Mai Tuta and the Kano Ciroman, Sanusi Ado-Bayero.
They were both removed by Emir Ado and Emir Muhammadu Sanusi, on charges of perjury.
Principal Depp challenged his acquittal in court.
17 years on, the Supreme Court has ruled that he is negligent.
Ganduje also wants to restore his reign and amend the law to be among the appointees to the Emir of Kano.
Ado Bayero removed Son'agundi in 2003 after being found guilty of conspiracy and conspiracy to commit political acts.
A committee was set up to investigate him, but he was invited to refuse to come before a committee to defend him.
He then challenged his removal at the Kano State High Court to the Supreme Court.
Before the Supreme Court, the Federal Court of Appeal had ruled that Aminu the Great should be returned to his seat.
But the Kano Emirate, under the rule of Muhamamdu Sanunmsi II, has appealed the decision, with the Supreme Court stressing the removal of him as a Representative of the East, and Emir of Dawaki Mai Tuta, on June 5.
After Sanusi Bayero was removed, Kano Ciroman was rejected by the Emir of Kano who was appointed Muhammdu Sanusi II in June, 2014.
He was later appointed chairman of the National Water Resources Board in the Jonathan era.
He was appointed Wamban Kano, under the current Emir of Kano.

NAPTIP has charged human traffickers, rescued 71 people in Kano State.
The National Security Service (NAPTIP), Kano State branch of police, has charged three kidnappers and rescued 71 people from their homes in the state.
The commander-in-chief of the Kano State Executive Board Shehu Umar made the announcement Friday while meeting with the News Agency of Nigeria.

Attempts To Threaten and Demand My Own Mind - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
The village of Longyuan in the Hongsipu region of Wuzhong, Ningxia's semi-autonomous Hui region, is located in northwestern China.
A committed woman named Li Yaomei or Sadiya (that is, her Islamic name) is famous for her struggle for life and success based on her efforts to get out of poverty.
Her story tells us that striving, being committed and looking out for oneself is heartbreaking.
Initially, Li Yaomei or Sadiya, she was never in a classroom intending to take a lesson, so she was unable to read aloud.
However, God gave her the gift of insight, bravery and collective wisdom, which was an example in the area of fighting poverty.
About 20 years ago, Madam Li Yaomei suffered from stomach cancer, where she underwent surgery on her stomach three times.
After her recovery, she suffered a serious accident, now she is walking with the lump placed in her leg.
Those challenges have plunged her into a difficult situation apart from health, even with the issue of prescription medication, which is why she received a loan of about N16 million, equivalent to N16 million.
Unsurprisingly, Malama Sadiya's challenge has paved the way for her to vote and vote in order to improve her life.
The Chinese government's support has also boosted its appeal.
Her specialty is to predict different kinds of weeds based on weeds.
Because of her efforts, her business has thrived exponentially, with various employers ordering her in.
In addition, she has created several engines that help her simplify the project.
For example, it takes 15 minutes to put together one large projection, but now within that time, it will include up to 5 projections.
In addition, it has provided additional engines to clean up the weeds it produces.
There is an additional engine that cleans up animal feed for her, and now it is selling those engines to applicants.
Given Malama Sadiya's challenges, as well as her efforts to improve her life and those of her staff, it is understandable that the applicant is indeed with her.
The work of fighting poverty and improving lives is not something that hangs over the government.
If the government is to provide support, but people are not generous or interested in improving their lives by finding themselves in jobs based on their situation, then lay-offs alone will continue without achieving any objectives.
Her article suggests that conducting a business or income stream does not require any visas or visas to other towns or overseas.
To take into consideration her condition, she used existing resources in her environment to improve her life.
Furthermore, teacher Sadiya carried out these works on the basis of standing by her foot without relying on her husband, so that he could flee her.
That is, the effort, the commitment and the quest for self-determination are at heart.
He expressed the strength of women to change their lives and stand by their shoulders without asking for help.
This is also a lesson that shows that whatever one does, he should stand firm, because relying on someone else is uncertain.
Indeed, Malama Sadiya was a committed, smart and talented person who was an example and a role model for the rest of the people.
Also, by March this year, Malama Sadiya had completed the payment of all her debts, and then suspended the receipt of support from the government on its own terms.

There are fears US Political Activists Will Lose to Stop COVID-19 - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organization (WHO), has recently expressed concern over the steps being taken by some countries to store the hoped COVID-19 respiratory disease vaccine, stating that priority must be avoided in various nations, while vaccinating against the epidemic.
And the vaccine should be distributed in a timely manner across the world, because it will be in line with the great good of different countries.
Indeed, some US politicians are implementing policies that prioritize their own good, regarding vaccine distribution, and thus undermine international cooperation in the fight against the pandemic.
Currently, the overall number of confirmed COVID-19 cases across the globe has already surpassed 23 million.
In the same number, there are more than 800 people who have lost their lives to the disease.
Under such extreme circumstances, there is an increased focus on the effectiveness of vaccinations, and happily, in recent days, there have been large results in the study of vaccinations in some countries, which has generated hope and belief in the whole international community.
But sadly, some US politicians have indicated a willingness to snatch the vaccine.
The journal "Science" even speculated that the U.S. government had already clinched agreements to buy a COVID-19 vaccine worth more than $6 billion, from several pharmaceutical companies.
Although the US government's policy is understood to be that Americans are at the forefront of the spread of the disease, other developing countries also need pilot vaccinations, looking at the fact that they are more likely to suffer from shortages of medical resources.
The journal "The ecologist" also pointed out that if the U.S. achieves the goal of securing a vaccine to be produced, then the number of doses to be produced in developing countries will decline.
Chicken, the director of the Africa CDC, Mr. John Nkengasong, also expressed concern over the issue.
As some current commentators have stated, even if a vaccine is successful, it will be impossible to achieve the goal of seeing beyond the pandemic unless the vaccine is designed to be distributed, which is a very important issue for the international community.
It is also imperative that countries around the world strengthen bilateral cooperation.
Tedros, the director general of the WHO, also pointed out that if it is to be seen after the pandemic, it must be contained in all sectors of the world, making it impossible for some parts of the world, or few other countries to achieve the goal of recovery from the impact of the pandemic alone.

Buhari administration chieftains who accompanied Abba Kyari's body were summoned to court.
A Pilgrims for the Rights of Nigerians has lauded all chieftains of the government of President Muhammadu Buhari for accommodating Abba Kyari's body.
Kyari, who is the Chief of Staff to the President, was buried at the Gudu cemetery in Abuja, on April 18, after he died of coronavirus.
The plaintiff, Tope Akinyade, summoned them to the Magistrate's Court in Kado, Abuja, where he asked the court to punish them, because they violated the curfew imposed on people at home by the federal government at the time.
He said there was a lot of injustice against Nigerians who were repeatedly arrested and punished during stay-at-home orders, but also for some members of the public to break the law, none of them were punished.
He said if the Buhari administration were to be fair, he would see no reason why the masses should be held accountable if they violated the Corona Act.
They and a group of government bodies broke the law but were allowed to.
Among those summoned to court by Tope are the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, the Minister of Civil Aviation, Hadi Sirika, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, the Minister of Relief and Humanitarian Affairs, Sadiya Umar.
There is also the Speaker of the Presidency, Garba Shehu, the military media officer, Bashir Ahmed, President Buhari's Adviser on Security, Babagana Monguno, the Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu and numerous other government figures.
Justice Celestine Odo sought to show that the plaintiff had made a mistake since the plaintiffs did not sign his plea.
However, Tope also reminded the Judge that he had directly brought the case to court, and that he did not do any compliance with the police.
He said the matter had been sent to all the accused to intervene.
Because he has done what Nigerian law gives him the freedom to do in court.
The judge adjourned the case and asked for a return to court on August 4, to be heard.

The presidency says the main opposition party in Nigeria, i.e. the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), is committed to upholding its values.
The Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu made the announcement in a statement released on Friday night.
Responding to a statement made to the PDP national chairman, President Buhari called for the resignation of President Buhari.
Shehu said at a time when the whole world is united to meet the same points, the opposition party of Nigeria, the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP has started campaigning.
Which is a moral violation of the Constitution, calling for the resignation of President Muhammadu Buhari for allowing permission to investigate several government offices, including the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).
In view of the statement issued by the party leader, Prince Uche Secondus, it is clear that they would like the President to stop investigating but close things down.
Never raise a lion from sleep as one of their leaders expressed.
The PDP cannot intimidate the government from executing serious allegations made against MDAs and their leaders because failure to do so would be a historic betrayal of the people.
ECOWAS Leaders Continue to Improve Mali's Violence.
West African leaders will hold an online summit on Monday, July 27 to introduce measures to end Mali's worsening political crisis, after five leaders of the bloc met with Mali's government and the opposition coalition in the capital Bamako on Thursday, July 23.

Thursday's event, which was attended by President Muhammadu Buhari, President Ibrahim Boubakar Keita of Mali, President Machy Sall of Senegal, Nana Akufo -Addo of Ghana, Alassane Ouattara of Cote d'Ivoire, listened to remarks from the Special Representative of ECOWAS, former President of Nigeria Goodluck Jonathan, and Mali's opposition leader Imam Mahmoud Dicko, representatives of the opposition coalition, as well as civil society groups.

Gunmen Shoot Students in Chukun Local Government Area, Kaduna.
The communities of the towns in Udawan, Chukun Local Government Area, say with the exception of six students writing the WEAC test who were abducted, there are some people who have been abducted for months.
Armed bandits in some areas of Kaduna State have repeatedly denied the community the right to sue but the Kaduna State government says it is at all possible to bring an end to these attacks, said Commissioner for Security and Internal Affairs Samuel Aruwan.
Armed bandits in rural areas have since prevented many farmers from going to the farm, which some fear could lead to food shortages in Nigeria.
The Confederation of Katsina State Government and Governments are engaged in money laundering, says Mai-shari'a Ummaru Abdullahi - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
We Must Return to the Truth It Will Be Peace in Nigeria.
The former Chairman of the Court of Appeal for Land Management, Mai Shariah El-Rufai Abdullahi (Walin Hausa) has said that the reconciliation with the Katsina State Government, with bandits, was a serious mistake and a waste of money.
It is because it has not had an impact or a sign of an end to the killings of bandits in Katsina State.
Justice Abdullahi made the remarks during a special press conference at his home in Katsina, including Leadership Today.
After completion of the foundation for the construction of a Women and Children's room, twenty-five beds will be constructed by a businessman at the Katsina town general hospital, who is the chairman of the forum.
The former President of the Court of Appeal, Addis Ababa, added that the reconciliation with the gunmen should not be carried out.
Because of that, he would say that a terrorist brought a gun to his credit, he returned to the bush, and he bought 47 rifles.
Walin Hausa maintained that the whole world nowhere near war has resulted in victory, they should be reconciled, by improving the lives of herders, that is, providing them with a place to breed, schools, drinking water and health care.
Even the Ministry of Veterinary Affairs exists in the northern province, and every year the government at every level budgets only farmers, but herders besides them, must come to terms with reform and justice, and then there will be sustainable peace.
But this war will not give birth to this country and Son Mai ido, because all of them are citizens of this country, reconciliation is the right way.
To do it with good intentions, peace will be achieved.
We are not alone.
The future of our children and grandchildren is going to be a big problem.
In this world, there has never been a war against a firearm which has been smashed with a rifle, on which a table is reconciled.
Security experts say terrorists are not reconciled, this is a bad decision, because even Americans who say it is not reconciliation with terrorists, they are terrorists and they are not citizens of the Americas, they are attacked by the people of another country.
We are also gunmen in this country, and it is said that they will not be reconciled.

The Nigerian Bureau of Statistics has announced that the country's economy has suffered an unprecedented recession in the last 10 years, with the recovery rate surpassing the 6 percent seen between April and June this year.
Figures released by the commission today show that between April and June, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic that swept through the world and the suspension of daily affairs, the Nigerian economy entered an unprecedented recession between 2010 and 2020.
The commission listed the reasons for the problem including forcing people to stay home across the country and curfews on flights and the closure of schools and businesses.
The commission added that taking such steps in countries around the world had caused oil prices to fall sharply, while factories around the world were also closed in response to the crisis.
Last month, Nigeria's Minister of Finance Zainab Ahmed said the Bureau of Statistics was predicting a similar situation, as a result of these problems that have prevented the conduct of day-to-day affairs, forcing the government to vote on its budget.

How I Stopped From a Police Inspector - Advocate Killer Shodipe.
The most prominent terrorist to be killed by police, Sunday Shodipe, described how he was able to flee from Mokola police station, Ibadan of Oyo State on Tuesday.
The suspect said a new branch leader, who was recently brought to the police station, instructed an officer named Funsho to leave him for a bath.
He said the officer warned him not to attempt to escape while he was bathing, adding that at that point he did not think to flee.
Shodipe explained that he managed to escape when he saw that the officer's attention had gone too far in communicating with another person and that he did not notice it.
He said the new female DPO had been brought in to demand that Funsho allow me a bath.
He warned me not to try to flee during the bath.
I escaped when I had a conversation with a man.
I went up to the top of the stairs and went up to the corridor.
People living in the area saw me when I was escaping but they weren't exposed.
Sahara Reporters gathered that a young man from Akure, Ondo State, who asked not to be named, had volunteered to help the police when he saw the news of the suspect's advancement and the warrant imposed on him.
He said he had traveled to Ibadan with three friends with the intention of hunting the offender for three days.
Upon their delivery to the state, they camped at a hotel where they spent the night before randomly searching for him.
It was gathered that the three men had tracked him down to where he bought marijuana in the city, but decided not to arrest him because of local mobs.
He was later arrested by members of the public while he was alone in his possession.
The suspect killed about eight people who were all women in Akinyele Local Government Area of Oyo State.
Yobe Spends Over N78.8m on Prison for Leaving Corporation - Leadership Hausa Newspapers.
The efforts of the Yobe State government, under Governor Mai Mala Buni, have been commended for revitalizing the sprawling company and its sprawling drones, owned by the state (Yobe state Polythene Bag and Woben Sacks Company), after more than 10 years in detention.
The statement was made by the chairman (General Manager), Engineer Sha'aibu Adamu Gadaka, in an interview with our correspondent at his office in Damaturu, the capital of Yobe State, earlier in the week.
He said the company had spent more than 10 years in lockdown, but after Governor Buni's arrival it was difficult for him to revise, in which he instantly ordered the removal of N78.8 million to renovate important sectors of the company with an additional 48 million naira to fund it, while allowing the company to stabilize its founders.
Eng. Gadaka added that this gave them the opportunity to purchase the products needed to start working in the company, which includes a new 500 kba power supply (Janareta), 500 kba power distribution machine (Taransifoma), a new engine for generating power plants, vacuum dryers (modern ones) and other equipment which the company needs.
He also lashed out and said, "Today, the main goal of Governor Buni's movement, to revitalize this company is to create jobs for the youth, reduce inequality and provide Yobe State with income."
Gadaka said.
On the other hand, he said the company was in favor of offering apps that it was partnering with, because of the fact that the state government had revived the Yobe Flour and Feed Mill (Yobe Flour and Feed Mill) in Potiskum and other traders who were courting the company's suppliers.
He said the longstanding opposition to the state government's attempts to renovate the fertiliser company was also a setback to the company's production.
On the other hand, he said, "There are some challenges that we are facing, on the basis of how the company spent over 10 years in lockdown, as the engines started working but there is a need to change us to other commodities in order to be able to operate without hesitation."
Who we expect before our operations resume, we will strive to bring in the rest of our products in need.
In addition, Gadaka said, "On the other hand, we urge the government of Yobe to provide us more equipment, truck carriers and vehicles to make it easier for us to carry out our duties, especially in order to transport our staff to the office due to the fact that it was very late, when we started working remotely."
He also said that in the meantime, the company has sent 25 youths to undergo training on how to operate masts and machines as well as to manage the products that the company uses in its services and how to do business with the people who interact with them.
Finally, he said that now that the company has started producing various bags of beer, including 100kg, 50kg and 25kg, and has provided sets for traders in terms of gleaning and the nature of the drinks they desire, the company is ready to satisfy them.
