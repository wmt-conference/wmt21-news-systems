The APC has accused the governor of Niger and the movement of violence in the party- leadership Hausa newspapers.
In a statement issued by the APC party, Tuesday, said the governor of Niger state, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, and the movement to bring riots into the party.
The chairman of the Association of engineers Muhammad Jibrin Imam and Secretary of the party, Barrister Muhammed Su, stated that, for six years, the state government was only 512 million naira.
The report continued, the meeting which was called by the governor for Stakeholders, which led on Saturday last week, will help to further the spread of the crisis in the party, where they say they have written to the party Secretary for national development and the state.
According to the engineer Imam( R. A.)," We understand the governor of Niger state's efforts to distribute the fruits of the party by organizing the Stakeholder conference, which is illegal, for any complaint made against the party leaders, on the basis of the written agreement of the ward, to investigate".
He continued to say that by the age of six and the establishment of the party, 512 million naira was in the party account.
He said that what he understood as the governor was in charge of the National Commission which was established July 25, 2020, led by the President to guide the issues between the party's sons and withdrawal of complaints within the party.
He said the funds we received were paid to the staff of the Secretary of the party, and other activities related to the party, the legislative elections and the coordination of other party issues such as health assistance due to the lack of access to government support, no matter the cost of the party we spent on illegal spending, we pay our taxes on it.
As I explained, the last few local government elections are the most important primaries in the country which we have made with the former commissioners and the current executive of the two local government areas in the state, which the funds spent in the elections were allocated to the commissioners.
Dan, it's a mistake for every person to say that the money of the party is spent on illegal, this is almost unfair and trying to protect the bad reputation of being hung up by the party, he said.
Of the funds which the complainant made said the money he allegedly was subjected to, the funding provided by the national Secretary of state, no money for such a person, I'm a challenge to the issue that he brought to his account.
Imam( R. A.) said that we stand on the protection of the APC from the movement or who is from the party, adding that any opposition to the party or any other party leader from the state level will be recorded by the committee in charge of the ward as described in article 21( b).
Therefore the Stakeholders do not have any particular role to play if they attempt to seize the power of the committee so their decision is not effective.
For this reason, they are the effective leaders of the party that have been approved in the state, in 21 chess and the sixth edition of the 87th edition of the party's Constitution, whatever it used to be used.
Because of the decision to make love with the leaders of the armed forces, they are wrong.
He said those who submitted with confidence in the session had not been improved at the meeting, which was not improved by Alhaji Abubakar Abubakar, the general Muhammed Garba, and HON. Ahmed long Da, until Alhaji Ibrahim Balarabe and all of the commissioners, were not members of the board of the executive Council in the state.

The paper added that the governor Abubakar Sani Bello reminded that the promise of the promised state of the country was to be fulfilled during the elections, and to travel to the local government in order to benefit everyone in the state and across the country through political ranks, which is the problem of the governor and the party.
The paper praised Federal parliamentarians who refused to attend the meeting and expressed concern over any issues between the party's members, this is not surprising to the voters who know their own pain, which they refuse to acknowledge as a party act.
Therefore, the chairman of the National standing Committee( Da) appealed to the governor Abubakar Sani Bello on his right to not try to suppress the state's politics.

The contributions of ‘ northern media writers to the unity of the North.
Social media such as Facebook, Twitter, Whatsapp, Instagram, sun and others, have long been playing a role in providing dialogue, cooperation between different communities, and sharing messages, stories, and political, educational and business goals.
Young people in Nigeria have been involved in this new technology using social media, in order to travel to and from time to time, to contribute or raise their voices.
We can say that these achievements have brought us much more development than the northern youth in trade, economy, education and local politics.
Some have eaten through writing and delivering messages Online, have found jobs or have developed the services they provide.
However, it is very difficult to see how some youth have been able to use this opportunity to continue their development, but there has been a number of violations of the Southern children of the country which have been committed in the world in public, in and outside the country, or in writing anti-discrimination and anti-discrimination laws.
What shows lack of awareness, in the development of the country's youth life.
The arrival of the Arewa media group in the country is a great blessing, to provide the youth of the North, a positive direction and to clean up the things that young people do in their social lives, so that they can be writing positive writings and spreading the ideas of the North.
It is necessary to give this organization the necessary cooperation, to achieve its good objectives, not only to the North, but also to Nigeria.
I advise our youth, especially those who use social media to bring us together to protect the dignity of the North and the right, and to create a system that will bring change to everyone.

It was reported that the late president of the war against oppression and poverty Malam Aminu Kano, had previously said that Nigeria is one country, but everyone knows his father's house!
So we say, of course when we call on International development and development, in every step, we call on the unity of the North, without discrimination or ethnic discrimination, to bring our region forward.
If we consider the way the North is now, it is not.
We should therefore use the insight God has provided to us in order to provide for the North through its economic recovery.
The North should provide Income-Generating ways to implement the budget without waiting for the Federal Government to grant it money.
In addition to the fact that we want to continue in the North, we are important to education, agriculture, tourism, health and science.
There are different ways to do that.
We think it is the North that will fulfill our ancestors' wishes!
Arewa is our pride.
