Never miss important updates! A statement issued by the APC last week accused the governor of Niger state, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, of attempting to cause chaos within the party.
Never miss important updates! A report by The Nation indicates that during the six years the party has ruled the state, only N512 million has been earmarked.
According to the document, the meeting of the governor called for stakeholders, which he chaired on Sunday night last weekend, will help to keep the party in turmoil, saying they had written to the national secretary of the party for further developments in the state.
According to Engineer Imam, “we understand that the Governor of Niger State is trying to apportion the heads of the party through the preparation of the stakeholders meeting, which is illegal, so that any complaint against the party leaders is written to the secretariat of the party in order to investigate”.
Never miss important updates! According to him, in the six years since the founding of the party, N512 million has been allocated to the party.
He said that what he understands as the governor belongs to the National Grip Committee which was formed on July 25, 2020, by the President in order to lead the organizing of the problems between the party members and the withdrawal of the complaints in the court between the party members.
Meanwhile, Legit.ng had previously reported that the chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Mr Yemi Osinbajo, disclosed this in a statement made available to newsmen in Abuja.
As I said, the last few local elections were the most important elections in the country that we have conducted with former Commissioners and current Commissioners in all the twenty-five municipalities in the state.
Accordingly, it is wrong for any person to claim that the funds of the party are being spent illegally, that is almost unjustified and that efforts to protect the wrong are being made to hang him, that no committee should investigate how the funds were spent and to whom it was formed.
The Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, made this known in a statement made available to newsmen in Abuja.
Imam Khomeini (r.a.) said that the APC will stand firm against the movement of any party or faction from the crushing of the party, adding that any accusation against the party or any party leader from the state level will be recorded by the committee that oversees the faction as stated in section 21 (B) (following), (d) on page 82 of the party system.
Therefore, party stakeholders have no role especially if they try to seize the power of the committee and their judgments have no effect.
For this reason, they are the most reliable and trustworthy leaders of the party in the state, in chess 21 and paragraph six on page 87 of the party constitution, whichever is contrary to this shall not be used.
Because the decision to despair of the leaders is wrong.
Never miss important updates! Alhaji Abubakar Magaji, General Muhammed Garba, and Hon. Ahmed Dogonkoli, as well as Alhaji Ibrahim Balarabe and all the commissioners, are not members of the executive committee of the party in the state.
Never miss important updates! The chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and the chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Mohammed Imam, will be chaired by the executive committee.
According to the document, Governor Abubakar Sani Bello recalled that the issue of the fulfillment of the promise made to the people of the state during the election, the journey of the parents of the party into the government so that everyone can benefit in the state and all parties by giving political positions, which is the problem of the governor and the association.
The document commends the members of the federal legislature for refusing to attend the meeting and for drawing attention to mediation on all the problems among party members. This is not surprising to the legislators who know their own plight.
Accordingly, there is a need for the chairman of the National Grip Committee to attract Governor Abubakar Sani Bello on the rightful position not to attempt to crush the politics of the state.

Food is the soul of all worlds, cannot be lived optional except by food.
This is why the judges of China are increasing their determination to provide the people with food.
In the past 71 years since the founding of the People’s Republic of China, the country has had great achievements in the field of food security, which has surprised the world with the number of the country’s population which has hitherto shown the number of Chinese passed 1.4 billion.
This effort has helped many pilots make huge contributions to the elimination of famine in the world, as the head of China’s Grain and Agricultural Commission Zhang Wufeng once said that since 1949 up until now, China has always put hunger at the forefront of all human activities.
But in the past few days, have some people and some Western media again "shown concern" over the issue of whether China can raise its people independently in the shadow of the global COVID-19 pandemic?
We would like to thank them for being extremely fresh and constantly caring for the Chinese presence in this world.
Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the country has managed to provide adequate food for its men.
The issue of providing adequate food for Chinese people is one of the main pillars of the ruling JKS party on a daily basis.
At the end of last week, the general secretary of the Supreme Committee of JKS, you are head of China, Xi Jinping issued an important directive to stop rationing, pointing out that everyone knows that any food and labor hardships are available.
Although this year the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the world is also damaging to the Chinese economy, China can provide adequate food for its people.
The figures released by the China Bureau of Statistics on the number of agricultural products, particularly rice, by the country this year show that the number of rice produced in the country in the first quarter of 2020 was 27.29 million tonnes, increasing by 1.08 million tonnes, an increase of 3.9% compared to the same period of 2019.
Ke Bingsheng, former dean of China Agricultural University, said that China has made great achievements in the face of the country’s food supply compared to the first phase of the policy of making domestic changes and opening the door to crossings.
Huang Jikun, director of Beijing University’s Agricultural Policy Research Institute, said during a press briefing with the China Science Daily that China’s current challenge is over the next 2 or three years, whether China can reduce the amount of wheat and rice it has stored in its grain storehouses.
The amount of grain each received now stands at 474 kilograms instead of 400 kilograms each person in the world should receive throughout the year.
And now China has installed tens of millions of tons of agricultural products to raise domestic animals only.
On the other hand, those who are anxious about the issue should keep their senses calm, go to bed, or focus on the affairs of their country.
The Chinese can raise themselves with the food they produce themselves.

Contributing ‘Northern Media Writers’ To North Unity.
Modern social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram, Bakandamiya and others, have long played a role in creating dialogue options, unity and fellowship between different societies of the world, as well as delivering messages, stories, and spreading political, educational and business initiatives.
Young people in Nigeria have become involved in this new technology using social media options, in order to travel digitally, in giving their own donations or in spitting out their lives.
We can say that these options have brought us a lot of improvements that Northern youth benefit from in trade, economy, education and local politics.
Many others eat by writing and delivering messages online, getting jobs or developing the services they run.
It is frustrating to see that instead of taking advantage of this opportunity, certain youth who were following the corrupt, oppressed and oppressed youths of the southern part of the country were held accountable to the people in and out of the country.

In addition, if we want Northern development, we give priority to education, agriculture, tourism, health and science and technology.

In Longyuan, Hongsipu, Wuzhong City, Ningxia, China
Li Yaomei or Sadiah (whose Islamic name) is famous for her struggle in life and her successful efforts to get out of poverty.
Her story tells us that, striving for self-confidence and self-seeking, it is something in the heart.
First of all, she was Li Yaomei or Sadiya and she never sat in the classroom intending to take a lesson.
Allah gave her so much insight, intelligence and wisdom that she became an example in war and poverty.
About 20 years ago, Madam Li Yaomei, suffered from stomach cancer, where she underwent surgery 3 times.
After her epilepsy again, she encountered a serious accident, now that she was walking with iron placed in her foot.
Meanwhile, Legit.ng had previously reported that the minister of finance, Rotimi Amaechi, disclosed this in a statement in Abuja.
Amazingly, the challenge that Ms. Sadiya faced slipped into a path of psalmism and insult in order to make her life better.
The Chinese government’s support, however, increased her confidence.
Its mission is to broom different kinds on the basis of vegetation consumption.
Because of their efforts, the business of filtering has grown exponentially, where various industries are ordering uniforms.
In addition, she has developed a number of machines that help her facilitate the task.
For example, it takes 15 minutes to attach one big broom, but now in this time, it will connect up to 5 brooms.
In addition, she has provided some additional machines that clean the vegetation that converts the broom.
Then there is an extra machine that cleanses her animal feed, and now even sells these machines to applicants.
Given the challenges Ms. Sadiya has faced, and the efforts she is still making to improve her life and that of her employees, it will be understood that the applicant is indeed with the gains.
The work of fighting poverty and improving quality of life is not dependent on the government.
If the government is going to provide support, but the people do not have the desire to improve their lives by making selfless efforts on the basis of their situation, only the next few days will take place without any purpose.
Her article shows that running a business or income project does not require any financial or travel goals to other cities or countries.
Because it considers the situation and uses the resources available in its environment to improve its quality of life.
Moreover, the teacher Sodom carried out these tasks on the basis of standing by her foot without relying on her husband, in order to flee and leave her.
That is to say, self-confidence and self-confidence is what is in the heart.
It shows the power of women to change their life and to stand on their feet without seeking help from anyone else.
This too is a lesson that shows that no matter what a person does, he should stick to his foot, for trusting in someone is not guaranteed.
Indeed, Ms. Sodom remained steadfast, insightful and exemplary to the rest of the population.
Also, by March of the year, Ms. Sadiya had completed the payment of all her debts, and she had stopped receiving support from the government on the basis of her own feelings.

US Politicians Will Disrupt COVID-19 Dakile Efforts - Leadership Hausa Newspapers
The Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, yesterday expressed concern over the measures taken by some countries to preserve the COVID-19 vaccine that is expected to be made available, explaining that priority must be avoided against different nations, while vaccines against the epidemic are distributed.
And the vaccines should be distributed in an appropriate way around the world, because this will benefit different countries.
Indeed, some U.S. politicians are implementing a policy of prioritizing their own use, of vaccine distribution, and of undermining international cooperation in the fight against the epidemic.
Meanwhile, the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases across the world has already passed 23 million.
In addition, there are more than 800 thousand people who have lost their lives to the disease.
Under such extreme circumstances, there is more emphasis on the effectiveness of vaccines, and the good news is that in recent days, there have been great results in the study of vaccines in other countries, which has created hope and faith for the entire international community.
But sadly, some American politicians have expressed their desire to get a vaccine.
Even the journal "Science" has clarified that the U.S. government has already terminated COVID-19 vaccine procurement deals worth over 6 billion dollars, from several pharmaceutical companies.
Despite the fact that the US government’s policy is understood to be leading the way in the spread of the virus, other developing countries also need to inject pilots, check that they are suffering the most from shortages of medical resources.
The journal “The Ecologist” also pointed out that if the United States achieves the goal of vaccines being developed, then the number of vaccines to be produced by developing countries will decrease.

As some day-to-day commentators have pointed out, even if a vaccine is successfully developed, it will not be possible to achieve the goal of post-pandemic viewing.
The international community should strengthen its cooperation.
WHO Director-General Tedros also pointed out that if post-traumatic stress is to be seen, it must be prevented from all aspects of the world, making it impossible for some parts of the world, or a few other countries to achieve the goal of reeling from the impact of the pandemic alone.
