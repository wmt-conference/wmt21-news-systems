Shouted to the world
The marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland is considered to have started well and shouts and calls in nature are beginning to attract people all over the world.
"You have the mystery, I need Iceland," says a woman in the wider world in comments to an advertisement from the marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland on the content provider YouTube.
Another viewer says that he will keep Iceland in his heart for all eternity and a young woman says that she has to get to Iceland as soon as possible, as her fiancé lives there.
Unfortunately, she is in the United States and expects to have to wait a few more months.
Another spectator asks if the hiking route to Iceland is possible, because there are no planes.
The story does not follow whether he comes from another time zone.
Egil Þórðarson from the advertising agency Peel, who co-created the ads with the international advertising agency M&C Saatchi, says that the reception has exceeded expectations.
"I came across many Inspired By Iceland campaigns that have been very successful, but this new campaign is already breaking records.
Basically, it's about creating PR value, that is, getting the foreign media to cover the campaign, and it has been incredibly successful.
In a relatively short period of time, we have received coverage in about seven hundred media outlets worldwide, covering a total of more than two billion people.
The value of that coverage is priced at ISK 1.8 billion.
That is not a bad thing at all. "
The main market is usually the United States, and the campaign has been very successful there, although the United States is not heading to the country any time soon.
According to Egils, well-known market areas such as Denmark, the United Kingdom and Germany have also been well received, such as Russia, which is a pleasant surprise.
There have also been reactions from foreign regions, such as India, which were not specifically addressed.
"These ads have traveled further than we expected," says Egil, noting that over four million people have watched the content on YouTube.
"We could not have wished for a better start."
The photos here at the opening were taken by Árni Sæberg, Morgunblaðið's photographer, during the shooting of advertisements entitled "Let It Out" in the middle of last month.
The shooting took place far and wide, such as on Skólavörðustígur in Reykjavík, in Reynisfjörður, by Skógarfoss, on Sólheimajökull and in a cave by Hjörleifshöfði.
Directors were Samúel Bjarki Pétursson and Gunnar Páll Ólafsson from Skoti productions and the cameraman was Óttar Guðnason.
The Icelandic Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, who is from Cuba and Hungary, played the roles.
Dozens of Icelanders took part in making the commercials, but at the same time as the recordings took place in the South, there was another group in the West and the Westfjords.
According to Egils, "Let It Out" is only the first item in the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign, but the aim is for a winter campaign in collaboration with M&C Saatchi.
"This is just the first phase in this work for Íslandsstofa," says Egil, adding that the collaboration with M&C Saatchi has been extremely successful.
"It's great to work with them.
In projects like this, it is important to have foreign partners with knowledge of the markets we are talking to. "
Sprengisandur: Discuss the situation on the labor market, pension funds and much more
Ásmundur Einar Daðason, Minister of Social Affairs and Children, arrives in Sprengisandur, which starts at ten o'clock in Bylgjan today.
He is also the Minister of Labor and discusses the situation on the labor market as such, the Icelandair issue and other issues.
He also discusses rural issues and the relocation of jobs to land that has gone badly and has been controversial in recent years and decades.
Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, chairman of VR, will also attend the show, but he will discuss his criticism regarding pension fund investments and present ideas for the trade union movement and employers to withdraw from the funds' boards to reduce the risk of conflicts of interest.
Ívar Ingimarsson, a tourist in East Iceland, and Árnheiður Jóhannsdóttir, the director of the North Iceland Marketing Agency, will be interviewed about the situation in tourism in the countryside.
They will look to the autumn and wonder if the success of the summer is a misleading omen for what is to come.
You can listen to the episode below, which starts at ten o'clock.
This is what she looks like today 25 years later
Actress Elisa Donovan had a successful career in teen shows of all kinds.
However, she gained world fame for her role as Amber in the film Clueless 25 years ago.
She also starred in Sabrina: The Teenage Witch with Melissa Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury and in Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49 years old, married with one child.
Little has happened to her lately, but she did manage to look back and comment on Clueless on Australian television these days.
She speaks beautifully of Brittany Murphy who died unexpectedly in 2009 and says she has been a great person.
"I have to admit that I based most of my character on girls I met at school who were not nice to me.
"As soon as I read the script, I knew who that character was," Donovan said of his performance in Clueless.
Did not want to leave the police station after spending the night
About fifty cases came to the attention of the police in the capital area today, and the police diary says that the cases were varied.
The day at the police station on Hverfisgata began with the police having to intervene with a man who had recently been released from a prison cell after having stayed there due to drunk driving.
The man did not want to leave after he was released and did not obey police orders telling him to leave.
The man earned a continued stay at the police station due to his progress.
A man was arrested this morning on suspicion of breaking into a company in Kópavogur.
Police also had to intervene with two men in Breiðholt due to a report of a physical assault.
It also happened that a woman who was eating at a shopping center in Kópavogur could not pay the bill after the meal and was therefore called to the police.
A car was also reported stolen in the city center this morning.
The driver of a white Renault van looked for her for a while and she was taken into custody.
The car has not been found.
The Curse of Gleðisveitarinn - The terrible fate of Gleestjarnar
The theory has spread on the Internet that a curse rests on the series about the Joy Band, but actress Naya Rivera recently drowned in California and thus became the third main actor of the series to die a long life ago.
The episodes about Glee are a popular series about song, dance and joy.
The episodes dealt with the so-called joy group of teenagers in high school, their love and destiny.
It was not always easy to be in the band, but through singing and dancing, the characters of the shows seemed to be able to overcome any situation that arose in their lives.
But outside of the filming location, great tragedies have befallen the actors and staff of the episodes, so much so that theories have arisen that a curse rests on the episodes.
Naya Marie Rivera played the role of Santana Lopez in the show, a cheerleader who did not call everything her grandmother.
After the series aired, Rivera married actor Ryan Dorsey and had his first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and they divorced as a result.
Dorsey, however, refused to file a complaint and the domestic violence case was dropped.
On July 8, it was announced that Rivera was missing after her four-year-old son was found alone drifting in a boat on Lake Piru in California.
The boy was found asleep in a life jacket on board the boat and he was able to inform the police that he and his mother had gone for a swim and then Rivera had brought him back into the boat but never returned there himself.
An extensive search for Rivera began.
The day after the search began, the local police chief reported that a search had revealed that Rivera had drowned.
Five days later, Rivera was found and officially pronounced dead.
It is believed that she was caught in a heavy current in the water and used her last claim to save her son.
The cause of death was recorded drunk as an accident.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith played the role of Finn Hudson in the episodes, the American footballer with the angelic voice who played a key role in bringing the Joy Band to glory and respect.
Outside of the show, however, Moneith wrestled with personal demons.
From the age of 13 he had struggled with addiction and found it difficult to escape it.
In 2013, his colleagues in the shows felt he had had enough, intervened and encouraged him to seek help.
Moneith then went into treatment and everything seemed to be looking better.
Just two months after finishing his treatment, Moneith was found dead in a hotel room after going out to have fun with friends.
Fatal disease turned out to be a deadly mixture of drugs and alcohol.
It was not considered to be an act of will.
Moneith had undergone treatment and his tolerance to intoxicants had decreased so much that a dose he had previously tolerated well proved fatal.
He was only 31 years old when he died.
His death weighed heavily on his colleagues, but under the guidance of his co-star, Lea Michele, it was decided to continue filming and dedicate an entire episode to the memory of Moneith and his character Finn.
Mark Wayne Salling played Noah "Puck" Puckerman in the show, Puck was an American football player, like Finn, and had little respect for his fellow students in the Joy Band, or until he got the courage to admit that he enjoyed it. to sing and dance.
Two years later, Salling was arrested at his home in Los Angeles on suspicion of possession of child pornography.
A search of his home turned up an enormous amount of child pornography, and the matter soon became public.
It was clear that Salling had been there.
He was subsequently charged and convicted of his crimes.
He faces up to four to seven years in prison, as well as being on the list of sex offenders and seeking treatment for child abuse.
Before sentencing the judge, Salling, who was then released on bail, was found dead near his home.
The cause of death was suicide.
It was not just the actors of the show who fell from a long time ago.
Jim Fuller was the assistant director of the show.
He was summoned to sleep in 2013, only 41 years old.
The show also featured a woman named Nancy Motes.
She was the younger sister of the superstar Julia Roberts and did not tell her sister the beautiful story, but she accused Roberts of great control and disrespectful behavior.
Motes took her own life in 2014, but she struggled with severe depression.
She left a letter to her fiancé in which she said that her mother and sister were responsible for how she was treated.
"My mother and my so-called siblings get nothing from me but the memory that they were the ones who caused my worst depression."
Lea Michel was the star of the show.
She has recently been accused of harassing and abusing her co-star on the set and of having a stellar star.
Jesse Luken guest starred in the show in 2012.
He was arrested and charged with drunk driving in 2019, which was considered a major scandal.
Actress Heather Morris played a major role in the show.
In 2010, unscrupulous hackers obtained nude photos of her and published them on the Internet.
Actors Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner both starred in the show and had an affair outside of the show.
Benoist later reported that Jenner had abused her in the relationship.
Flowers can be placed on almost anything
It increases the development of children when they get to play outside in the garden with their parents to grow flowers and watch them grow and prosper.
It can also be done indefinitely with flowers, as the Swedish photographer Anna Kubel points out.
Just having fun with the kids in the yard is something that will never be forgotten.
They will remember the flowers, the fragrance and, of course, the precious time they spent with their parents.
Bought a boat after tenth grade
"I don't think there are many fishermen who work in the country's kindergartens," says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, who fishes in the summer but studies psychology at the University of Iceland during the winter. "
Coastal fishing is a very comfortable summer job when you are studying.
If you fish well, you can have a good income and I think it's great to be able to skip taking out a student loan.
The income is also good enough for me into the winter, "says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, a 25-year-old psychology student who is engaged in coastal fishing this summer as in previous summers.
Axel was recently laid to rest at a pier in Tálknafjörður when a journalist caught word of him late in the evening at the beginning of the week. "
"The winter I was in the tenth grade, I took the captaincy for boats under twelve meters long and I bought my boat the summer after I finished primary school.
I have been fishing on my boat all summer since.
I bought the boat used by an acquaintance of mine, Hartmann Jónsson, and I named the boat after him.
Hartmann had grown up when I bought the boat and stopped being at sea and he was very happy when he saw that the boat bore his name.
Hartmann died a few years after I took over the boat, "says Axel, adding that he bought the boat for three million.
"I made a contract with Hartmann to pay half, one and a half million, at the beginning of the summer and the other half at the end of the summer when I had finished fishing.
So I had the boat debt-free at the end of my first summer on it. "
But how could a boy have one and a half million to pay off in a boat when he had just finished primary school?
"I had deposited and saved money, I had been working with my father at sea when I was a boy, I had been fishing with him all summer and got my share.
I also put my confirmation money in my boat fund. "
Axel was born in Ísafjörður, where all his mothers are from, but he has lived in Kópavogur since he was a boy.
"I can fish here in the western area because I have a legal domicile with my grandmother in Ísafjörður.
I learned in those areas here west of rowing with Dad.
I move between fjords depending on how I feel, because this fishing area covers the entire Westfjords.
Although I like to be in the west, I have also fished around Snæfellsnes and elsewhere.
I have also fished in the south, but then I prefer grayling, "says Axel, who always rains alone early in the morning and sometimes says that he talks to the seagulls and sings in the sky, in the loneliness of the hours together out on the Baltic Sea.
"The internet connection at sea is good, so I can call, listen to radio shows and music.
I don't mind being alone on a boat.
Of course I try to avoid getting into danger, but of course there have been occasional storms, but never a great danger, "says Axel, who is lucky that he is never seasick.
He says the length of the working day depends on how the fishing goes at any given time.
"In coastal fishing, I have never been fishing for more than 14 hours at a time, but I have also been fishing in other systems, for example in the rental quota, but then I have been fishing for one and a half days out at sea to fish. “
He says that the arrangement for coastal fishing is such that he can catch 770 kilos a day, which he finds restrictive.
"Other restrictions are that I can not fish on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, and I can only fish twelve days a month, these four months of coastal fishing, in May, June, July and August.
In my opinion, fishermen should choose their fishing days according to the weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary pressure is on people to row instead of having 48 days throughout the summer and being able to choose for themselves.
The zoning could also go my way and the sea area that is well located by the fishing grounds should be able to enjoy it, "says Axel, who mostly pulls cod from the salty sea in his coastal fishing, but also only saithe and a few other species float with him.
Axel works during the winter with his university studies at the Núpi kindergarten in Kópavogur.
"I don't think there are many fishermen working in the country's kindergartens," says Axel proudly, adding that he only intended to work temporarily at the kindergarten.
"I get stuck there because I think it's a great job.
I hope that the study of psychology will be useful to me at the preschool level in the future, "says Axel, who has also come a long way in studying business administration.
Registration error prevented homecoming asepsis
An error in the registration form that people fill out when they arrive in the country meant that an individual, resident in this country, was not called back for sampling.
It is not a condition to register an ID number if the person in question fills out the form in English, as is the case when it is done in Icelandic.
"This will be examined this week," says an expert in the field of disease control at the Directorate of Health.
Three domestic infections were diagnosed at Landspítali's virology department yesterday.
One of those who turned out to be positive arrived in the country on July 15, two days after the rules on so-called return asepsis came into force.
Those who lived in Iceland are then screened on arrival in the country and again summoned for sampling four to five days later.
It was stated in the RÚV lunch news that the person in question had, however, followed the old system.
Border sampling was negative and he was not recalled for screening for the virus.
Kamilla Rut Sigfúsdóttir, an expert in the field of disease control at the Directorate of Health, says in an interview with the news agency that this can be traced to an error in the electronic registration form.
If people fill out the registration form in English, it is not a condition to enter an ID number, as is the case in the Icelandic version.
After all, it was primarily intended for foreign tourists.
Therefore, the person in question did not receive an automatic invitation to come for sampling.
Kamilla says that many people have followed the rules on return portals even though they have filled out the registration form in English and in some cases employers have also been vigilant about sending people back for sampling after they arrived in the country.
"This week we will look at how it can make it easier for people to access this to raise awareness of the process."
The man is in solitary confinement and six have been quarantined.
They all go for sampling but two had started to show symptoms.
Infection tracking is now underway with the three infections that were diagnosed yesterday, but it is mostly over due to two infections that were reported on Friday.
In both cases, the sequencing of Icelandic Genetics has revealed that there are variants of the coronary virus that have not been found here before.
In the second case, the ties have been directed at Israel, although it is known that the person who brought the virus to the country had also traveled to other European countries.
Kamilla says that it should be clear tomorrow where the other virus was coming from.
There are now a total of 15 in isolation according to the COVID website. is.
135 are quarantined.
Four out of five infections unrelated
Five domestic infections have been diagnosed in Iceland in recent days.
Four of them are completely unrelated and, for example, the source of the infection that appeared at the Rey Cup sports tournament yesterday has not been found.
Contagion is still ongoing.
Originally, about thirty were uniquely sent to quarantine, but they were reduced to sixteen.
A total of 34 people are in quarantine due to these new infections that were diagnosed yesterday.
This is the second time in a short time that an infection has been detected at a sporting event and it has raised questions about whether such events should be held.
Jóhann K. Jóhannsson, communications manager at the National Commissioner of Police's Civil Protection Department, says it is possible, as long as people follow the norms and rules.
"We are constantly urging all those who live here that it is necessary to maintain individual infection control.
We also need to remind people who are holding events that there are certain rules in place that need to be followed.
Then it is possible to hold events, "says Jóhann.
He says that infection can be prevented by maintaining individual infection control.
In addition, rules and standards are under constant review.
"What needs to be done, and what the Department of Civil Protection and the Directorate of Health are constantly urging people to do, is to consider these individual infection control measures.
Both at home and at service companies.
That people wash their hands and use alcohol.
This prevents infection from continuing, "says Jóhann.
"We need to urge people to continue on the good path we were on, in order to sustain the progress we have made so far."
40% of COVID-19 victims had type 2 diabetes
Devon Brumfield heard on the phone how difficult it was for her father to catch his breath.
Her father had diabetes and she encouraged him to seek medical help.
The next day he died.
The death was attributed to sudden respiratory distress due to coronary heart disease.
Diabetes was listed on the death certificate as an underlying problem, and Brumfield, who also has diabetes, is terrified that the same thing will happen.
Reuters reports that Brumfield's fears are not unfounded.
Figures from a new study commissioned by the US government show that almost 40% of those who died had type 2 diabetes as an underlying disease.
When the proportion of those who had not reached the age of 65 is examined, the proportion increases to half.
The CDC's investigation included more than 10,000 people in 15 states who died from the coronary heart disease between February and May.
Jonathan Wortham, an expert in infectious diseases at the CDC, says the results are striking, not least for those who have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and their loved ones.
Was hidden in the slow growth Reuters commissioned a survey and indicated the responses from the 12 countries that responded to similar proportions.
10 states, including California, Arizona and Colombia, have not yet started reporting underlying diseases.
"Diabetes was already a slow-growing epidemic.
"COVID-19 has now broken through like a powerful age," Reuters quoted Elbert Huang, director of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the University of Chicago, as saying.
Diabetes is more common among blacks and people of South American descent, who have also suffered worse from coronary heart disease.
One of the best protections for those with type 2 diabetes is to keep the disease under control through exercise, a healthy diet and the help of healthcare professionals.
The coronary heart disease epidemic, however, has made it difficult for many to maintain a routine.
The high price of insulin has forced some to keep coming to work and risk being exposed to the virus.
Reuters points out that the US authorities should have been aware of the danger that those with type 2 diabetes could be caused by the virus.
When the SARS coronary heart disease spread in 2003, more than 20% of them had the disease, and during the swine flu epidemic in 2009, this group was three times more likely to need to be hospitalized.
When MERS showed up in 2012, one study showed that 60% of those who died or were admitted to the intensive care unit had diabetes.
Charles S. Dela Cruz, a researcher at Yale University, says that because the effects of the COVID-19 virus could last longer, the epidemic has uncovered a number of previously unknown complications.
"I'm afraid we'll see a tidal wave of problems when this is over," said Andrew Bolton, chairman of the International Diabetes Association.
Doctors have warned that the coronary heart disease epidemic could indirectly lead to an increase in diabetes-related complications, including kidney disease and kidney dialysis.
New research suggests that coronary heart disease may lead to an increase in the number of cases of diabetes.
Reuters reports that researchers are trying to understand the link between the coronary heart disease and diabetes mellitus 2.
The virus attacks the heart, lungs and kidneys, organs that are already weak in many people with diabetes.
In addition, high glucose and lipid levels in diabetics can cause a true "cellular storm", as it is called when the immune system reacts too hard and attacks the body.
Damaged endothelial cells can also lead to inflammation, which in turn can lead to fatal blood clots.
"This is all one big puzzle," says Dela Cruz.
"It's all interconnected."
The news has been corrected.
"We were offered champagne, then they left the room"
The couple Ásrún Magnúsdóttir and Atli Bollason complied with the unusual request from the artist Ragnar Kjartansson to have sex in front of a camera for a work that the artist was setting up in Paris.
"We loved each other so it was not complicated."
Atli Bollason will never forget when he met his wife and mother, Ásrún Magnúsdóttir, for the first time.
"I was fascinated by her.
Of course, it was just the radiance, but then I also thought it was incredibly sweet.
And it is still considered, "he says.
Ásrún also remembers this, as her husband regularly recalls the first meeting.
"I always hear this story.
Last weekend only, "she says, who was also attracted to her husband when she first met her.
"I felt and feel so much excitement around Atli, that I feel it.
There is a lot going on and a lot going on and I was fascinated by it. "
Atli says that the couple have emphasized in their relationship going their own way.
"We do not tie our bags with the same knots as our fellow travelers.
We avoid routines that we analyze around us. "
That is possibly the reason why they took the talk from the artist Ragnar Kjartansson just joyfully, although it was unusual to say the least.
"Kristín Anna, our mutual friend, contacts us and asks if we can come and eat dessert with her, Raggur and Ragnar's wife Ingibjörg, at Snaps."
They accepted the invitation, met the trio at Snaps and had dessert wine and dessert each.
They listened to Ragnar guide them through their plans for an art exhibition he planned to set up at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris this autumn.
"He had a multi-channel video called Scenes from Western Culture.
He described it in a simple way. "
Ásrún says that he described the work as banal and decadent scenes from the everyday life of Westerners.
"He had sketches of all the scenes he was going to shoot and lastly he told us what he wanted to know if we were interested in participating."
The scene that Ragnar asked the couple to take part in was to show a young middle-class couple falling in love in a minimalist room.
"This is intercourse with the beginning and the end," says Atli.
The couple did not know Ragnar much, even though they knew about him and he about them "but they knew us and felt we fit into this.
They said they did not want to advertise for people.
Maybe they thought they would not get the right people but people who would get sexual masturbation from performing for others. "
They said goodbye to Ragnar and agreed to think about it, but it did not take long.
"When we walked out of Snaps, we said, 'Are we not just into this?'
It was just like that.
I trust Ragnar as an artist and his whole team, "says Ásrún and Atli agrees.
"It's about love and intimacy"
The scene was filmed in a nice apartment on Mýrargatan.
There was a very small film crew; cameraman, Ragnar and sound engineer and the couple.
After the recording had been turned on, everyone left the room to wait outside in a car except Atli and Ásrún.
"We had not decided anything how we should be.
We got some little instructions but we tried to forget the time and place.
Being unaware of what we were doing and for whom.
It was not a game, we just loved each other so it was not complicated, "says Ásrún.
But was it romantic?
"Yes, it was a bit romantic," says Atli and Ásrún agrees.
"We were offered champagne before they left the room.
It was a bit like being on holiday in a nice hotel in Paris. "
The team was pleased with the couple's performance in the work that moved them.
"When cameraman Tommi looked at this, he cried, he thought it was so beautiful," says Atli.
"It's as much about love and intimacy as the intercourse itself," says Ásrún.
The couple's parents have seen the work and Atli says that his mother heard the voice of his son at the Reykjavík Art Museum and then realized that he was part of the work.
"Then she turns around and starts to dig into this," says Atli.
"Mom and Dad saw this in Paris.
We had not told anyone this way, but then my dad just sent me a message and said: It's nice to come across the small family in the Palais de Tokyo, "recalls Ásrún.
And do you think the participation in the project has deepened the relationship between Ásrún and Atli?
"At least we're still together, so maybe this deepened something.
At least this deepened my relationship with my in-laws, "says Ásrún and laughs.
Ásrún herself saw the work in Copenhagen with her colleague.
"I found it a little difficult not to be with you but with someone else," she says, turning to her husband.
"But it was nice to see this because it's just one scene in a much bigger work and when you saw it with the other works it's very cool.
I could tear myself away from this a bit and was just proud.
And there was the little bean in my stomach, "says Ásrún, who was not pregnant with the couple's other child when the scene was filmed.
"It was just beautiful."
Anna Marsibil Clausen talked to Ásrún and Atli in Ástarsögur on Rás 1.
Swansea win the first semi-final
Swansea beat Brentford 1-0 in a dramatic game.
This was the teams' first game in the semi-finals of the play-offs to reach the English Premier League.
The match took place at Swansea's home ground in Wales.

Brentford played the rest of the game one man less and in the 82nd minute Swansea players took advantage of the difference.
Andre Ayew then made up for the free kick by scoring a great goal and securing Swansea a 1-0 victory.
Swansea lead 1-0 in the duel, but the second game will take place next Wednesday at Brentford's home ground.
Without an ambassador for five years since 2009
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the US ambassador to Iceland, is in the media spotlight after CBS announced this morning that he wanted an armed bodyguard as he feared for his life.
However, appointing an ambassador to Iceland has not been easy for the President of the United States.
Since Carol Van Voorst resigned as US Ambassador at the end of April 2009, the country has had a total of no ambassadors for 62 months, more than five years.
Van Voorst resigned under strange circumstances, but Kastljós announced in 2009 that she should have received the Falcon Word.
On her way to a farewell meeting with the President of Iceland, she received a phone call from the President's Office to the effect that she would not be honored.
After leaving Iceland, she taught international relations at Army War College.
Sixteen months passed before Van Voorst's successor took office in September 2010.
This is partly due to the fact that Robert S. Connan had been appointed ambassador but then resigned.
Loius Ariega, who had worked in the Foreign Service for decades, finally took over the job.
He resigned in the fall of 2013 and took over as ambassador to Guatemala.
Then came another ambassador-free period.
Robert Barber received the approval of the US Congress in January 2015 and came to work shortly afterwards, but by then no ambassador had been present for 13 months.
Barber was politically appointed, not a diplomat, but had worked as a lawyer and supported Barack Obama's election fund.
He resigned as soon as Donald Trump took office on January 20, 2017, as is customary with a politically appointed ambassador.
The Trump administration took an unusually long time to appoint both ambassadors and high-ranking officials in Washington's administration.
It took two years for the US Congress to convene a meeting of Jeffrey Ross Gunter to question him and confirm his position as ambassador to Iceland.
In his testimony at the Althing, he said that he had never been to Iceland but often to Western Europe, but that his wife, who had died, had been broken by Dutch rock.
Gunter is a political figure, was previously a dermatologist in California and has been a prominent member of the Republican Jewish Coalition.
Casino owner Sheldon Adelson founded the organization, but Adelson is an ardent supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter came to work in Iceland in May 2019, but then there had been no ambassador in the country since early 2017, for two years and four months, which is the longest example in Iceland.
This is due both to the length of the Trump administration's appointment of key people and to the fact that in recent years the work of the US Congress has slowed down considerably, including the confirmation of ambassadors.
Since 2009, there has been a total of no ambassadors in Iceland for over five years.
However, this has not prevented construction work by the embassy, which recently opened its headquarters at Engjateig.
The construction is estimated to have cost around 6.5 billion, but thick security walls surround the building and bulletproof glass is in all the windows.
However, it does not seem to have been enough to fill the current ambassador with a sense of security because he is said to fear for his life and has requested an armed bodyguard.
Former ÍBV player suffered racism in Iceland - "It was a mistake to come to Iceland"
Tonny Mawejje, a former ÍBV player, says that he suffered racism when he was in Iceland and that he regrets coming to Iceland.
This is stated in an interview with Tonny which appeared on the Ugandan media Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined the Uganda Police FC team that plays in Uganda's top division.
In the interview with the Daily Monitor, Tonny talks about many things, including his time in Iceland but he played with ÍBV, Val and Þróttir in Iceland.
"When I came to Iceland, I did not play in the middle as I used to play.
The captain of the team was in that position but in addition he also had the jersey number I wanted so I got neither of what I wanted, "says Tonny but he played on the right wing during the season with ÍBV.
Among the things Tonny talks about is the racism he experienced in Iceland.
He says this is a problem that many black players face when they play in Europe.
"It happened to me once, but since I did not understand the language, I just ignored what was said to me.
Later I heard about the case and then I asked my friend what the case was about.
He then told me that my opponent had made racist remarks about me after I tackled him. "
In 2014, Tonny left Iceland for Norway, where he joined Haugesund.
There he says he has made the mistakes he regrets the most.
Tonny had not managed to get into the starting line-up at Haugesund but he wanted to play more to get into the national team.
He then asked to return to Iceland on loan but he then joined Val.
"It was a mistake to come back to Iceland on loan.
I think if I had been in Norway longer, I would have had the opportunity I wanted, "says Tonny, but he hoped that if he played well in Norway, he would probably get further.
He wants to say that the loan to Iceland has fulfilled his dreams of joining the big team in Europe.
Found a worm in a woman's throat
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found a 3.8 cm long black worm in the throat of a woman who was looking for it.
Doctors were able to pull the worm out with forceps.
An investigation revealed that they were parasites.
CNN reports this.
The woman had eaten sashimi, which are thin slices of meat, a few days before.
The woman recovered soon after the worm was removed, but parasites such as these are often found in raw meat or fish.
Following the rise of sushi in the West, the number of cases involving parasites has risen, according to CNN.
Fear that another wave is beginning in Europe
Spain is now in the spotlight over concerns over another wave of coronary heart disease in Europe, where the government has taken action to stem the spread of the coronavirus virus again.
In Catalonia, all entertainment has been put on ice for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona where the number of infections is increasing.
Other European countries have also taken action to increase the number of infections in Spain, but in the UK everyone has to quarantine on their return from Spain, as in Norway, and France has been warned against traveling to Spain.
The number of infections is also rising again in France and Germany, where the government is trying to find a balance between stopping the spread of the virus and restarting the economy.
However, the situation in Europe is good compared to the rest of the world, where the incidence of infections worldwide is approaching 300,000 per day, with the highest number of infections in the Americas and South Asia.
The number of confirmed infections worldwide has risen to 16 million, according to Johns Hopkins University, and the number of deaths confirmed to be linked to the virus has risen to 644,000.
Gerður's mosaic work can finally be enjoyed to the fullest
In front of Tollhúsið in Reykjavík is a large and deep hole.
On top of it are men with orange helmets.
There is also a large dig.
And more smaller machines.
The street is closed to traffic.
But the sidewalk is passable and many people stop there now and admire works of art made of millions of mosaic tiles - as if they had never seen it before.
Maybe they've never seen it before.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.
The work has so far been somewhat hidden, right in front of it were parking lots that were always occupied.
People parked there, locked the car in a hurry and then jumped off to do their errands in the city center.
"Lively and diverse public spaces" and "attractive urban atmosphere" are the guiding light in the reconstruction of Tryggvagatan, which is currently underway.
The goal is to beautify the area and allow Gerður Helgadóttir's mosaic work at Tollhúsið to enjoy a better view.
In front of the project, there will be a square and since the area is close to the sun, it is considered suitable as a residential area for pedestrians.
The artwork will be illuminated and the material will now enjoy itself better than before on this 142 square meter surface.
There will also be small "fog sprayers" in the area, a kind of water sculpture, which offer play and give the area a certain mystery.
In this way, the improvements are described by the City of Reykjavík, which is carrying out the project together with Veitur.
The water supply, heating and electricity pipes will be renewed.
Many of them have come of age, but the sewage and cold water pipes date from 1925 and have served the residents and businesses in the city center for almost a century.
When the street is reopened after construction, cars can drive through it again.
However, it will be a one-way street and at the same time create a calmer and more accessible space for pedestrians.
An information about the Customs House on the director of customs' website says that the house was taken into use in 1971 and its architect was Gísli Halldórsson.
Due to the harbor damage reaching through the house, a 250 square meter windowless wall surface was formed to the street.
The building committee and the architect agreed that such an area would have a negative effect on the overall streetscape, if no special measures were taken to decorate the appearance of the building.
The parties therefore agreed to have a permanent work of art installed there.
At that time, a lot was said about Gerður Helgadóttir, an artist, says in the summary.
She had worked extensively on mosaic works in Germany and elsewhere.
It was decided to contact her first before deciding whether to hold a competition for the project.
It had often been discussed that the work needed to reflect life by the harbor, as the harbor had been the lifeblood of Reykjavík since it was built.
When talking to the artist, she was immediately taken aback by such a work.
It was agreed that she would receive drawings and other assistance before returning from the country, where she would work on the proposals abroad.
Gerður was given the time she decided she needed, and when she returned home, she put forward some suggestions for discussion.
It was agreed without delay to ask her to do the work.
It was also requested that a comprehensive agreement be made with her and the famous artwork company in Germany, the Oidtmann Brothers, but Gerður had worked with them for a long time on the installation of famous works of art throughout Europe.
Agreements were reached and Gerður worked on the artwork for the installation of the brothers' workshop, which then took care of the installation of the Customs House.
The whole work was done extremely well, both by Gerður Helgadóttir and Oidtmannbræður, says the summary.
It has always withstood unpleasant Icelandic weather.
It took Gerður about two years to complete the work, which was done and set up in 1972 and 1973.
The artist died two years after the Customs House work was completed, only 47 years old.
Preparing to relocate more institutions
Ásmundur Einar Daðason, Minister of Social Affairs, announces that more public institutions will be relocated in the near future.
This was said by the Minister in the episode Sprengisandi á Bylgjan at noon.
It was recently announced that the Fire Department of the Housing and Civil Engineering Institute will be moved north to Sauðárkrókur this autumn.
Six experts in the field of firefighting work for the agency, but none of them intend to follow the agency to the north, and the National Association of Firefighters and Ambulancemen has criticized the relocation.
"I think we need to take it a step further.
I am preparing further steps into this being.
Further transport, "said Ásmundur.
He says he is convinced that the vast majority of the nation wants to see a greater distribution of public institutions throughout the country.
"I think further political decisions need to be made about relocating public jobs, as I was doing with the Housing and Civil Engineering Agency," said Ásmundur, who also took the example of other agencies that have been relocated and were of great importance to communities abroad, such as the relocation of the Food Administration to Selfoss, the National Land Survey of Iceland to Akranes and unemployment insurance on Skagaströnd.
All the highlights from the second day of the Championship
The 94th Icelandic Freestyle Championships ended at Þórsvellir in Akureyri today.
Several competition records were set on the second day of the competition.
An exciting competition in the women's hammer throw was expected at Þórsvellir, but Vigdís Jónsdóttir from FH set the Icelandic record in the hammer throw in 2014, which lasted until Elísabet Rut Rúnarsdóttir from ÍR improved her record in May last year.
Vigdís won the Icelandic record back earlier this summer and has been in ghost form lately, but she has tripled the Icelandic record so far this summer.
Elísabet Rut has been struggling with injuries and did not recover today.
She had only one valid throw out of five, throwing 25.69 meters, which is far from her best.
Vigdís threw the longest of all today, or 60.08 meters in her last attempt and at the same time set a competition record.
Her Icelandic record she set earlier in July is 62.69 meters, so she was somewhat away from that.
Guðrún Karítas Hallgrímsdóttir from ÍR had the second best throw of the day but she improved her best result with a throw of 50.18 meters.
In the men's category, FH-ingurinn Hilmar Örn Jónsson, Icelandic record holder in hammer throw, won a convincing victory but he threw 73.84 meters in his penultimate throw and set a competition record.
His Icelandic record in the discipline is 75.26 meters.
Guðni Valur Guðnason, Olympian and Icelandic record holder in round robin, won a competition in shot put at Þórsvellir yesterday but today he competed in round robin which is his main sport.
Guðni Valur's Icelandic record is 65.53 meters, but he threw the longest 59.13 meters today and secured the victory.
Valdimar Hjalti Erlendsson threw the second longest today but he had one valid throw that was enough for 2nd place, 49.43 meters.
Hafdís Sigurðardóttir, Icelandic record holder in long jump, won the long jump competition with superiority, but Hafdís jumped the longest 6.25 meters today, which is almost 40 cm from her Icelandic record.
In the women's 200 meter race, it was ÍR-ingurinn Guðbjörg Jóna Bjarnadóttir who was the hardest to sprint, finishing in 24.04 seconds and her Icelandic record in the discipline is 23.45 seconds.
Guðbjörg Jóna was victorious in Akureyri but she won two gold medals yesterday, in the 100 meter run and in the 4 x 100 meter relay and then also in the 4 x 400 meter relay today.
In the men's category, Kolbeinn Höður Gunnarsson from FH was first in the 200 meter run in 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds ahead of Óliver Máni Samúelsson from Árman.
Like Guðbjörg Jóna, Kolbeinn Höður won gold in the 100 meters yesterday as well as in the 400 meters.
Will not be fined for 27 million ISK Bitcoin harvest
The Internal Revenue Service has rejected the claim of the Director of Tax Investigations, who demanded a fine for failing to declare his capital income from the sale of the electronic currency Bitcoin.
The committee concludes that the director of tax investigations had not given clear reasons as to why it was necessary to fine the man.
The committee's ruling states that the director of tax investigations believed that the man had submitted materially incorrect tax returns for the income years 2016 and 2017.
He had underestimated his capital income from the sale of the 27 million Bitcoin currency, either intentionally or through gross negligence.
The man should be fined for his conduct.
The man rejected this in a letter to the committee.
He admitted, however, that in 2016 he had sold e-coins for 27 million.
He would have acquired it with a digger in the years 2009 and 2010 when this would have been both easy and cheap with a normal home computer.
He also pointed out that when he sold the electronic currency, the tax practice for such a sale had been significantly vague and unpredictable.
It would hardly have been possible to expect ordinary citizens to be aware of such measures in their tax returns.
He had not intended to avoid paying tax on the harvest and had declared his property on the tax return as a deposit in a foreign currency account.
He had asked both experts and the Director of Internal Revenue how this was done, but without success.
He also felt that it needed to be taken into account that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years when he started digging for Bitcoin.
He would therefore have been in a worse position than others to familiarize himself with complex rules on which the tax authorities had not formed a clear opinion.
The man therefore considered it right that his taxes for these two income years should be re-determined and the levy applied, but otherwise no penalty should be imposed.
He also reiterated that he worked in Iceland and had paid taxes in this country since 2012.
He had never intended to evade his duties.
The demand for a fine was excessive and would plunge him into debt.
Brynjólfur mentions: "This man understands what football is"
Brynjólfur Andersen Willumsson has been a lot between people's teeth but has also impressed because of his performance so far this season with Breiðablik in the Pepsi Max division.
Flashes will be in the line of fire tonight when they receive ÍA live on Station 2 Sport.
Brynjólfur then takes out a suspension due to four warnings during the season and therefore does not come to the game with a new haircut as in the games of the summer so far.
He had had "blah, blah, blah" written on his head before the game against HK last Thursday, which HK won 1-0.
"I do not know exactly who he was answering with the payment, but speaking of character, this one was better to try in the game.
He did not go into hiding.
He wants to get the ball every single time and if anyone was going to level this game, I thought he would do it or make it, "said Guðmundur Benediktsson in the Pepsi Max booth, when it came to Brynjólfur.
"I'm supposed to be here for the people."
"It is sometimes difficult to realize what position he is in.
He looks a bit to the left when the games start to pass, but he has a very free roll in the team, "said Hjörvar Hafliðason.
Þorkell Máni Pétursson says Brynjólf is a real entertainer and is happy to have such a colorful man in the league: "Nobody disputes that this is a character.
This is a fun guy and I love this with my hair, and to always be ready to show up and answer in interviews.
There are an incredible number of people preoccupied with him, who tell me that this man understands what football is.
"I'm an entertainer.
I should be here for the people and enjoy it. "
People are reading the interviews with Brynjólf, people are paying their way in and watching what is next on his hair.
This man is just a genius, "said Máni.
KR player says he wants to leave the club - "I have been in contact with several teams in the B-league"
Tobias Thomsen, a KR player in the Pepsi Max League, seems to be leaving the team.
According to the Danish media Bold, Tobias is ready to return home to Denmark.
Fótbolti.net also reported the case.
Tobias wants to get the start of the season in his home country, but for that he must first terminate his contract with KR, as the Danish league starts before the Icelandic one ends.
The club knows that I miss Denmark and has shown me a lot of understanding, "said Tobias in a conversation with Bold.
"I have been in contact with several teams in the B-league and will probably switch before the Icelandic season ends.
There are not many teams in Denmark that can afford to pay my contract with KR. "
He also says that he will probably have to accept a pay cut in Denmark.
"Companies in Denmark have probably felt more of the economic impact of the virus than in Iceland."
Hjólahvíslarinn Bjartmar has recovered bikes for millions - Now answers for himself after DV coverage
Unlike most others, Bjartmar Leósson has had a hobby for over a year.
He sniffs and rescues lost and stolen bicycles, electric bicycles and scooters.
Bjartmar has earned the name "hjólahvíslarinn" for this.
Yesterday there was a lot of fuss when a man published a story about his relationship with Bjartmar.
DV then referred to a discussion on the Facebook group of Vesturbæingar where it was stated that Bjartmar had spoken to the man at Austurvellir and said that the scooter might have been stolen.
The only thing that could be read from the original writings of the electric shuttle was that Bjartmar had stolen him.
That text has now been changed on Facebook and the headline of the original DV news item updated accordingly.
Bjartmar says that the original news of the case is not at all descriptive of what really happened yesterday at Austurvellir.
Bjartmar said that he had received information from the victim of an electric shuttle theft that these were indeed his electric shuttles.
The information was received by the alleged owner from others, but the information turned out to be incorrect, says Bjartmar.
"I looked at the guy and I recognized the shuttle, with information that there was an electric shuttle that had been missing for a very long time and had been searched for.
I certainly hesitated at first, but when I saw him getting ready to leave on the shuttle, I decided to punch him to talk to the man.
The owner was sure of his guilt, so I decided to have a conversation with the man.
"In general, I do very well in such matters, but before I could finish what I had to say, the man had taken my word for it."
Bjartmar says that the man in the electric shuttle had at one point invited him to show him the receipt for the bike and had called the police himself.
"Yes, cool," said Bjartmar, "let's just get this straight."
Then the owner of the electric shuttle proved ownership of his electric shuttle and drove off.
Later, the rightful owner of the electric shuttle told his story on Facebook, as reported in a previous article.
In the little over a year that Bjartmar has practiced this practice, he says he can count the times he got on the edge with people on the fingers of one hand.
"I have had peaceful relations with the most difficult people in Reykjavík," said Bjartmar and points out that bicycle thieves are often the youngest brothers and sisters in society, addicts, people with mental disabilities and other people who for some reason are on the streets.
"Addiction is a hard master and somehow the next dose has to be financed, unfortunately the theft of such liquid assets is an easy way to that goal," says Bjartmar.
"My communication with these people is really so good that I have brought a lot of the good people with me to the team.
There are examples of people going to treatment and taking action and then looking to me and helping me with what I am doing, "he says.
In general, Bjartmar's communication with cyclists is polite.
Some people know about him and what he is doing and offer to show him receipts, bike numbers and so on.
Bicycle theft is a big problem that has been little discussed.
Furthermore, Bjartmar says that the police have even started to warn people to talk to him about stolen bicycles.
Bjartmar is dissatisfied with DV's previous news coverage and says that he is not some kind of self-appointed police in a personal search for justice.
Asked if he is still not on slippery ice with his actions, and if this is not primarily the role of the police, Bjartmar certainly says so.
"Of course the police have to do this, but the fact of the matter is that the police are not doing this at all.
For example, I have watched police officers drive away from a large pile of stolen wheels.
She is downright powerless in these matters. "
"When the police are not doing anything about this, and this is just in front of your nose, and experience has shown that I can succeed in this area, then why not?" Bjartmar asks.
He says that he has achieved so much success in finding stolen bikes that he sometimes comes across his "clients" on the street that then they just got the Bjartmar bikes they had previously picked up.
The times that Bjartmar has called for the help of the police, it has happened that she does not show up.
"This is just not working with the police, and it's not my fault and it's not the owners of the bicycles who are to blame," said Bjartmar, and he is sorry that the victims of bicycle thefts have to suffer from the indifference of the police in this area.
Bjartmar's success is not disputed.
There are many stories of people thanking Bjartmar for getting their property back to them.
Bjartmar himself says that he has long since lost count of the number of bicycles he has returned, but the amounts will of course run into millions, if not tens of millions.
Electric scooters, electric bicycles and electric shuttles weigh heavily, but electric bicycles can cost less than half a million.
Bjartmar works during the day at a kindergarten and every other weekend he works in a dormitory.
His bike search is therefore unpaid work that he does in his free time.
Pension funds and long shadows
2019 was a great anniversary year in the history of pension funds in Iceland.
Although officials had received pensions from the King of Denmark all the way from the 19th century, in 1919 a pension fund for civil servants was established, which eventually became the pension fund for all public employees.
The foundation for the current pension funds for general employees was then laid with comprehensive wage agreements in the labor market in 1969, which provided for occupational pension funds with compulsory membership and full fundraising from the beginning of 1970.
In 1974, laws were enacted on the basis of these agreements and the pension system continued to grow thereafter.
The workers' pension system was not the only radical change brought about by the 20th century trade union movement.
Unemployment insurance had been obtained in a similar way in a historic strike in 1955, and the organization also gradually enforced its demands for sickness and sickness benefits, substantial holiday entitlements, shortening of working hours, housing reform and more.
All these rights cost a great and severe struggle, but turned out to be, in retrospect, a much greater and more lasting wage increase than the increase in auras in the wage envelope, which disappeared as quickly in the heat of inflation that characterized the post-war period until 1990, as many remember.
The run-up to the establishment of general pension funds in 1969 was both long and complex.
Although people eventually agreed that the funds would in fact be the property of fund members, the trade union movement had to agree that their boards should be composed of representatives of employers and fund members equally.
In the years following the establishment of the funds, the demand for a majority of workers on the boards of the funds was often discussed in trade unions, but it never materialized, and we are still left with the unusual arrangement that representatives of fund members do not have a majority on the boards.
In Article 36 of Act no. 129/1997 on compulsory insurance of pension rights and the activities of pension funds deals with the investment policy of the funds.
Point 1 states that "a pension fund shall be guided by the interests of fund members."
Point 5 also states: "The pension fund shall set ethical standards in investments."
Lífeyrissjóður verslunarmanna's shareholder policy includes the following provisions, following the aforementioned legal provisions:
The Pension Fund is a party to the United Nations (UN PRI) Rules on Responsible Investment, along with many of the largest pension funds and institutional investors in the West and in Europe.
The rules discuss how the emphasis on environmental and social issues as well as good corporate governance can contribute to improved investment performance of portfolios.
In this way, the interests of investors and the goals of society go hand in hand in a broader context.
LV considers it important that companies, especially those listed on the stock market, adopt a public policy of: maintaining good corporate governance, social responsibility and the environment.
Lífeyrissjóðurinn Gildi, which has one of the largest funds in the country, has established a "responsible investment policy" and there are provisions of a similar nature.
This is all reviewed here as an introduction to the latest buzzword in Icelandic, "shadow management".
Since the word is new in the case, it is not hoped that it has been fully defined, but it seems to me that the following definition is now "most taken": Shadow management is when a union leader says in the media that he intends to send representatives of the union to the board the pension fund's recommendations or instructions on how they should take a position on a particular matter.
If they do not follow the recommendations, they will be removed from the board at the earliest convenience.
If the leader does not cover this in the media and does not talk about dismissal, then it is not "shadow management", as such communication between people is of course always in the financial world as elsewhere.
I leave it to the reader to consider which way he finds more "shady."
There are two people in particular who have tried to formulate this definition as of this writing, on the morning of Saturday, July 25, 2020.
They are Hörður Ægisson, a journalist at Fréttablaðið, and Ásgeir Jónsson, Governor of the Central Bank.
The occasion arose for both of them after Bogi Nils Bogason, CEO of Icelandair, had announced his intention to terminate the company's agreements with flight attendants and flight attendants (terminate them), and Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, chairman of the Reykjavík Tradesmen's Association, sent the recommendation to the company's board representative. Lífeyrissjóður verslunarmanna not to support the fund's possible purchase of shares in the company, otherwise they may be forced to give way.
Some time later Bogi Nils withdrew his decision and as a result Ragnar Þór went the same way with his recommendations which of course were based on Bogi's decision.
Nonetheless, Hörður and Ásgeir saw reason to talk about the matter in the Friday issue of Fréttablaðið with big words about shadow management, violations of the law and the great need for changes in the law.
There, a small tuft was supposed to carry a heavy load, even though the blessed tuft had been connected and also dried out quickly.
Since the issue is important, let's consider the subject at the end.
I have outlined above the points in the law on pension funds that pertain to this matter.
This means that fund boards must safeguard the interests of fund members and have ethical standards in investments, and these issues are elaborated in more detail in the articles of association of both Gildi and the Retailers' Pension Fund, as I mentioned.
Pension funds, on the other hand, should NOT look solely at short-term profitability considerations in their investments.
This would be a very dangerous policy and one does not have to look long for examples of this in the past, as large loans from banks and funds have gone to immoral adventurers and environmental messes, with disastrous consequences.
The CEO of Icelandair was obviously on slippery ice when it occurred to him to wipe out an entire group of employees, thus significantly reducing the company's goodwill in the Icelandic market and weakening its position vis-à-vis investors.
Fortunately, he took care of himself and withdrew this.
Time will tell whether it is sufficient for the pension funds' investment in the company to be considered liable to fund members in the long run.

One of the infected did not have a return asept
One of the three who were diagnosed with Covid-19 in the country yesterday arrived in the country from the Baltic States on the 15th of July, about a week and a half ago.
He is an Icelander who does not live here permanently and therefore did not receive clear instructions to carry out a so-called return asepsis after arriving in the country and go for another sampling a few days after arrival.
He got negative from screening at the border.
"But he is in Icelandic society and in fact should go to that resort," says Kamilla Jósepsdóttir, an expert in the field of epidemiology at the Directorate of Health and deputy epidemiologist while he is on summer vacation, in a conversation with Fréttablaðið today.
"He used the English registration form and there is no obligation to register the ID number and if the ID number is not registered then you are not automatically invited to the second sample."
She says that the man could have used the English registration form because he actually lives abroad but because of his network in the country as an Icelander he should have used the Icelandic one instead.
However, he did not realize this.
"When the ID number is not registered, you have to apply for it yourself in the second sampling.
Neither he nor his employer seem to have realized that this was the right way to go, "says Kamilla.
"So it is clear that we need to strengthen the provision of information about this while we find some way to make an automatic preaching system even if Icelanders do not register their ID number.
Or to make it more obvious who are the participants in Icelandic society in the registration system, "she explains.
Fortunately, the person in question did not associate with anyone on arrival in the country, even though he is defined as a participant in Icelandic society, being an Icelander.
Only six have been quarantined since he was diagnosed yesterday and those six were all in contact with him.
They will be sampled, but two of them have begun to show signs of Covid-19 infection.
The man received a negative result from his sampling at the border on 15 July.
Kamilla says it is likely that he was so recently infected with the virus that she was not yet able to detect it when the sample was taken at the border.
However, she does not want to rule out that the man was infected here in Iceland but did not carry the virus with him to the country.
"It is not entirely possible to claim that this is definitely an imported infection because it is so long since he came to the country that he could have been exposed here like these two who have caused a bit of a stir in connection with the sports tournament. “
She says, however, that this is very unlikely due to the small number of people around here.
"It is actually very unlikely," says Kamilla, but states that this cannot be ruled out until Icelandic Genetics has sequenced the virus in humans.
"If we get a type of virus that has not been seen here before, it is almost certain that he carried it to the country."
Pepper spray and bombs used against protesters
Clashes broke out between police and protesters in Seattle last night.
Police challenged protesters pepper and non-infant grenades, but protesters broke windows and turn on.
Forty-five protesters were arrested and 21 police officers were injured.
Police contraction and racism was protested widely in the United States last night, but the protest in Seattle was in support of Protestants in Portland in Oregon state.
In Austin, Texas, one protester was shot dead.
According to the BBC, the attacker has been arrested.
In Seattle, thousands gathered in peaceful protest.
A group of people then set fire to a construction site and broke windows in the city's courthouse.
Subsequently, Police said the protests be riots and for conflict came between groups of protesters and police.
Demanding justice In Aurora, Colorado, Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old black man who was murdered by police in August last year, was remembered by protesters.
A car drove through a group of protesters in the city but no one was injured.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of black National Guard members gathered to demand justice for Breona Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman who was murdered by police at her home last March.
The group carried firearms and marched in a closed intersection where police separated the group from a group of protesters and also carried firearms.
There were 75 arrests in Omaha, Nebraska, where protesters remembered James Scurlock, a 22-year-old black man who was murdered by a white bar owner in May.
Sunshine: Not the game that defines our season
Ole Gunnar Solskjær, the football manager of Manchester United, does not want to underestimate the importance of the game against Leicester today in the final round of the English Premier League.
If United lose the game, and Chelsea do not lose against Wolves, Solskjær and his men will end up in 5th place and thus lose their place in the Champions League.
However, they still have hope of reaching the Champions League by winning the Europa League next month.
"We have not reached the end.
"If we get a point against Leicester, I think people will say that we have not had a bad season now," said Solskjær.
"But whatever happens, this is not the end of our journey because we still have a long way to go to reach the two teams above us," said Solskjær.
It is clear that people's nerves will be there at 15 today but Solskjær tried to pretend that it was every other game.
"If you want to belong to Manchester United, you have to get used to being under pressure in the last game of the season.
This is nothing new, and the company is based on it.
We have created a great opportunity to end the season well and now it is up to us to take advantage of it, "said Solskjær.
"This is not the most important game of the season, this is just the next game.
You can ask anyone in football, the next game is always the most important.
The results do not define our period, we have already had many moments to define this period. "
"The arrival of Bruno Fernandes changed a lot for us and I believe that overall we are in better shape and much stronger mentally than last season," said Solskjær.
65,000 infections per day
65,490 new coronary heart disease infections were diagnosed in the United States yesterday, according to John Hopkins University.
A total of 4,178,021 infections have been confirmed in the West Sea since the beginning of the epidemic in that country.
900 people died from the virus yesterday, but in the last four days before that there were more than 1,000 deaths due to the virus per day.
A total of 146,460 deaths from the virus have been confirmed in the United States.
According to a CNN report, the number of deaths due to the virus will increase to 175,000 by August 15, according to a US model.
Fear another wave of the epidemic
The Spanish government is now making a weak effort to curb the growing spread of COVID — 19 in the country.
Spanish health authorities reported more than 920 new cases of COVID — 19, both on Thursday and Friday.
There have been no more diagnoses in a single day since the beginning of May, and the news comes at the same time as the Spaniards are starting to lift one of the strictest curfews in Europe.
As a result of the setback, the British authorities are now obliging passengers coming from Spain to quarantine on their return.
A week earlier, Spain was on Britain's list of safe countries.
The situation is worst in Catalonia in northeastern Spain, where the government has imposed wider restrictions to try to curb growth.
In the capital, Barcelona, entertainment venues will be closed for the next two weeks and old houses will be closed at midnight.
A curfew is now in effect for 200,000 people in Segria County in western Catalonia.
It is believed that the British decision will have a negative effect on the Spanish economy, which relies heavily on the arrival of foreign tourists and is badly affected by the epidemic.
Tui, the UK's largest travel agency, has canceled all scheduled flights to Spain and the Canary Islands.
Governments around the world are said to be preparing for the second wave of the epidemic, but there seems to be little interest in re-launching a massive curfew that has devastated the economy in many places.
For example, Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, has taken this very badly and likened it to nuclear weapons that he does not want to use.
The Prime Minister of France, Jean Castex, has said that the nation "would not survive, economically or socially," if a national curfew were imposed again.
Many officials hope that the local remedies that reach the inhabitants of individual towns, cities or areas will be enough to stop the virus in the next round if it occurs.
Five new infections in Iceland - Three domestically
Three domestic infections were diagnosed yesterday as well as two in addition to the border.
Thus, five individuals were diagnosed with a positive Covid-19 infection yesterday in Iceland.
A civil defense announcement states that one infection is related to the infection that was reported yesterday at the ReyCUP football tournament.
He has been sent to solitary confinement and sixteen who were in close contact with him in quarantine.
The infected person was a participant in the social work of a sports club in Reykjavík and is, according to the announcement, "only part of the sports team" in quarantine.
Others who were sent to quarantine relate to the man in other ways.
The origin of this infection is undiscovered and infection tracing is in full swing with the infection control team of the National Commissioner of Police.
The organizers of the ReyCUP tournament have followed the guidelines and rules of the Epidemiologist and Civil Protection that are still in force and appropriate measures have been taken.
However, photos from the tournament yesterday attracted attention as you could see in a very close communion celebrating their team's good performance on the field.
Just before 11 o'clock today, the organizers published the following announcement on their Facebook page.
It says "NOTE: Parents please respect the rules that competitors pick up their own toys at school.
Parents are NOT allowed to do this.
Thank you for your understanding. "
Another infection was diagnosed yesterday but is related to the infection that was reported the day before.
The announcement states: "Icelandic Genetics has sequenced the infection and a new type of virus has been discovered that has not been diagnosed here before."
Infection tracing is also being worked on in this case and the person is infected in isolation and 12 in quarantine due to the infection.
The third infection in question is from a man who came to Iceland 11 days ago, on 15 July.
He was diagnosed in the southwest corner of the country.
He is now in solitary confinement and six who were in close contact with him in quarantine.
Two of them are already showing signs of virus infection.
In addition, two people were diagnosed at the border and the results of further research are awaited, as stipulated in the process of cross-border infection.
Finally, the announcement states: The Civil Protection Department of the National Commissioner of Police and the Office of the Medical Director of Health urge people to be careful and pay close attention to individual infection control.
If there is the slightest doubt as to whether the symptoms of the Covid-19 virus are present, the same person is asked to have a sample taken at the nearest health center.
Patreksfjörður says the camp site is booked for a shopping weekend - Directs guests something else
The camping site in Patreksfjörður is fully booked this weekend, according to an announcement from Vesturbyggð.
Guests are advised to explore other accommodation options.
Mentions Vesturbyggð Bíldudalur, Tálknafjörður, Melanes á Rauðasandur, Hótel Flókalund and Hótel Breiðavík as other options in the situation.
It's enough to be in Patreksfjörður this weekend, because as in previous years, Skjaldborg, a festival of Icelandic documentaries will be held in the town.
It has been held since 2007 and has therefore become a strong tradition in the town.
Judging by the attendance at the camp site, a good turnout can be expected this year, if the weather does not put a stop to it, but DV said earlier today about a poor forecast.
One can, however, expect the worst weather to the south, and hope for Patreksfjörður.
The website bb.is first reported, and said that all other accommodations in the town were already fully booked.
An entire apartment building rots in the best location in the city
Romanian workers live for free at Dunhagi 18–20.
Meanwhile, the owners are applying for a building permit for renovation, but their mission has been successful in the system for the third year.
In one of the oldest, greenest and most expensive districts in the city of Reykjavík, there is a magnificent apartment building on three floors.
On the ground floor of the building is about 600 square meters of retail space.
Behind the house are the doors of two stairwells, each of which houses four fairly spacious apartments.
They are in the range of 93-130 square meters, although most are over 100.
The house has a considerable history.
It was built in 1959 and has housed video rentals, Skóstofan, Mjólkursamsälan's dairy shop, Jói byssusmið, fish sales and most recently Háskólaprent.
The house has, to say the least, remembered its dandelion more beautifully.
The house is now badly damaged, as can be seen in the attached photos.
The owner of the house is D18 ehf.
The owners of D18 ehf. are according to the company register among others Magnús Magnússon and Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir.
Magnús led Borgun's ownership group and was the representative of the holding company Borgun.
Among the owners of the holding company Borgun is Stálskip ehf.
Stálskip ehf. is an investment company of Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir and her children.
Guðrún is also the owner of a third share in D18 ehf.
Guðrún and her husband, Ágúst Guðmundur Sigurðsson, once ran the company Stálskip.
D18 ehf. bought the house in the summer of 2009 and there has been little to no maintenance since then.
Neighbors say that the condition of the house has deteriorated steadily since then, although most in recent years.
On the residents' Facebook page, one resident says that the house "has not been very lively in recent years".
It may play into the fact that the owners have for several years sought to change the house and the plot.
Other neighbors say the house has not been in order for a long time.
"It is long overdue to do something proper with this spot and it is sad that it has dragged on like this."
He also says that he is full of the owners of the house for not having rushed to finish this, found some common ground with the neighbors of the house and stopped this "legal bottleneck".
"Do this only in consultation with the surrounding community so that it can be rushed and completed."
The "legal step" that the resident refers to is the planning process of the block that has been going on at least since 2017.
The owners of Dunhagi 18 and 20 then applied for permission to build a floor on top of the existing apartment building and behind the building, a new elevator building and an extension on one floor as well as a basement.
The building permit granted for that project was appealed to the Appellate Committee on Environment and Natural Resources, and the committee revoked it as the project had no basis in the local plan and the local presentation was not satisfactory.
The City of Reykjavík then started with local planning work and ended it with an advertisement in the Government Gazette in July last year.
That plan was also appealed and the committee repealed it in March 2020.
At this point, almost three years had passed since the original application for a building permit and the owners of the house on the starting block.
By this time, the house had collapsed considerably and the neighbors were getting tired.
When DV asked the neighbors of the house about the situation and the reactions of the neighbors, the answers were in various ways.
Some understood the intentions of the owners of the house, others not at all.
Others turned their anger on the city, others did not.
Others were just angry but not necessarily out to anyone.
Still others said the car park was a point of contention, but neighbors have used the unused car park Dunhagi 18-20 for their vehicles.
One applicant in the case said he was tired of the administration:
"It is unbelievable that we will have to go through the process three times.
It's as if the city of Reykjavík can't read. "
Today the house is empty, abandoned and neglected.
A monument to the city's hovering and the noble intentions of the owner and their many years of work that is now in its infancy.
When a journalist came to the yard at Dunhagi 18, he was greeted by open doors and piles of rubbish.
A Playstation computer and a recent television were among other debris on earth - the victims of Icelandic summer wetness.
It was open into the old office of Háskólaprents and there were a lot of cats to smell.
It is clear that someone has nestled around in one corner but no one is visible.
Stacks of sofas and beds and a few pallets of geological pages, no doubt about to become a book, blew up.
The stairwells of the apartment building were also open and life in both of them.
A journalist was so lucky to come across the residents of one of them.
There, Romanians were cooking potato dishes for dinner and invited a journalist.
The Romanians work for the staffing company Ztrongforce ehf.
They have been there for some time and DV's sources allege that the company paid nothing for the premises except heat and electricity.
Due to the condition of the house, it is not considered justifiable to collect rent.
Judging from the parking spaces in the lobby of the building, it is clear that a lot of foreign workers have lived there in recent months.
Staffing operations have not been spared from the Covid-19 situation, as a decline in tourism has led to a contraction in the construction sector and these two industries have been the most efficient in using staffing services.
Nonetheless, the residents of Dunhagi 18 seemed to have plenty to do and the work coats and mittens in the common area hung to dry after a long working day in the rain.
It should be noted that despite the miserable condition of the house, the apartment that the boys shared seemed to be well maintained.
When a journalist greeted the boys in Romanian, the irony suddenly became clear to him: In the best place in Reykjavík, a 1,500 square meter property is being demolished.
The owners want to change the house for the better and the neighbors want to improve the situation but share the definition of "improved".
In between, the city's planning department is on the starting line, a victim of endless appeals and opportunities for appeal in the planning process, and the sliding decision of the Appellate Committee on Environment and Natural Resources.
The house is home to Romanian workers, perhaps those who are trying to improve the situation, when the Icelanders stop arguing.
The article originally appeared in the weekend paper DV on July 17.
In the fight against obesity in the wake of the coronary heart disease epidemic
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Boris Johnson, will provide a £ 10 million campaign against obesity, which will include a ban on fast-food advertising, following his serious illness, in part due to his weight.
Johnson is set to launch the Better Health campaign tomorrow, Monday, which will encourage doctors to prescribe cycling for their overweight clients and increase efforts to increase the number of cycle paths.
Advertisements for fast food on television will be banned before 9 pm, according to British media sources.
"COVID — 19 has alerted us to the short- and long-term risks of being overweight, and the Prime Minister is determined that we must use the time to become healthier, more active and eat a healthier diet," a government spokesman said.
Johnson himself has been plagued by weight problems, but he was admitted to intensive care when he contracted the coronavirus this spring, partly due to his weight, which is thought to have made him so seriously ill.
Women are better able to lead the changes
She said the new constitution was the biggest step the nation could take towards greater devolution of power, transparency and the fight against corruption and the interests of the whole.
"We need to change gears a bit now and who is better suited to lead such changes than the group of society that finds it easier to be in these values.
There are women, "said Helga.
"Women in Iceland are famous for their solidarity with women.
To stand together and be together in leading change.
So now it's just up to us to lead these changes. "
She said that she was a little apprehensive about the emphasis on Iceland as "the best in the world" in both gender equality and human rights.
"Then we are not so ready to look at what needs to be done.
As Germans are very aware of their history and look at everything that needs to be done.
There are lots.
We have to know where we are coming from and know the story and listen.
Listen to the voices of marginalized groups.
We do not all have the same rules here, "said Helga.
Aðspurð said that women are in many ways in good shape in Iceland, but added that, as in many other places, Icelanders live by very masculine values.
She said that politics revolved around, for example, self-interest, domination and power, which were the forces that perpetuated inequality in all societies.
"Women have now formed this group and come together and have just become a little irritated that the Althingi is going to ignore this 2012 referendum," she said.
"It is these feminine values that we are thinking of.
Based on human rights and nature conservation, co-operation and that we all really sit at the same table, "she said, adding that the aforementioned values were the basic values in the new constitution.
"We are a very rich country of natural resources and it is ridiculous that there are people here who live in poverty.
It's ridiculous, we can change differently, "said Helga.
"It is ridiculous that it is a natural law that women's jobs are always paid lower.
It is absurd that flight attendants and nurses have to fight endlessly just to get a decent salary. "
You can sign the signature list for a new constitution here via electronic Iceland.
Tried to rob a pedestrian in the city center
A man was arrested in the city center last night after he threatened pedestrians and tried to take money from him.
The police also stopped the production of drugs in Árbær where two people were arrested in connection with the case.
The police also stopped the driver of a motorcycle in Hlíðar, where his driver was at a speed of 146 km / h, where the maximum speed is 60 km / h.
In addition, he had previously been disqualified from driving.
The police in the capital area had plenty to do tonight and more than 80 cases were recorded in the police diary from five yesterday to five this morning.
There was a lot of noise announcements due to events.
On the eve of Saturday, there were reports of eleven noisy gatherings, which was considered a lot in the police diary.
Last night, however, 22 noise cases were reported to the police.
Six were kept in a holding cell last night.
In Árbær, police were called last night when parties fired fireworks into the air.
However, they had escaped when police officers came to the yard.
Nine drivers were stopped for driving under the influence of alcohol and / or drugs.
Four people were arrested for fighting in the city center last night, but one of them was kept in a holding cell.
Two were taken to the emergency room after they fell on their faces, one in the town center and the other in Vesturbær.
One was taken to the accident ward after he was injured while jumping on a trampoline in Kópavogur.
In addition, police officers stopped the driver who towed a caravan in Kjalarnes yesterday.
According to the police diary, the caravan's bicycle equipment was in "very bad condition" and was detained.
You can stay in Monet's house during the shopping weekend
The house, where the impressionist Claude Monet spent the last forty years of his life, is now for rent on the Airbnb site.
The next free nights in the house are during the shopping weekend.
The house is small and cute, located in the town of Givenry in Normandy in France.
The world-famous painter lived in the house from 1883 until his death in 1926.
The house has three bedrooms, two lounges and three bathrooms.
Monet was first inspired to paint his famous gardens in this house.
If anyone intends to rent the house, they must rent it for at least two nights.
According to the Airbnb website, it is next available in a week, on a Sunday for shopkeepers' weekends, so it might be a good idea for some shopkeepers on holiday to hurry up and book the painter's house.
The two nights over a shopping weekend cost only 964 US dollars, or just over 130 thousand Icelandic kronur, according to Fréttablaðið.
Dozens in quarantine and some of them have begun to show symptoms of the disease caused by the coronavirus
Five have been diagnosed with the coronary heart virus domestically in the last three days and most of the infected are unrelated.
Dozens have been quarantined because of this and some of them have begun to show symptoms of the disease caused by the virus.
Three were diagnosed with the coronary virus domestically yesterday and two during border screening.
An expert at the Office of the Medical Director of Health says that the growing number of domestic infections does not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading further into the community.
"The previous domestic infection has been sequenced and it is a virus that has not been seen here before, so we have no particular reason to believe that it has been hidden in the community for some time.
This is probably something that has just arrived in the country, but of course we need to be very careful now, "said Kamilla Sigríður Jósefsdóttir, an expert in the field of disease control at the Office of the Medical Director of Health.
Most of those infected have been in contact with individuals who came from abroad.
Further sampling will take place in the near future, but some who were in contact with the infected have begun to show symptoms of the coronary virus.
"Right now there is no flu and no other respiratory infections, so we can be quite liberal in doing these tests on individuals who during the flu season would have found a reason to do something else first," said Kamilla.
Contagion is largely complete, but it is possible that more people will need to be quarantined.
Two of the infected were diagnosed after attending a sporting event.
This has raised questions about whether it is justifiable to hold such events.
The Director of Civil Protection says it is possible as long as people follow the norms and rules.
Kamilla says it is almost impossible that the infected people became infected at the sports tournament.
"If more people do not go into isolation from these individuals after interacting with them at these sports tournaments, we can claim that our disease control at the tournaments has worked.
But it has not been revealed, "said Kamilla.
The procedures of the Civil Defense Department are under constant review.
"We need to be prepared to intervene with further advice or restrictions if it seems necessary," said Kamilla.
In just over a week, the number limits will be expanded to a thousand people.
This new situation could affect relaxations.
"Certain meditation to cook" - See Elísa Viðar's menu
Elísa Viðarsdóttir is an accomplished footballer and plays with Val.
She is also a master's student in nutrition, mother, and works as a food scientist.
She needs a lot of energy for the day's activities and usually takes the time to cook good and nutritious food.
My normal day starts with coming to work from eight, "says Elísa.
"After work I go to the store to prepare dinner before I pick up my girl at kindergarten at three o'clock."
Elísa finds it very nourishing to pick up her daughter early for kindergarten.
"It's good to have time with her before I go to practice in the second half.
After exercise it is good to come home and just need to warm up the food.
At night, when the girl is asleep, we like to watch one episode to clear our minds. "
Elisha does not follow any particular diet.
She is finalizing her master's thesis in nutrition and therefore knows what suits her to eat to have enough energy to do work, school, family and exercise.
"What suits me is to eat a variety of foods that are well composed of proteins, carbohydrates and fats.
However, I think the most important thing is to have a healthy relationship with food and not classify food as bad or good, rather nutritious or malnourished.
"It's okay to eat everything, just not all at once and not always."
Elisa is very interested in cooking.
"I find a certain meditation in standing in the kitchen to cook and I get very involved in it.
I have to say that I have confidence in the kitchen and I sincerely believe that I am a good cook. "
Breakfast: Oats, chia seeds, hemp seeds, salt, a little lemon juice, leave in almond milk overnight.
Top this meal with whatever is available at any given time.
Most often it is banana and crispy muesli & COFFEE.
I'm a great coffee woman.
Intermediate: Incredibly different, but fruit or vegetables, flat cakes, pure skyr with banana and muesli, bread with toppings and then I could eat hummus with a spoon out of a box if necessary.
Lunch: I often make all kinds of hearty salads from what is in the fridge, quinoa or barley, falafel buns, rock salad, oven-baked vegetables with a good dressing is a bit of what I work with.
If the organization goes completely out of control (which often happens) then the egg machine at work has come to my rescue quite often and then there are 2 slices of bread with butter, cheese and a boiled egg, do not put more on you.
Snack: Get me some carbs for exercise, bread with toppings, cereal or fruit.
Dinner: Fish is very often the choice in my home, otherwise some delicious vegetarian dishes.
Clashes between police and protesters in Seattle
Authorities in Seattle, Washington have declared a state of uprising following a rally in the city center.
Police grabbed yesterday to flare bomb and pepper to tempt a large area that protesters lied underneath and stretched over many houses in the vicinity of the parliament of the city.
The police announced on Twitter at least eleven protesters had been arrested and that the study traversed on the sabotage worked on the police station in the city yesterday, possibly with some kind of bomb.
City and police officials say protesters stoned police with stones, bottles, explosives and other items, and one police officer was taken to a hospital where his injuries were treated.
The Seattle protests, however, were peaceful for a long time to come.
They were called upon to show solidarity with the protesters in Portland, Oregon, where there have been repeated clashes between protesters and heavily armed federal police.
There, as in many other US cities, people gather under the banner of Black Lives Matter, recalls Georges Floyd, who was killed by a Minneapolis police officer on May 25, protests against systemic racism in American society and demands redress.
Not withdrawn until after the vote
It is not yet clear whether the dismissals of Icelandair's flight attendants, which are due to take effect at the end of next month, will be revoked.
The electronic voting on the Icelandair Flight Attendants' Association's wage agreement on behalf of Icelandair's flight attendants ends at noon tomorrow.
Guðlaug Líney Jóhannsdóttir, chairman of the company, says she is confident that Icelandair will not make a decision on the dismissals until the results of the voting are available.
"This is clearly connected," says Guðlaug Líney.
"No redundancies have been withdrawn, this must be made available so that the machines can be manned.
Then, of course, people are impatient to find out if they will have a job after the end of the month. "
An agreement was signed a week ago, on the eve of 19 July.
It is expected to be valid until the end of September 2025 and is based on an agreement that the flight attendants had previously put to the vote.
On July 17, the board and board of trustees of Flugfreyjufélag Íslands agreed to announce a general work stoppage at Icelandair, the members approved it in a vote.
It never happened, but this was decided following Icelandair's decision to end negotiations with Flugfreyjufélagið, dismiss all its flight attendants and seek agreements with another union.
The company's pilots were also to take on the role of safety crews on board temporarily.
Asked how she thinks the vote will go, Guðlaug Líney says it is difficult to say.
"People are hurt after Icelandair's enforcement, when all the company's flight attendants were fired and it was announced that an agreement would be reached with another union.
Now it will be seen if it has an effect, "she says.
940 flight attendants worked for Icelandair at the end of April, but then 900 of them, about 95%, were laid off.
The notice period for them varies, for those with the shortest working life it is three months and therefore ends at the end of July-beginning of August.
In that group, about 90% of Icelandair's flight attendants are.
What happens if the agreement is not approved?
"Then we request continued discussions with our counterparts.
With this agreement, we are meeting Icelandair's requirements.
If he is rejected, it is clear that the flight attendants are considered to have gone too far. "
Voting on the wage agreement ends and Icelandair will present its second quarter results tomorrow
The flight attendant's vote on a new wage agreement ends at 12 noon tomorrow.
Icelandair's results for the second quarter will also be published tomorrow, but preliminary operating results indicate that the company's revenue has decreased by 85 percent from the same period last year.
Electronic voting on the wage agreement between Flugfreyjufélag Íslands and Samtaka atvinnulífsins for Icelandair began on Wednesday, July 22, and ends tomorrow, Monday, July 27, at 12 noon.
Those who may vote for the agreement are Icelandair employees who pay membership fees to the Flight Attendant Association.
Icelandair and FFÍ signed a new wage agreement on the eve of Sunday 19 July, but on the previous Friday Icelandair had terminated negotiations with the company after the flight attendants rejected the previous agreement in a vote in early July.
Icelandair had terminated all of the company's flight attendants and flight crews on Friday, but they were withdrawn after a new wage agreement was signed.
According to a new wage agreement, flight attendants are required to fly five hours more per month for the same basic salary.
The collective agreement is valid until the year 2025, where the provisions of pilots and flight attendants on how long it is possible to fly on one shift have been integrated.
The agreement was presented to FFÍ members at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica hotel last Monday, and many flight attendants interviewed by the news agency expressed dissatisfaction with the agreement.
Most, however, seemed to agree that the agreement had to be approved in order to keep FFÍ alive.
Icelandair's results for the second quarter will be announced tomorrow, but the company's EBIT, its operating result before financial items and taxes, is, according to preliminary operating results, negative by 100 to 110 million US dollars or about 15 billion Icelandic kronas.
Icelandair sent preliminary calculations to the Exchange last Wednesday, stating that the company's revenue amounted to USD 60 million in the quarter, or ISK 8.3 billion.
Cash and cash equivalents were around USD 154 million at the end of the quarter, around ISK 21 billion.
Icelandair also aims to offer the company's share capital in August.
Icelandair aims to complete agreements with fifteen creditors, the government and the Boeing aircraft manufacturer before the end of the month before a share offering is launched.
A new variant rather than a new type of virus
"A new virus just means that this has been an individual who came from abroad.
This is not something that has been going on in Iceland, "says Már Kristjánsson, chief physician at Landspítali's infectious diseases department, about the news that a" new type of virus "has been diagnosed in this country.
Three domestic infections were diagnosed yesterday and two at the border.
One who was diagnosed had taken part in the social work of a sports club at the Rey Cup football tournament, but the source of the infection has not been discovered and the infection is ongoing.
Infection was also diagnosed in an individual who arrived in the country on July 15, and two who were in contact with him began to show symptoms of COVID — 19.
Yesterday, an infection was diagnosed that is related to an infection that was reported the day before yesterday, and after a sequencing at Icelandic Genetics, a "new type of virus that has not been diagnosed here before was discovered."
Tracing of infection is complete in connection with that infection.
Már states that this is not a new virus, but that it is the same virus that has spread around the world, i.e. the new coronary virus SARS-CoV-2.
It is more correct to talk about a new variant of that virus than about a new type of virus.
Asked what it means and whether it could say something about the start of another wave of epidemics, Már says that at the moment it is an isolated case and it could happen that nothing more will happen.
"On the other hand, if there are cases in Iceland that do not have a connection from abroad and have the same genotype as this particular variant, it would be possible to draw that conclusion [about the second wave], but it is premature at the moment," explains Már .
Happiness in the hot tub
Is the secret to Icelanders' happiness hidden in the hot tubs?
The BBC's programmers lead this in a fun video that sheds light on the country's pool and hot tub culture.
Icelandic bathing culture is unique in the world and it is claimed that nowhere in the world are there as many bathing places per capita.
The natural geothermal energy is its basis, but also the tradition for swimming that prevails here.
Swimming lessons for children were legalized in 1940, but senior citizens are no less diligent in using the hot water for their health.
Swimming is described as a permanent part of the general welfare of the country.
In the pot, everyone is equal, regardless of class or position.
Free from mobile phones, people talk to each other on personal notes about home and space or enjoy the soothing power of water: meditating and recharging the batteries of mind and body.
It is a steep climb for a hundred days to go to the polls
There are a hundred days until the Americans go to the polls and elect a president for four years.
Donald Trump is running for re-election, but he has a steep run.
Joe Biden, the Democratic Party's prospective candidate, has a huge advantage over Trump nationally, according to opinion polls.
According to a new survey by the AP news agency, a record number of Americans believe that the nation is on the wrong track.
Trump's response to the pandemic of the new coronation virus is also very unpopular, and more Americans than ever before believe that the president has mismanaged the economy.
Specifically, only two out of ten Americans say the United States is on the right track.
32 percent say they support Trump's response to the epidemic and 48 percent say he has kept the economy afloat.
In March it was 56 percent and in January it was 67 percent.
According to the FiveThirtyEight average, Biden's support is 49.9 percent nationally, compared to Trump's 41.9 percent.
Trump himself has tried to divert attention from his performance against the epidemic to Biden, incite so-called cultural disputes and proclaim policies that should be law and order.
However, Biden's candidacy is working hard to keep Trump in the spotlight, and he believes there is a good chance he will win by a landslide if the election is really about how Trump has performed over the past four years.
Trump's unpopularity also appears to be hurting Republican lawmakers, with Democrats fearing that Democrats could even gain a majority in the U.S. Senate, which has so far been seen as very unlikely.
Politico recently reported that party and candidate support would remain comparable to what the Republican Party would be doing now in decades.
Suburbs proved to be particularly bad for the party in the 2016 parliamentary elections and now it looks like this trend will continue.
In recent days, Trump has tried to intimidate suburban residents to follow him, including by saying that if Biden becomes president, he will destroy US suburbs and incite racial strife.
Among other things, Trump has repealed a regulation from the time of Barack Obama in the White House that was intended to increase diversity in the suburbs.
He urged suburban "housewives" to read an article by former New York Deputy Secretary of State in which she argued that Biden would destroy US suburbs, and Trump agreed.
"Biden will destroy your neighborhoods and your American dream.
I will preserve it, and even make it even better! "Said the President.
The suburbs of the United States are a growing group of voters.
According to NPR, they are about half of all voters in the United States.
Ever since George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004, the candidate who has won the majority of this group has become president.
Except in 2012 when Mitt Romney received a majority of votes from this group but lost to Barack Obama.
Opinion polls have shown that despite Trump securing a narrow majority in the 2016 suburbs, his support there has fallen sharply.
Although there are differences between the polls, Biden has recommended a fifteen percentage point advantage over Trump in the recent suburbs.

Will the Olympic flame light up at the end of the tunnel?
After the final decision was made to postpone the Olympics, an event that only world wars have affected so far, the president of the International Olympic Committee said that the infamous Olympic flame would be "the light at the end of the tunnel," together.
Achievements have an additional year to prepare and the Japanese authorities will cover the costs of the delay.
However, everyone keeps their heads down, as a lot is at stake.
When it was announced that Tokyo in Japan would be the venue for this year's Olympics, the cheers of the Japanese delegates were genuine.
They cried and laughed alternately, as Tokyo had applied to host the 2016 Games, but this time they lost to Rio in Brazil.
This time, Tokyo and Japan were to bathe in the attention of the world.
The games were supposed to take place from July 24 to August 9, but have been postponed for a year and will instead start on July 23, 2021 and end on August 8.
If the games are not held, then if the coronavirus becomes too much of a threat, the games will be canceled.
However, no one really wants to think that thought to the end.
The Olympics are no ordinary sporting event.
Nothing is spared, the show should always be magnificent and strive to top the last games.
The selection of a city for the Olympics is based on the selection committee's assessment of the cities' presentations.
The more magnificent the presentation, the more likely it is to get the nod.
Tokyo spent $ 150 million trying to host the 2016 Olympics, or more than $ 20 billion.
The second time, when the 2020 Games were applied for, 75 million dollars, about ten billion ISK, were put into the presentation.
In 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo would host the Games this year, the Japanese authorities had already spent ISK 30 billion on the project.
But that amount is just a drop in the ocean compared to what it costs to build Olympic villages, stadiums and in general to strengthen the country's infrastructure to handle such tournaments, prepare it and hold the games themselves.
Organizers in Japan have said that the Tokyo Olympics, which should have been running these days but have been postponed for a year due to the coronary heart disease, would have cost 12.6 billion dollars.
However, a report by the Auditor General of Japan published at the end of last year stated that the cost was almost double that figure.
It will probably not be possible to fully estimate the cost of postponing the games, but it has been estimated that it could cost between two and six billion dollars in addition to the initial cost.
The total cost to the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could therefore range from 15 to 30 billion dollars.
The figures are so high that all the Icelandic state's tax revenue would have been enough for just under half of the Olympics, based on the lowest possible cost.
The Olympics are an event of such magnitude that they have often been the subject of discussion by economists, who try to look at numbers and see the benefits and advantages of the Games.
In short, many people seem to have come to the conclusion that the impact of the Olympics is less than positive for the economies of the cities that host them.
There are some short-term effects, for example, the number of jobs will increase significantly in the short term, but in the long term, cities often end up with debt burdens and the alarmingly high operating costs of little-used structures.
Rio in Brazil is in significant debt due to the 2016 Games and has been struggling to pay for the maintenance of all the major sports facilities built before the Games.
Figures after the London 2012 Games have been examined, but it has been found that only 10 percent of those who got a job related to the Olympic Games in the city were previously unemployed.
This means that there were only a few new jobs.
In general, cities have not benefited much financially from hosting the Olympics due to the staggering costs of the facilities built for the Games.
However, the benefit is often seen in the increased traffic of tourists who want to visit the Olympic cities in the wake of the Games, which is, however, a great deal of uncertainty regarding the 2021 Games.
It is also uncertain whether it will be possible to receive all the number of spectators who usually attend the games.
The main issue, however, is the honor that the cities receive, but it is difficult to value in money.
Because despite the enormous cost, it can also be said that the joy that the games bring is not of the nature that it is possible to put a price tag on it.
But even though the show is often magnificent and there is no saving anywhere, it is of course not just about money.
It is the sports heroes who are in the foreground.
For some high achievers, it's a good idea to postpone the games.
The Australian pentathlete and gold medalist in her article at the recent Olympics, Chloe Esposito, for example, is pale and would have been far from fun this summer but hopes to be in competition form before the 2021 Games.
She is therefore among the athletes who are just rather happy with the postponement, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who planned to retire after this year's games, if they had been held on time, postponing the games would in some cases mean that they would stop competing before the games take place.
Simply do not trust your body to go through years in addition to rigorous exercises.
Few athletes have been as thoroughly immersed in the hearts of spectators at the 2016 Rio Olympics as gymnastics star Simone Biles.
She came home with four gold around her neck and one bronze.
Biles has recently appeared in several interviews in his home country, the United States, to discuss the Olympics.
She is planning for the 2021 games, but she is not necessarily sure that she will still be at the top of the games next year, as she will then be 24 years old.
Although it is not generally considered old age, it is at best for a gymnast in the forefront.
"This is a sensitive issue," says Biles, but smiles to herself in an interview published on the Olympic Committee's Instagram page when asked if she intends to achieve as much in the 2021 Games as she did in Rio 2016.
"I really do not know if I will still be at the top after a full year of training," said Biles.
She has previously said that her body can no longer withstand the stress that comes with gymnastics training much longer.
Nevertheless, she is training hard for the 2021 Olympics.
Biles admits it was an awkward feeling to have to abruptly stop exercising when the pandemic peaked and the gym closed.
There were no exceptions for Biles rather than others while all sports facilities were closed for seven weeks.
All her Olympic gold could not buy any access above the others, she had to find various ways to stay in shape like others.
The basic form is certainly a bit better than most people.
"We have a strict plan now.
It was difficult to start practicing again after the gym opened.
We started slowly but are back on track and I will increase the exercises gradually as the year goes on.
Of course, we do not know exactly how these games will be or whether they will be held, but we still practice considering that they will be, we can not do otherwise.
"I've put too much effort into leaving the sport now," said Biles.
With her, like many others, she doubts or perhaps is more aware that the situation may arise that the games will not be held at all in 2021 either.
Predicting that, though, is hopeless.
No one can know what the situation will be like during the pandemic virus pandemic in July 2021, and there is nothing to do but prepare for the Olympics, given that they will be held next year.
Maybe the Olympic flame will be the light at the end of the Covid tunnel.
Postponed wedding due to epidemic
Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding due to the crown virus.
She was to marry former Bachelorette contestant Wells Adams this summer.
"I think there are other more important things to think about right now," the actress told People.
"We really want to get married someday and have the dream wedding and have everyone present who is dear to us.
But we decided to postpone it and focus on what's important right now and that is helping to share information about the importance of wearing masks and staying home.
I look more at world affairs than weddings these days.
There is a lot going on and we need to focus on what is happening in the world. "
