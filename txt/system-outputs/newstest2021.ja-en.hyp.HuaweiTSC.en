Honoka becomes [Tanaka Minami's style hair]!
A full report on the cut (CanCam.jp) - Yahoo! News
Add a layer to your heavy semi-long hair to make your hair softer.
CanCam model Honoka said, "Of course she is beautiful, but she has a very high level of professionalism and I respect her!"
I asked Asahi Mitsuteru of Sun Valley, a hair salon in Omotesando, who actually cuts Tanaka Minami's hair, to make them all look real.
Here's a report on the cutting process!
Nogizaka46 Yamashita Mizuki gets her first cover with short hair!
First of all, check the faint hair before cutting.
Thin, soft and plentiful.
I have a habit, especially during the rainy season, I sometimes wear a straight perm because I get bogged down.
It is a heavy semi-long with flowing bangs.
Cutting is finally underway!
To make it easier to cut, first lightly wet the whole.
After that, separate the top of the bee (the part above the periphery where the head is most protruding) and cut it from the bottom.
By the way, here are the hair tips that you can get close to Minoru!
1 Table bangs By making the inside of the bangs slightly shorter, it becomes slightly thicker when it is fully lowered, and it becomes see-through when it is lightly divided.
2 Cuts that make the most of your habits If you have a habit of having a lot of hair, if you reduce the amount of hair too much, it may spread well.
While discussing the balance around that, maintain a balance that is easy to handle but difficult to spread, and that allows your own swell to live.
3 Layers around the face and curly hair Layers = cuts with steps.
If you put a layer around your face, it will be easier to move, and it will be a cute finish.
If you make curly hair in three places, the front and back of the temples and sideburns, it will look stylish even if you quickly put it together.
The hair on the bee that I had shared was also cut together, and it was around my face.
Pull the upper part of the hair around your face forward and cut the tip of the hair slightly.
This way, when the strands are lowered, there will be a step and it will be easier to move (this is the layer cut).

Governor Yoshimura "partners with Gurunavi" against Corona (Sankei Sports) - Yahoo!News
Governor of Osaka Prefecture Yoshimura Hirofumi (45) made a remote appearance on Osaka ABC TV's "Cast" (Monday to Friday, March 48) from the prefectural government office on the 20th, and revealed that they are considering a partnership with the restaurant information website "Gurunavi" as part of measures to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus infection.
From the beginning of this month, Osaka Prefecture will issue "Infection Prevention Declaration Stickers" to businesses that comply with the guidelines in order to promote efforts to prevent the spread of infection and provide peace of mind to citizens.
However, only 11,000 stores have issued stickers in the prefecture, which is said to have more than 120,000 restaurants alone.
Governor Yoshimura said, "We're planning to do it at the end of the month, but we'll partner with Gurunavi or something, and when we make a reservation, we'll put out a store that issues a declaration sticker so that it can be understood at the reservation stage," and declared a tag team with an online reservation site.
"What's important is not to put them all together as a 'night town', but to clearly separate the stores that are taking measures against infectious diseases from those that are not. It's also important to make efforts to increase the number of stores that are doing it," he said.

The prefectures of Hokkaido, Miyagi, Tochigi, Gifu, Hiroshima, Kagawa, Saga and Nagasaki, which have already exceeded the 1.0 number, have also made similar appeals.
In addition, regarding traffic to and from Tokyo, Saitama, Chiba, Kanagawa, Aichi, Shiga, Kyoto, Osaka, Hyogo, Nara, Wakayama, Fukuoka and Kagoshima prefectures, where the number of new infections in the last week exceeded "2.5 per 100,000," the government is calling for "reconsidering the necessity carefully and refraining from those who are at high risk of serious illness, such as the elderly" (as of July 25).

The exhibition "Toyosawa Town History and Culture Exhibition" organized by the Toyosawa Town Promotion Association (headed by Nakamura Kenji) in Hanamaki City will be held from the 25th at Kenji Square in Kamimachi.
On display is a notebook in which Miyazawa Kenji (1896-1933), a poet and fairy tale writer, and the residents of Toyosawa-cho, where he grew up, sent donations to the areas affected by the Great Kanto Earthquake in 1923.
It is a valuable resource that shows the connection between Kenji and Toyosawa Town, and introduces the culture and history of the town.
Until August 23.
The notebook was found last summer by Ito Yuji (60), a member of the association and a group employee in Toyosawa-cho, the same city, when he was sorting out a warehouse in his home.
It was used by his grandfather-in-law, Takahashi Genzo (1900-85), who ran a local general store.
On September 15th, it was written "Tokyo City Earthquake Disaster Relief Fund Recruitment (Resident Soldiers) ," and along with the symbols "XX" and "×," the names of Kenji and the residents of Toyosawa-cho at the time, as well as the amount of the donation, are written.
Taneichi, who is in his fourth year of high school graduation at Lotte, has completed his first professional seal!
No. 4 Yasuda V, Toritani Dameoshi 2-run (Baseball King) - Yahoo! News
● Seibu 0 - 5 Lotte ○ <10th round, MetLife Dome> Lotte's starting pitcher, Taneichi Atsuki, threw 136 pitches in 9 innings alone, making him a happy first professional shutout in his 4th year.
He won his third victory in this season's Pa-League as the number one finisher, and stopped the team's consecutive defeats with 2.
In the first inning, Taneichi allowed Suzuki Shohei, who was in the lead, to start the game with a double that broke the third base line, but immediately after that, he hit Genda Sosuke with a triple, and Suzuki Sho, who was aiming to advance to base, also touched out at third base.
Helped by the calm response of his allies' defenses, he managed to get through the pinch of standing up with zero, and from the second time onwards, he tossed Seibu's batting line with a combination of sliders and forks centered on his proud straight.
He raises his tone up and puts zeros on the scoreboard.
The batting line struggled to beat the opponent's starting pitcher, Honda Keisuke, but in the seventh inning, No. 3 Kanno Takeshi came out with a walk, and Oka Oumi, the substitute, succeeded in stealing the second.
Yasuda Hisanori, in 4th place, took advantage of this opportunity to hit a right-handed forehand that was worth 1,000 gold, and finally broke the balance.
Then, in the next eight innings, he attacked the opponent's third-placed Miyagawa Tetsu, and scored four points in one stroke, including a two-run left-middle hit that was the first time since Toritani Takashi, who was participating in the middle of the game, moved to the club.
He folded it like pushing the back of the young ace candidate of the Marines, and the game was decided at once.
Taneichi was eliminated eight times by three players, and he continued to pitch nine times, exceeding 100 balls.
He said, "I gave it my all" and caused a pinch with two dead and full bases with consecutive walks, but at the end of the game, he took the 10th strikeout of the day with a high straight from Spangenberg and set the game.
They smiled and chewed their joy.
Tsuruoka Police Station Collaborates with Related Organizations to Raise Safety Awareness | Yamagata Shimbun
A bicycle class was held as the start of the operation, and a collision test between a car and a bicycle was conducted at the Shoko Gakuen Automobile Training School in Tsuruoka City.
In recent years, the Tsuruoka Police Station (Chief Sato Keizo) has launched "Operation Zero Bye Accidents" in an effort to eliminate accidents involving bicycles and motorcycles, which have a high rate of occurrence within the jurisdiction.
In addition to working with traffic safety organizations within the jurisdiction to raise awareness of accident prevention, they will also step up crackdowns on bicycle traffic rule violations.
There have been three fatal traffic accidents within the department's jurisdiction this year, resulting in the deaths of motorcyclists and cyclists.
Although the number of accidents has been on a declining trend, the rate of accidents involving bicycles was about 11.7 percent as of June 30th, and that involving motorcycles was about 5.8%, both of which are higher than the prefecture average.
In particular, the rate of bicycle accidents in the past five years has often exceeded the prefecture average, and we planned a strategy to overcome this situation.
The name of the operation was multiplied by "bike" and "s" to mean the eradication of accidents.
Related organizations will be invited more than ever to provide driving guidance to the elderly and use luminous reflective materials in traffic safety classes.
The department issues a yellow card (guidance warning card) in the event of a crackdown, etc., and warns people to be careful.
The opening ceremony for the operation was held on the 21st at the Shoko Gakuen Automobile Training School in Tsuruoka.
About 30 people involved attended, and Chief Sato said, "I would like to ask for your cooperation in reducing even one tragic accident."
The person in charge of the department indicated the policy and the activities of each organization.
As the start of the operation, a bicycle lesson will be held.
A police officer in a car demonstrated how the impact on a cyclist is different when he or she brakes and hits the cyclist, compared to when he or she hits the cyclist at about 55km/h without pressing the brake.
Koichi Kaneuchi, chairman of the Tsuruoka Regional Traffic Safety Activities Promotion Committee, said, "I once again realized the horror of traffic accidents. I would like to call attention not only to the elderly but also to young people."
Comedy Akasaka-tei Regular vaudeville for the first time in five months Professional storytelling attracts visitors: Sanyo Shimbun Digital | San Digi
Kaminarimon Kisuke (right) performs rakugo with a sharp narrative style
On the 25th, a regular vaudeville performance was held for the first time in five months at the public vaudeville theater "Owarai Akasaka-tei" (Sobun, Akaiwa City), which had been closed due to the new coronavirus.
Kaminarimon Kisuke (75), a rakugo storyteller based at Akasakatei, and others invited laughter from the audience with their professional storytelling.
At the request of a vassal who has been told by the lord not to drink alcohol, Kisuke performs "Prohibition Banya", in which a liquor store trying to bring in sake engages in a comical exchange with the gatekeeper.
The sharpness of his speech and the delicious manner in which he drank sake caused him to laugh many times.
An office worker (58) from Naka-ku, Okayama City, who was visiting with his wife, said with a smile, "The way he spoke and the way he arranged the room was exquisite, and I was immediately drawn in."
Kisuke said, "It's been a long time since I've performed, and my voice hasn't been in good shape, but it was a fulfilling time."
Guest rakugo storyteller Katsura Kodome (31) from Osaka, and magician group Tsuyama Magic Club also made an appearance.
Comedy Akasaka-tei opened in 1996 in the former Akasaka-cho as the first public vaudeville theater in Japan.
Although they continued to hold regular yose and delivery yose once a month, due to the influence of the new Corona, the yose was canceled after the last performance in February this year.

Demonstrators protesting the detention and dismissal of Governor Hulgar in the Khabarovsk region of Russia's Far East on the 25th (AP = Kyodo News)
[Moscow Kyodo] Demonstrations were held on the 25th to protest the detention and dismissal of Governor Hulgar in the Khabarovsk region of Russia's Far East.
Demonstrations have been held for 15 consecutive days, an unprecedented situation.
The brunt of the criticism has also been directed at President Putin.
Security authorities have not resorted to the usual methods of mass detention in the capital, Moscow, and the government's cautious attitude of taking into consideration the feelings of the residents has begun to erupt.
Former governor Hulgar, who belongs to the far-right Liberal Democratic Party, won a landslide victory in the 2018 gubernatorial runoff election against the incumbent candidate of Putin's ruling party, United Russia, with about 70% of the vote.
He was one of the few non-ruling party governors in Russia, but was detained by the security authorities on the 9th of this month.
The charges were announced as involvement in two murders of businessmen between 2004 and 2005.

They sampled ramen and rice balls, and said, "Thai soup stock works well. It's delicious."
Energize yourself with "amabier" Bizen pottery figurines Produced by students from Okayama University's Special Needs School: Sanyo Shimbun Digital | San Digi
Students from the Okayama University Special Needs School (Hirai, Naka-ku, Okayama) High School are making Bizen ware figurines of Amabier, a specter believed to quell plagues, as gifts for the elderly in the area.
Due to the impact of the new coronavirus, it is difficult to conduct sales training at stores and interact with local residents every year, but the plan was made with the hope of early cure of infectious diseases and health.
Eleven high school students have been working on the project three days a week since June, as part of their classes in the morning.
After forcefully stretched clay is molded without a mold, straw is wrapped around it to produce the red pattern "Hidasuki" characteristic of Bizen ware.
It is said to be completed in about two to three weeks, including the drying and baking processes.
A third-year student (18) said, "We are working hard to make it with the hope that the elderly will not lose out to the new Corona and spend their time in good health."
On the 27th, 40 pieces of Bizen ware will be delivered to the residents of Okayama City Yurakuen (the same place), a nursing home for the elderly, where they have exchanges such as singing.
Production is scheduled to continue until the end of July, and the recipients of the remaining works will be decided in the future.
Ichinoseki City's Senmaya District Community Development Council (headed by Murakami Keiichi) will hold its first "Umbrella Sky Senmaya" displaying umbrellas in the sky at the parking lot of the Senmaya Civic Center in Senmaya-cho, Ichinoseki, and will hold a special exhibition event on August 1.

Both Tiger and G highly praised, Hanshin Wada TA "After all top class" (Sankei Sports) - Yahoo!News
The Hyogo High School Baseball Tournament was held on the 24th, and Akashi Sho, one of the strongest players in the Koshien last spring and summer, faced Takasago in the first game (the second game, Takasago Baseball Stadium) and made five cold starts with a score of 11-0.
Nakamori Shunsuke (3rd year), a 151kg right-hand man who is a top draft pick, showed off his dignified pitching with three hitless innings and seven strikeouts.
Technical advisor (57) to the headquarters of the Hanshin-Wada Toyo Baseball Team, who inspected the game, also praised it highly.
The start was delayed by 39 minutes due to maintenance and other reasons due to the continuous rain.
A muddy mound.
Even so, I was excited because it was the first official game of this year that I had been waiting for.
At the end of the game, he gave up one walk, but he pitched a no-hitter with dignity.
He struck out seven and pitched three shutout innings, helping the Red Sox win five innings.
Nakamori's self-evaluation was harsh, but he marked the fastest time of the day at 148km, and the professional eyes of Hanshin, Kyojin and ORIX behind the net are highly rated.
Hanshin and Wada TA have been inspecting Nama for the first time since last summer's first match at Koshien (second round XX 4-3 Hanasaki Tokuei).
"I'm growing up. I'm still in the top class of high school students. Even if my lower grades were bad, my form didn't collapse and I was able to control it well. I think I'll become a high-ranking candidate."
Giant Kishi Scout also commented, "It was the best I've seen recently.
It is truly amazing that we have finished it while there is a corona disaster."
At the end of June, he said, "I'm either going to be a pro or I'm going to go on to higher education," and his attention-grabbing career path came to a conclusion after the Koshien exchange match (against Kiryu Daiichi) on August 16th, saying, "I have a desire to go to a pro, but I can't decide yet."
Before that, my goal is to win this tournament, which ends in the best 8.
The rules allow for the registration of 20 benched players for each game to be changed.
All 16 juniors played in this game as well.
In order for all 39 juniors to play, they must win the remaining three games.
"This is the last tournament after three years of hard training. If all the third-year students can participate, I want to win all the games, including Koshien. I myself have always been told by the coach (Hama) that I will not be able to complete the game, so I can do that."

Butler once again praises Tyler Hero, the young warrior who will lead the future of the Heat, "The way of thinking is not that of a rookie" (Basket Count) - Yahoo!News
Photo by Getty Images The first game of the Heat's scrimmage (practice game) was against the Kings.
Duncan Robinson scored a team-high 18 points and Tyler Hero followed with 15 points in the 104-98 victory, highlighting the backcourt's success.
Robinson, one of the best shooters in the league, as well as the 13th overall pick in the draft, the step up of the rookie and hero will be an important factor for the Heat.
Hero missed 15 games between February and March due to an ankle injury, and his last return game was against the Hornets on March 12th, ending a long hiatus.
"I had a lot of time to get back to 100 percent. It's the best feeling I've ever felt," Hero said, but his performance from scrimmage was more convincing than words.
Since starting point guard Kendrick Nunn was late to join the team, the hero's playing time increased, and he took advantage of that opportunity.
It's worth a lot because he scored 15 points after performing a different role than usual.
Team leader Jimmy Butler once again praised the Favourite's hero.
"He can handle, he can score, he can defend, he can do everything for the team, he can do anything for the team, he can play in any position because the way of thinking is not that of a rookie. I watch the video and study it, and I'm thinking about where and how my teammates move and free, and what I should do about it."
Even before the start of the season, Butler liked his hero's unbeatable spirit as a rookie and his stoic approach to basketball.
That's why I invited him to the individual practice that starts at 4 o'clock in the morning, and we have been training together.
"He speaks his mind to everyone and doesn't back down. I respect that kind of fighting spirit," Butler once said.
Butler is the type of person who always says what he thinks, and if he thinks it will be good for the team, he will give harsh opinions knowing that there will be conflicts.
In the past, this has led to a deterioration in the relationship with teammates.
Butler probably sees his younger self as his hero.
Butler's character, sometimes too harsh on his teammates, is a good guide for anyone who has the guts to follow suit.
If the teacher-student relationship between the two, who respect each other, spreads to the whole team, the Heat will become a team that can aim even higher.
Shimasho takes the initiative for the first time in the fourth round of the 2020 Summer Shizuoka High School Baseball Tournament Shimadasho - Hamamatsujo Hokuko | Shizuoka Newspaper @S
Shimada Sho - Hamamatsu Castle Hokuko In the bottom of the first inning, Shimada Sho hits an undead base, and Matsuura hits the first inning at Kusanagi Stadium.
4th round (Kusanagi 1st game) Hamamatsujo Hokuko 0000000-0 410000×-5 Shimada Shou Game time 1 hour 26 minutes
[Review] Shimada Sho took advantage of an early opportunity and defeated Hamamatsu-jo Castle Hokuko.
Shimada Sho took the lead with a two-run timely hit by Matsuura on the first inning with no-death bases.
He added two more points with an infield grounder and a squeeze.
As for pitching, starting pitcher Saito showed a good pitch with no runs scored with only one hit in six innings.
Hamamatsu-jo Castle Hokuko did not take advantage of the opportunity to fill the bases with two dead in the last inning.
4th round led by 3 years
In the second year, Matsuura hit the first inning with gratitude.
It was the 4th place in the 2nd year, which was the first appearance this summer, that defeated the opponent's appearance.
Shimada Sho's Matsuura hit a change ball with no-death bases for the first time and carried it to the left front.
"For three years, if I lost, I would retire immediately. I wanted to beat myself and win."
Last autumn, the talented player who played in the 4th position was proud.
The first and third rounds were fought mainly for three years, and the strong two years were held back.
Coach Ikeda gathered the players at a meeting and told Nine, "Three years have passed so far. I will go with the best members from now on."
On this day, four out of the nine starters solidified the main axis in two years.
It may seem ruthless, but it is proof that he is committed to serious competition.
Matsuura said reassuringly, "From now on, the level of the opposing pitcher will also rise, and I will approach it with the intention of returning the runner."
Saito, who pitched consecutively, was a good pitcher with only one hit in the sixth inning, and he did not even step on second base, showing his pride for three years.
The number 10 jersey has been positively received as a synergy effect, saying, "When you get two years out, you will be stimulated for three years. If it leads to victory."
Combined with last year's Shizuoka tournament, the team is aiming to be in the top four for the third consecutive year, and they do not intend to make memories of the remaining games.
Sixteen musicians associated with Fukushima Prefecture gather in the world of singing voices with residents of Fukushima Prefecture (Fukushima Minpo) - Yahoo!News
We want to bring the energetic singing voices of Hama, Naka and Aizu to the world.
Sixteen musicians associated with Fukushima Prefecture came together to compose a message song.
The lyrics engrave the earnest image of Fukushima Prefecture as it struggles to recover from the Great East Japan Earthquake and TEPCO's Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident and fights the new coronavirus.
Infused with the singing voices of the residents of the prefecture, the "full version" will be completed by next summer, the 10th anniversary of the earthquake.
On the 24th, the song was released on the video-sharing website YouTube.
The title of the song is "Pray from Fukushima (Play from Fukushima) ."
The cheerful and energetic melody expresses the desire to "communicate from Fukushima" the positive attitude of the people.
Due to the influence of the new Corona, the live house that serves as the base for musical activities has been forced to close, and many musicians have lost the place to sing and perform.
It was planned by singer-songwriter Nappo (46), who lives in Minamisoma City, and DAZU-O (37), who is a member of the Iwaki City music group "Mehikari Boys," in order to believe in the power of music when the future is uncertain.
Nappo writes and composes, while Dazuo raps.
When the project started in March of the corona disaster, singer-songwriters Manami (28) and Kanno Jun (38) from Fukushima City agreed one after another, and the circle quickly spread.
Ms. Nappo said with an emotional expression, "We now have a gorgeous lineup that is unthinkable in normal times. I want to fully enjoy this opportunity."
As a countermeasure against infection, there was no opportunity for 16 people to gather, and each was recorded at a live house or home.
In an effort to boost the project, Iwaki City artist Koa drew an image character.
Reminiscent of Fukushima Prefecture, it expresses the rich natural climate with blue and greenery.
The finished song will be posted to the world via YouTube, with the aim of making it into a CD.
Next year marks the 10th anniversary of the disaster, and the postponed Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics are also scheduled to be held.

New Corona: Two new cases confirmed in Sendai (TBC Tohoku Broadcasting) - Yahoo!News

Instantaneously detects a crisis from online information and determines hoaxes (JBpress) - Yahoo!News
"I want to know where and what kind of disasters and accidents occurred as soon as possible!"
This is not limited to media outlets such as television and newspapers, but there is also strong demand from many companies such as social infrastructure companies and local governments.
A service that responds to this is "Specty" developed by Spectee, an AI-based information analysis company.

Today, the first way for people to know about disasters and accidents is shifting from television to online information (social media).
Social media such as Twitter has become an important medium for disseminating information immediately after a disaster or accident occurs.
However, it is difficult to manually monitor the overflowing information and extract useful information from it.
Specty has the ability to detect and analyze information related to natural disasters and accidents from information flowing through social media such as Twitter, Instagram and Facebook, and distribute it to companies after determining the authenticity of the information.
It is a crisis management support service that visualizes various crises that are occurring in Japan and overseas, with "a wide range of events that have a negative impact, such as stopping or stagnating social activities, positioned as "crisis""" (Murakami Kenjiro, CEO).
At the time of the Kumamoto earthquake in April 2016, NHK was the first major use case for Specti, and since then, recruitment has spread rapidly among companies.
In addition to television stations, newspapers and other media outlets, more than 350 companies in Japan, including companies that support social infrastructure such as electricity, gas and transportation, as well as local governments across the country, are currently using Specti.
Analyze posts to determine the type and location of "crisis"
Specty distributes information in four steps: "collection of information," "analysis and classification of content," "title," and "determination of authenticity."
The user company must specify in advance the area where the information will be collected (prefecture, city, ward, town or village, etc.) and the category of crisis (disaster, accident, etc.).
Specty collects posts that fall under that designation using the API provided by social media.
Next, the text, images and videos contained in the collected posts are analyzed and categorized.
For example, if there is a video showing a fire engine, black smoke rising from the building and orange flames coming out of the room, it will be classified as a fire.
In addition, images of overturned cars are classified as "traffic accidents" and images of roads covered with water are classified as "road flooding."
Specty also estimates the location of disasters and accidents.
"We often don't know the location from the posts, so we use a combination of various information to make estimates," said CEO Murakami.
For example, if a road sign or sign appears in an image or video, place name information is extracted from it and matched with a place name database to identify the location.
Angels lose bye in opening game...Otani strikes out 3 pitches with bases loaded in the 1st and 9th innings (Baseball King) - Yahoo!News
○ Athletics 7x - 3 Angels ● <July 24th local time, Oakland Coliseum> Angels player Otani Shohei (26) made his start in the opening game against the Athletics on the 24th (25th Japan time) as the 3rd designated hitter.
In the first inning, he hit his first hit of the season in the middle of the first inning, but after that, he dropped out of the four at-bats and recorded a record of five at-bats, one hit and one strikeout.
In the third inning, Otani faced Montana again with one out and one out.
In the third inning of the fifth inning, which was 1-1, he faced Pettit, the second-placed right-hand man, with one death and one base, and fell to the ground again.
With a 2-1 lead in the fourth inning, he faced Diekman, the fifth-place left-hander, as the lead hitter.
He bounced the second ball straight back in the opposite direction at a good angle, but it did not over the fence and fell to the left fly.
In the bottom of the eighth inning, when the Angels took a one-point lead, Butley, the relief right-hand man, lost two points and allowed a reversal, but in the top of the ninth inning, when there was no end left, new catcher No. 7 Castro took the team's first solo shot of the season to the right wing seat.
At the last minute, they caught up with a 3-3 tie.
After that, Trout batted second with two deaths and one second base.
The Athletics bench shied away from declaring Trout here, choosing to play Otani with two dead and full bases.
Otani was expected to overtake him, but he struck out three balls in front of Hendrix, the guardian deity of the Athletics.
The game could not be settled in the ninth inning, and the extra time game started with an undead second base, which is a special case this season.
Ohtani was the last batter in the ninth inning, so he made it to second base.
In the top of the 10th inning, the Angels' lead batter, Walsh, threw a scathing first base grounder, but first baseman Olson caught the ball well and sent it to third base.
Otani was caught between second and third bases, and it was a touchout.
After that, the Angels loaded the bases with two deaths, but in the end, No. 8 Simmons fell to Nigoro.
On the other hand, the Angels were in a pinch at third base when Robles, who continued to pitch across the innings, was killed by a dead ball and a violent throw.
At this point, new manager Maddon shifted the infield to five, but Robles walked Davis in the fourth to load the bases.
Milner, the left-hander who replaced him, was carried to the right wing seat with a full-base ball that would be a farewell to No. 5 Olsson, and the game was decided.

This is a circuit built on the riverbed instead of a prefectural road that was closed due to a landslide, and it has been accessible only to residents' cars since the 17th.
As a result, 56 people from 33 households in the Oshima area are once again isolated, and Iida Construction Office hopes to begin restoration work as soon as the water recedes.

"Crowded cheating" "Home" doesn't make sense ...?
"Words I thought weren't really dialects" (Netorabo) - Yahoo!News
I am a resident of Chiba Prefecture, which is close to Tokyo.
I have been living in the prefecture for less than 30 years since I was born.
When I used it in a conversation with a friend at university (Tokyo), it was instantly taken as Kyoton.
They understood the meaning through the flow and the sense of the word, but Tokyo residents and Saitama residents told me they wouldn't use it.
Surely it's "crowded cheating = cheating and sneaking in?"
Since it seems to be connected with , it seems to be able to guess the meaning somehow.
and one more thing.
I didn't notice this when it was pointed out, but the expression "uchinchi" which means "my home" was not used at all when I was reading books, and I didn't hear it from my friends, so when I looked it up as an adult, it turned out to be a dialect.
"Home" ... ... ... was that so?
I also use it in my hometown (Gunma Prefecture), but I did not notice it because I naturally stopped using it after I grew up ...
Japanese "chilled Chinese food" doesn't appeal to Chinese people...?
"Cold noodle dishes" unpopular reason (contemporary business) - Yahoo! News
Chilled Chinese noodles in China are "Japanese-style cold noodles"
As mentioned at the beginning, hiyashi chuka is a Chinese dish (Japanese-style Chinese) that originated in Japan and was devised based on Chinese "liang bang mien" (chilled mixed soba).
Therefore, it does not originally exist in China, but due to the diversification of food, it is becoming common to see it in Japanese restaurants in the summer.
Also, recently, Japanese convenience stores have been selling arranged products called "Japanese-style Soba Ryomen/Soba Hiyashi Chuka" and "Sichuan-style Chicken Chicken Ryomen/Sichuan-style Chicken Hiyashi Chuka".
On the other hand, the popularity of Japanese-style Chinese cuisine in China is not high on the whole, pushed by the trendy punchy Chinese cuisine such as Sichuan cuisine and Hunan cuisine.
Naturally, Japanese-style Chinese flavors are often familiar to Chinese people.
Therefore, it is not unpleasant, but if it has little impact, it tends to be criticized badly.
"Hiyashi Chuka" is no exception, and it is still a minor presence in China.
Incidentally, the name of hiyashi chuka in China is "Japanese style cold noodles."
It is recognized by the Chinese as one of Japanese cuisine.
The standard summer dish is "liangpi" (cool skin).
In China, "liangpi" is probably the most summery noodle dish.
Many people may not be familiar with it in Japan, but ryopi is a flat noodles made from flour, rice flour and starch that originated in Shanxi Province.
It is said to have a history of 2,000 years.
It is a staple of B-grade gourmet that is also sold at stalls, and the price is very reasonable, around 10-20 yuan (150-300 yen).
It contains the word "ryo" (cool), but it is not squeezed with ice like Japanese chilled Chinese food.
Rather, it is based on room temperature.
The noodles are topped with your favorite ingredients such as shredded cucumbers, carrots and boiled bean sprouts, and spices such as coriander, chilli, ginger and garlic are added.
Finally, special seasonings such as soy sauce, chili oil, vinegar, sesame paste and peanut paste are added to finish.
The spicy sauce with a refreshing sourness and richness is well entwined with the noodles that are well-throated and pulling, and even when you have no appetite due to summer fatigue, it will slip in smoothly.
Also, because it has spread all over China, there are various toppings and seasonings, and the variety is abundant, which is one of the characteristics of ryokawa and one way to enjoy it.

Benefits of "cold water shower" for body and mind (Cosmopolitan) - Yahoo! News
Reduces inflammation such as muscle pain
A study published in The North American Journal of Medical Sciences looking at the effectiveness of hydrotherapy (water-based treatment) has shown promise in physical and mental healing.
By taking cold water after exercising, you can reduce muscle aches and other inflammatory effects.
According to Professor Douglas Casa, director of the Korey Stringer Institute, which studies sports medicine, and who teaches at the University of Connecticut, "It's important to exercise and take a cold shower in as little time as possible. Reducing your body temperature immediately after exercising will speed up recovery from exercise-induced inflammation and fatigue."
Reduce fatigue
Exercising in high temperatures causes the heart, muscles and skin to need more blood flow than usual.
"When you're exercising, your heart rate is high, so there's more blood flow to your heart, muscle blood flow increases because you need energy to contract your muscles, and when it comes to your skin, there's a lot of blood coming in to regulate your body temperature," he said.
"A cold shower lowers the temperature of the skin, which reduces the amount of blood flow to the skin. Instead, it sends blood flow to the internal organs such as the stomach and intestines, which makes it easier for water and nutrients to be taken after exercise. As a result, fatigue felt after exercise can be reduced."
Expectations for hormesis effect
Drozzewski also explains that exposure to cold water can trigger a "hormesis effect."
The hormesis effect is the idea that it is better to have a small amount of substances and stress that are harmful to the body than not at all.
"Hypoxia exercise, petit fasting, and cold water showers are prime examples of hormesis effects for health, and cold water showers stimulate hormones and neurotransmitters to develop physical and physical resilience and resilience."
Shizuoka Prefecture Sports Supporters Commission Two Cycling Teams | Shizuoka Newspaper @S
Hirano (center) and others receiving a plate commissioned by a sports supporter at Fujinokuni, Oyama-cho
On the 24th, Shizuoka Prefecture commissioned two cycling teams from the eastern part of the prefecture as "Fujinokuni Sports Supporters" to help promote sports in the prefecture.
"Team Bridgestone Cycling" based in Mishima and "Levante Fuji Shizuoka" based in Fuji.
Seiya Hirano of Team Bridgestone Cycling, who received a plaque commissioned by Governor Heita Kawakatsu at Fuji Speedway in Oyama-cho, expressed his aspirations, saying, "I want to work as a team to liven up the cycling competition together with the people of the prefecture."

Hanshin-Oyama, 2 rounds in a row, No. 7!
Director Yano "It's stately to watch" (Sankei Sports) - Yahoo!News
(Se-League, Chunichi 2-5 Hanshin, 7th round, Hanshin 4-3, 24th, Nagoya D) The momentum of No. 4 has not stopped.
The ball soared high and landed in the middle of the left wing seat.
Oyama made two consecutive arches and circled the diamond.
When he returned to the bench, he peeked at his white teeth.
"While I was able to make a good swing, I was able to narrow down the target ball and swing boldly."
In the fourth inning, 0-2, he took the lead in the batting order.
He swings aggressively from the first ball, and the second ball after the foul.
Ohno Yu's sweet 134kg slider was not to be missed.
The hitting ball caught with the core is such a perfect hit that you can be sure that you will stand in the moment you hit it.
Following the match against Hiroshima (Koshien) on the 23rd of the previous day, one shot in two consecutive games was a sluggish counterattack.
It was also a valuable one that was hit from an opponent that was not good at it.
When he faced Ohno Yu at Koshien on the 17th, he had 9 hits and scored 4 points.
However, as far as the Nagoya Dome is concerned, they have allowed 7 wins, 1 loss and 1 hold in their past 12 games, and have suffered seven consecutive defeats since August 23, 2013, with a draw in between.
From such a difficult opponent, he scored a goal for the first time in 23 innings at the Nagoya Dome (even dropping out of the game counted to one inning) with a dynamic shot and did not pass the flow of the game.
Manager Yano also expressed his hopes for further explosions, saying, "It's a high level to be able to catch a sweet ball well. It has a dignity to watch, and even if the timing of hitting is foul, there is an atmosphere. I think he will still hit me."
At one point, he hit a right-handed forehand, and with this, he has hit in six consecutive games and multiple hits in three consecutive games.
Although he made a modest start to the season, with seven home runs and 16 RBIs, he is already working impeccably as the team's top and fourth.
In order to win, we will continue to leave results.

Head Coach Iwabuchi Kensuke (HC) of the Japan men's rugby sevens team spoke to the press online on the 25th, expressing his determination regarding the Tokyo Olympics, which have been postponed to next year, saying, "I want to unite and work towards my goal of winning medals."
Due to the postponement of the Olympics, Yusaku Kuzuru (Coca-Cola), the captain of the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics, and Fukuoka Kenju (Panasonic), who represented the Olympics and played an active part in the 2019 World Cup with 15 players, left the team.

Macau Casino Supervisory Authority inspects the implementation of epidemic prevention measures at casino facilities... New Coronavirus Negative Certificate must be presented at admission (Macau Newspaper) - Yahoo!News
About 40 casino facilities in Macau were closed for 15 days from February 5th to 19th due to the outbreak of the new Coronal Ill infection (COVID-19), but have resumed operations after taking strict epidemic prevention measures since February 20th.
The Macau Casino Regulatory Authority (DICJ) requires operators to protect the health of their employees and guests as much as possible when reopening, ensuring the distance between gaming (casino) tables, allowing seating next to each other for table games (for example, at a Baccarat table, only three to four people can sit at one table at the same time), and limiting the risk of cross-infection by requiring slot machines to be operated every other or two.
Strengthened disinfection of gaming equipment such as chips has also been implemented.
Guests are also required to wear a mask, check their temperature, and present a valid health code (generated by entering their most recent stay, contact history with new corona patients, symptoms such as fever or cough, and contact information) at the entrance.
From midnight on July 15th, a new type of coronavirus nucleic acid test negative certificate (limited to those within the validity period issued by a licensed facility in Macau or Guangdong Province) was added to the condition.
The background to the new requirement to present a negative certificate is the relaxation of waterfront measures between Macau and Guangdong Province from 6:00 a.m. on the 15th (the abolition of quarantine and quarantine for 14 days, subject to various conditions), which is a preventive measure accompanying this.
The DICJ announced on July 18th that, in response to the change in admission conditions from July 15th, Director General of the DIC, Adriano Ho, and others inspected the implementation of anti-epidemic measures at the casino facilities, held a meeting with representatives from the security departments of the six casino operators, and renewed their call to protect the health of employees and guests by thoroughly managing the admission of guests.
The DICJ stated that it will continue to conduct strict patrols of casino facilities, hold regular meetings with the operators according to the situation and evaluation, and will adjust quarantine measures at casinos as appropriate in accordance with the guidelines of the government health bureau.
It is said that Hayashi Matsu, director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention at the Sanitation Bureau, and others accompanied him on this visit to the casino facilities, and on-site guidance was given on how to disinfect gaming (casino) chips and how to secure a safe distance between the seats of electronic casino equipment.
In addition, due to the sharp decrease in inbound tourists due to epidemic prevention measures including border entry restrictions, cumulative casino sales from January to June of this year decreased by 77.4% from the same period of the previous year to 33.720 billion Macao patacas (Japanese yen equivalent: approximately 451.9 billion yen).
Yuwaku Onsen to Hikari no Ale: A message to medical professionals to replace the Bonbori Festival next month (Hokukoku Shimbun) - Yahoo!News
At Yuwaku Onsen, where the annual Yuwaku Bonbori Festival has been cancelled due to the new coronavirus, efforts to light bonbori with messages of support to medical workers will begin on August 1.
Paper written by fans and local residents from all over the country will be affixed to about 350 bonbori, enveloping the hot spring town with the light of ale and bringing healing to visitors.
The Bonbori Festival is an event that recreates the festival that appears in the anime "Hanasaki Kuiroha" modeled after Yuwaku Onsen, and is organized by the Yuwaku Onsen Tourist Association.
Since the anime was first broadcast in 2011, many anime fans from all over the country visit every year.
Every year, from the lighting ceremony in July until the main festival in October, a bonbori is lit up on the stairs leading to Yuwaku Inari Shrine next to Soyu.
This year, the festival was forced to be cancelled due to the new Corona, but fans from all over the country and the local area said one after another, "It's sad that there are no bonbori in the summer of Yuwaku," and the association came up with this plan.
The campaign was named "Recovery Campaign" with the hope of contributing as much as possible to the healing and recovery of the world that is suffering from the corona catastrophe.
Up to now, about 50 students from Yuwaku Elementary School and Shibahara Junior High School have been asked to write an illustrated message one by one, and more than 100 applications have been received from all over the country.
If you purchase the message form from the association's website, fill it out, put it in a reply envelope and send it to the association, you can receive a lighted photo attached to a jar.
For 6,000 yen per set, applications will be accepted until the total number of bonbori reaches about 350.
The bonbori will be lit until the end of November.
Yamashita Shinichiro (48), who has been the chairman of the festival's executive committee since its inception, said, "Reading the message gives us encouragement. Next year, we want to hold a grand festival that will mark the 10th anniversary."
For the campaign, a character of Hanasaki Iroha and an illustration of Asanogawa Ohashi Bridge have also been prepared.
From the first day, users of special accommodation plans at ryokans in Yuwaku Onsen will receive a clear file with illustrations.
"Moriyama Gaigen," the core 4 that supports Seibu, is a collaboration of souls (Higashi Sport Web) - Yahoo!News
Seibu's proud "Moriyama Gaigen" showed the spirit of cooperation and produced the second farewell victory this season.
In the game against Lotte (MetLife) on the 24th, the four players, who were still far from their best form, showed their tenacity for victory in the 9th inning, 2-2.
Genda led off the inning with a head-sliding single to first base off a safety bunt.
Then, No. 3 Mori, who has been at the bottom of the table with a batting average of 10.08 minutes and 2 rin in the last 6 games, sent a bunt and scored one death and second base.
Yamakawa, in 4th place, was shunned, and Tonosaki, who had switched places with Mori and returned to 5th place on this day, smashed Masuda's straight ball, leading to a 3-2 victory.
Tonozaki, the hero, said, " (Genda's safety) caught me off guard even though I was on the bench, and I thought I had no choice but to do something about it. Tomoya also believed in me behind me with a bunt, and I understood that feeling. Yamakawa gave me a word before going to first base with Keito, "Be proactive!," so I was able to get my feelings into it."
Mori and Yamakawa ranked first and second in the 2013 draft, Tonosaki ranked third in 2014, and Genda ranked third in 2016. The four players are the "core 4" of the fielders, whom the team officials call "the heart of our current team."
All of them have experience as captains when they were amateurs, and their sense of responsibility is more than double that of others.
Tozaki, who took over as captain from Yamakawa in his senior year at Fuji University, said, "Mr. Yamakawa is a good talker, so he is a captain who leads the team with words. On the other hand, since I am not good at speaking, I was the type to leave the talk to the vice captain who is good at talking and stand behind me."
Director Tsuji said, "Genda's safety? That's not an autograph. But with that, I thought, "Yes, I can go." Tomoya was also a great bunt. Tozaki also played well."
All four players are currently struggling with a batting average of 20.4% to 5 minutes, but they support the team with the wisdom to win even if they can not hit.

After returning to the Choshu Domain, he gave a lecture on military science at Yamaguchi Meirinkan.
The statue focused on Masujiro as an educator.
Standing beside a globe, holding a book in his hand, he gave a lecture on Western studies.
The combined height of the pedestal is about 3 meters (1.55 meters), and it is said that the statue was made from the perspective of a disciple taking a lecture by Masujiro.
It was designed by local designer Takami Marie (27), a descendant of Masujiro's wife, Kotoko.
It was built with donations from the 150th anniversary of the death of Omura Masujiro, whose parent organization was the Chusenji Community Association (headed by Okamoto Satoshi).
About 12.8 million yen was collected from 1,104 people nationwide.
The cost of the project, including the installation of the nameplate, is approximately 12 million yen.
The remaining donations will be used to maintain the statue.
Chairman Okamoto said, "The pride of Kori is that Masujiro kept his ambition high and made a great contribution as an educator. A bronze statue that will serve as hope for the children of the region who will bear the future."
Mbape left the venue on crutches after being injured in a vicious tackle (SPORT.es) - Yahoo! News
Paris Saint-Germain won for the 13th time in two years after defeating Saint-Etienne 1-0 in the Coupe de France final held at the Stade de France on the 24th local time.
PSG wins domestic double
Neymar's goal puts PSG ahead of Saint-Etienne After Neymar's first-half goal secured them a domestic double following Ligue 1, PSG now have no choice but to worry ahead of the Champions League in August.
Kilian Mbape, who started in the same game, was injured after a vicious sliding tackle by his opponent CB Loic Perrin.
The young French star contorted his face in pain after being knocked down with his right ankle pinched in the first half hour.
Players from both teams got into a scuffle over the play.
Mbape, who seems to have twisted his right ankle, is unable to continue playing.
A red card was shown to Phelan.
After the match, Mbape left the stadium on crutches with his right leg fixed.
The PSG will play the Coupe de la Ligue final against Lyon on August 1st at 4:10am Japan time, but it will definitely be impossible to use Mbape in this match.
He will have to wait for a medical report from the club, but could miss the Champions League in Portugal.
Corona disaster "becoming closer to art" Online art museum "HASARD" Mr. Konno (born in Hachinohe) launched (Daily Tohoku Shimbun) - Yahoo!News
There are museums where anyone can touch art for free, whenever they want.
The collection ranges from famous painters such as Claude Monet and Gustav Klimt to unknown artists in Japan.
Since its "opening" in April 2019, the online museum "HASARD" has captured the hearts of users for its convenience and novelty, and its attention has been further heightened by the new lifestyle caused by the corona disaster.
Representative Konno Shinnosuke (26), who is from Hachinohe and lives in Tokyo, who launched the website, said, "We wanted to create a service where anyone can easily enjoy art. We want people to come into contact with art in difficult situations."
When you visit Other, you will be amazed by the abundance of exhibits and the beauty of the images.
As of the 24th, there are a total of 14 permanent and special exhibitions on display, and the ultra-high resolution works that convey not only the colors but also the texture of the brush attract the viewer.
There is no need to register as a member or pay an entrance fee, and it is characterized by the fact that there is no cost not only for the viewer but also for artists who want to hold a solo exhibition.
The unique way of showing things online is also attracting attention.
Moving the picture is one of them.
In Claude Monet's permanent exhibition "It Begins to Move Again," clouds, flowers and meadows are digitally altered to make them move.
"I want to make it accessible to people who are not interested in art" (Representative Konno), so you can feel like you are in a picture.
Representative Konno first encountered art when he was in elementary school.
When my family and I visited the Aomori Museum of Art, which had just been completed, I saw three huge paintings of Marc Chagall's "Areco" and was struck by its power.
From the next day, the art class turned into a fun time, and even after he moved to Tokyo to attend university, he began to visit galleries and other places.
At the same time, I also felt that there are many people who do not have many opportunities to interact with art from various perspectives, such as the lack of an art museum nearby, large-scale exhibitions are only held in the Tokyo metropolitan area, and it is difficult to go out due to childcare.
So, while working for an IT company, he spent about two months launching a website where people can appreciate art online.
The number of users reached an average of 10,000 per month in the first 10 months, and increased to about 30,000 after the spread of the new corona infection.
It would be great if anyone could appreciate art in a free way when they wanted to see it.
Other's aim was unexpectedly accepted by more people due to the corona disaster.
Representative Konno emphasized the significance of art appreciation, saying it enriches the imagination.
"The more imagination you have, the more you can reach out to people in need.
I hope that by bringing art closer to us, we will become a better society."
The simple reason why the era of quality in China is coming to an end and the era of quality in Japan is coming (modern business) - Yahoo!News
a pandemic and a shift in values
Various predictions and discussions have been made about the after-pandemic world.
On the business front, there is a possibility that the changes mentioned in the July 8th article, "Actually, the jobs of 'managers' are starting to disappear in Japan right now...! That cruel reality" and the July 4th article, "In the world of 'After Corona', 'Japanese manufacturing' is likely to make a big comeback...!"
[Photos] The true nature of "Japan's strength" unknown only to Japanese people... an unexpected reality seen in Asia
On the spiritual front, the trend is likely to become more mainstream, with articles such as the June 26th article, "How to burn completely" for those who have become conscious of the end of their lives in the corona" and the June 10th article, "Now that the corona is full of riots, let's reconsider the utility of "God's request in times of hardship"".
The major trend of "from Chinese quality to Japanese quality" is that these two "materials (economics and business) " and "spirit" will be clearly visible to our eyes as a combination.
For example, if a T-shirt or digital camera is defective or defective, it can be annoying, but there is no other way to save the life of the person who purchased it.
On the other hand, the sloppy quality of masks and respirators made in China, which has recently become a hot topic, ..."Chinese quality" in such products that are directly linked to life and safety is fatal.
No matter how cheap it is, you cannot buy such a product.
Even if they pay a substantial price, they will still be looking for "Japanese quality" products.
Of course, this trend is not happening only in Japan.
This is evident from the fact that Western countries, which had fallen into a difficult situation due to a shortage of masks and medical equipment, nevertheless returned products one after another due to the severity of "Chinese quality."
It's safer and safer than cheap.
Products such as automobiles are also products whose defects can be fatal (death in an accident).
No matter how many countries, including China and Korea, go on the offensive with the "cheap or bad" strategy, they will not be able to compete with Japanese-made cars in the end, and the situation will be as described in the article on June 16th, "Will the world's automakers bow down to Toyota after winning alone?" This is because "Japanese quality" is strongly required for automobile products.
And this pandemic reminded us that "safety and security" is also necessary for many other products.
In addition, safety and security are important not only for "Japanese quality in manufacturing" but also for "Japanese quality in logistics and other services."
Like the toilet paper riots, there are times when even though there is proper production capacity, intermediate distribution is delayed and it is not reachable.
Furthermore, the April 17 article "Who is the real culprit behind the shortage of masks? Don't tolerate fireplace thieves from the Communist Party of China" made me keenly aware that self-sufficiency in Japan is also an important element of "security and security."
When an emergency occurs, it is natural for any country to prioritize their own country, and it is very important to be able to procure essential goods such as masks (medical equipment) and food within their own country.
The number of new cases of coronal infection in South Korea exceeds 100 for the first time in 115 days, the highest number of foreign influxes at 86 (Yonhap News) - Yahoo!News
According to Yonhap News, (SEOUL=Yonhap News) South Korea's Central Epidemic Control Headquarters announced on the 25th that as of midnight on the same day, the number of people infected with the new coronavirus had increased by 113 from midnight the previous day to a total of 14,092.
This is the first time in 115 days that the number of new infections per day has exceeded 100 since April 1 (101).
In addition to the fact that 32 seafarers were found to be infected by a Russian ship that entered Busan Port, 32 of the 293 workers who returned from Iraq on the 24th were tested positive.
The number of new infections in South Korea was in the 30-60 range, except for the 20th (26).
Of the new infections announced on the 25th, 86 came from overseas, the highest number since January 20th, when the first cases of infection occurred in Korea.
The largest number came from Iraq with 36, followed by 34 from Russia, five from the Philippines and three from the United States.
On the other hand, 27 people were infected in the city, 11 in Seoul and Gyeongui-do respectively, and 5 in Busan.
The five in Busan were employees of a repair company that boarded the Russian vessel.
The death toll remains unchanged from the previous day, bringing the total to 298.
Nagoya player Miyahara tested positive for corona in J1 soccer for the first time since league resumed | Shizuoka Newspaper @S
Nagoya, a J1 soccer team, announced on the 25th that it had confirmed that defender Miyahara Kazuya (24) had tested positive for the new coronavirus.
This is the first time a player has tested positive since the J-League resumed.
He is the third player from the club after forward Kanasaki Yumeo (31) and Australian goalkeeper Mitchell Langerak (31) who were infected in June.
Both players were treated and returned to the game.
This season's Miyahara was on the bench in the J1 match against Oita at Showa Denko Dome Oita on the 22nd.
Nagoya held an online press conference on the 25th and revealed that 60 players and staff had undergone PCR tests on the same day.

It turns out that white paint derived from Teflon-processed frying pans enhances the cooling effect with heat insulation!
Unbelievable discovery!
This year, the rainy season was marked by an unprecedented amount of rainfall, but when it is bright, the scorching summer will begin in earnest.
The days were so hot and hot that even the air conditioning didn't work well...
Global warming is a major global problem, and humankind has been striving to figure out how to overcome the hot summer with even a little comfort.
One way to do this is to wear light white clothing.
See, you don't have to wear black clothes to absorb heat in summer, do you?
In addition, the same principle is applied to the construction of homes, and it seems that the use of white paint is increasing.
Even if white is white, I wonder if it is possible to make a paint that reflects more light and does not absorb heat, and that is the latest research field.
Recently, UCLA's Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science, in collaboration with researchers from Columbia University's School of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics, announced that they have found a method for blending white paint that can most efficiently repel solar heat and increase the cooling effect inside buildings.
It is hoped that this technology will be put into practical use at an early stage.
Previously, the white paint with the highest reflectivity of sunlight was made of titanium oxide, which has a reflectivity of up to 85%.
White paint that uses titanium oxide has already been applied to roofs of buildings in high temperature environments, helping to block solar heat and increase cooling efficiency.
However, what was newly discovered was a white paint derived from the fluorine resin of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), which is used in Teflon-processed frying pans.
It is a white paint that applies this Teflon effect, and it reflects sunlight up to 98%, and it is said that it is possible to cut heat significantly.
Even in the hot summer, thanks to the unexpected white paint made with Teflon, it is easy to spend indoors without being exposed to the scorching heat.
Such an era may be coming soon, right?
I feel that the roofs of Japanese houses have a lot of dark colors, but I wonder if white will become the mainstream in the future?
When is Amazon's annual big sale this year?
On July 21st, CNBC reported that Amazon.com has postponed its annual "Prime Day" sale.
It is held in July every year, but it was reported that this year was forced to be postponed due to the spread of the new coronavirus infection.
■ A spokesperson said, "Details will be announced shortly" A spokesperson for Amazon said in a statement.
"Prime Day has become a special celebration event that we look forward to over the past five years. This year, we will hold it later than usual, while ensuring the safety of our employees and supporting our customers and exhibitors."
However, he only stated that "details will be announced soon" and did not specify a specific date.
On the other hand, it was decided to hold the event in India.
A press release was posted on the country's website.
He explained that it will be held for 48 hours from midnight on August 6th.
Until now, Prime Day has been held simultaneously around the world, but this year may be an unusual step.
■ Large-scale event with sales of 760 billion yen in two days Amazon started this large-scale sale for members in 2015 as a way to promote sales in the summer when sales are declining.
Originally a 24-hour event, it has grown in scale year by year, and last year it was held for 48 hours from midnight on July 15th in 18 countries including the US, Canada, UK, Germany, France, India, Japan, China and Australia.
According to the company, sales over the two days last year exceeded previous sales results on Black Friday (the first day of the year-end sales season) and Cyber Monday (the following Monday).
The event has also helped attract new subscribers to the paid subscription service, Prime, and last year saw a record number of applications on the first day, followed by the next day.
Last year, the company sold 175 million products worldwide.
In response, Internet Retailer, a magazine specializing in the online shopping industry, reported that global sales over the two days were $7.16 billion (approximately 760 billion yen), a 70% increase from the previous year.
Strict eyes on mobile phone number transfer and excessive retention.
What happens to fees and point grants?
(New Switch) - Yahoo!News
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications is seriously considering a review of the Same Number Transition System (MNP), which allows users to use their existing phone numbers as they are when changing mobile communications companies.
At the opinion leaders' meeting on the 21st, they announced their intention to revise the MNP guidelines established in 2004.
Specific issues range from the nature of MNP fees to the pros and cons of retaining those who wish to move out.
While opposition from telecommunications companies is expected, attention will be paid to whether this will lead to the promotion of healthy market competition.
The dark side of telecommunications companies where unlimited mobile phone transfers are far away When MNP was introduced in 2006, the user fee was 2,000 yen, but now it is 3,000 yen.
The MNP fee revenues of the three major mobile telecommunications companies are estimated to be 15.9 billion yen a year.
On the 21st, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications listed the current situation surrounding MNPs at the Working Group on Verification of Competition Rules (WG), a meeting of experts to discuss the competitive environment in the telecommunications market.
He also mentioned the time required for issuing MNP reservation numbers when consumers transfer to other carriers as a challenge.
Major telecommunications companies accept applications online, but due to the convenience of operating mission-critical systems, the reception time is mainly from 9 to 20 o'clock.
In the working group materials, it was stated that the direction for future consideration would be to respond throughout the day in principle.
It is also seen as a problem that mobile telecommunication companies try to keep people who wish to move out with MNP by granting them points.
This is because they judged that excessive retention could impede fair competition.
Kita Shunichi, a partner at Nomura Research Institute, who is a member of the working group, recommends, "Get permission from users to give them time to explain the provision of economic benefits, and promptly issue numbers to users who do not grant permission. It is important to thoroughly implement this process first."
However, in a series of issues, there is a structural problem with MNP fees: "The higher the fee, the less likely it will be for customers to leave, so it will be difficult to motivate them to actively lower it" (a person in charge at the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications).
If some companies take the initiative in lowering MNP fees, there will be an increase in the outflow of customers from those companies, and there are concerns that their efforts will not be rewarded.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications has also pointed out that many countries overseas do not require user fees for MNPs, and this may be the case in Japan as well.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications hopes to compile a report on the outcomes of the working group around September-October, and then begin the process of revising the MNP guidelines.
It is expected that the revision will be made after 21 years.
Mobile telecommunication companies are likely to struggle with issues including sales and customer support.
Chunichi Katsuno fails to win pitcher's right even if he scores no runs in six innings (Sankei Sports) - Yahoo! News
Chunichi pitcher Katsuno Shokei (23) started in the Hanshin 8th round (Nagoya Dome) on the 25th.
He had four hits and no runs in six innings.
"I was throwing because I thought it was my last chance because I also pitched last time. There was also a foreball, but I was able to compete with the opponent without worrying too much."
In the first pitch of the season and the last game against Hanshin on the 18th (Koshien), both starters struggled to control the ball and dropped out of the game up to four times.
He did not play the role of a starter, and this time it was a backwater mound facing the survival of one army.
This time, he aggressively attacked with a hearty ball against a fierce tiger batting line that was in good shape.
When a straight ball in the latter half of the 140-kilometer range ran, variable balls such as counting balls could be used effectively.
In the sixth inning, he was hit by a left-middle double by the leading Sands, but Oyama flew to the left and Bohr was hit by a two-goro, two-death third base.
In the match against Fukudome that he met here, he chased him with two balls, and at the end of the game, he forked.
In the three-ball game, he struck out with a swing and overcame the pinch.
Katsuno finished the sixth inning with 83 pitches, but at the end of the midfield game, Manager Yoda came off the bench and announced the change of pitchers.
Nishi Isamu, who played in the pitching match, had 108 pitches at the same time, but he got off the mound first and could not get the right to win for the first time this season.

Masuda-jinja Shrine, located in the Takagushi district of Tano, Hizen-cho, Karatsu City, enshrines Officer Masuda Keitaro (1869-95), who died in the line of duty for his efforts to combat the cholera epidemic that spread to the area 125 years ago.
The annual festival has been held grandly in late July every year, but this year it was canceled due to the influence of the new coronavirus.
On the 26th, only Shinto rituals will be performed by the council presidents.
At the annual festival, a community association was held, and Officer Masuda's float on a white horse was paraded and fireworks were set off.
Every year, nearly 200 people, including bereaved families living in Kumamoto Prefecture, police officials and local residents, attend.
Takeda Yoshinori (72), the chairman of the local government, said, "This is an annual festival that has been connected to the local community, and it is very regrettable that it has been canceled."
This year, the prefectural police also canceled a memorial service for police academy students.
On the 21st, Chief Sugiuchi Yumiko and Chief Fukushima Hiroto of Karatsu visited Komatsushima, off the coast of Takagushi Port, where he was cremated, and laid flowers at the monument.
Chief Sugiuchi renewed his belief that "the spirit of bravery and dedication is the origin of the police force, and I want to pass it on as it should be."
Constable Masuda, originally from Kumamoto Prefecture, was assigned to Takagushi in July 1895.
He took measures such as disinfecting the patient's home in a sleepless and restless manner, and after that he himself contracted cholera.
He said, "I will carry all of Takagushi's cholera on my shoulders," and passed away at the age of 25, just four days after taking office.

Dodgers Bets sign 12-year, 39.1 billion yen contract
The second largest in history after Angels Trout!
Los Angeles Dodgers outfielder Mookie Betts has signed a new contract.
He was traded to the Boston Red Sox in the offseason.
Before his first year in the new world, he signed a contract until 2032.
Companies such as the US media "CBS Sports" reported on the 22nd (23rd Japan time).
Video: R Sox Bets show off their diverse talents!
You can do this other than baseball!
Betts made his major league debut in 2014 at the age of 21.
As the center of the Boston Red Sox's strong batting line and as a strong right fielder, he has contributed to the team.
From 2015 to last season, he hit more than 40 doubles every year, and he is like the pinnacle of middle-distance hitters.
In 2018, when he became the best player in the world, he was crowned the top batter and MVP with a .346 batting average.
According to CBS Sports, Betts rejected a 10-year, $300 million offer from the Red Sox last year.
In the off-season, he was traded to the Dodgers in exchange for money and multiple players, along with left-handed ace pitcher David Price.
He signed a one-year contract worth $27 million (approximately 2.9 billion yen) this season.
The new contract announced this time is a total of $365 million (approximately 39.1 billion yen) over the 12 years from the 2021 season to the 2032 season.
The current largest contract in Major League Baseball is a 12-year, $426 million contract with Los Angeles Angels outfielder Mike Trout.
Betts's current contract is the second-biggest.
As for Betts, who will become a free agent (FA) in the off-season, a battle was inevitable if he went to the market.
It follows the recent trend of signing long and expensive contracts before becoming an FA.
In the turbulent times of Major League Baseball, Betts has gained long-term stability.

"Hot Seminar" where Dr. Kinoshita Akio, Director of the Ophthalmology Department at Hiramatsu Hospital, explained dry eyes, etc. =Yonezawa Saga Head Office of Glasses, Saga City
The "Health Hot Seminar" (sponsored by Saga Shimbun and co-sponsored by Yonezawa Glasses) was held on the 25th at the Yonezawa Saga Head Office of Glasses in Shimoda-cho, Saga City, where experts give advice on various health-related issues.
Kinoshita Akio, head of the ophthalmology department at Hiramatsu Hospital (Ogi City), explained about eye diseases that are deeply involved in daily life, such as dry eyes and cataracts.
Dry eye is described as a "tear disease", a condition where the quality of tears collapses and tears do not spread evenly on the surface of the eye.
Ms. Kinoshita said, "Contact lens users are about four times more likely," and urged caution, "Do not use them for a long time or sleep while wearing them."
Measures such as placing the computer screen below eye level and humidifying in an air-conditioned room were shown.
Ingredients and foods that are effective for dry eyes were also introduced.
"Omega-3 contained in blue fish prevents tears from evaporating, and mucin contained in natto and okra enhances the quality of tears."
As for cataract surgery, there are two types of intraocular lenses that are inserted instead of the lens, one that is single-focus and the other that is multi-focus, and I touched on the differences in appearance.
Approximately 40 people attended the seminar.
As a preventive measure against the transmission of the new coronavirus, the event was divided into two parts, one in the morning and the other in the afternoon, and was held in small groups, and temperature inspections and disinfection were carried out before admission, and sufficient ventilation was carried out at the venue.

Kofu City announced that a man in his thirties in the city had been infected with the new coronavirus.
The new infection was confirmed by a male employee in his thirties at the Kofu District Fire Department South Fire Station.

[G Osaka] What is the possibility of making a J1 debut against 17-year-old forward Karayama and Kobe?
Coach Miyamoto "Scoring ability is outstanding" (Sports Hochi) - Yahoo! News
Manager Miyamoto Tsuneyasu (43) of G-Osaka spoke to reporters on the 25th before the Kobe match (Noesta on the 26th) in which they will face a four-game winning streak, and expressed his expectations for third-year high school forward Karayama Shoji (17), who joined the first-team squad for the first time in the previous season.
Karayama, who was promoted to the top rank in this season's jumping class, was made a bench member in the game against Hiroshima on the 22nd.
I didn't give him a chance to play, but to the striker who has scored 3 goals in 5 games this season in J3 so far, "There is a prominent part in getting points. I am 17 years old, but I want you to do more gamsala. I have seen players going abroad at a young age, but I want you to play with high awareness and greed."
Karayama scored 8 goals in 10 games for J3, who played as a specially designated player last season.
Although he is slender at 178 centimeters and 65 kilograms, he boasts an astonishing scoring rate of 11 goals in 15 games in J3, using his sense of instantaneous movement to get behind the defender and his calmness to shoot in front of a crowded opponent's goal.
In the game against Hiroshima, Karayama got a chance when FW Ademiwson and MF Onose were out of the bench due to injury, but he did not have a chance to play.
In preparation for the match against Kobe, Miyamoto explained the condition of Ademiwson and Onose, saying, "Both of them are not 100%, but they are highly motivated and are challenging their preparations."
If they are preserved, there is a possibility that Karayama will be on the bench again.
At G-Osaka, MF Doan (currently PSV) made his J1 debut at the age of 16 years and 11 months, while FW Usami made his J1 debut at the age of 17 years and 0 months, and moved overseas in his teens.
Karayama, who is currently 17 years and 10 months old and is expected to be the next talent, is also expected to make his J1 debut as a successor to them.
A Ferrari that was stolen 26 years ago was found at the bottom of a river, but was not restored and turned into a work of art (octane.jp) - Yahoo!News
In 1994, a Ferrari Mondial was stolen in the Netherlands.
Time passed without the police being able to solve it, but 26 years later, the mondial was miraculously found.
The discovery of the Ferrari (four photos) found at the bottom of the river was triggered by a diving training exercise by the fire department.
On July 8th, a training diver spotted something in the shape of a wedge submerged at the bottom of the river, and police and even the Dutch army were called in and pulled something out, which turned out to be a Ferrari Mondial.
By matching the VIN number to a database of stolen cars, they were able to link the Ferrari to the 1994 incident.
The car was handed over to its legal owner, an insurance company, and then sent to a scrap dealer.
Lowie van de Ooyevaar, a scrap dealer, said: "There are still some parts left, but they are for the art of displaying. We have already received many requests from people who want to make a table out of the dismembered mondial. We will use engine blocks and glass plates."
For the time being, there are no plans to sell them in concrete terms, but scrap dealers will store them as objects.
Seibu and Tonosaki hit their first goodbyes
In his sixth year as a professional, the "man who doesn't have" is finally here!
(Sankei Sports) - Yahoo!News
(Pa-League, Seibu 3x-2 Lotte, 9th round, Seibu 6-3, 24th, MetLife) It's the white star of obsession! !
On the 24th, Seibu and Tonosaki Shuta Uchinote (27) hit their first goodbye in their 6th year as pros in the 9th inning of the Lotte 9th round (MetLife) to the left front, contributing to a 3-2 victory.
He took advantage of the opportunities that were staged with Genda's head sliding and Mori's sacrifice hit.
The team that came together and won the competition had two savings.
The voltage of the Leo Party, which was packed into its home base, the MetLife Dome, reached a climax.
Tonozaki hit his first goodbye in his sixth year as a professional.
The crowd of 4,825 people was excited.
"Minamoto (Genda) and Tomoya (Mori) connected me, so I entered the batting with the intention of doing something about it" The obsession of my colleagues to win inspired the number 5.
It was the ninth time that they met at 2-2.
Genda, the lead hitter, attempted a safety bunt and made a spirited head slide to first base.
When he came out with an infield hit, last season's top batter, Mori, made his second professional sacrifice hit.
No. 4, Yamakawa shy away from declaring.
A senior at Fuji University was forced to walk, and Tonosaki's inner heart was burning.
"I thought, "Damn it." Before Yamakawa-san went to first base, he said to me, "Be proactive," so I got a feeling for him."
From the first ball, he was stuck in a straight ball with a high infield angle, but the ball hit the left front.
Through his amateur days, he said goodbye that he "has no memory."
The 27-year-old, who had been inspired by his alma mater, Aomori's Hirosaki Sane High School, advancing to the top four in the summer prefectural tournament for the first time in 20 years, took a jubilant water shower and smiled, saying, "As expected, it felt good."
He was called "the man who didn't have it."
He was selected by Samurai Japan as a versatile player who can protect the inside and outside of the field, and contributed to being the best in the world at the "Premier 12" last November.
However, at Seibu, he had no experience of hitting a goodbye, and was bullied by Manager Tsuji and Baba's strategy/defense/running coach, saying, "I don't have it, you."
Repelling the negative reputation, he directed the second farewell victory this season.
Director Tsuji praised him, saying, "I asked the Victory Goddess to do it for today only. She played well."
In terms of savings 2, they are in third place, one game behind SoftBank, which is in first place.
Tonozaki, who has only hit one home run this season and has a batting average of 252, said, "We still have to hit. We will work together as a team to aim for the next victory."
The one stroke that decides the game will be the trigger for the recovery.

Minoru pig farming steadily progresses to brand pig, acquires JGAP (Daily Tohoku Shimbun) - Yahoo!News
Minoru Pig Farm (represented by Nakano Watari Minoru), which raises about 50,000 pigs a year on farms in Towada City and Rokunohe Town, visited Mayor Oyamada Hisashi at Towada City Hall on the 20th and reported that their farm has obtained JGAP (Livestock and Livestock Products) certification, which indicates the safety of agricultural and livestock products.
This is the second case of a pig farming business in the prefecture to be acquired.
The company is engaged in the production of "garlic pork," which uses powdered garlic from the prefecture as a special feed, and "locally raised pigs," which use rice from the prefecture.
This time, out of the five farms, Farm No. 5 (Rokunohe Town), which raises about 10,000 pigs and produces "local pigs," obtained JGAP certification.
The company aimed to obtain certification after learning that "certification is necessary to be selected by a major buyer" and that it was a condition for procuring ingredients for use in the Olympic Village at the Tokyo Olympics.
Since August of last year, with the support of Aomori Bank, preparations have been underway with bank staff qualified as JGAP instructors.
On March 3rd this year, it was reviewed by a certification body and passed a total of 113 standards, including food safety.
It was certified on the 13th of the same month.
The day's visit was attended by the company's president, Nakano Wataru Minoru, managing director, Nakano Wataru Dai, Aomori Bank's Towada Minami branch manager, Yamada Takeo, and the bank's corporate support department's business advisor, Ishigo Nobuhiro.
Mayor Oyamada cheered him on, saying, "It's great. I hope you will promote (the JGAP certification) to expand your sales channels."
Representative Nakano Watari Minoru expressed his enthusiasm, saying, "I would like to continue contributing to Towada City by making efforts to brand pig farming."
Managing Director Nakano Wataru said, "We are aiming to obtain certification for the remaining four farms," and stated his future goals.

(Se-League, Chunichi 1-0 Hanshin, 8th round, 4 wins, 4 losses, 25th, Nagoya D) Chunichi Takahashi Shuhei Uchinote (26), who had left the front line due to a muscle detachment in the back of his left thigh, appeared on the 25th as a substitute hit in the 7th inning, 1 death and 2nd base in the 8th round of Hanshin.
The result was nigoro.
Fukuda, who was in the lead, came out with a midfielder, and Ishikawa Takashi (Toho High School), who was in first place in D1, made a bunt in front of the pitch and made a chance to take the lead with one death and two bases.
This is the turn of the jersey number "3" who just got promoted on this day.
Chunichi fans crammed into the Nagoya Dome and cheered loudly.
As a result, he batted on the slider of Sai Isamu's first pitch, but with a minimum of work, he lost two games to third base, and Iryo hit a short-range infield hit in the first inning.
"Ideally I'd like to hit, but I'm happy because Iryo-san hit and scored for me," he said.
Originally, it was expected to take three to four weeks for him to return, but he returned at a speed of two full weeks.
Director Yoda also said, "I think (the condition) is about 70 to 80%. This is his own feeling, so it's like that in the part I'm watching, but I think it's a faster recovery than I expected. I didn't particularly care how I ran after hitting, and I think that if I get used to it gradually, the starter will be close."
Takahashi himself said, "I will get back what I left as soon as possible."
A reliable captain pushes the team up.
Heavy Rains Scar "Traffic" in Hokuen: National Route 152 closed for 10km, some sections of JR Iida Line closed | Shizuoka Newspaper @S
On the afternoon of the 22nd, National Route 152 was completely closed to traffic, and a line of cars waiting for a detour that alternates on one side = Ryuzan-cho, Tenryu-ku, Hamamatsu City (part of the photo has been processed)
The Tenryu area of Hamamatsu City was one of the hardest hit areas in Shizuoka Prefecture after heavy rains in July caused extensive damage to Kyushu and other parts of Japan.
The impact of the landslide remains on the main highway, National Route 152, and the JR Iida Line, which is the "foot of daily life," and many areas require time to be restored.
In addition to the inconvenience of daily life, residents are increasingly worried about the negative impact on their economic activities.
At the Sejiri Bridge, which crosses the Tenryu River in Ryuzan-cho, the same ward, there is a long queue of cars waiting to pass during the day.
The lead car remained parked for nearly 40 minutes.
National Route 152 is closed to traffic for about 10 kilometers, and a detour to the opposite bank of the Tenryu River is necessary to move around the town.
However, the width of the road is narrow, and the entire section is alternating on one side, so the waiting time is unpredictable.
In the same town, a landslide occurred on the national highway on the 9th, and traffic was closed due to the risk of falling rocks on the slopes nearby.
On the 13th, cracks were found in the Akiba Tunnel within the restricted section, and the timing of reopening to traffic has not yet been established.
In 2018, the town's national highway was closed to traffic due to a landslide, damaging residents' lives and tourism.
Tamamoto Kimie (76), the representative of the Dragon Mama processing plant, which sells specialty products, says, "The new coronavirus has overtaken customers while they have been away. The number of visitors has decreased significantly."
The JR Iida Line was interrupted between Mizukubo Station (Mizukubo-cho, the same ward) and Hiraoka Station (Nagano Prefecture) due to a slope collapse beside the track.
Ukai Shiori (16), who was attending Hamamatsuko Kitatakasakuma Branch School in Sakuma-cho, Hamamatsuko, from Oarashi Station (in the same town) in the out-of-service section, needed to pick up a car for about an hour one way.
"If it's a car, it's a heavy burden on both parents and myself," he said, hoping for an early recovery.
According to JR Central, it is expected to take about three months for the line to reopen, and from the 27th, a special train will be operated between Mizukubo Station and Oarashi Station on weekday mornings and evenings.
In Mizukubo-cho, landslides frequently occur on forest roads that also serve as living roads.
In some cases, detours can take several hours.
Kumagai Keiji (69), head of the Mizukubo Forestry Cooperative, said with a clouded expression, "The removal of logs has also been delayed. There are isolated islands on the land everywhere. I am worried about future rains."
Nakajima Shoya, is it your choice to miss the victory ceremony?
Local media coverage (football channel) - Yahoo!News
It seems that Nakajima Shoya, the midfielder representing Japan, is on his way to leaving Porto.
Portugal's "ZAP" reported it based on information from "Recordo."
Porto, who won the Portuguese league in the 2019/20 season, held a victory ceremony on the pitch during the final home game on the 20th of this month.
However, the fact that there was no Nakajima in this place has just become a hot topic.
Nakajima, who refused to join the team in training during the league suspension due to the new Coronavirus, has been absent ever since.
Under such circumstances, his absence from the championship ceremony has led to talk of a transfer this summer.
According to Recordo, Porto invited Nakajima to the ceremony.
However, it is said that Nakajima just did not show up.
As a result, it says, "Nakajima is increasingly out of Sergio Conceyson's plans for the next season, and he needs to leave the club in the next transfer window."
Although Nakajima was ranked 10th in a prestigious family in Portugal, he seems to have left the club after one year.
They may have already begun to search for a new world.

Forty-five percent of households have a wife holding a wallet!
Is my husband happy or unhappy?
Isn't there a wife who is thrilled or upset when her husband says, "This month's allowance is not enough ..."?
The family where this conversation can take place is the one where the wife holds the wallet.
How many families in the world have wives holding their wallets?
Also, let's take a look at the percentage of "married couple wallets" and "jointly managed wallets" together.
Who holds the household purse?
Matsui Securities Co., Ltd. conducted an online survey of 800 people nationwide, including 400 men and women in their 20s and 30s (young married couples) who have been married for three years or less, and 400 men and women in their 50s and 60s (mature married couples) who have been married for more than 30 years.
Who holds the household purse?
Wife: 45.0% Husband: 24.8% Families in which the wife manages the household budget were the most common.
Regardless of who manages it, there are twists and turns in household management, but it seems that there are various episodes.
My wife manages the household budget: In the case of Ms. A, Ms. A is a working mother from Alafif who has a daughter in the third grade of high school and a daughter in the first grade of high school.
Ms. A is in full control of the household budget.
As I was preparing for my university entrance exams, there were many months when my school fees were high and I was in the red, so I negotiated with my husband to lower my allowance, but as expected, I was resisted.
At that time, he asked me to show him what kind of income and expenditure I had, so I showed him my household account book.
Although all expenses should have been listed, it was not enough to make a loss when looking at the household account book.
My husband almost approached me and said, "It's enough," but Ako unexpectedly said, "Okay, I'm not strong enough in managing the household budget, so please take care of everything," and when she cuts off the omie, she will be sent back saying, "Please do it after all."
Later, when Ako interviewed her husband, he said, "Although I am dissatisfied with my allowance being managed, my real intention is that I don't have the time or the energy to manage various things in and out of the household budget (such as school materials and PTA expenses)."
Husband manages household budget: B child's case B child, a full-time housewife, manages her daily life after her husband gives her living expenses.
Last spring, the freezer part of the refrigerator broke down, so Bko asked her husband to buy a refrigerator.
However, my husband was reluctant to replace it, saying, "The freezer is not good, but the refrigerated part can still be used, so it's okay."
However, in the summer, her husband wanted to create an environment where he could eat ice cream anytime, so he turned his palm over and said, "Let's buy a refrigerator after all."
Then, B-ko unexpectedly complained to her friend, "My husband is stingy enough to be shy."
Kubo Takehide's transfer destination has been narrowed down to five clubs in Spain's first division (Higashi Sport Web) - Yahoo!News
It seems that Kubo Takehide (19), the Japanese midfielder who played for Mallorca in the Spanish First Division this season, is gradually narrowing down his transfer destination.
Although Mallorca was relegated to the second division, Kubo's reputation skyrocketed due to his performance at the end of the season.
However, due to the fact that they are outside the EU, it will be difficult for them to return to Real Madrid, who have the "right to own" the club, so they plan to play for another club next season.
He has already received offers from around 30 clubs, but R Madrid plans to train him as a warrior at a club in the country.
According to the Spanish newspaper Marca, first division clubs such as Real Sociedad, Villarreal, Granada, Getafe and Betis are likely to be Kubo's transfer destinations, and "five clubs are interested in acquiring him, but R Madrid want a club that ranks above the middle of the league."
Among them, Villarreal and R Sociedad will qualify for the Europa League (EL) next season, and Granada will also participate from the second round of EL qualifying, which will meet the team requirements of R Madrid.

At the Ichijodani Asakura Clan Ruins in Fukui City, a total of 53 rockets, 2-4 balls, were launched for about two minutes while the surrounding mountains were covered in haze.
The karamon gate and other structures were illuminated by fireworks in the dark night, creating a fantastic atmosphere.
