Full Cut Reports (CanCam.jp) - Yahoo!News
Add layers to the heavy semi-long and fluffy hair.
Honoka of the CanCam model challenges the hair style with movement like Minami Tanaka, who has a longing for "It's beautiful, of course, but I'm very professional and I respect it!"
I asked Mitsuteru Asahi of "SUNVALLY," a hair salon in Omotesando, who is actually working on the haircut of Minami Tanaka, to make it "Minami Real-style Hair."
Report on the cut process!
Nogizaka 46 Mitsuki Yamashita, became short hair and the first cover!
First, check the hair of the cheek before the cut.
It is thin, soft, and many.
There is a habit, especially in the rainy season, it gets rough, so it is also possible to apply straight perm.
It is a heavy semi-long with the front hair.
Finally, the cut is started!
In order to make it easier to cut, first lightly wet the whole.
After that, separate the top of the bee (the top part of the head above the surrounding area) and cut from the bottom.
By the way, here is the point of hair that brings everyone closer to Sane!
1 Table Bang By shortening the inner part of the bang slightly, you can enjoy the change depending on the styling, such as being slightly thick when you lower it full, and being able to see through the skin if you separate it lightly.
2 Cuts that make use of the habit If the amount of hair is reduced too much, it may spread out.
While consulting about the balance around it, it is easy to handle and it is difficult to spread, and keep the balance as if your own swell lives.
3 Layers and blisters around the face Layer = cut with a step difference.
Putting layers around your face makes it easier to move, making it cute.
If you make your hair in three places, before and behind Komekami and Momiage, it will look fashionable even when you put it in a lump.
When the hair on the bees is cut together, the hair on the bees is cut.
Pull out the hair bundle of the upper part around the face in front and cut the hair tip a little bit.
This way, when the hair bundle is lowered, the step difference is attached and it becomes easier to move (this is the layer cut).

Butler once again praised Tyler Hero, a young warrior who is responsible for the future of the heat "Thinking is not that of the rookie" - Yahoo!
Photo = Getty Images The first game of the scrimmage (practice game) of the heat is a match against the Kings.
In the 104-98 win, Duncan Robinson scored 18 points on Team High, Tyler Hero scored 15 points on Team High, and the backcourt were successful.
Robinson is one of the top shooters in the league, and the 13th overall draft pick, rookie, and hero step-up are important elements for Heat.
Hero missed 15 games between February and March due to ankle injury, and the season ended with a long break after a return match against the Hornets on 12 March.
Hero said, "I was able to regain 100% of my condition because I had plenty of time, and I feel like I'm the best I've ever felt," but the creative performance was more convincing than the words.
Due to the late arrival of Kendrick Nan, the starting point guard, the hero's playing time increased and the chance was taken advantage of.
It is worth it because it is 15 points after performing a different role than usual well.
Team leader Jimmy Butler once again praised the heroes of Favorites.
"He can also be a handler, he can score, he can defend, he can do everything for the team, he can do everything for the team, he can't do any position because his way of thinking is not that of a rookie, he sees and studies the footage, his teammates are free to move, and he's thinking about what he should do to it."
Prior to the season's opening, Butler likes the unbeatable strength of the hero's rookies, and the stoic stance of basketball.
That's why I invited him to practice individually at the start of the morning at 4 a.m.
Butler once said, "He says his opinion to everyone, he does not withdraw, he can respect that kind of struggle."
It's the kind of thing that Butler always talks about, and if he thinks it's for the team, he's got a tough opinion knowing that the collision will happen.
In the past, the relationship with the teammates had deteriorated.
Butler must have been a hero in his youth.
The character of Butler, sometimes too harsh for teammates, is a good guide for those who have guts to come about it.
If the relationship between the two teachers and students who respect each other spreads to the whole team, the heat will become a team that can aim even higher.

MacDonald's first goal was to move the ball to the left in the first round of the game.
"If I lost three years, I would retire immediately, and I wanted to beat and win."
Itsuki, who was in fourth position last autumn, was very proud of her.
The fight lasted three to three years, and lasted two years.
Ikeda gathered the players at the meeting and told Nine, "I've been here for three years, and I'll be the best player in the future."
On that day, four of the nine members of the stamen consolidated their main axis in two years.
It appears to be ruthless, but it is proof that he is committed to serious competition.
He said, "I'm going to go back to the next level and I'm going to go back home."
Saito, who had been in a series of pitches, did not even hit second base with a good pitch that kept him down to one hit six times, and gave him a three-year advantage.
The number 10 received positive feedback as a synergistic effect, saying, "I will be stimulated for three years by coming out of two years, and if I can lead to victory."
The team that aims to reach 4th place in the third consecutive year, together with the Shizuoka tournament until last year, will not make the rest of the game memorable.

The song was released on YouTube on October 24.
The name of the song is "Pray from Fukushima."
I put people's positive attitude on a cheerful and energetic melody with the thought of "I want to tell you from Fukushima."
Due to the new Corona, the live house was forced to close, and many musicians lost their place to sing and perform.
The project was planned by Nappo (46), a singer-songwriter living in Minamisoma City, and DAZU-O (37) of the Mehikari Boys, a music group in Iwaki City, to believe in the power of music.
Nappo is in charge of the lyrics and composition, and Dazo is in charge of the rap.
When the project started in March of the coronal disaster, singer-songwriters Manami (28) and Jun Sugano (38) from Fukushima City agreed with the project one after another, and the circle spread quickly.
Mr. Nappo says, "I want to enjoy this opportunity to the fullest because I have become a gorgeous face that I can not think of in normal life."
In order to prevent infection, there were no opportunities for sixteen people to gather, and each of them recorded at live houses and homes.
In order to support the project, Koa, a painter from Iwaki City, drew down the image character.
It represents the rich natural climate with blue and green in the shape of Fukushima Prefecture.
The finished song is transmitted to the world on YouTube and aims to be CD.
Next year is the tenth year since the earthquake, and the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games will be postponed.
Dazuo said, "It's great that we have overcome difficulties, and I hope that by releasing the song at a turning point, we can encourage many people."
The other musicians were as follows.

[Picture] Specialized teams judge the authenticity of social media information by alerting from the perspective
Today, the first way people know about disasters and accidents is shifting from television to online information (social media).
Social media, such as Twitter, is an important medium to communicate information immediately after a disaster or accident.
However, it is difficult to watch the overflowing information at all times and extract useful information from it.
Specty has the ability to detect and analyze natural disasters and accidents from information flowing through social media such as Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, determine the authenticity of the information, and then distribute it to the user company.
"A wide range of negative impact events that cause social activities to stop or stagnate are positioned as "crisis"" (Kenjiro Murakami, CEO) This crisis management support service visualizes various crises occurring in Japan and overseas.
NHK was the first large-scale use case of Specti during the Kumamoto Earthquake in April 2016, and thereafter the recruitment movement spread rapidly among companies.
In addition to news agencies such as television stations and newspapers, more than 350 companies in Japan, including companies that support social infrastructure such as electricity, gas and transportation, and local governments all over the country, are currently using the spectrum.
Analyze posts to determine the type and location of "crisis"
Specty distributes information in four steps: "Collection of Information," "Analysis and Classification of Contents," "Titleing," and "Fake Judgment."
The companies that use the information must specify in advance the regions (prefectures, municipal towns, villages, etc.) that collect information, and categories of crises (disasters, accidents, etc.).
Specty uses the API provided by social media to collect posts that fall under the designation.
Next, analyze and classify the text, images, and videos contained in the collected posts.
For example, if there is a video showing a fire truck, black smoke rising from the building, and orange flames coming out of the room, it is classified as a "fire."
In addition, the image of a rolling car is classified as "car accident" and the image of a road covered with water is classified as "road water."
Species also estimate the location of disasters and accidents.
"We often don't know where the posts are, so we use a combination of different information to estimate them," Murakami says.
For example, if a road sign or a sign is reflected in an image or video, the information of the place name is extracted from it, and the location is identified by matching it with the place name database.

"Zulu Mix" which means "crossing" was used in a conversation with a friend of a university (Tokyo), and it was made a Kyoton for a moment.
I was able to understand the meaning by the flow and the sense of language, but the people of Tokyo and Saitama Prefecture told me that they didn't use it.

Because it seems to be connected to it, it seems that you can guess the meaning without anything.

Japan's "hiyashi chuka" won't be Chinese ... ?
"Cold Noodle Cooking" Unpopular Wake (Contemporary Business) - Yahoo!
In China, chilled Chinese noodles are "Japanese cold noodles."
As I mentioned at the beginning, chilled Chinese is a Chinese food (日式中華) originated in Japan, which was invented based on the Chinese "cooling surface (Lang Bangmien / chilled mixed soba).
Therefore, it originally does not exist in China, but due to the diversification of food, it has come to be seen in Japanese restaurants in summer.
Recently, at convenience stores in Japan, there are also arranged products named "Nishiki Soba Ryomen/Soba Hiyashi Chuka" and "Kawakodori Shi Ryomen/Sichuan-style Chiyashi Chuka."
On the other hand, the popularity of Japanese-style Chinese cuisine in China is not high on the whole, because it is pushed by popular Chinese cuisine such as Sichuan cuisine and Hunan cuisine.
Naturally, the flavor of Japanese-style Chinese is often familiar to Chinese people.
Therefore, it is not bad, but if the impact is poor, it tends to be criticized badly.
"Hiroshi Chinese" is not an exception, and it is still a minor presence in China.
By the way, the name of chilled Chinese in China is "Sun-style cold noodles."
Chinese people are recognized as one of the Japanese cuisine.
The summer's standard is "Ryanpi."
In China, when it comes to noodle dishes that feel summer, it is probably "Ryanpi."
In Japan, there are many people who are not familiar with it, but the cool skin is flat noodles made from flour, rice flour, starch, etc. which originated in Shanxi Province.
It is said that it has a history of 2000 years.
It is a standard B-class gourmet that is sold at stalls, and the price is very reasonable around 10-20 yuan (150-300 yen).
It contains the word 'ryo' (cool), but it does not make it ice like Japanese chilled Chinese.
It is rather warm.
On top of the noodles, it is topped with favorite ingredients such as sliced cucumbers, carrots, boiled bean sprouts, and added medicinal flavors such as Pak Chi, chili pepper, ginger and garlic.
Finally, it is finished with special seasoning mixed with soy sauce, chili oil, vinegar, sesame paste, peanut paste, etc.
The noodles are well pulled through the throat, and the sourness is refreshing and rich and spicy sauce is well intertwined, and even when it is hot in summer and there is no appetite, it gets into the noodles.
In addition, because it has spread throughout China, there are various toppings and seasonings, and the rich variety of toppings and seasonings is one of the characteristics of ryoshu, and it is one of the ways to enjoy it.

Benefits of Cold Water Shower in the Body and Mind (Cosmopolitan) - Yahoo!
it reduces inflammation, such as muscle pain
A study published in The North American Journal of Medical Sciences, investigating the effectiveness of hydrotherapy, found that it could be effective in physical and mental healing.
By taking cold water after exercise, muscle pain and other inflammatory effects can be reduced.
According to Professor Douglas Casa, head of the Korey Stringer Institute, a sports medicine research institute and a professor at the University of Connecticut, "It is important to exercise and take a cold water shower as soon as possible.After moving your body, lowering your body temperature immediately will help you recover from inflammation and fatigue caused by exercise."
and reduce fatigue.
When you exercise in high temperatures, your heart, muscles and skin will need more blood flow than usual.
"During exercise, the higher the heart rate, the more blood flow into the heart, the more energy it takes to contract the muscles, the more muscle blood flow increases, and the more blood flows in the skin to regulate body temperature," says Professor Casa.
"The cold water shower reduces the temperature of the skin and reduces the flow of blood that is sent to the skin; instead, the blood flow is sent to the internal organs such as the stomach and intestines, which makes it easier for moisture and nutrition to take in after exercise, which results in less fatigue after exercise."
i'm looking forward to the holmysis effect.
Drozevsky also explains that the "holmysis effect" can be expected to be activated by taking in cold water.
Holmysis effect is the idea that substances and stress that are harmful to the body should be a little more than nothing at all.
"Low oxygen movement, Petit fasting, and cold water showers are representative examples of health formalism: cold water showers stimulate hormones and neurotransmitters to increase physical and physical resilience and recovery."

Statue of Masujiro OMURA in Casting Zenji [Yamaguchi] Revealed as an educator | Ube Daily Media Web
A bronze statue of Masujiro OMURA (1825-1969), who was one of the ten outstanding figures of the Meiji Restoration, was visible on the 23rd at his birthplace, Yamaguchi City.
A unveiling ceremony was held in the front garden of the regional exchange center of the minting agency, and local and administrative officials celebrated the completion of the ceremony.

"I want to make it possible for people who are not interested in art to enter" (Representative Konno) From the thought, you can feel as if you are in the picture.
Art and art meet when he was in elementary school.
At that time, when I visited the newly completed Aomori Museum of Art with my family, I saw three huge pictures of "Aleco" by Marc Chagall, and I was shocked by the power of it.
From the next day, art classes changed into a fun time, and after going to Tokyo on the occasion of going to university, he began to visit galleries.
At the same time, I also felt that there are many people who do not have much opportunity to interact with art from various perspectives, such as the fact that there are not many museums nearby and large exhibitions are only held in the Tokyo metropolitan area, and it is difficult to go out due to childcare.
So, while working at an IT affiliate, for about two months, we launched a site where you can view art on the Internet.
The number of users reached an average of 10,000 a month in the first 10 months, and increased to about 30,000 after the spread of the new corona.
When you want to see any person, you can appreciate the art freely.
Asa's aim was accepted by more and more people as a result of the Corona disaster.
Mr. Konno emphasized that the significance of the art appreciation will enrich the imagination.
"When your imagination becomes rich, you can reach out to the people in need."
I want art to become a better society by becoming closer."
A Simple Reason for the End of the Era of Chinese Quality and the Era of Japanese Quality (Contemporary Business) - Yahoo!
it's a pandemic, a shift in values.
Various predictions and discussions about the after-pandemic world are taking place.
On the business side, there is a possibility that the change mentioned in the July 8 article, "In fact, the work of "management" is now disappearing in Japan ...! That cruel reality" and the July 4 article, "In the world of "After the Corona," there is a possibility that "Japan's manufacturing industry is likely to revive ... !."
[Picture] The true identity of the "strength of Japan" that only Japanese people do not know ... surprising reality seen in Asia
In terms of mentality, it seems that the mainstream trend is going to be the article on June 26, "The Knowledge of Complete Combustion" given to people who have become conscious of the end of life in the corona," and the article on June 10, "Corona, let's reconsider the utility of "God's request in times of hardship" now filled with riots."
And the major trend of "from Chinese quality to Japanese quality" is that these two "materials (economic and business) " and "spirits" seem to be clearly visible in our eyes as combinations.
For example, if there is a defect or defect in a T-shirt or digital camera, it is disgusting, but there is no separate clause in the life of the person who purchased.
On the other hand, the remarkable quality of Chinese masks and artificial respirators that have recently been talked about ... "Chinese quality" in products directly linked to life and safety is fatal.
No matter how cheap it is, you can't buy such products.
Even if you pay a considerable price, you will seek "Japanese quality" products.
Of course, this trend is not happening in Japan alone.
It is also clear that Europe and the United States, which faced difficulties due to lack of masks and medical equipment, continued to "return" one after another due to the high degree of "Chinese quality."
it's safer and safer than it's cheap.
In addition, products such as automobiles can cause fatal defects.
No matter how many countries, including China and South Korea, have launched an offensive in the cheap sales strategy of "Let's make it cheap or evil," they can't compete with Japanese manufacturing in the end.
This pandemic reminded me of the need for "security and security" in many other goods.
In addition, security and safety are important not only in "Japanese quality in manufacturing," but also in "Japanese quality in services such as logistics."
Like the Toilet Paper Disturbance, although the production capacity is well-established, intermediate distribution may be delayed and cannot be reached.
Furthermore, as in an article on April 17, "Who is the real culprit behind the mask shortage!Don't allow fire-crackers of the Communist Party of China government," I keenly realized that self-sufficiency in Japan is also an important element of "security and security."
Every country has its own priority when it comes to emergency situations, and it is very important to be able to procure necessary goods such as masks (medical equipment) and food in its own country.
More than 100 coronal infections in South Korea have been reported for the first time in 115 days.
According to Yonhap News, the number of new coronavirus infections increased by 113 from 0 a.m. the previous morning to 14,092, according to South Korea's Central Anti-Defection Prevention and Prevention Headquarters.
The number of new infections per day exceeded 100, the first in 115 days since April 1, 101.
In addition to the fact that 32 Russian sailors had been infected by Russian ships entering Busan Port, 32 of the 293 workers who had returned from Iraq on the 24th were confirmed as positive.
The number of new infections in South Korea was between 30 and 60, except for 20 days.
Of the new infections announced on the 25th, 86 have entered the country from abroad, the highest number since 20 January when the first infection occurred in Korea.
Thirty-six people came from Iraq, 34 from Russia, five from the Philippines, and three from the United States.
On the other hand, there were 27 people infected in the city, 11 in Seoul and Kyogido respectively, and 5 in Busan.
Five of Busan's men were employees of a Russian ship repair company.
The death toll remained unchanged from the previous day, with a total of 298.
Nagoya and Miyahara are corona positive soccer J1, the first after the league restart | Shizuoka Shimbun at es
Nagoya, Japan's national football team, announced on February 25, that it had confirmed that the new coronavirus had been tested positive by Japanese footballer Kazuya Miyahara (24).
This is the first time a player's positive response has been made since the J-League resumed.
He is the third player to have played for the club, following the infected FW Yumeo Kanazaki (31) in June and Australian GK Mitchell Langerak (31).
Both men were treated and returned to the match.
This season, Miyahara entered the bench on the 22nd in a major battle of J1.
Nagoya held a press conference online on the 25th and announced that it had conducted a PCR test on the same day against 60 athletes and staff.
98 percent reflection.
It turns out that white paint derived from the frying pan of Teflon processing, and heat insulation will increase the cooling effect!
no way!
This year's rainy season was marked by an unprecedented amount of rainfall, but in the light of the day, the hot summer will become full-scale.
It's hot and hot, and it's so hot that even the air conditioner doesn't work...
Global warming is a major global issue, and mankind has narrowed down the wisdom of how to overcome the hot summer as much as possible comfortably.
One way to do it is to wear a thin, white robe.
You don't have to wear black clothes to absorb heat in summer, do you?
The same principle is applied to the construction of houses, and the number of cases using white paint is increasing.
Even if white is white, it may not be possible to make paints that reflect more light and do not absorb heat, or that is the latest research field.
The Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and colleagues from the Department of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics at Columbia University have recently announced that they have found a method of mixing white paints that can most effectively repel solar heat and increase the cooling effect inside the building.
We are aiming for the early practical application.
Up to now, white paints with the highest reflectivity of sunlight have been made using titanium oxide, which has a reflectivity of 85%.
The white paint, which uses titanium oxide, is already applied to roofs of buildings in high-temperature environments, and is used to cut off solar heat and increase air conditioning efficiency.
However, the newly discovered white paint is derived from the fluorine resin of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), which is used in the teflon-processed frying pan.
It is a white paint that uses the Teflon effect, and it is said that it can significantly cut heat by reflecting sunlight to nearly 98 percent.
Even in the hot summer, thanks to the white paint using teflon unexpectedly, it is easy to spend indoors without being exposed to the heat.
Such an era might come close, right?
I feel that the roof of a Japanese house has many dark colors, but from now on, white type will become mainstream?
When is Amazon's annual large sale this year?
On July 21, CNBC reported that Amazon.com had announced the postponement of its annual large-scale sale, Prime Day, to be postponed.
It is held every year in July, but it is said that this year it is forced to postpone due to the expansion of the new coronavirus infection.
■ Public Relations Officer, "The details will be announced soon" Amazon Public Relations Officer said in a statement.
"Prime Day has become a special celebration we've been looking forward to over the past five years, and this year we'll be holding it later than usual, ensuring employee safety and supporting our customers and exhibitors."
However, he stated that "the details will be announced soon" and did not reveal the specific date.
On the other hand, we decided to hold the event in India.
Press releases are posted on the country's website.
It will be held for 48 hours from midnight on August 6.
Until now, Prime Day has been held at the same time around the world, but this year it might take extraordinary measures.
Large event with sales of 76 billion yen in two days Amazon launched a large sale for its members in 2015 as a measure to promote sales in the summer when sales decrease.
Originally it was a 24-hour event, but it expanded year by year. Last year, the event was held in 18 countries including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, India, Japan, China and Australia for 48 hours from midnight on July 15th.
According to the company last year, sales for two days exceeded previous sales for Black Friday (the first day of the year-end business) and Cyber Monday (the next Monday).
This event also contributed to the acquisition of new subscribers for paid members "Prime," and last year, the number of applications for the first day was the largest in the past, followed by the number of applications for the next day.
Last year, 175 million items were sold worldwide.
According to Internet Retailer, the global total sales for the two days were $7.16 billion, up 70 percent from the previous year.
Strict eyes for mobile number migration and excessive keeping.
What about commissions and points?
New Switch - Yahoo!
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) is making full-scale efforts to review the migration system (MNP) for mobile communication companies that can use conventional telephone numbers as they are when changing their telephone numbers.
At the meeting of experts on the 21st, they announced a policy to revise the guidelines for MNPs established in 2004.
Specific issues range from how MNP fees should be handled and whether or not they should be withdrawn from the service.
Reflections from telecommunications companies are expected, and attention is focused on whether they can promote sound market competition.
At the beginning of 2006, when MNP was introduced, the user fee was 2,000 yen, but now it is 3,000 yen.
The MNP fee income of the three major mobile communications companies is estimated at 15.9 billion yen per year.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) listed the current status of MNP in the "WG Working Group on Validation of Competitive Rules" meeting of experts discussing the competitive environment in the telecommunications market on February 21.
The time required for the issuance of the MNP reservation number required for consumers to transfer to other telecommunications companies was also listed in the list.
Major telecommunications companies accept it on the web, but due to the convenience of operation of the core system, the acceptance time is mainly 9-20 o'clock.
The WG documents clearly stated that the direction of future consideration should be based on the principle of full-day response.
It is also problematic for mobile communication companies to give points to those who wish to transfer at MNP.
It is judged that excessive restraint could inhibit fair competition.
Shunichi Kita, a partner of Nomura Research Institute (NRI), who is a member of the WG, suggests that "It is important to thoroughly implement this process first, by issuing a number immediately to users who do not grant permission, whether they have time to explain the provision of economic benefits or obtain permission from the user."
However, in a series of issues, there is a structural problem called "The higher the MNP fee, the more difficult it will be for customers to flow out, the less motivation to actively lower it" (in charge of MIC).
If a company lowers the MNP fee at the initiative, there is a concern that the company's customer outflow will increase, and corporate efforts will not be rewarded.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications has pointed out that many countries overseas do not require user fees for MNPs, and it is possible that this will happen in Japan.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) would like to compile the results of the WG as a report around September-October, and then begin the procedure for the revision of the MNP Guidelines.
The date of the revision is expected to be after 21.
Mobile telecommunications companies are likely to worry about sales and customer support as well.

Detected Ferrari 26 years ago is found at the bottom of the river to work without a return (octane.jp) - Yahoo!
In 1994, the Ferrari Mondial was stolen in the Netherlands.
The time passed without the police being able to solve it, but 26 years later, it was miraculously discovered.
Ferrari found at the bottom of the river (4 photos) It was diving training of the fire department that triggered the discovery.
On 8 July, a trained diver discovered something of a wedge shape that sinks to the bottom of the river, and the police and the Dutch army were also in motion.
By matching the VIN number with the stolen car database, it was possible to associate the Ferrari with the 1994 case.
The car was handed over to the insurance company, the legal owner of the car, and then sent to the scrapper.
The scrapper Lowie van DE Ooyevaar said, "There are still some remaining parts, but it's for the art of decorating, and we've already received a lot of requests from people who want to make tables from disassembled mondials, using engine blocks and glass plates."
For the time being, there were no specific sales plans, and scrap dealers would store them as objects.

National Route 152 is closed to all traffic, and a line of cars waiting for a detour of one side alternating traffic = 22 pm, Tatsuyama-cho, Tenryu-ku, Hamamatsu City (part of the photo is processed)
The Tenryu area in Hamamatsu City, which was devastated by heavy rains in July, which caused tremendous damage to Kyushu and other parts of Japan, was also heavily affected in Shizuoka Prefecture.
The impact of landslide disasters remains on the JR Iida Line of the National Route 152 and the 'A foot of life' of the main road, and many places require time to recover.
In addition to the inconvenience of daily life, residents are concerned about the adverse effects on economic activity.
The Sejiri Bridge across the Tenryu River in Ryuzan-cho, the ward, has a long line of cars waiting for traffic during the daytime.
The front car remained at the station for nearly 40 minutes.
U.S. Route 152 is completely closed for about 10 km, and a bypass to the other side of the Tenryu-gawa River is necessary for the town to move.
However, the width of the road is narrow, and the whole section is cross-sectional, and waiting time is unpredictable.
On the 9th, a landslide occurred on the national highway, and the road was closed due to the danger of falling rocks on the nearby slopes.
On the 13th, cracks were found in the Akiba tunnel within the regulation section, and the timing of the resumption of traffic has not yet been reached.

"If it is a car, both parents and myself have a large burden," he hopes for early recovery.
According to JR Tokai, it is expected that it will take about three months to resume operations, and from the 27th, a special train will run between Mizukubo Station and Oarashi Station, one by one, in the morning and evening of the day.
A number of landslides occur along the forest road, which also serves as a living road, in the town of Minakubo.
In some cases, it takes several hours to bypass.
Keiji Kumagai (69), head of the Mizukubo-cho Forest Union, clouded his expression, saying, "The trees are still being brought out, and there are isolated islands of land everywhere, and we are worried about the rain in the future."
Shoya Nakajima, is it your choice to be absent from the winning ceremony?
Local media coverage - Yahoo!
It seems that Shoya NAKAJIMA, the representative of Japan, is heading towards the departure of Porto.
The Portuguese "ZAP" was based on information from Le Cord.
Porto, who won the Portuguese League in the 2019/20 season, held a pitching ceremony at the home final on the 20th of the month.
However, the fact that there was no Nakajima in this place was a hot topic.
Nakajima, who refused to join the team practice during the suspension of the league due to the new Corona virus, continued to miss it.
However, due to the absence of a winning ceremony, the transfer of this summer is being made.
According to Le Cord, Porto called Nakajima for the ceremony.
However, it is said that Nakajima did not show himself.
As a result, "Nakajima is more and more out of Sergio Conseison's plans for the next season, and we need to leave the club in the next transfer market."
Although Nakajima carried the No. 10 in the famous Portuguese gate, he seems to have a strong departure in one year.
