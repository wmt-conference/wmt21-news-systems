Honoka becomes [Tanaka Minami's style hair]!
Report on the full picture of the cut (CanCam.jp) - Yahoo!News
Add a layer to the heavy semi-long [all real wind] for fluffy hair
CanCam model Honoka admires, "Not only is she beautiful, but she has a very high level of professionalism and I respect her!" and challenged her hairstyle with movement like Tanaka Minami.
I asked Asahi Mitsuteru of the hair salon "SUNVALLY" in Omotesando, who actually handles Tanaka Minami's haircut, to make it "everyone's real style hair".
Let's report on the cutting process!
Nogizaka 46 Yamashita Mitsuki, her first cover with short hair!
First of all, check the faint hair before the cut.
Thin, soft and plentiful.
I have a habit, and I sometimes apply a straight perm because it gets bumpy, especially during the rainy season.
It is a heavy semi-long with sink bangs.
Finally, the cut starts!
To make it easier to cut, first lightly wet the whole.
After that, the top of the bee (the part above the most protruding perimeter of the head) is separated and cut from the bottom.
By the way, here are the key points of hair that brings you closer to Minami!
1Table bang By making the inside of the bangs slightly shorter, you can enjoy changes depending on the styling, such as slightly thicker when you lower it full, and see-through when you divide it lightly.
2 Cut that makes use of habits If you have a multi-haired habit, if you reduce the amount of hair too much, it may spread remarkably.
While consulting about the balance around that, it is easy to handle but difficult to spread, and maintains a balance that allows one's own swells to live.
3 Layers around the face and fluffy hair layers = cuts with steps.
Putting a layer around the face makes it easier to move, giving it a cute finish.
If you make the fluffy hair in three places: the temple, the front and the back of the miage, it will look stylish even when you quickly put it together.
When you cut the hair on the bee that has been separated, it will be around the face.
Pull out the upper part of the hair bundle around the face forward and cut the tip of the hair.
This way, when the hair bundle is lowered, there will be steps, making it easier to move (this is the layer cut).

Governor Yoshimura to "partner with Gurunavi" against Corona (Sankei Sports) - Yahoo!News
Osaka Governor Yoshimura Hirofumi (45) appeared remotely from the prefectural office on Osaka's ABC TV "Cast" (Monday to Friday, March 48) on the 20th, and revealed that he is considering partnering with the restaurant information website "Gurunavi" as part of measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus infection.
Since the beginning of this month, Osaka Prefecture has issued "Declaration of Infection Prevention Stickers" to businesses that comply with the guidelines in order to promote efforts to prevent the spread of infection and provide peace of mind to the citizens of the prefecture.
However, only 1100 stickers have been issued in the prefecture, which is said to be more than 120,000 restaurants alone.
Therefore, Governor Yoshimura declared, "I'm thinking of doing it at the end of the month, but we will partner with Gurunavi and others to issue a declaration sticker when making a reservation so that it can be understood at the reservation stage," declaring a tag with the internet reservation site.
He said, "The important thing is not to put it all together as a "town at night."We should clearly divide the restaurants that are taking measures to combat infectious diseases and those that don't. It's also important to make efforts to increase the number of restaurants that do it."

Taneichi, Lotte's fourth year after graduating from high school, is the first professional to complete it!
4th Yasuda V hit, Toritani hit 2 points (Baseball King) - Yahoo!News
Seibu 0-5 Lotte ○ <10th round, MetLife Dome< At Lotte, the start-up, Taneichi Atsuki, threw 136 balls nine times by himself, and in his fourth year, he was happy to complete his first professional.
He scored his third win with the best ride in the Pa League this season, and stopped the team's consecutive losses at 2.
For the first time, Taneichi allowed the lead Suzuki Shohei to go to base with a double run defeating the third base track, but immediately after that, he defeated Genda Sosuke with three rumbles, and during this time Suzuki Masashi, who was aiming to advance to the base, also touched out at third base.
He was also helped by the calm response of his ally defense, and when he made it through the pinch of standing up at zero, he was at the mercy of the Seibu batting line with a combination of sliders and forks centered on his proud straight from the second round onwards.
Raise your hips and arrange the zeros on the scoreboard.
The batting line was struggling to hit the opponent's start, Honda Keisuke, but Kanno Takeshi, 3rd in the lead seven times, went to base in four balls, and Oka Omi, the substitute, succeeded in stealing two.
Taking this opportunity, 4th Yasuda Naonori hit a right front strike with a value of 1,000 money, and finally broke the equilibrium.
Then, in the next eight innings, he attacked his opponent in 3rd place, Miyagawa Tetsu, and scored four points at once, including a two-point hit in the middle left for the first time since Toritani Takashi, who was competing on the way, transferred.
They folded it up as if pushing the back of Marines' young ace candidate, and decided on the game at once.
Taneichi cleaned up eight times with a three-way retreat, and played nine times in a row, exceeding 100 balls.
"I worked hard" led to a pinch of two-death bases in four balls in a row, but at the end, he took the tenth strike of the day with a high straight from Spangenberg, and the game set.
He chewed his joy with a smile.
Bye-bye Tsuruoka Station raises safety awareness in cooperation with related organizations in an accident in a new operation|Yamagata Newspaper
At the bicycle class held as the start of the operation, a collision test between a car and a bicycle was conducted at Shoko Gakuen Automobile Training School in Tsuruoka City
In recent years, Tsuruoka Police Station (Chief Sato Keizo) has started "Operation Zero By-Buy Accidents" in order to eliminate accidents involving bicycles and motorcycles, which have a high proportion of accidents occurring within the jurisdiction.
In addition to raising awareness of accident prevention with traffic safety organizations within the jurisdiction, they will strengthen the crackdown on violations of traffic rules on bicycles.
Three traffic fatal accidents occurred within the department's jurisdiction this year, and a person who was driving a motorcycle or bicycle died.
Although the number of accidents has been on a decreasing trend, the rate of accidents involving bicycles was about 11.7% as of June 30th and about 5.8% related to motorcycles, both of which are higher than the prefectural average.
In particular, the incidence of bicycle accidents over the past five years has often exceeded the prefectural average, and a strategy was planned to overcome this situation.
The name of the operation was multiplied by "bike" and "bicycle" with the meaning of eradicating accidents.
Affiliated organizations will be asked to provide driving guidance to the elderly and use of luminous reflective materials at traffic safety classes more than ever before.
The department issues a yellow card (guidance warning form) when cracking down, etc., and encourages caution.
The opening ceremony for the operation was held on the 21st at the Sho Kogakuen Automobile Training School in Tsuruoka.
Approximately 30 people involved attended, and Chief Sato said, "I would like to ask for your cooperation to reduce the number of tragic accidents as much as possible."
A person in charge of the department presented the policy and the activities of each organization.
As the start of the operation, a bicycle class was held.
We demonstrated how the impact on a bicycle differs between when a police officer in a car collides with a bicycle by applying a brake and when it collides at a speed of about 55 km/h without stepping on the brake.
Kaneuchi Koichi, chairman of the Tsuruoka Regional Traffic Safety Activity Promotion Committee, said, "I realized once again the horror of traffic accidents. I would like to call attention not only to the elderly but also to young people."

On the 25th, a regular yose was held for the first time in five months at the public yose "Comedy Akasakatei" (Sobun, Akaiwa City), which had been closed due to the new coronavirus.
Kaminarimon Kisuke (75), a rakugo storyteller based in Akasakatei, and others invited visitors to laughter with their professional storytelling.
At the request of a vassal who was ordered by the lord to prohibit alcohol, Kisuke performed a "prohibited sake banya" in which a liquor store trying to bring in alcohol interacts with the gatekeeper in a comical manner.
There was laughter over and over again at the crispy way of speaking and the gesture of drinking deliciously.
A male office worker (58) from Naka-ku, Okayama, who visited with a couple, said with a smile, "The way of speaking and intervals were exquisite, and I was immediately drawn in."
Kisuke said, "It was my first performance in a long time and my voice wasn't in good condition, but it was a fulfilling time."
Guest rakugo storyteller Katsura Kodome (31), Osaka City, and the magic group Tsuyama Magic Club also appeared.
Comedy Akasakatei opened in 1996 in the former Akasaka-cho as the first public vaudeville theater in Japan.
They continued to hold regular vaudeville theaters and delivery vaudeville theaters once a month, but due to the influence of the new corona, the vaudeville theater was canceled after the last performance in February this year.
Unprecedented protests against the governor's detention for 15 consecutive days in the Russian Far East, leading to the government | Shizuoka Newspaper @S

[Moscow Kyodo] A demonstration was held on site on the 25th protesting the detention and dismissal of Governor Hulgar in the Russian Far East Khabarovsk region.
This marks the 15th consecutive day of the demonstration, which is an unusual situation.
The forefront of criticism is also directed at Putin.
In the capital city of Moscow, the security authorities have not always taken measures to detain them all at once, and the administration's cautious stance of giving due consideration to the sentiment of the residents is blurred.
Former governor Hulgar, who belongs to the far-right Liberal Democratic Party, won an overwhelming victory as an incumbent candidate for Putin's ruling party "Unified Russia" in the gubernatorial election in 2018, with a voting rate of about 70%.
Although he was one of the few non-ruling governors in Russia, he was detained by security authorities on the 9th of this month.
The suspicion was announced that he was involved in two murders of a businessman between 2014 and 2005.

Butler once again praises Tyler Hero, a young warrior who will be responsible for the future of the heat "The way of thinking is not that of a rookie" (basket count) - Yahoo!News
Photo by Getty Images Heat scrimmage (practice match) In the first game, they played against the Kings.
In this match, which won 104-98, Duncan Robinson scored 18 goals in the team high, followed by Tyler Hero scored 15 goals, and the backcourt played an active role.
In addition to Robinson, one of the best shooters in the league, stepping up the rookies and heroes nominated for 13th place in the draft will be an important factor for the heat.
The hero missed 15 games from February to March due to an ankle injury, and the season was suspended for a long time after his return match against Hornets on March 12th.
The hero said, "I had plenty of time, so I was able to regain 100% of my condition. It's the best feeling I've ever felt," but his performance at Scrimage was more persuasive than words.
Due to the delay in joining the starting point guard, Kendrick Nang, the hero's playing time increased, and he took advantage of that opportunity.
The value is great because he scored 15 points after splendidly playing a different role.
Team leader Jimmy Butler once again praised the hero of "Favorite".
"He's a handler, he can score, he can defend. He's a player who can do everything for the team. The reason he can do any position is because his way of thinking is not that of a rookie. He looks at the footage, researches it, where his teammates move, goes freelance, and what he should do about it."
Even before the start of this season, the butler likes the strength of losing like a hero's rookie, and his stoic attitude towards basketball.
That's why I invited them to practice individually starting at 4am and trained with them.
Butler once said, "He speaks his opinion to everyone, and he won't back down. I respect that kind of fighting spirit."
The butler is the type who always says what he thinks, and if he thinks it will be good for the team, he knows that there will be a collision, so he bumps into harsh opinions.
In the past, his relationship with his teammates has worsened thanks to this.
Butler must be superimposing himself as a hero when he was young.
The butler's character, which is sometimes too harsh for his teammates, is a good guide for those who have enough guts to follow it.
If the teacher-student relationship between the two who respect each other spreads to the whole team, Heat should be able to become a team that can aim for an even higher level.

[Comment] Shimada Sho took advantage of the opportunity in the early stages and won a complete victory over Hamamatsu Castle Hokko.
Shimada Sho took the lead with Matsuura's two-point timely strike with immortal bases for the first time.
Two more points were added in the infield rumbling and squeeze.
In the throw, the start-up Saito showed a good hit with no points in six innings with only one hit.
Hamamatsu Castle Hokko could not take advantage of the opportunity to have two death bases in the final episode.
The fourth round led by three years
2nd year Matsuura, pre-emptive strike of gratitude
It was 4th in his second year, when he competed for the first time this summer, that he lost his opponent's appearance.
Shimada Commerce's Matsuura hit a changing ball with an immortal base for the first time and carried it to the left front.
"If I lost for three years, I retired immediately. I wanted to hit myself and let him win."
The great talent who was in charge of 4th place last fall was proud.
In the first and third rounds, they fought mainly for three years, and the powerful two years were ahead of them.
Coach Ikeda gathered the players at the meeting and told Nine, "Three years have been connected so far. I'm going with the best members in the future."
On this day, four of the nine stamens solidified their main axis in two years.
It looks ruthless, but it's proof that he's committed to a serious game.
Matsuura said, "From now on, the level of the opponent's pitcher will also increase. I will face it with the intention of sending the runner home."
Saito, who made consecutive pitches, was a good hit that kept six innings to one hit, and he didn't even step on second base, peeking into his stubbornness for three years.
The number 10 is accepted favorably as a synergistic effect, saying, "Two years will stimulate me for three years. I hope it will lead to victory."
The team aiming to be in the top four for the third consecutive year, including the Shizuoka tournament up until last year, does not intend to make memories of the remaining games.
16 musicians related to Fukushima Prefecture gather in the world of singing voices with the people of the prefecture (Fukushima Minpo) - Yahoo!News
I want to deliver the energetic singing voices of Hama, Naka and Aizu to the world.
Sixteen musicians related to Fukushima Prefecture came together to create a message song.
The lyrics depict Fukushima Prefecture's dedication to fighting the new coronavirus as it moves towards recovery from the Great East Japan Earthquake and the accident at TEPCO's Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant.
Inviting the singing voices of the people of the prefecture, the "complete version" will be completed by next summer, which marks the 10th anniversary of the earthquake.
On the 24th, the song was released on the video posting site "YouTube".
The title of the song is "Pray from Fukushima".
He puts people's positive attitude on a cheerful and energetic melody with the desire to "communicate from Fukushima".
Due to the influence of the new corona, the live house, which will be the base for musical activities, has been forced to be closed, and many musicians have lost their place to perform songs and performances.
It was planned by singer-songwriter nappo (46), who lives in Minamisoma, and DAZU-O (37) of Iwaki's music group "Mehikari Boys" in order to believe in the power of music because it is a time when we can't see the future.
Nappo will write the lyrics and compose, and Dazuo will be in charge of rap.
When the project started in March of the corona disaster, Fukushima-born singer-songwriters Manami (28) and Kanno Jun (38) agreed one after another, and the circle expanded in the blink of an eye.
Nappo said with emotion, "It has become a gorgeous lineup that is unthinkable in normal times. I want to fully enjoy this opportunity."
As a countermeasure against infection, there was no opportunity for 16 people to gather, and each of them was recorded at a live house or at home.
In order to support the project, Koa, a painter from Iwaki City, drew an image character.
In the shape of Fukushima Prefecture, it expresses a climate rich in nature with blue and green.
The finished song will be disseminated to the world on YouTube, and will also be made into a CD.
Next year marks the 10th anniversary of the earthquake, and the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games, which have been postponed, are also scheduled to be held.
Dazuo said, "We, who have overcome difficulties, have a great deal to carry. I would be happy if releasing the song at a milestone would encourage many people."

Instantaneous detection of crises from online information and judgment of hoaxes (JBpress) - Yahoo!News
"I want to know where and what kind of disasters and accidents occurred as soon as possible!"
There is a strong need for this not only in the press such as television and newspapers, but also in many companies such as social infrastructure companies and local governments.
A service that responds to this is the "Spectee" developed by Spectee, an AI-based information analysis company.
[Picture] Specialist team determines the authenticity of social media information with alerts from Specti
Today, the first way for people to know the occurrence of a disaster or accident is shifting from television to online information (social media).
Social media such as Twitter have become important media that disseminates information immediately after a disaster or accident occurs.
However, the task of constantly watching overflowing information and extracting useful information from it is difficult by hand.
Specti has a function that detects natural disasters and accidents from information flowing through social media such as Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, analyzes the contents, determines whether the information is true or not, and then distributes it to user companies.
It is a crisis management support service that visualizes various crises occurring both in Japan and overseas, "Positioning a wide range of events that have negative impacts that suspend or stagnate social activities as "crisis" (Murakami Kenjiro, CEO).
NHK at the time of the Kumamoto earthquake that occurred in April 2016 was the first major use case of Specti, and since then, the movement of recruitment has spread rapidly among companies.
It is said that more than 350 companies in Japan, including companies that support social infrastructure such as electricity, gas and transportation, as well as local governments all over the country, are currently using Specti, as well as news agencies such as TV stations and newspapers.
Analyze posts to determine the type of "crisis" and where it occurred
Specti distributes information in four steps: "collection of information", "analysis and content classification", "title", and "true judgment".
The user must specify in advance the area where the information will be collected (prefectures, municipalities, etc.) and the category of crisis (disaster, accident, etc.).
Specti collects posts that fall under that designation using the API provided by social media.
Next, the text, images, and videos contained in the collected posts are analyzed and classified.
For example, if there is a video showing a fire truck, black smoke rising from the building, and orange flames coming out of the room, it will be classified as "fire".
In addition, images of overturned cars are classified as "traffic accidents", and images of roads covered with water are classified as "road floods".
Specti also estimates the location of disasters and accidents.
"We often don't know the location from the post, so we estimate it by combining various information," says CEO Murakami.
For example, if a road sign or signboard is reflected in an image or video, information on the place name will be extracted from it, and the location will be identified by comparing it with the place name database.
Angels lose goodbye in the opening game... Otani strikes 3 balls with full bases in 1,9 innings of 5 (Baseball King) - Yahoo!News
Athletics 7x-3 Angels ● <Auckland Coliseum on July 24th local time< Angels player Otani Shohei (26) participated in the opening match against athletics in enemy territory on the 24th (25th Japan time) as a "third nominated batter".
In the first round, he hit a middle-stroke, his first hit of the season, but the subsequent four bats retreated, resulting in five strokes, one hit and one strike.
Otani played against Montana again in the first-death first base three times and played Yugoro.
In the 5th 3rd batting with 1-1, he played against 2nd place right arm Petit at one-death first base and collapsed here as well.
In the 8th 4th batting with a 2-1 and one-point lead, he confronted Deakman, his left arm in 5th place, as the lead batter.
He bounced the straight of the second ball back in the opposite direction at a good angle, but it didn't go over the fence and fell to the left.
Angels reached the bottom of the 8th with a one-point lead, and rescue right arm Batley lost two points and allowed a reversal, but in the 9th table where there was nothing left, new catcher 7th Castro took the team's first solo bullet this season to the right wing seat.
He caught up with a 3-3 tie at the last minute.
After that, he had 2 deaths, 1st and 2nd bases, and the order of batting was 2nd trout.
The athletics bench avoided declaring a trout here, and chose the Otani game with two-death bases.
Otani was expected to win, but he struck out three balls in front of Hendrix, the guardian deity of athletics.
The game could not be settled in nine innings, and they entered an extended game starting with the immortal second base, which is a special exception this season.
Otani was the last batter in nine innings, so he became a second base runner.
For the Angels in the 10th table, the lead hitter Walsh hit a poignant first base, but the first base Olson, who captured this batting well, sent the ball to the third base.
Otani, who was sandwiched between the second and third bases, was touched out.
The Angels later had two-death bases, but at the end, 8th Simmons fell to Nigoro.
Behind the scenes, Robles, who continued to play across the innings, was in a pinch of one death, second and third bases with dead balls and rash throws.
At this point, new coach Madon made a shift to five infield players, but Robles walked 4th Davis in four balls and had full bases.
Milner, his left arm, took a goodbye full-base bullet to 5th Olson to the right wing seat, and the game was decided.

Can't you understand "crowded cheating" and "home"...?
I asked the people of Chiba Prefecture, "The words I really thought were not a dialect" (Netorabo) - Yahoo!News
I am a citizen of Chiba Prefecture, close to Tokyo.
I have been living in the prefecture for less than 30 years since I was born.
When I used "crowded cheating", which means "side-by-side", when I used it in a conversation with a friend at university (Tokyo), it was considered Kyoton for a moment.
They understood the meaning through the flow and the sense of the word, but the people of Tokyo and Saitama told me not to use it.
-- Certainly, "I wonder if it's about cheating and cheating sideways?"
Since it seems to be connected, it seems that the meaning can be guessed somehow.
and one more thing.
I didn't realize this when it was pointed out, but the expression "uchinchi", which means "my house", was not used at all even when I was reading books, and I didn't hear it from my friends, so when I looked it up when I grew up, it was a dialect.
-- Eh, "Uchinchi"... was that so?
I also use it in my hometown (Gunma Prefecture), but I didn't notice it, perhaps because I naturally stopped using it when I grew up...
Japan's "chilled Chinese" is not popular with Chinese people...?
The reason why "cold noodle dishes" are unpopular (Gendai Business) - Yahoo!News
Chilled Chinese noodles in China are "Japanese-style cold noodles"
As I mentioned at the beginning, chilled Chinese is a Chinese dish (Japanese-style Chinese) that originated in Japan, invented based on the Chinese "ryang bang mien (chilled mixed soba noodles)."
Therefore, although it does not originally exist in China, due to the diversification of food, it has come to be seen in Japanese restaurants in the summer.
In addition, Japanese convenience stores have recently started selling arranged products such as "Nisshiki Soba Ryomen / Soba Chilled Chinese" and "Sichuan Style Chicken Chilled Chinese".
On the other hand, the popularity of Japanese-style Chinese cuisine is generally not high in China, pushed by trendy punchy Chinese dishes such as Sichuan and Hunan cuisine.
Naturally, the seasoning of Japanese-style Chinese food is often familiar to Chinese people.
Therefore, there is a tendency to be harshly criticized if it is not tasty, but has little impact.
"Chilled Chinese" is no exception, and it is still a minor presence in China.
Incidentally, the name of chilled Chinese noodles in China is "Japanese-style cold noodles".
It is recognized by the Chinese as one of the Japanese dishes.
The staple of summer is "Riampi"
In China, when it comes to noodle dishes that make you feel summer, it's probably "rippy".
In Japan, there are many people who are unfamiliar with it, but cool bark is flat noodles made from flour, rice flour and starch that originated in Shanxi Province.
It is said that it has a history of 2,000 years.
It is a staple of B-class gourmet foods that are also sold at food stalls, and the price is around 10-20 yuan (150-300 yen), which is very reasonable.
Although the word "cool" is included, it is not made with ice like chilled Chinese food in Japan.
Rather, room temperature is the basics.
On top of the noodles, toppings such as shredded cucumbers, carrots and boiled bean sprouts are topped, and condiments such as coriander, chili pepper, ginger and garlic are added.
Finally mixed with soy sauce and chili oil, vinegar, sesame paste and peanut paste, poured with special seasonings and finished.
The refreshing sour, rich and spicy sauce is well entangled in the noodles that go well through the throat, and it goes smoothly even when you have no appetite due to summer fatigue.
In addition, since it has penetrated all over China, there are various toppings and seasonings, and a wide variety of variations is also a characteristic of cool skin, and it is one of the ways to enjoy it.

Benefits of "cold water showers" for body and mind (Cosmopolitan) - Yahoo!News
Suppresses inflammation such as muscle pain
A study that examined the effectiveness of hydrotherapy, published in The North American Journal of Medical Sciences, found that it could be expected to have an effect on physical and mental healing.
By bathed in cold water after exercise, muscle pain and other inflammatory effects can be suppressed.
According to Professor Douglas Casa, head of the Korea Stringer Institute, who studies sports medicine and teaches at the University of Connecticut, "It's important to exercise and take a cold water shower as little time as possible. By lowering your body temperature immediately after moving your body, you can recover from inflammation and fatigue caused by exercise faster."
Reduce fatigue
When you exercise in high temperatures, your heart, muscles, and skin will need more blood flow than usual.
"During exercise, the heart rate increases, so blood flow to the heart increases, and muscle blood flow increases because it requires energy to contract the muscles. Also, when it comes to the skin, a lot of blood flows in to regulate body temperature," says Professor Kasa.
"Taking a cold water shower lowers the temperature of the skin, so it can reduce the amount of blood flow sent to the skin. Instead, blood flow is sent to internal organs such as the stomach and intestines, making it easier to take moisture and nutrients even after exercise. As a result, it can reduce the fatigue you feel after exercise."
Expectations for the hormesis effect
Dorosevsky also explains that exposure to cold water can be expected to trigger the "hormesis effect".
The hormesis effect is the idea that it is better to have a little bit of substances and stress that are harmful to the body rather than not at all.
"Hypoxic exercise, petit fasting, and cold water showers are typical examples of hormesis effects for health. Cold water showers stimulate hormones and neurotransmitters, increasing physical and physical resilience and resilience."

Hanshin and Oyama, No. 7 in 2 consecutive races!
Director Yano "watching and dignified" (Sankei Sports) - Yahoo!News
(Se League, Chunichi 2-5 Hanshin, 7th round, Hanshin 4 wins and 3 losses, 24th, Nagoya D) The momentum of No. 4 can't stop.
The soaring batting landed in the middle of the left wing seat.
Oyama shot an arch for two races in a row and went around the diamond.
When I returned to the bench, I peeked into my white teeth.
"While I was able to swing well, I was able to squeeze the ball I was aiming for and swing boldly."
In four innings of 0-2, he entered the batting in the lead.
He swung aggressively from the first ball, and the second ball after the foul.
I didn't miss Ono's sweet 134km slider.
The batting captured with the core is such a perfect hit that you are convinced that it will stand in the moment you hit it.
One shot in two consecutive games following the previous day's match against Hiroshima (Koshien) on the 23rd was a counterattack.
It was also a valuable shot from an opponent he was not good at.
When he played against Ono at Koshien on the 17th, he scored 9 hits and 4 points.
However, only at the Nagoya Dome, they have allowed 7 wins, 1 loss and 1 hold in a total of 12 games in the past, and have suffered seven consecutive losses after a draw since August 23, 2013.
From such a difficult enemy, he scored for the first time in 23 innings at Nagoya Dome (disembarking along the way was also counted as one inning) with a dynamic shot, and did not pass the flow of the game.
Director Yano also said, "It's a high level to be able to catch a sweet ball firmly. He has a personality when he sees it, and the timing of hitting has an atmosphere even if it's a foul. I think he'll still hit it," expressing his expectations for further explosions.
He hit the right front at a time, marking six consecutive hits and multiple hits for three consecutive games.
Although the opening was just around the corner, 7 home runs and 16 runs have already worked perfectly as the top of the team and 4th.
In order to win, we will continue to produce results.

Macau casino supervisory authorities inspect the implementation of epidemic prevention measures at casino facilities... it is mandatory to present a new coronavirus negative certificate at the time of admission (Macau Newspaper) - Yahoo!News
Approximately 40 casino facilities in Macau were closed for 15 days from February 5th to the 19th due to the new coronavirus infection (COVID-19) epidemic, and have resumed operations since the 20th of the same month after taking strict epidemic prevention measures.
The Macau Casino Regulatory Authority (DICJ) requires the operating company to protect the health of its employees and guests as much as possible when reopening, and it is stipulated that the distance between gaming (casino) tables is secured, that seats can be opened next to each other in table games (for example, at a baccarat table, three to four people can be seated at one table at the same time), and that slot machines should be operated one or two at a time, thereby reducing the risk of cross-infection.
Disinfection of gaming equipment such as chips has also been strengthened.
Guests are also required to wear a mask, check the temperature, and present an effective health code (the most recent history of stay, presence or absence of contact with a new type of corona patient, presence or absence of symptoms such as fever or cough, generated by entering contact information) at the time of admission.
From midnight on July 15th, the presentation of a negative coronavirus nucleic acid test certificate (limited to those within the validity period issued by an authorized facility in Macau or Guangdong Province) was also added to the condition.
Behind the new mandatory presentation of negative certificates is the relaxation of waterfront measures between Macau and Guangdong Province from 6am on the 15th (the elimination of 14-day quarantine quarantine, with various conditions), which will be a precautionary measure associated with this.
DICJ announced on July 18th that in response to changes in admission conditions starting on the 15th of the same month, Director Adriano Ho and others of the bureau observed the implementation of epidemic prevention measures at casino facilities, and held a meeting with representatives from the security departments of the six casino management companies, and announced that they once again called for the protection of the health of employees and guests by thoroughly managing the admission of guests.
DICJ stated that it will continue strict patrols of casino facilities and have regular meetings with the operating company according to the situation and evaluation, and that epidemic prevention measures at casinos will be adjusted as appropriate in accordance with the guidelines of the government health bureau.
Hayashimatsu, director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of the Department of Health, also accompanied him on a visit to the casino facility, where he gave guidance on how to disinfect gaming (casino) chips and keep a safe distance between the seats of electronic casino equipment.
Cumulative casino sales for the January-June quarter of this year decreased 77.4% from the same period of the previous year to 33.72 billion Macau patacas (Japanese yen equivalent: approximately 451.9 billion yen) due to the sharp decline in the number of inbound passengers due to epidemic prevention measures, including restrictions on entry.
A cheer of light from Yuwaku Onsen Next month, a message to medical professionals in place of the Bonbori Festival (Hokkoku Shimbun) - Yahoo!News
At Yuwaku Onsen, where the annual "Yuwaku Bonbori Festival" has been canceled due to the new coronavirus, efforts to light bonbori with messages of support to medical practitioners will begin on August 1st.
Approximately 350 sheets of paper written by fans and local residents from all over the country are pasted to envelop the city of hot water with ale light to deliver healing to visitors.
The Bonbori Festival is an event that recreates the festival that appears in the anime "Hanasaku Iroha" modeled after Yuwaku Onsen, and is organized by the Yuwaku Onsen Tourism Association.
It began in 2011, when the anime was broadcast, and attracts many anime fans from all over the country every year.
Every year, every day from the lighting ceremony in July to the main festival in October, bonbori are lit up on the stairs leading to Yuwaku Inari Shrine next to the Soyu.
This year, the festival was forced to be canceled due to the new corona, but local and national fans said one after another, "It's lonely that there's no bonbori in the summer of Yuwaku," and the association came up with this project.
It was named the "Recovery Campaign" to help heal and recover the world, which is in a difficult situation due to the coronal disaster.
Until now, about 50 pupils from local Yuwaku Primary School and Shibahara Junior High School have been asked to write messages with illustrations, and more than 100 applications have been received from all over the country.
If you purchase the message form from the association's website, fill it out, put it in a reply envelope and send it to the association, you can receive a photo with a light attached to it.
For 6,000 yen per set, applications will be accepted until the total number of bonbori reaches 350 units.
The lanterns are scheduled to be lit up until the end of November.
Yamashita Shinichiro (48), who has been the chairman of the festival's executive committee since the first edition, said, "Reading the message gives us encouragement. Next year we would like to hold a grand festival that marks the 10th milestone."
For the campaign, illustrations of the blooming Iroha characters and Asanogawa Ohashi Bridge were also prepared.
From the 1st, a clear file with illustrations will be presented to users of the special accommodation plan at the ryokan in Yuwaku Onsen.
Core 4 "Moriyama Gogen" that supports Seibu collaborates with souls (Tospo Web) - Yahoo!News
Seibu's proud "Moriyama Gogen" showed the cooperation of the soul and staged a goodbye victory for the second time this season.
In the match against Lotte (MetLife) on the 24th, nine times, 2-2, and the four players, who were still far from being in good condition, showed their obsession with victory.
In the lead, Genda went to base by headsliding from the safety bunt to the first base.
Then, in the last six games, 3rd Mori, who is at the bottom with a batting rate of 10%, 18 minutes and 2 rin, scored a sending bunt and made a one-death second base.
4th Yamakawa avoided the declaration, and from this day on, Sotozaki, who returned to 5th after replacing Mori, defeated Masuda's straight ball, leading to a 3-2 victory.
Hero Sotozaki said, "(Genda's safety) I was surprised even though I was on the bench, and I thought I had no choice but to do something about it. I conveyed the feeling that Tomoya also believed in me behind me with a bunt and connected me.Mr. Yamakawa avoided it and gave me a word, "Be proactive!" before going to the first base, so I was able to get into it," and the result was the thoughts of the three people who created the flow of goodbye.
The four players, first place in the draft in 2013, second place Mori and Yamakawa, Sotozaki in 3rd place in 2014, and Genda in 3rd place in 2016, are Note's "Core 4" that baseball team officials call "the heart of our current company".
All of them had experience as captain when they were amateurs, and they have a greater sense of responsibility than anyone else.
Sotozaki, who took over as captain from Yamakawa when he was in his fourth year at Fuji University, said, "Mr. Yamakawa is good at speaking anyway, so he's the captain who leads the team with words. On the other hand, I'm not good at speaking, so I left the conversation to the vice-captain who was good at speaking, and I was the type who was in the back," and each of them supports the new captain Genda and the new player chairman Mori while demonstrating their own individuality.
Director Tsuji said, "Genda's safety? That's not a sign. But then I thought, 'Okay, I can go.' Tomoya was also a wonderful bunt. Sotozaki also hit me a lot," praising the soul collaboration of "Moriyama Gogen".
All four of them are currently struggling with a batting rate of 20% 24-5 minutes, but even if they can't hit, they support the team with their wisdom and how to win.

After teaching at the Bakufu's Bansho Shirabesho, a research and educational institution for Western studies, he opened a private school called Kyukyodo in Edo, where he taught Western studies, military science and medicine.
Even after returning to the Choshu Domain, he gave lectures on military science at Yamaguchi Meirinkan.
The bronze statue focused on Masujiro as an educator.
Standing beside the globe, holding a calligraphy in his hand, he gave a lecture on Western studies.
The statue, combined with the pedestal, is about 3 meters high (1.55 meters), and it is said that it was made from the perspective of a disciple taking Masujiro's lecture.
It was designed by Masujiro's wife, Takami Marie (27), a descendant of Kotoko and a local designer.
It was built by the project executive committee (Chairman Okamoto Satoshi) 150 years after the death of Omura Masujiro, whose parent organization is the Chusenji Residents' Association, soliciting donations.
Approximately 128 million yen was collected from 104 people nationwide.
The project cost, including the installation of famous boards, is approximately 12 million yen.
The surplus donations will be used to maintain and manage the statue.
Chairman Okamoto said, "Masujiro, who has continued to have high aspirations and made great contributions as an educator, is the pride of his old hometown and a bronze statue that will be the hope of the children of the region who will be responsible for the future."
Leaving the venue wearing Embape crutches, who were injured after a malicious tackle (SPORT.es) - Yahoo!News
Paris Saint-Germain, who defeated Saint-Etienne 1-0 in the Coupe de France final held at Stade de France on the 24th local time, won his 13th victory for the first time in two years.
PSG achieves two domestic crowns
Neymar's goal in the first half of defeating Saint-Etienne in Neymar's final point was the final point, and PSG won two domestic crowns following Ligue Ann, but they are in a situation where they can't help but be concerned about the Champions League in August.
Killian Embape, who made his first appearance in the same match, was injured after a malicious sliding tackle by his opponent's CB Royk Peran.
In the first 30 minutes, the young French star, who was defeated in the form of being sandwiched between his right ankle, distorted his face in pain.
Players from both teams were touch-and-go over this play, resulting in a brawl.
Embape, who seems to have twisted his right ankle, is unable to continue playing.
Peran was presented with a red card.
After the game, Embape, with his right leg fixed, left the stadium with crutches on.
PSG will compete in the final of the Coupe de la League against Lyon on August 1st at 4:10 JST, but it will undoubtedly be impossible to employ Embape in this match.
It is necessary to wait for the medical report to be announced by the club, but there is also a possibility that they will miss the Champions League in Portugal.
Corona disaster "Online museum "HASARD" close to art Konno (from Hachinohe) launched (Delhi-Tohoku Shimbun) - Yahoo!News
There is a museum where anyone can come into contact with art for free whenever they like.
The collection ranges from famous painters such as Claude Monet and Gustav Klimt to unknown artists in Japan.
Since its opening in April 2019, the online museum "HASARD" has grabbed the hearts of users for its convenience and novelty, and has gained even more attention in the wake of a new lifestyle caused by the corona disaster.
Representative Konno Shinnosuke (26), who is from Hachinohe and lives in Tokyo, said, "We wanted to create a service where everyone can easily enjoy art. I want people to come into contact with art in difficult situations."
When you visit Ather, you will be amazed by the abundance of exhibits and the beauty of the images.
As of the 24th, a total of 14 exhibitions, including permanent and special exhibitions, are open to the public, and the ultra-high-resolution works that convey not only the color but also the texture of the brush attract viewers.
Membership registration and admission fees are not required, and it is characterized by the fact that there is no cost not only for the viewer but also for artists who want to hold a solo exhibition.
The unique way of showing it online is also attracting attention.
Moving the picture is one of them.
In Claude Monet's permanent exhibition "It Begins Moving Again", clouds, flowers and grasslands are digitally processed to move.
With the desire to "make it possible for people who are less interested in art to enter" (Representative Konno), you can feel as if you are in a picture.
Representative Konno first encountered art when he was in elementary school.
At that time, when I visited the newly completed Aomori Museum of Art with my family, I saw three huge paintings of Marc Chagall's "Aleko" and I was shocked by their power.
From the next day, art classes turned into a fun time, and even after moving to Tokyo after going to university, he began to visit galleries and other places.
At the same time, I also felt that there are many people who do not have many opportunities to come into contact with art from various perspectives, such as the fact that there are no museums nearby, large special exhibitions are only held in the Tokyo metropolitan area, and it is difficult to go out due to childcare.
Therefore, while working for an IT-related company, he spent about two months launching a website where people could appreciate art on the Internet.
In the first 10 months, the number of users reached an average of 10,000 per month, and since the spread of the new corona, the number has increased to about 30,000.
I wish anyone could appreciate art in a free way when they want to see it.
The aim of the other was unintentionally accepted by more people due to the coronal disaster.
Representative Konno emphasized that the significance of art appreciation enriches the imagination.
"When your imagination becomes richer, you will be able to reach out to people in need.
I hope that by getting closer to art, it will become a better society."
The simple reason why the era of Chinese quality is coming to an end and the era of Japanese quality is coming (Gendai Business) - Yahoo!News
Changing values through pandemics
Various predictions and discussions have been made about the world of after-sales pandemics.
On the business front, there is a possibility that the changes mentioned in the article on July 8th, "Actually, the jobs of "managers" are starting to disappear in Japan...! That cruel reality", the article on July 4th, "In the world of "Post-Corona", the reason why "Japan's manufacturing industry" is actually likely to make a big comeback...!"
[Photo] The identity of "Japan's strength" that only Japanese people don't know... Surprising reality seen in Asia
In addition, mentally, it seems that the trend will become mainstream, such as the article on June 26th, "The Principles of Complete Combustion" given to people who have become aware of the end of their lives in the corona, and the article on June 10th, "Corona, now that it is full of riots, let's review the benefits of "praying for the gods in times of hardship".
And what we can see clearly as a combination of the two "materials (economy and business)" and "spirit" is the major trend from "Chinese quality to Japanese quality".
For example, it would be annoying if there were defects or defects in a T-shirt or digital camera, but there is no separate article in the life of the person who purchased it.
On the other hand, the sloppy quality of Chinese-made masks and ventilators that have recently become a hot topic... "Chinese quality" in such products that are directly linked to life and safety is fatal.
No matter how cheap it is, you can't buy such a product.
Even if you pay a considerable price, you will be looking for "Japanese quality" products.
Of course, this trend is not just happening in Japan.
It is evident from the fact that Western countries, which fell into a difficult situation due to a shortage of masks and medical equipment, still made "returns" one after another due to the severity of "Chinese quality".
Safer and safer than cheap
In addition, products such as automobiles are also products that can cause fatal defects (deaths from accidents).
No matter how much China, Korea and other countries go on an offensive with the low-cost strategy of "cheap or bad", they will not be able to compete with those made in Japan in the end, and the situation described in the article on June 16th, "After all, will automakers around the world bow down to Toyota?" is because "Japanese quality" is strongly required for the products of automobiles.
In addition, this pandemic reminded us that "security and safety" is also necessary for many other products.
In addition, security and safety are important not only for "Japanese quality in manufacturing", but also for "Japanese quality in logistics and other services".
Like the toilet paper turmoil, there are times when intermediate distribution is delayed and cannot be reached even though production capacity is proper.
Furthermore, I keenly realized that self-sufficiency in Japan is also an important element of "security and safety" as shown in the article "Who is the real culprit of the shortage of masks! Don't forgive firefield thieves by the Communist Party of China administration" on April 17th.
In the event of an emergency, it is natural for every country to prioritize their own country, and it is very important to be able to procure essentials such as masks (medical devices) and food within their own country.
Korea's new corona infection exceeds 100 for the first time in 115 days, the highest overseas inflow at 86 (Yonhap News) - Yahoo!News
(SEOUL=Yonhap News) Korea's Central Epidemic Prevention Headquarters announced on the 25th that as of midnight, the number of people infected with the new corona virus has increased by 113 from midnight the previous day to 14,092.
This is the first time in 115 days since April 1st (101) that the number of new infections per day has exceeded 100.
In addition to the fact that 32 sailors were found to be infected by a Russian ship that arrived at Busan Port, 32 of the 293 workers who returned from Iraq on the 24th were judged positive.
Except for the 20th (26), the number of new infections in Korea was in the range of 30 to 60.
Of the newly infected people announced on the 25th, 86 came from overseas, the highest number since January 20th, when the first infection occurred in Korea.
The number of immigrants from Iraq was the largest at 36, with 34 from Russia, 5 from the Philippines, and 3 from the United States.
On the other hand, 27 people were infected in the city, 11 were confirmed in Seoul and Gyeonggi-do, respectively, and 5 were confirmed in Busan.
Five people from Busan were employees of a repair company aboard a Russian ship.
The death toll has remained unchanged since the previous day, reaching a total of 298 people.
Nagoya and Miyahara play corona-positive soccer J1, for the first time since the league reopened | Shizuoka Newspaper @S
J1 soccer player Nagoya announced on the 25th that defender Miyahara Kazuya (24) has confirmed a positive response to the new coronavirus.
This is the first time a player has reacted positively since the reopening of the J league.
He is the third player from the club, following forward Kanasaki Yumeo (31), who was infected in June, and Australian goalkeeper Mitchell Langerac (31).
The two had already been treated and returned to the game.
This season's Miyahara was on the bench in the J1 match against Oita at Showa Denko Dome Oita on the 22nd.
Nagoya held a press conference online on the 25th and revealed that a PCR test was conducted on 60 athletes and staff on the same day.
98% reflection.
It turns out that the white paint derived from a Teflon-processed frying pan and heat insulation increase the cooling effect!
No way, it was a big discovery!
This year was the rainy season with an unprecedented amount of precipitation, but at dawn, the extremely hot summer will begin in earnest.
It's hot and hot, and it's so hot that even air conditioning doesn't work... it's going to swell just by imagining it, isn't it?
Global warming is a major global problem, and humankind has narrowed down its wisdom on how to overcome the hot midsummer as comfortably as possible.
One way to do this is to wear thin, whitish clothes.
You see, you don't have to bother to wear black clothes that absorb heat in the summer, right?
In addition, the same principle is applied to the architecture of houses, and it seems that there are an increasing number of cases where white paint is used.
Even if white is white, the latest research field was whether it could not be made into a paint that reflects more light and does not absorb heat.
Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) has recently announced that, in collaboration with researchers from the Department of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics at Columbia University, they have found the most efficient way to blend white paint to repel solar heat and improve the cooling effect inside the building.
It is said that it is expected to be put into practical use as soon as possible.
Until now, white paints with the highest reflectance of sunlight have been made from titanium oxide, which has a reflectance of 85%.
White paint, which uses titanium oxide, has already been applied to the roofs of buildings in high-temperature environments, and has been used to block solar heat and increase cooling efficiency.
However, what has been newly discovered is a white paint derived from the fluorine resin of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), which is used in Teflon-processed frying pans.
It is a white paint that applies this Teflon effect and reflects sunlight to nearly 98%, making it possible to drastically cut heat.
Even in the hot summer, thanks to the surprisingly white paint using Teflon, it is easy to spend indoors without being exposed to the extreme heat.
Perhaps such an era is coming soon, isn't it?
I feel that the roofs of Japanese houses have a lot of dark colors, but will white be the mainstream from now on?
Amazon's annual large-scale sale, when will it be held this year?
The US CNBC reported on July 21st that Amazon.com has announced the postponement of its annual large-scale sale "Prime Day".
It is held every July, but it was reported that this year it had to be postponed due to the spread of coronavirus infection.
A spokeswoman, "Details will be announced soon," an Amazon spokeswoman said in a statement.
"Prime Day has become a special celebration that we look forward to over the past five years. This year it will be held later than usual, ensuring the safety of our employees and supporting customers and exhibitors"
However, he only stated that "details will be announced soon", and the specific date of the event was not disclosed.
On the other hand, it was decided that the event would be held in India.
A press release was posted on the country's website.
It was explained that it will be held for 48 hours from midnight on August 6th.
Prime Day has been held at the same time around the world, but this year it may take unprecedented measures.
Amazon, a large-scale event that sells 760 billion yen in two days, started a large-scale sale for members in 2015 as a sales promotion measure in the summer when sales are declining.
Initially it was a 24-hour event, but the scale has expanded year by year, and last year it was held for 48 hours from midnight on July 15th in 18 countries, including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, India, Japan, China and Australia.
According to the company, last year, two-day sales exceeded previous sales of "Black Friday" (the first day of year-end sales) and "Cyber Monday" (the following Monday).
This event also contributed to the acquisition of new subscribers to the paid member "Prime", and last year the number of applications made on the first day reached a record high, and the next day was second only to that.
In addition, 175 million products were sold worldwide last year.
Regarding this, Internet Retailer, a magazine specializing in the online shopping industry, reported that global sales for the two days were $7.16 billion (approximately 760 billion yen), up 70% from the previous year.
Mobile number migration, harsh eyes on excessive retention.
What happens to fees and points?
(New Switch) - Yahoo!News
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications is in full swing considering a review of the same number migration system (MNP) that allows users to use conventional phone numbers as they are when changing mobile telecommunications companies.
At a meeting of experts on the 21st, they announced their intention to revise the guidelines for MNPs enacted in 2004.
Specific issues cover a wide range of topics, such as the state of MNP fees and the pros and cons of retaining those who wish to move out.
As opposition from telecommunications companies is expected, attention will be paid to whether this will lead to the promotion of healthy market competition.
At the beginning of 2006, when dark MNPs were introduced by telecommunications companies that are far from unlimited mobile phone transfers, the user fee was 2,000 yen, but now it is 3,000 yen.
The MNP fee revenue of the three major mobile telecommunications companies is estimated to be 15.9 billion yen per year.
On the 21st, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications listed the current situation surrounding MNPs at the "Working Group on Verifying Competition Rules (WG)", an expert meeting to discuss the competitive environment in the telecommunications market.
The time for issuing an MNP reservation number, which is required for consumers to move to another telecommunications company, was also cited as a ball.
Major telecommunications companies accept applications on the web, but due to the convenience of operating core systems, the mainstream acceptance time zone is 9-20:00.
The WG materials clearly stated that, in principle, all-day response would be the direction for future consideration.
Another problem is that mobile telecommunications companies grant points to those who wish to move out by MNP to keep them.
This is because it was judged that excessive retention could impede fair competition.
Kita Shunichi, a partner of Nomura Research Institute, who is a member of the working group, suggested, "If you have time to explain the provision of economic benefits, or with permission from the user, you will promptly issue a number to users who do not grant it. It is important to thoroughly implement this process first."
However, with regard to MNP fees in a series of issues, there is a structural problem that "the higher the fee, the less likely it is for customers to flow out, so it is difficult to motivate them to actively lower it" (a representative from the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications).
If there are businesses that take the initiative in lowering MNP fees, there is concern that the outflow of customers from the company will increase, and corporate efforts will not be rewarded.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications has pointed out that many countries overseas do not require user fees for MNPs, and this may be the case in Japan as well.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications would like to compile the results of the working group into a report around September-October, and then begin the procedure for revising the MNP guidelines.
It is expected that the amendment will take place after 2019.
Mobile telecommunications companies are likely to be troubled, including how to provide sales and customer support.
Chunichi Katsuno wins no points six times and doesn't get the right to be a pitcher (Sankei Sports) - Yahoo!News
Chunichi pitcher Katsuno Masayoshi (23) started in the 8th round of Hanshin (Nagoya Dome) on the 25th.
He had six innings, four hits and no points.
"There was also the last pitch, so I thought it was my last chance, so I threw it. There was also a fore ball, but I was able to compete with my opponent without worrying too much about it."
He pitched for the first time this season and the last match against Hanshin (Koshien) on the 18th, and both started twice, struggling to control the ball and disembarked up to four times.
He was unable to fulfill his role as the starting point, and this time it was a backwater mound for the survival of the 1st army.
This time, he bullishly attacked the strong fierce tiger batting opponent with a heartfelt ball.
When a straight ball in the 140-kilometer range ran, changing balls such as counting balls were also able to be used effectively.
In six innings, he hit a double run in the middle left against Sands in the lead, but flew Oyama to the left and killed Boer to Nigoro, 2 deaths and 3rd bases.
In the match against Fukudome here, he drove him with two balls, and at the end was a fork.
In a three-ball game, he took an empty strike and surpassed the pinch.
Katsuno finished six innings and had 83 balls, but at the same time as the end of the mid-field game, coach Yoda stepped out of the bench and announced the change of pitcher.
Saiyu, who played the pitcher game, had 108 balls at the same time, but he got off the mound first and could not get the right to win for the first time this season.

The prefectural police canceled the memorial service visited by police academy students this year.
On the 21st, General Manager Sugiuchi Yumiko and Karatsu Chief Fukushima Hiroto visited Komatsushima off the coast of Takagushi Port, where they were cremated, and offered flowers to the monument.
General Manager Sugiuchi renewed his desire, "The courageous and dedicated spirit is the origin of the police, and I would like to pass it on as it should be."
Policeman Masuda, who is from Kumamoto Prefecture, was assigned to Takagushi in July 1895.
He took measures with insomnia and rest, such as disinfecting the patient's home, and after that, he himself was infected with cholera.
He said, "I will carry all of Takagushi's cholera on my back," and died at the age of 25 just four days after his arrival.

Dodgers Bets, contracted for a total of 39.1 billion yen in 2012!
The second largest in history after the Angels Trout!
It turns out that Mookie Betz outfielder of the Los Angeles Dodgers has signed a new contract.
Transferred off from the Boston Red Sox.
Prior to his first year in Shintiandi, he signed a contract until 2032.
Companies such as the US media CBS Sports reported on the 22nd (23rd Japan time).
[Video] R-socks Betz demonstrates a variety of talents!
You can do something like this besides baseball!
Bets made his major debut in 2014 at the age of 21.
He has contributed to the team as the center of the strong batting line of the Boston Red Sox and as a right-wing hand with a strong shoulder.
He is like the pinnacle of mid-range batters, recording more than 40 double runs every year from 2015 to last season.
In 2018, when he became the best in the world, he won the top batter and MVP with a batting rate of .346.
According to CBS Sports, Betz had rejected a 10-year $300 million (approximately 32.1 billion yen) offer from the Red Sox last year.
At the time off, along with left arm ace pitcher David Price, he traded to the Dodgers in exchange for money and multiple players.
This season's contract is $27 million (approximately 2.9 billion yen) a year.
The new contract reported this time amounts to a total of $365 million (approximately 39.1 billion yen) over the 12 years from the 2021 season to the 2032 season.
The biggest contract in the current Major League Baseball is Mike Trout outfielder from Los Angeles, $426 million (approximately 45.6 billion yen) in 12 years.
This time, Bets' contract is the second largest amount after this.
As for Betz, who is now off as a free agent (FA), a battle was inevitable if he went to the market.
Before becoming an FA, it follows the recent trend of long-term and high-priced contracts.
In the turbulent Major League Baseball, Betz gained long-term stability.
Commentary on eye diseases related to daily life Health Hot Seminar Kinoshita, Director of Ophthalmology, Hiramatsu Hospital | Town Topics | Saga Shimbun News | Saga Shimbun LiVE
Kinoshita Akio, head of the ophthalmology department at Hiramatsu Hospital, explains dry eyes, Yonezawa Saga flagship store of glasses in Saga
A "relieved seminar" in which Kinoshita Akio, head of ophthalmology at Hiramatsu Hospital, explains dry eyes = Yonezawa Saga flagship store of glasses in Saga City
A "Health Relieved Seminar" (sponsored by the Saga Shimbun and co-sponsored by Yonezawa for glasses) was held on the 25th at the Yonezawa Saga head office of glasses in Shimoda-cho, Saga.
Kinoshita Akio, head of the ophthalmology department at Hiramatsu Hospital (Ogi City), explained eye diseases that are deeply related to daily life, such as dry eyes and cataracts.
Dry eye is said to be a "disease of tears", and it is explained as a disease where the quality of tears collapses and tears do not spread evenly on the surface of the eyes.
Kinoshita said, "The number of contact lens users is about four times more likely," and urged them to "don't use it for a long time or sleep while wearing it."
Measures were shown, such as placing the computer screen below the height of the eyes, and humidifying it in air-conditioned rooms.
Ingredients and foods that are effective for dry eyes were also introduced.
"Omega-3 contained in blue fish prevents the evaporation of tears, and "muchin", which is abundant in natto and okra, enhances the quality of tears."
Regarding cataract surgery, there are two types of intraocular lenses that are inserted instead of crystals, with single-focus and multi-focus lenses, and I touched on the differences in appearance.
Approximately 40 people participated in the seminar.
As a measure to prevent a new type of coronavirus infection, it was divided into two parts, one in the morning and the other in the afternoon, and the temperature was checked and disinfected before admission, and sufficient ventilation was carried out at the venue.

A cluster at the new corona-infected fire department "We have a support system, and there will be no hindrance to operations" (UTY TV Yamanashi) - Yahoo!News
Kofu City announced that a man in his 30s in the city has been infected with a new corona virus.
The newly confirmed infection is a male employee in his 30s from the Minami Fire Department of the Kofu District Fire Department Headquarters.
This man has not been in deep contact with four people who have been confirmed to have been infected within the Kofu District Fire Department Headquarters, but on the 14th of this month, he had symptoms such as fever and underwent a PCR test and was found positive yesterday.
Currently, there are no symptoms and they are waiting at home.
This is the fifth official from the Minami Fire Department to be infected, and the prefecture and city say that a cluster has occurred.
There are six other staff members who have symptoms suspected of infection, and PCR tests are currently being conducted.
In the fire department, it is said that by setting up a support system and assigning another team, there will be no hindrance to operations.
This is the 85th person that an infection has been confirmed in the prefecture, except for cases where it was found to be positive again.
[G Osaka] 17-year-old forward Karayama, what is the possibility of making his J1 debut against Kobe?
Director Miyamoto "Scoring ability stands out" (Sports Hochi) - Yahoo!News
G Osaka coach Miyamoto Tsuneyasu (43) responded to an interview on the 25th before the match against Kobe (Noesta on the 26th) for four consecutive wins, and revealed his expectations for third-year high school forward Karayama Shoji (17), who became a member of the top team for the first time in the previous section.
The commander made Karayama, who was promoted to the top in the jumping class this season, a bench member in the match against Hiroshima on the 22nd.
He didn't give him the opportunity to compete, but so far in J3, there is an outstanding part in terms of scoring points against a striker who has scored three goals in five games this season. I'm 17 years old, but I want Gamshara to do it more and more. I've seen players going abroad at a young age, but I want them to play with a high level of awareness and greed."
Karayama scored 8 goals in 10 games in J3, where he competed as a specially designated player last season.
Although he is slender at 178 centimeters and 65 kilograms, he boasts an astonishing scoring rate of 11 goals in 15 games in J3, thanks to his sense of taking the back of the defender with instantaneous movement, and his calmness until he shows a shot in front of a dense opponent's goal.
In the match against Hiroshima, forward Ademiouson and midfielder Onose were off the bench due to injuries, and Karayama had a chance, but he did not have a chance to compete.
Coach Miyamoto explained the condition of Ademiouson and Onose in the run-up to the match against Kobe, saying, "Both of them are not 100%, but they are eager to prepare."
When it comes to preserving the two, there is a possibility that they will be on the bench in Tangshan again.
At G Osaka, midfielder Doan, the current PSV, made his J1 debut when he was 16 years old and 11 months old, and forward Usami made his J1 debut when he was 17 years old and 0 months old, and moved to overseas in his 10s.
Karayama, currently 17 years old and 10 months old, who is expected to be the next talent, is also expected to make his J1 debut as a follow-up to them.
Ferrari, which was stolen 26 years ago, is found at the bottom of the river ✨ Go to work without restoration (octane.jp) - Yahoo!News
In 1994, there was an incident where Ferrari Mondial was stolen in the Netherlands.
Time had passed without the police being able to solve it, but 26 years later, the Mondial was miraculously discovered.
The discovery of Ferrari (four photos) found at the bottom of the river was triggered by diving training at the fire department.
On July 8th, a diver in training found something in a wedge shape that sank to the bottom of the river, and the police and even the Dutch army were dispatched, and when they pulled something up, it was Ferrari Mondial.
By comparing the VIN number with the database of stolen vehicles, we were able to associate this Ferrari with the 1994 incident.
The car was handed over to its legal owner, the insurance company, and then sent to the scrap company.
Scrap contractor Lowie van DE Ooyevaar said, "There are still a few remaining parts, but they are for the art of decorating. We have already received many requests from people who want to make a table from the torn apart Mondial. We will use engine blocks and glass plates."
For the time being, they are not considering any specific sales, and the scrap company will store it as an object-like existence.
Seibu and Sotozaki hit goodbye for the first time
In his sixth year as a professional, the "man who doesn't have it" is finally here!
(Sankei Sports) - Yahoo!News
(Pa League, Seibu 3x-2 Lotte, 9th round, Seibu 6 wins, 3 losses, 24th, MetLife) It's an obsessive white star!
On the 24th, Seibu's Sotozaki Shuta Uchino-te (27) hit nine times in the 9th round of Lotte (MetLife) and his first goodbye strike to the left front in his sixth year as a professional, contributing to the 3-2 victory.
He took advantage of the opportunities staged by Genda's headsliding and forest hits.
The team that competed together set their savings to 2.
The voltage of the Leo party crammed into their home base, MetLife Dome, reached its climax.
Sotozaki hit goodbye for the first time in his sixth year as a professional.
It aroused an audience of 4825 people.
"Gen (Genda) and Tomoya (Mori) connected me, so I entered the batting with the desire to do something about it." My colleague's obsession with victory inspired number 5.
Celebrated nine times with 2-2.
The lead batter, Genda, tried a safety bunt, headsliding with vigor to the first base.
When he went to base with an infield hit, last season's top batter Mori scored his second professional hit.
No. 4, Yamakawa avoided declaration.
A senior at Fuji University was walking, and Sotozaki's heart was on fire.
I thought, "Damn it." Before Yamakawa went to the first base, he said to me, "Be proactive," which made me feel really excited."
He was stuck in a straight ball with a high inner angle from one ball, but the batting fell to the left front.
Throughout his amateur days, he said goodbye to "no memory".
His alma mater, Aomori and Hirosaki Sanetaka, advanced to the top four summer prefectural tournaments for the first time in 20 years, and the 27-year-old, who was also stimulated, took a joyful water shower and said with a smile, "It was pleasant as I expected."
It was called "the man who doesn't have it".
He was selected as Samurai Japan as an all-purpose player who can protect the inside and outfield, and contributed to the best in the world at "Premier 12" last November.
However, he had no experience hitting goodbye at Seibu, and coach Tsuji and Operation Baba and defensive and running base coach bullied him, saying, "I don't have it, you."
He repels his negative reputation and directs a goodbye victory for the second time this season.
Director Tsuji praised him, saying, "I asked the goddess of victory to ask for it only today. She hit me well."
With 2 savings, he ranked 3rd with a difference of 1 game from Softbank.
With only one home run this season, Sotozaki, with a batting rate of 252, strengthened his speech, saying, "We still have to hit more. We will work together as a team to aim for the next win."
A hit that decides the game triggers a recovery.

Minoru Pig Farming (represented by Nakanowatari Minoru), which raises about 50,000 pigs annually at farms in Towada City and Rokunohe Town, visited Mayor Oyamada Hisashi at Towada City Hall on the 20th, and reported that their farm has obtained "JGAP (livestock and livestock products) certification" indicating the safety of agricultural and livestock products.
This is the second case of a pig farming company in the prefecture.
The company produces "garlic pork" that uses powdered garlic from the prefecture as special feed, and "local pig farming" that uses rice from the prefecture.
This time, out of the five farms, JGAP certification was obtained at Farm No. 5 (Rokunohe-cho), which raises about 10,000 pigs and produces "local pig farming".
The company aimed to obtain certification because it learned that "certification is necessary to get major buyers to choose it" and that it was a condition for procuring ingredients to be used in the Athletes' Village for the Tokyo Olympics.
With the support of the Aomori Bank since August last year, preparations have been made together with bank staff qualified as JGAP instructors.
It was reviewed by a certification body on March 3rd of this year, and cleared a total of 113 criteria, including food safety.
Certification was obtained on the 13th of the same month.
The company's representative, Nakanowatari Minoru, Managing Director of Nakanowatari University, Yamada Takeo, Towada Minami Branch Manager of Aomori Bank, and Ishigo Yoshihiro, Business Advisor of the Bank's Corporate Support Department, attended the visit.
Mayor Oyamada sent a cheer saying, "It's very wonderful. I hope it will greatly promote (JGAP certification) and lead to the expansion of sales channels."
Representative Nakanowatari Minoru said with enthusiasm, "I would like to continue to make efforts to brand pig farming and contribute to Towada City."
Managing Director Nakanowatari University said, "We aim to obtain certification for the remaining four farms as well."

The U.S. and Chinese governments criticized each other and called for the closure of the consulate, which became a selling material.
Another weight of the market was that the momentum of the spread of the new corona virus had not subsided in the United States.
By brand, Intel for semiconductors fell by 16%.
The delay in the development of next-generation semiconductors was disgusting.

Torrential rains, scars on "traffic" in Hokuen National Route 152 10 km closed, some sections of the JR Iida Line closed | Shizuoka Newspaper @S
National Route 152 has been completely closed, and a queue of cars waiting for alternating detours on one side: On the afternoon of the 22nd, Ryuzan-cho, Tenryu-ku, Hamamatsu (some of the photos have been processed)
The Tenryu area of Hamamatsu City was severely damaged in Shizuoka Prefecture due to torrential rains in July that caused tremendous damage to Kyushu and other parts of Japan.
The effects of landslides remain on the main road, National Route 152, and the JR Iida Line, which is the "foot of daily life", and there are many places where it takes time to recover.
In addition to the inconvenience of daily life, residents are anxious about the adverse effects on economic activity.
At Sejiri Bridge, which spans the Tenryu River in Ryuzan-cho, the same ward, long convoys waiting for traffic continue during the day.
The leading car stopped for nearly 40 minutes.
National Route 152 has been completely closed for about 10 kilometers, and a detour to the opposite bank of the Tenryu River is required to move around the town.
However, the width of the road is narrow, and all sections are alternating on one side, so the waiting time cannot be predicted.
In the town, a landslide occurred on a national highway on the 9th, and traffic was closed due to the risk of falling rocks on nearby slopes.
On the 13th, a crack was found in the Akiba Tunnel within the regulated section, and there is still no prospect of resuming traffic.
In the town, the national highway was closed in 2018 due to collapsed soil, and the lives of residents and tourism were damaged.
Tamamoto Kimie (76), president of the Dragon Mama Processing Plant, which sells specialty products, drops her voice, saying, "The new coronavirus is a hit while the number of customers is far away. The number of visitors is decreasing significantly."
The JR Iida Line was closed between Mizukubo Station (Mizukubo-cho, the same ward) and Hiraoka Station (Nagano Prefecture) due to the collapse of a slope beside the track.
Ukai Shiori (16), who was attending Hamamatsu Kohoku High School Sakuma Branch School in Sakuma-cho, the same ward from Oarashi Station (the same town) in the disconnected section, needed to pick up a car for about an hour one way.
"A car puts a heavy burden on both parents and themselves," he said, hoping for an early recovery.
According to JR Central, it is expected to take about three months to reopen, and from the 27th, there will be a special train going back and forth between Mizukubo Station and Oarashi Station one by one in the morning and evening on weekdays.
In Mizukubo Town, landslides occur frequently on forest roads that are also living roads.
In some cases, it takes several hours to take a detour.
Kumagai Keiji (69), chairman of the Mizukubo Town Forestry Association, clouded his expression, saying, "The transport of raw wood has also been delayed. There are isolated islands on land everywhere. I'm worried about rain in the future."
Nakajima Shoya, is it your choice to be absent from the winning ceremony?
Local media report (Football Channel) - Yahoo!News
It seems that Japanese national midfielder Nakajima Shoya is heading to leave Porto.
Portugal's ZAP reported it based on information from Recorde.
Porto, who won the Portuguese league in the 2019/20 season, held a winning ceremony on the pitch during the final round of the home on the 20th of this month.
However, the fact that there was no Nakajima in this place has just become a hot topic.
Nakajima, who refused to join the team practice during the league interruption due to the new coronavirus, has since been missed.
Against this backdrop, he was also absent from the winning ceremony, so his transfer this summer is being discussed.
According to Recorde, Porto invited Nakajima to the ceremony.
However, Nakajima just didn't show up.
As a result, "Nakajima is increasingly out of Sergio Consason's plan for next season. He needs to leave the club at the next transfer market".
Nakajima is a prestigious Portuguese family and carries the 10th on his back, but it seems that he has left the team after a year.
Maybe they are already starting to look for a new world.
Ring of light, horizontal rainbow co-starring Yamagata observes sun halo and ring horizontal arc|Yamagata Newspaper
A horizontal rainbow-colored horizontal arc appeared at the same time under the sun halo surrounding the sun at 8:43am on the 24th, near Takado, Yamagata City
A phenomenon that appears to be a halo of a ring of light surrounding the sun and a horizontal arc of a rainbow-colored band of light appeared at the same time in Yamagata City before 9am on the 24th.
According to the Yamagata Regional Meteorological Observatory, both the sun halo and the horizontal arc are caused by the refraction and reflection of sunshine hitting fine ice crystals in the clouds.
An ordinary rainbow looks in the opposite direction of the sun, but the ring horizontal arc is characterized by the fact that it looks in the same direction as the sun.
Although the sun halo is a relatively common phenomenon, it is said that the ring horizontal arc does not appear as frequently as the sun halo.
On this day, a sun halo was also observed in Takahatake-cho.
Takeda Chieko (75), a housewife from Fukuzawa in the same town, confirmed at home around 11am when her daughter told her that there was a strange rainbow.

45% of families have wives holding their wallets!
Is my husband happy or unhappy?
Isn't there a wife who is thrilled or angry when her husband says, "I don't have enough allowance this month..."
The family where this conversation is established is the family where the wife is holding the wallet.
How many families in the world have wives holding their wallets?
Also, let's take a look at the proportion of "wallets by couple" and "jointly managed".
Which one holds the household's wallet?
Matsui Securities Co., Ltd. conducted an Internet survey of a total of 800 people, including 400 men and women in their 20s and 30s (young couples) who have been married for three years or less, and 400 men and women in their 50s and 60s (mature couples) who have been married for more than 30 years, and the results of the "Survey on the Household Management Situation of Couples" (announced in June 2019) show the following results.
Who holds the household's wallet?
Wife: 45.0% Husband: 24.8% The most common result was a family whose wife manages the household budget.
Whichever one manages, there are twists and turns in household management, but it seems that there are various episodes.
My wife manages household finances: Aako's case Aako is a Warmama from Arafif, who has a daughter in her third year of high school and her first year of high school.
Ms. Aako is in full control of the household budget.
As the university entrance exams were approaching, cram school fees were high and there were more months when there was a deficit, so I negotiated to lower my allowance to my husband, but sure enough, I was resisted.
At that time, I was told to "show me what kind of income and expenditure it is", so I showed my household account.
Even though all expenses should have been listed, if you look at household accounts, the income and expenditure was not enough to be in the red.
I was about to be approached by my husband, saying, "It's enough," but Ms. Aako unexpectedly said, "Okay, I don't have enough power in household management, so please manage everything," and if I cut off the big bargain, I'm likely to be refunded, saying, "Please do it after all."
Later, when Aako interviewed her husband, she said, "Although she is dissatisfied with the fact that allowances are managed, the truth is that she doesn't have the time or energy to manage various household expenses (e.g., school teaching materials and PTA expenses)."
Husband manages household finances: In the case of Ms. B Ms. B, a full-time housewife, is given living expenses by her husband and manages it every day.
Last spring, the freezer part of the refrigerator was broken, so Ms. B asked her husband to buy a refrigerator.
However, my husband was reluctant to replace it, saying, "I can't use the freezer, but I can still use the refrigerator, so it's okay."
However, in the summer, it seems that her husband wanted to create an environment where he could eat ice cream at any time, and his palm turned over, saying, "Let's buy a refrigerator after all."
So B-ko unintentionally complained to her friend, "My husband is so stingy that he's stingy."
Kubo Takehide has been narrowed down to five clubs in Spain's first division (Tospo Web) - Yahoo!News
It seems that the transfer destinations of Japanese national team MF Kubo Takehide(19), who played for Majorca in Spain's first division this season, are gradually being narrowed down.
Although Majorca was demoted to the second division, Kubo's reputation rose sharply due to his success at the end of the season.
However, it will be difficult to return to Real Madrid in the first division, which has "ownership rights" due to the framework outside the EU, so he plans to play for other clubs next season.
They have already received offers from about 30 clubs, but R Madrid plans to have them train as warriors at domestic clubs.
The Spanish newspaper "Marca" reported that Real Sociedad, Villarreal, Granada, Getafe and Betis are the dominant destinations for Kubo's transfer, and that "five clubs are interested in winning Kubo, but R Madrid wants a club above the middle of the league".
Among them, Villarreal and R Sociedad will qualify for the Europa League (EL) next season, and Granada will compete from the second round of the EL qualifier, which will meet the team requirements required by R Madrid.
What kind of decision will the world's number one big club make to accomplish the "treasure of Japan"?

Karamon Gate illuminated by fireworks and light launched vividly at nationwide events on the evening of July 24th, Ichijodani Asakura Ruins in Fukui City, Fukui Prefecture
On the evening of July 24th, less than one year before the start of the Tokyo Olympics, which had been postponed due to the spread of the new corona virus, a nationwide fireworks event was held by the Japan Youth Chamber (JC) to enliven society as brightly as possible.
Unfortunately, it was raining in Fukui Prefecture, but nine locations were launched as scheduled, coloring the summer night sky.
The JC called on block councils across the country to overcome the sense of stagnation caused by the spread of the infection and serve as a signal for Japan to be reborn.
It started at 8 p.m. at 117 locations in 46 prefectures.
At the Ichijodani Asakura Clan Ruins in Fukui City, a total of 53 rounds, including the 2nd to 4th balls, were launched for about two minutes while the surrounding mountains were covered with haze.
With the light of the fireworks, the Karamon Gate emerged in the dark night, creating a fantastic atmosphere.
In the prefecture, it was also held along the Matsubara coast in Tsuruga City and along the Mana River in Ono City.
In order to prevent infection, we did not announce the launch location in advance because we wanted to avoid attracting many onlookers.
