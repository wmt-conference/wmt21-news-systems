Honoka becomes [Minami Tanaka style hair]!
Report on the whole cut (CanCam.jp) - Yahoo! News
Add a layer to the heavy semi-long [everyone's real style] for fluffy hair
CanCam model Honoka challenges a moving hairstyle like Minami Tanaka, who admires, "Of course it is beautiful, but it is very professional and I respect it!"
I asked Mitsuteru Asahi of the hair salon "SUNVALLY" in Omotesando, who is actually working on Minami Tanaka's haircut, to make it "Minami's real style hair".
Report on that cutting process!
Nogizaka46 Mizuki Yamashita, short hair and first cover!
First, check the faint hair before cutting.
Thin, soft, and abundant.
There is a habit, especially during the rainy season, so you can apply a straight perm.
It is a heavy semi-long with sink bangs.
Finally start cutting!
First, lightly wet the whole so that it is easy to cut.
After that, separate the top of the bee (the part above the most protruding circumference of the head) and cut from the bottom.
By the way, here are the points of hair that will bring you closer to Minoru!
1 Table bang By shortening the inside of the bangs a little, you can enjoy changes depending on the styling, such as thickening it a little when you lower it full, and see-through the skin when you divide it lightly.
2 Cut that makes the most of the habit If the hairy habit Ari reduces the amount of hair too much, it may spread.
While discussing the balance around it, it is easy to handle and hard to spread, and maintains a balance that makes your own swell live.
3 Layers around the face and hair layers = cuts that are cut with steps.
Layers around the face make it easier to move and have a cute finish.
If you make your hair in three places, before and after your temples and momiage, it will look fashionable even when you put it together quickly.
After cutting the hair on the bee that was separated, around the face.
Pull the hair bundle on the upper part around the face forward and cut the ends of the hair a little.
This way, when the hair bundle is lowered, there is a step and it is easier to move (this is a layer cut).

Governor Yoshimura to "partner with Gurunavi" against Corona (Sankei Sports) --Yahoo! News
Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura (45) of Osaka Prefecture made a remote appearance on Osaka ABC TV "Cast" (Monday-Friday 3.48) from the prefectural office on the 20th, and revealed that he is considering a tie-up with the restaurant information website "Gurunavi" as part of measures to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus infection.
From early this month, Osaka Prefecture has issued an "Infection Prevention Declaration Sticker" to businesses that comply with the guidelines in order to promote efforts to prevent the spread of infection and provide peace of mind to the citizens of the prefecture.
However, the number of stickers issued in the prefecture, which is said to be more than 120,000 restaurants alone, is only 11,000.
Therefore, Governor Yoshimura declared a tag with the Internet reservation site, saying, "I'm thinking of doing it at the end of the month, but I will partner with" Gurunavi "and set up a store that issues declaration stickers when making a reservation so that I can understand it at the reservation stage.
"The important thing is not to lump it together with the 'night city'. It is important to clearly separate the stores that are doing infectious disease countermeasures and the stores that are not doing it. It is also important to make efforts to increase the number of stores that do it."

The poet and fairy tale writer Kenji Miyazawa (1896-1933) exhibited a notebook in which he and the residents of Toyosawa Town, where he grew up, sent donations to the areas affected by the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923 (Taisho 12).

Lotte's 4th year high school graduate, Taneichi is the first professional shutout!
No.4 Yasuda V hit, Toritani no good push 2 points hit (Baseball King) --Yahoo! News
● Seibu 0-5 Lotte ○ < 10th round, MetLife Dome > Lotte is the first professional shutout in the 4th year, with starting pitcher Atsuki Taneichi throwing 136 balls alone in the 9th inning.
He won his third win in the Pacific League shutout Ichiban ride this season and stopped the team's losing streak at 2.
For the first time, Taneichi allowed the leading Shohei Suzuki to go on base with a double that broke the third base line, but immediately after that, Sosuke Genda was hit with three ground balls, and during this time, Masaru Suzuki, who aimed to advance to base, also touched out at third base.
Helped by the calm response of the ally defense, he escaped the pinch of rising with zero, and after the second inning, he tossed the Seibu batting line with a combination of sliders and forks centered on the proud straight.
Raise the tone and line up zeros on the scoreboard.
The batting line was hitting the opponent's starting pitcher Keisuke Honda, but Takeshi Sugano, the third in the 7th inning, went on base on a walk, and substitute runner Oka Omi succeeded in stealing.
On this chance, No.4 Naonori Yasuda hit a right front hit of 1,000 gold and finally broke the balance.
Then, in the following eight times, he attacked the opponent's third place, Tetsu Miyagawa, and scored four goals at once, including the left middle two-run hit, which is the first timely after the transfer of Takashi Toritani, who was participating in the middle.
I folded it to push the back of the young Marines ace candidate and decided the game at once.
After clearing up eight times with a three-way retreat, Taneichi continued to throw nine times over 100 pitches.
"I was strong" and invited a pinch of two dead bases with a consecutive walk, but in the end, I took the 10th strikeout of the day with a high straight from Spangenberg and set the game.
I chewed joy with a smile.
Bye-bye to accident in new operation Tsuruoka station, safety enlightenment in cooperation with related organizations | Yamagata Shimbun
At the bicycle class held as the start event of the operation, a collision experiment between a car and a bicycle was conducted = Tsuruoka City, Shoko Gakuen Driving School
In recent years, the Tsuruoka Police Station (Chief Keizo Sato) has launched the "Bye-bye Accident Zero Operation" in an attempt to eliminate accidents involving bicycles and motorcycles, which have occurred at a high rate in the jurisdiction.
In addition to promoting awareness of accident prevention with traffic safety organizations in the jurisdiction, we will strengthen the crackdown on bicycle traffic rule violations.
Three traffic fatal accidents have occurred in the jurisdiction of the station this year, and a person who was driving a motorcycle or bicycle has died.
Although the number of accidents is on a decreasing trend, the rate of accidents involving bicycles is about 11.7% as of June 30, and motorcycles are about 5.8%, both higher than the prefectural average.
In particular, the rate of bicycle accidents in the past five years has often exceeded the prefectural average, and we planned a strategy to overcome this situation.
The name of the operation is "bike" and "bicycle" multiplied by the meaning of accident eradication.
We will ask related organizations to encourage the elderly to drive and use night light reflectors more than ever in traffic safety classes.
The station will issue a yellow card (guidance warning card) at the time of crackdowns to call attention.
The opening ceremony of the operation was held on the 21st at the Shoko Gakuen Driving School in Tsuruoka City.
About 30 people concerned attended, and Chief Sato said, "I would like to ask for your cooperation in reducing even one tragic accident."
The person in charge of the station showed the policy and the activities of each organization.
A bicycle class will continue to be held as the start event of the operation.
A police officer in a car demonstrated how the impact on a bicycle differs between braking and crashing into a bicycle at about 55 km / h without stepping on the brake.
Koichi Kanauchi, chairman of the Tsuruoka District Regional Traffic Safety Activity Promotion Committee, said, "I realized the horror of traffic accidents again. I want to call attention not only to the elderly but also to young people."

Kisuke Kaminarimon (75), a rakugo storyteller based in Akasaka-tei, and others invited visitors to laugh with professional storytelling.
At the request of a vassal who was sentenced to abstinence by the lord, Kisuke performed a "abstinence banya" in which a liquor store trying to bring in sake had a humorous exchange with the gatekeeper.
I laughed many times at the crisp narrative and the delicious gesture of drinking sake.
A male office worker (58) = Naka-ku, Okayama City = who visited as a couple smiled, saying, "The way of speaking and how to take a break is exquisite, and I was immediately drawn in."
Kisuke said, "My voice was not in good shape at the performance after a long time, but it was a fulfilling time."
Guest rakugo storyteller Katsura Kodome (31) = Osaka City, magic group Tsuyama Magic Club also appeared.
In 1996, the former Akasaka-tei opened as the first public yose in Japan.
He continued to hold regular monthly vaudeville and delivery vaudeville, but due to the influence of the new Corona, he canceled the vaudeville at the end of the performance in February this year.

[Moscow joint] A demonstration was held on the 25th in protest of the detention and dismissal of Governor Fulgal in the Khabarovsk region of the Russian Far East.
The demonstration was an unusual situation for the 15th consecutive day.
Criticism has also been directed at President Putin.
In the capital, Moscow, the security authorities did not take the usual step of detaining all the people at once, and the administration's cautious stance of considering the feelings of the residents is reflected.
Former Governor Fulgal, who belongs to the far-right Liberal Democratic Party, overwhelmingly won the incumbent candidate of Putin's ruling party "United Russia" in the gubernatorial runoff vote in 2018 with about 70% of the vote.
He was one of the few non-ruling governors in Russia, but was detained by security officials on the 9th of this month.
The charges were announced as involvement in two murders of businessmen between 2004 and 2005.

Eleven high school students produced it as part of the class in the morning, three days a week from June.
After molding the clay that has been stretched with force by die cutting, straw is wrapped around it to produce the red pattern "Hidasuki" peculiar to Bizen ware.
It will be completed in about two to three weeks, including the drying and firing processes.

Butler again praises Tyler Hero, a young warrior who will bear the future of the heat "The way of thinking is not that of a rookie" (Basket Count) --Yahoo! News
Photo = Getty Images Heat scrimmage (practice game) The first match is against the Kings.
Duncan Robinson scored a team-high 18 points in a 104-98 win, followed by Tyler Hero with 15 points in the backcourt.
In addition to Robinson, one of the best shooters in the league, the step-up of rookies and heroes nominated for 13th place in the entire draft will be an important factor for the heat.
Hero missed 15 games from February to March due to an ankle injury, and the season entered a long break after his return match against the Hornets on March 12.
Hero said, "I had a lot of time, so I was able to regain 100% condition. It's the best feeling I've ever felt," but the performance at the scrimmage was more convincing than words.
The hero's playtime increased due to the delay in joining starting point guard Kendrick Nunn, and he took advantage of that opportunity.
It's worth it because it's 15 points after playing a different role.
Team leader Jimmy Butler praised the "favorite" hero again.
"He can be a handler, he can score points, he can defend. He is a player who can do everything for the team. I can do it in any position because the way of thinking is not that of a rookie. I watch the video and study it, and my teammates are hitting their heads on where and how they move and become free, and what I should do about it."
Even before the start of the season, Butler likes the hero's rookie-like strength and his stoic attitude towards basketball.
That's why I invited him to practice privately starting at 4 am and trained together.
Butler once said, "He gives his opinion to everyone and does not withdraw. I can respect that fighting spirit."
Butler is the type who always says what he thinks, and if he thinks it will be for the team, he knows that a collision will occur and gives a harsh opinion.
In the past, this has worsened my relationship with my teammates.
Butler seems to be superimposing his youth on his hero.
Butler's personality, which is sometimes too harsh for his teammates, is a good guide for those who have the guts to follow it.
If the mentor and pupil relationship between the two who respect each other spreads to the whole team, the Heat should be a team that can aim even higher.
Shimasho takes the initiative in the first round of the 2020 Summer Shizuoka High School Baseball Tournament Shimada Sho-Hamamatsu Johokuko | Shizuoka Shimbun at S
Shimada Sho-Hamamatsu Johokuko 1st inning back Shimada Sho undead bases loaded, Matsuura hits first = Kusanagi Stadium
▽ 4th round (Kusanagi 1st game) Hamamatsu Johokuko 0000000-0 410000 × -5 Shimada Sho ▽ Match time 1 hour 26 minutes
[Review] Shimada Sho took advantage of the opportunity in the early stages and won the shutout against Hamamatsu Johokuko.
Shimada Sho started with Matsuura's two-run timely hit on the first bases loaded with no death.
He added two more points with an infield grounder and a squeeze.
Saito pitched the sixth inning with only one hit and no runs.
Hamamatsu Johokuko did not take advantage of the opportunity of two dead bases loaded in the final inning.
■ 4th round led by 3 years
2nd year Matsuura, thank you first strike
It was No.4 in the second year, which was his first appearance this summer, that he defeated the opponent.
Matsuura of Shimada Sho hit a change ball with the first bases loaded without death and carried it to the front left.
"If you lose for three years, you will retire immediately. I wanted to hit and win."
The talented player who played No.4 last fall was proud.
In the first and third rounds, he fought mainly for three years, and in the second year with power, he was sidelined.
Coach Ikeda gathered the players at the meeting and told Nine, "Three years have been connected so far. I will be the best member in the future."
On this day, four of the nine starters solidified their main axis in two years.
It seems ruthless, but it is evidence that he is committed to a serious game.
Matsuura said, "From now on, the level of the opponent's pitcher will rise. I will face it with the intention of returning the runner."
Saito, who pitched consecutively, did not even step on second base with a good throw that kept the sixth inning to one hit, and showed his willingness for three years.
The uniform number 10 is a favorable reception as a synergistic effect, saying, "Two years will inspire three years. If it leads to victory."
The team, which is aiming to enter the top four for the third year in a row, including the Shizuoka tournament until last year, does not intend to make memories of the remaining games.
16 musicians related to Fukushima Prefecture gather in the world of singing voices with the citizens of the prefecture (Fukushima Minpo) --Yahoo! News
I want to deliver the energetic singing voices of Hama, Naka, and Aizu to the world.
Sixteen musicians related to Fukushima Prefecture gathered to create a message song.
The lyrics describe the single-minded appearance of Fukushima Prefecture, which is fighting the new coronavirus as it walks toward recovery from the Great East Japan Earthquake and the accident at TEPCO's Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant.
By imbuing the singing voice of the citizens of the prefecture, the "complete version" will be completed by next summer, which will be the 10th anniversary of the earthquake.
On the 24th, the song was released on the video posting site "YouTube".
The song title is "Pray from Fukushima".
I put the desire to "convey the positive attitude of people from Fukushima" on a bright and energetic melody.
Due to the influence of the new Corona, the live house, which is the base of music activities, was forced to close, and many musicians lost the place to sing and perform.
Singer-songwriter nappo (46) living in Minamisoma City and DAZU-O (37) of the music group "Mehikari Boys" in Iwaki City planned to believe in the power of music because you can't see the future.
Nappo is in charge of lyrics and composition, and Dazuo is in charge of rap.
When the project started in March of the corona disaster, singer-songwriters MANAMI (28) and Jun Kanno (38) from Fukushima City agreed one after another, and the circle spread in a blink of an eye.
Mr. Nappo said, "It became a gorgeous face that can not be thought of in normal times. I want to fully enjoy this opportunity."
As a measure against infection, there was no opportunity for 16 people to gather, and each recorded at a live house or at home.
In an attempt to support the project, a painter from Iwaki City drew an image character.
It is modeled after Fukushima Prefecture and expresses a climate rich in nature with blue and green.
The completed song will be sent to the world on YouTube and will be made into a CD.
Next year will mark the 10th anniversary of the earthquake, and the postponed Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics will be held.
Mr. Dazuo said, "We have overcome difficulties and have a lot to carry. I hope that releasing the song at the milestone will encourage many people."
Other participating musicians are as follows.

Instant detection of crisis occurrence from online information, judgment of hoaxes (JBpress) --Yahoo! News
"I want to know where and what kind of disaster or accident occurred as soon as possible!"
This is not limited to news organizations such as television and newspapers, but also many companies such as social infrastructure companies and local governments have strong needs.
The service that responds to this is "Specty" developed by Spectee, which handles information analysis using AI.

Now, the first way people know about disasters and accidents is shifting from television to online information (social media).
Social media such as Twitter have become important media for disseminating information immediately after a disaster or accident occurs.
However, it is difficult to manually watch the overflowing information and extract useful information from it.
Specty detects information related to natural disasters and accidents from information flowing on social media such as Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, analyzes the content, determines the authenticity of the information, and distributes it to the user company.
"A wide range of events with negative impacts that stop or stagnate social activities are positioned as" crises "" (Kenjiro Murakami, CEO), a crisis management support service that visualizes various crises occurring in Japan and overseas.
NHK at the time of the Kumamoto earthquake that occurred in April 2016 was the first major use case of Specty, and since then, the movement of adoption has spread rapidly among companies.
It is said that more than 350 companies in Japan, including TV stations and newspapers, as well as companies that support social infrastructure such as electricity, gas and transportation, and local governments all over the country, are currently using Specti.
■ Analyze posts to determine the type and location of "crisis"
Specty distributes information in four steps: "collection of information," "analysis and content classification," "titling," and "authenticity judgment."
The user company specifies in advance the area (prefecture, municipality, etc.) to collect information and the category of crisis (disaster, accident, etc.).
Specty collects posts that fall under that designation using APIs provided by social media.
Then, the text, images, and videos contained in the collected posts are analyzed and classified.
For example, if there is a video showing a fire engine, black smoke rising from the building, and orange flames coming out of the room, it will be classified as "fire."
In addition, images of overturned cars are classified as "traffic accidents", and images of flooded roads are classified as "road flooding".
Specty also estimates where disasters and accidents occur.
"Since the location is often unknown from the posts, we estimate it by combining various information," says Murakami.
For example, if a road sign or signboard is reflected in an image or video, the information of the place name is extracted from it, and the location is identified by collating with the place name database.

"Crowded" and "Uchinchi" don't work......?
I asked the people of Chiba Prefecture "Words I thought were not really dialects" (Netorabo) --Yahoo! News
I am a resident of Chiba Prefecture near Tokyo.
I have lived in the prefecture for less than 30 years since I was born.
When I used it in a conversation with a friend at a university (Tokyo), it was momentarily called Kyoton.
I was able to understand the meaning with the flow and the sense of words, but I was told by the people of Tokyo and Saitama that I would not use it.
― ― Certainly, "Zuru crowded → Is it going to slip and enter sideways?"
Since it seems to be connected with, it seems that the meaning can be guessed somehow.
Then one more thing.
This was pointed out and I didn't notice it, but the expression "Uchinchi", which means "my house", was not used at all even if I read books, and I didn't hear it from my friends, so I looked it up after I became an adult and it was a dialect.
― ― What is "Uchinchi"?... Was that so?
I use it in my hometown (Gunma Prefecture), but I didn't notice it because I didn't use it naturally after I became an adult......
Japanese "chilled Chinese" is not popular with Chinese people...?
"Cold noodle dish" unpopular reason (modern business) --Yahoo! News
Chilled Chinese noodles in China are "Japanese cold noodles"
As mentioned at the beginning, chilled Chinese is a Chinese dish (Japanese style Chinese) that originated in Japan, which was devised based on the Chinese "lian bang mien / chilled mixed soba".
Therefore, although it does not originally exist in China, it has come to be seen in Japanese restaurants in the summer due to the diversification of food.
Recently, Japanese convenience stores have also introduced arranged products called "Japanese-style soba chilled side / soba chilled Chinese" and "Kawaka chicken chilled side / Sichuan-style chicken chilled Chinese".
On the other hand, Japanese-style Chinese cuisine is generally not very popular in China, pushed by trendy and punchy Chinese dishes such as Sichuan cuisine and Hunan cuisine.
Naturally, the seasoning of Japanese-style Chinese is often familiar to Chinese people.
Therefore, it is not bad, but it tends to be criticized badly for its poor impact.
"Chilled Chinese" is no exception, and it is still a minor presence in China.
By the way, the name of chilled Chinese in China is "Japanese cold noodles".
It is recognized by the Chinese as one of the Japanese dishes.
The summer staple is "Liangpi"
In China, the noodle dish that feels summer is "Liangpi".
In Japan, many people may not be familiar with it, but Liangpi is a flat noodle made from flour, rice flour, starch, etc. that originated in Shaanxi Province.
It is said that it has a history of 2000 years.
It is a standard B-class gourmet that is also sold at food stalls, and the price is around 10 to 20 yuan (150 to 300 yen), which is very reasonable.
It has the word "cool" in it, but like Japanese chilled Chinese, it is not made with ice.
Rather, it is basic at room temperature.
Top the noodles with your favorite ingredients such as shredded cucumbers, carrots, and boiled bean sprouts, and add condiments such as coriander, pepper, ginger, and garlic.
Finally, add a special seasoning that is a mixture of soy sauce, chili oil, vinegar, sesame paste, peanut paste, etc.
The spicy sauce, which is refreshing and rich in acidity, is often entwined with the noodles that are easy to swallow and pull, and even when you have a summer fatigue and have no appetite, you can easily get in.
In addition, since it has permeated all over China, there are various toppings and seasonings, and the rich variety is also a feature of Liangpi, and it is one of the ways to enjoy it.

Benefits of "cold water shower" for body and mind (Cosmopolitan) --Yahoo! News
Suppresses inflammation such as muscle pain
A study published in The North American Journal of Medical Sciences that examined the effectiveness of hydrotherapy (a treatment using water) found that it can be expected to have a physical and mental healing effect.
By bathing in cold water after exercise, muscle pain and other inflammatory effects can be suppressed.
According to Professor Douglas Casa, head of the Korey Stringer Institute, which studies sports medicine and teaches at the University of Connecticut, "It is important to exercise and take a cold water shower as soon as possible. By lowering the body temperature immediately after moving the body, recovery from inflammation and fatigue caused by exercise will be faster."
Reduce fatigue
When exercising in high temperatures, the heart, muscles, and skin need more blood flow than usual.
"When exercising, the heart rate is high, which increases blood flow to the heart, and it takes energy to contract muscles, which increases muscle blood flow. Also, when it comes to the skin, a lot of blood flows in to regulate body temperature," says Casa.
"Taking a cold water shower lowers the temperature of the skin, so you can reduce the blood flow sent to the skin. Instead, blood flow is sent to internal organs such as the stomach and intestines, so it is easier to consume water and nutrients after exercise. As a result, you can reduce the fatigue you feel after exercise."
Expectations for hormesis effect
Drozewski also explains that bathing in cold water can be expected to activate the "hormesis effect."
The hormesis effect is the idea that it is better to have a small amount of substances and stress that are harmful to the body than not at all.
"Hypoxia, petit fasting, and cold water showers are prime examples of hormesis effects for health. Cold water showers stimulate hormones and neurotransmitters to increase physical and physical toughness and resilience."

It was also a valuable one that I hit from an opponent I was not good at.
When he played against Yu Ohno at Koshien on the 17th, he captured 9 hits and 4 goals.
However, as far as Nagoya Dome is concerned, he has allowed 7 wins, 1 loss and 1 hold in the past 12 games, and has been suffering from 7 consecutive losses with a draw since August 23, 2013.
From such a difficult enemy, he scored for the first time in 23 innings at Nagoya Dome (even one inning on the way) with a dynamic single shot and did not pass the flow of the game.
Manager Yano also said, "It is a high level to be able to kill a sweet ball firmly. There is a stately look, and there is an atmosphere even if the timing of hitting is foul. I think that it will still hit."
In the first inning, he hit a right front hit, which marked six consecutive hits and three consecutive hits.
Although the opening was a preliminary start, 7 home runs and 16 RBIs have already worked perfectly as the team's top and 4th.
We will continue to produce results for victory.

Corona disaster "Closer to art" Online art museum "HASARD" Konno (from Hachinohe) launched (Daily Tohoku Shimbun) --Yahoo! News
There is a museum where anyone can come into contact with art for free whenever they want.
The collection ranges from famous painters such as Claude Monet and Gustav Klimt to unknown artists in Japan.
Since its "opening" in April 2019, the online museum "HASARD" has grabbed the hearts of users for its convenience and newness, and the attention has further increased with the opportunity of a new lifestyle due to the corona disaster.
Shinnosuke Konno, 26, a representative from Hachinohe City who launched the site, lives in Tokyo and says, "I wanted to create a service where everyone can easily enjoy art. I want people to come into contact with art in difficult situations."
What surprises you when you visit Other is the abundance of exhibits and the beauty of the images.
As of the 24th, a total of 14 permanent and special exhibitions have been released, and the ultra-high resolution works that convey not only the color but also the texture of the brush attract the viewer.
There is no need for membership registration or admission fee, and the feature is that not only the viewer but also the artist who wants to hold a solo exhibition does not cost money.
The unique way of showing it online also attracts attention.
One of them is to move the picture.
In Claude Monet's permanent exhibition "It Starts Moving Again," digital processing is applied to move clouds, flowers, grasslands, etc.
"I want to make it possible for people who are not interested in art to enter" (Konno representative), so you can feel like you are in a picture.
Konno first encountered art when he was in elementary school.
At that time, when I visited the newly completed Aomori Museum of Art with my family, I was shocked by the power of the three huge paintings of "Aleko" by Marc Chagall.
From the next day, the art class turned into a fun time, and even after moving to Tokyo on the occasion of going to university, I began to visit galleries.
At the same time, I felt that many people do not have many opportunities to interact with art from various perspectives, such as the lack of museums nearby, the fact that large special exhibitions are only held in the Tokyo metropolitan area, and it is difficult to go out due to childcare.
So, while working for an IT-related company, I spent about two months launching a site where you can appreciate art on the Internet.
The number of users reached an average of 10,000 per month in the first 10 months, and increased to about 30,000 after the spread of the new corona infection.
If anyone can appreciate art in a free form when they want to see it.
Other's aim was unintentionally accepted by more people due to the corona disaster.
Representative Konno emphasized that the significance of art appreciation will enrich your imagination.
"When you have a lot of imagination, you can reach out to people in need.
I want you to become a better society by getting closer to art."
The simple reason why the era of Chinese quality is over and the era of Japanese quality is coming (modern business) --Yahoo! News
Pandemic changes values
Various predictions and discussions are being made about the world of after-pandemics.
On the business side, the article on July 8 "Actually, the jobs of" managers "are starting to disappear in Japan now...! That cruel reality", the article on July 4 "In the world of" After Corona ", in fact, the reason why" Japanese manufacturing "is likely to make a big comeback...! There is a possibility that the changes described in such as".
[Photo] The true identity of "Japan's strength" that only Japanese people do not know... Surprising reality seen in Asia
In terms of spirit, the article on June 26 "Knowledge of Complete Combustion" given to those who have become conscious of the end of life in Corona "and the article on June 10" Corona, now full of riots It seems that the flow of "Let's review the utility of" God's request when it is difficult "will become mainstream.
And it is a big flow of "From Chinese quality to Japanese quality" that seems to be clearly visible to our eyes as a form that combines the two "materials (economy and business)" and "spirit".
For example, if a T-shirt or digital camera is defective or defective, it is exasperating, but there is no exception to the life of the person who purchased it.
On the other hand, the sloppy quality of masks and ventilators made in China, which has recently become a hot topic... "Chinese quality" in such products that are directly linked to life and safety is fatal.
No matter how cheap it is, you cannot buy such a product.
Even if you pay a considerable price, you will want "Japanese quality" products.
Of course, this trend is not happening only in Japan.
It is clear from the fact that Western countries, which fell into difficult situations due to a shortage of masks and medical equipment, still made "returns" one after another due to the terrible "Chinese quality".
Safety and security rather than cheapness
In addition, products such as automobiles are also products whose defects can be fatal (death by accident).
No matter how much China, South Korea, and other countries attack with the bargain selling strategy of "cheap or bad," they cannot compete with Japanese-made products in the end, and the article on June 16 "After all, the world's automakers will win by themselves and bow down to Toyota?" The reason for the situation described in "Japanese quality" is strongly required for products called automobiles.
And this pandemic reminded me that many other products also need "safety and security."
In addition, safety and security are important not only in "Japanese quality in manufacturing" but also in "Japanese quality in services such as logistics".
Like the toilet paper turmoil, even though there is a proper production capacity, intermediate distribution may be stagnant and it may not reach you.
In addition, self-sufficiency in Japan is also an important element of "safety and security", as in the article "Who is the true culprit of the lack of masks! Do not forgive the fire field thieves of the Chinese Communist Party administration" on April 17.
In an emergency, it is natural for any country to prioritize its own country, and it is very important to be able to procure necessities such as masks (medical equipment) and food within its own country.
More than 100 new coronavirus infections in South Korea for the first time in 115 days = 86 overseas inflows, the highest number (Yonhap News) --Yahoo! News
[Seoul Yonhap News] South Korea's Central Epidemic Control Headquarters announced on the 25th that the number of people infected with the new coronavirus as of midnight on this day increased by 113 from midnight the previous day to a total of 14,092.
This is the first time in 115 days that the number of new infections per day has exceeded 100 since April 1 (101).
It is believed that 32 of the 293 workers who returned from Iraq on the 24th were tested positive, in addition to the fact that 32 sailors were found infected on a Russian vessel that entered Busan Port.
The number of newly infected people in South Korea was in the 30-60 range except on the 20th (26).

The largest number of immigrants from Iraq was 36, with 34 from Russia, 5 from the Philippines, and 3 from the United States.
On the other hand, 27 people were infected in the city, 11 in Seoul and Gyeonggi-do, and 5 in Busan.
Five people in Busan were employees of a repairer on board a Russian ship.

Nagoya / Miyahara positive for corona Soccer J1, first after league resumption | Shizuoka Shimbun at S
Soccer J1 Nagoya announced on the 25th that defender Kazuya Miyahara (24) has been confirmed to have tested positive for the new coronavirus.
This is the first positive reaction of a player after the resumption of the J League.
This is the third player from the club, following FW Yumeo Kanasaki (31) and Australian goalkeeper Mitchell Langerak (31), who were infected in June.
The two have already been treated and returned to the match.
This season's Miyahara entered the bench at the J1 Oita match held at Showa Denko Dome Oita on the 22nd.
Nagoya held an online press conference on the 25th and revealed that it had conducted PCR tests on 60 players and staff on the same day.
98% reflection.
It turns out that the white paint derived from a Teflon-processed frying pan and heat insulation improve the cooling effect!
A big discovery!
This year was the rainy season, when the amount of precipitation was conspicuous, but if it is clear, the extremely hot summer will be in full swing.
Hot and hot, scorching days that even the air conditioning is not effective... Just imagining it already seems to make you swell, right?
Global warming is a major global problem, and human beings have squeezed their wisdom on how to overcome the hot midsummer with even a little comfort.
One way is to wear light white clothing.
Look, you don't have to wear black clothes that absorb heat in the summer, do you?
And it seems that the number of cases where white paint is used is increasing by applying the same principle to the construction of houses.
Even if white is white, it was also the latest research field whether it could be made into a paint with properties that reflect more light and do not absorb heat.
The Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), in collaboration with researchers from the Faculty of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics at Columbia University, has recently found a method for blending white paint that can most efficiently repel solar heat and improve the cooling effect inside buildings. Announced.
It is said that early practical application is aimed at.
Until now, the white paint with the highest reflectivity of the sun's rays was made of titanium oxide, which has a reflectivity of 85%.
White paint that already uses titanium oxide is applied to the roofs of buildings in high temperature environments, and is used to block solar heat and improve cooling efficiency.
However, the newly discovered white paint is derived from the fluororesin of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), which is used in Teflon-processed frying pans.
It is a white paint that applies this Teflon effect, and reflects the sun's rays to nearly 98%, making it possible to cut heat significantly.
Even in the hot summer, surprisingly, thanks to the white paint using Teflon, it is easy to spend indoors without being exposed to the intense heat.
Such an era may be coming soon, right?
I feel like there are many dark colors on the roofs of Japanese houses, but from now on, white will become the mainstream?
When will Amazon's annual big sale be held this year?
Amazon.com has announced the postponement of its annual big sale, Prime Day, CNBC reported on July 21.
It is held every July, but it was reported that it was forced to postpone this year due to the spread of the new coronavirus infection.
A spokesperson for Amazon said in a statement, "Details will be announced shortly."
"Prime Day has become a special celebration event that we look forward to over the past five years. This year, we will hold it later than usual, ensuring the safety of our employees and supporting our customers and sellers."
However, he did not disclose the specific date, saying only that "details will be announced soon."
On the other hand, we have decided to hold it in India.
A press release was posted on the country's website.
He explained that it will be held for 48 hours from midnight on August 6.
Prime Day has been held at the same time around the world so far, but this year it may take unusual measures.
■ Amazon, a large-scale event that sells 760 billion yen in two days, launched a large-scale sale for members in 2015 as a sales promotion measure in the summer when sales are declining.
Initially it was a 24-hour event, but it has expanded year by year, and last year it was held for 48 hours from midnight on July 15 in 18 countries such as the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, India, Japan, China, and Australia.
According to the company, last year, sales for the two days exceeded previous sales on "Black Friday" (the first day of the year-end sales season) and "Cyber Monday" (the following Monday).
This event has also contributed to the acquisition of new subscribers to the paid member "Prime", and last year, the number of applications on the first day was the highest ever, and the next day was the second highest.
Last year, it sold 175 million products worldwide.
Internet Retailer, a magazine specializing in the online shopping industry, reported that total global sales for the two days were $7.16 billion, up 70% from the previous year.
Strict eyes on mobile number migration and excessive retention.
What happens to fees and points?
(New Switch) - Yahoo! News
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications is in earnest considering a review of the same number transfer system (MNP), which allows the conventional telephone number to be used as it is when changing mobile communication companies.
At a meeting of experts on the 21st, the government announced its policy to revise the MNP guidelines established in 2004.
Specific issues include the ideal way of MNP fees and whether or not to retain those who wish to move out.
As a backlash from telecommunications companies is expected, attention will be focused on whether it will lead to the promotion of healthy market competition.
At the beginning of 2006, when the dark MNP of telecommunications companies that are far from unlimited mobile phone transfers was introduced, the user burden fee was 2000 yen, but now it is 3000 yen.
The MNP fee income of the three major mobile communication companies is estimated to be 15.9 billion yen per year.
On the 21st, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications listed the current situation surrounding MNP at the Working Group on Verification of Competition Rules (WG), a meeting of experts to discuss the competitive environment of the telecommunications market.
The time required to issue an MNP reservation number when consumers move to another telecommunications company is also listed as a challenge.
Major telecommunications companies accept it on the web, but due to the convenience of operating the core system, the acceptance time is mainly from 9 to 20 o'clock.
The WG material clearly stated that all-day support will be the principle as the direction of future consideration.
It is also a problem for mobile communication companies to give points to people who wish to move out with MNP to retain them.
It is judged that excessive retention may hinder fair competition.
Shunichi Kita, a partner at Nomura Research Institute, who is a member of the WG, said, "We will either have time to explain the provision of economic benefits or obtain permission from the user, and promptly issue a number to users who do not permit it. It is important to thoroughly implement this process first."
However, among the series of issues, regarding MNP fees, there is a structural problem that "the higher the fee, the more difficult it is for customers to leak out, so it is difficult to motivate them to actively lower it" (person in charge of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications).
If there is a business that takes the initiative in lowering MNP fees, there is concern that the outflow of customers from that company will increase and corporate efforts will not be rewarded.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications has also pointed out that many countries overseas do not require user-borne fees for MNP, and it is possible that this will be the case in Japan.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications wants to compile the results of the WG as a report around September-October, and then start the procedure for revising the MNP guidelines.
The timing of the revision is expected to be after 21 years.
Mobile communication companies are likely to have trouble with sales and customer support.
Chunichi / Katsuno can't get the right of the winning pitcher even if he has no runs in the sixth inning (Sankei Sports) --Yahoo! News
Chunichi pitcher Masayoshi Katsuno (23) started in the 8th round of the Hanshin Tigers (Nagoya Dome) on the 25th.
He had four hits and no runs in the sixth inning.
"There was also the previous pitching, so I thought it was my last chance and threw it. There was also a foreball, but I was able to compete with the opponent without worrying too much."
In the first pitching of the season and the previous match against Hanshin (Koshien) on the 18th, both starting pitchers suffered from ball control and dropped out by the 4th inning.
It was a backwater mound that did not play the role of starting pitcher, and this time it was a backwater mound that faced the survival of the first army.
This time, he bullishly attacked his strong tiger batting line opponent with a hearty ball.
When a straight ball in the latter half of the 140km range ran, changing balls such as counting balls were also able to be effectively used.
In the sixth inning, he was hit by a double in the middle of the left by the leading Sands, but Oyama was left flying, Boer was killed by two ground balls, and two death third base.
In the match against Fukudome, which was greeted here, he drove in with two balls and finally forked.
He struck out in a three-ball game and surpassed the pinch.
Katsuno finished the sixth inning with 83 pitches, but at the end of the midfield match, Manager Yoda came out of the bench and announced a pitcher change.
Nishi Isamu, who played the pitcher's game, had 108 pitches at the same time, but he got off the mound first and could not get the right to win for the first time this season.

[G Osaka] 17-year-old FW Karayama, what is the possibility of J1 debut against Kobe?
Director Miyamoto "Scoring power is outstanding" (Sports Hochi) --Yahoo! News
G Osaka coach Tsuneyasu Miyamoto (43) responded to the interview before the match against Kobe (Noesta, 26th), which will face four consecutive wins on the 25th, and revealed his expectations for high school third-year forward Shoji Karayama (17), who became a member of the top team for the first time in the previous section.
The commander made Karayama, who was promoted to the top in the skipping class this season, a bench member in the match against Hiroshima on the 22nd.
He did not give him an opportunity to participate, but in J3 so far, he said to the striker, who has scored three goals in five games this season, "There is a part that stands out from the point of scoring. I'm 17 years old, but I want Gamshala to do more. I've seen players go abroad at a young age, but I want you to play with high awareness and greed."
Karayama scored 8 goals in 10 games in J3, which he played as a specially designated player last season.
Although it is slender at 178 cm and 65 kg, it boasts an astonishing scoring rate of 11 goals in 15 games in J3, with the sense of taking the back of the defender with an instant movement and the calmness to shoot in front of the dense opponent's goal.
In the match against Hiroshima, FW Ademilson and midfielder Onose were off the bench due to injury, and Karayama got a chance, but he did not have a chance to participate.
Manager Miyamoto explained the state of Ademilson and Onose for the match against Kobe, "Both of them are not 100%, but they are motivated and challenging preparations."
If they are to be preserved, there is a possibility that Karayama will be on the bench again.
At G Osaka, midfielder Doan = current PSV = made his J1 debut at the age of 16 years and 11 months, and forward Usami at the age of 17 years and 0 months, and moved to overseas as a teenager.
Karayama, now 17 years and 10 months old, who is expected to be the next talent, is also expected to make his J1 debut as a successor to them.
Ferrari stolen 26 years ago is found at the bottom of the river │ To the work without restoration (octane.jp) --Yahoo! News
In 1994, there was an incident in the Netherlands where Ferrari Mondial was stolen.
Time had passed without the police being able to solve it, but 26 years later, the mondial was miraculously discovered.
It was the fire department's diving training that triggered the discovery of the Ferrari (4 photos) found at the bottom of the river.
On July 8, a training diver discovered something wedge-shaped that sank to the bottom of the river, and police and even the Dutch army were dispatched, and when they pulled something up, it was a Ferrari Mondial.
By matching the VIN number with a database of stolen vehicles, the Ferrari was able to be associated with the 1994 incident.
The car has been handed over to its legal owner, an insurance company, and then sent to a scrap company.
Scraper Lowie van DE Ooyevaar said, "There are still some parts left, but it's for art like decorating. We have already received many requests from people who want to make tables from dismembered mondials. We use engine blocks and glass plates."
For the time being, it is not considering specific sales, and it is said that scrap companies will store it as an object.
Seibu and Tonosaki hit their first goodbye
6th year professional "man who doesn't have" is finally!
(Sankei Sports) --Yahoo! News
(Pacific League, Seibu 3x-2 Lotte, 9th round, Seibu 6-3, 24th, MetLife) It's a white star of obsession!!
Seibu and Shuta Tonosaki infielder (27) hit his first goodbye in his sixth year as a professional to the left in the ninth inning of Lotte's ninth round (MetLife) on the 24th, contributing to a 3-2 victory.
He took advantage of the opportunities produced by Genda's head sliding and forest sacrifice.
The team that won the race together saved 2.
The voltage of the Leo party packed in the home base MetLife Dome reached its climax.
Tonosaki hits the first goodbye in his sixth year as a professional.
It excited a crowd of 4825 people.
"Gen (Genda) and Tomoya (Mori) connected me, so I entered the at-bat with the feeling that I would do something about it." The obsession with victory of the colleague inspired the uniform number 5.
The ninth inning was 2-2.
The first batter, Genda, tried a safety bunt and head-sliding to first base.
When he hit the base with an infield hit, Mori, the top batter last season, decided to sacrifice his second professional hit.
No.4 Yamakawa shunned the declaration.
A senior at Fuji University was made to walk, and Tonosaki's inner heart was burning.
"I thought," Damn. "Before Mr. Yamakawa went to first base, he said," Go aggressively, "so I felt good."
I got stuck in a straight ball with a high internal angle from one ball, but the hit ball fell to the front left.
Goodbye hit that "I have no memory" throughout my amateur days.
The 27-year-old, who was inspired by his alma mater, Hirosaki Sanetaka, who advanced to the top four of the summer prefectural tournament for the first time in 20 years, took a delightful water shower and smiled, "As expected, it felt good."
He was called "the man who doesn't have it."
He was selected by Samurai Japan as a versatile player who can protect the infield and outfield, and contributed to the world's best in "Premier 12" last November.
However, in Seibu, he had no experience of hitting goodbye, and was told by Director Tsuji and Operation Baba, as well as defense and running base coach, "I don't have it, you."
He repelled his negative reputation and produced his second goodbye win of the season.
Director Tsuji praised, "I asked the goddess of victory to ask only today. He hit me well."
With 2 savings, 3rd place, one game behind Softbank.
With only one home run this season, Tonosaki, who has a batting average of 252, said, "I still have to hit. I will work as a team to win the next one."
The one hit that decides the game is the trigger for demodulation.

The effects of landslide disasters remain on National Route 152, the main road, and the JR Iida Line, which is the "foot of life," and there are many places that will take time to recover.

However, the width of the road is narrow, and all sections are alternating traffic on one side, so the waiting time is unpredictable.
A landslide occurred on the national highway in the town on the 9th, and traffic was closed due to the risk of falling rocks on the nearby slopes.
On the 13th, cracks were also found in the Akiba tunnel in the regulation section, and the prospect of traffic resumption time is not yet standing.
In 2018, the national highway was closed due to the collapse of the town, which hit residents' lives and tourism.

45% of households have wives holding wallets!
Is my husband happy? Unhappy?
Isn't there a wife who is surprised or angry when her husband says, "I don't have enough pocket money this month..."?
The family in which this conversation is established is the family in which the wife holds the wallet.
How many families in the world have wives holding wallets?
Let's also look at the percentages of "married couple wallets" and "jointly managed."
Which one holds the household wallet?
Matsui Securities Co., Ltd. conducted an Internet survey of 400 men and women in their 20s and 30s (young couples) within three years of marriage nationwide and 400 men and women in their 50s and 60s (mature couples) over 30 years of marriage, a total of 800 people. The following survey results have been obtained from the results of the "Survey on Household Management Circumstances of Couples" (announced in June 2020).
Who holds the household wallet?
Wife: 45.0% Husband: 24.8% The most common result was that the wife manages the household budget.
No matter which one manages it, there are twists and turns in household management, but it seems that there are various episodes.
Wife manages household budget: In the case of Ako, Ako is an Arafif wamama with a daughter in the third year of high school and a daughter in the first year of high school.
A child is in full control of the household budget.
As the number of months when the cram school fee increased and the deficit increased ahead of the university entrance exam, I negotiated with my husband to lower my pocket money, but as expected, I was resisted.
At that time, I was told to "show me what kind of income and expenditure it is," so I showed the household account book.
I should have listed all the expenses, but when I looked at the household account book, it was not enough to make a deficit.
My husband almost stopped by me saying, "It's enough," but Ako involuntarily said, "Okay, I'm not strong enough to manage the household budget, so please manage everything." If you cut the big deal, it seems that you will be sent back saying, "After all, please."
Later, when Ako interviewed her husband, she said, "I'm dissatisfied with the management of pocket money, but I don't have the time or energy to manage various household expenses (for example, school teaching materials and PTA expenses)."
Husband manages household budget: In the case of B child, B child, a full-time housewife, is given living expenses by her husband and is busy every day.
Last spring, the freezer part of the refrigerator broke, so Ms. B asked her husband to buy a refrigerator.
However, my husband was reluctant to replace it, saying, "The freezer is not good, but the refrigerated part can still be used, so it's okay."
However, in the summer, it seems that he wanted to create an environment where he could eat ice cream at any time, and the palm of his hand turned over, saying, "Let's buy a refrigerator after all."
Therefore, B child seems to have complained to a friend involuntarily, "My husband is stingy enough to get a do."

What kind of decision will the world's number one big club make on the departure of "Japan's treasure"?

Unfortunately, it was raining in Fukui Prefecture, but it was launched at nine locations as scheduled, coloring the summer night sky.
JC called on each block council nationwide to overcome the sense of stagnation caused by the spread of infection and signal that Japan will be reborn anew.
It started at 8:00 p.m. at 117 locations in 46 prefectures at once.
At the Ichijodani Asakura site in Fukui City, a total of 53 shots of No.2 to No.4 balls were launched for about 2 minutes while the surrounding mountains were covered with haze.
The light of the fireworks caused the Karamon gate to appear in the dark night, creating a fantastic atmosphere.
In the prefecture, it was also held along the Matsubara coast in Tsuruga City and along the Mana River in Ono City.
In order to prevent infection, the launch site was not announced in advance in order to avoid attracting many spectators.
