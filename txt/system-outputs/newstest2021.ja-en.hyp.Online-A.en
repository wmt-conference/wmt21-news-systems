Report that cut process!
Nogizaka 46 Mitsunori Yamashita, short hair and first cover!
First of all, check the hair of the faint before the cut.
Thin, soft, and many.
There is a habit, especially during the rainy season, so you may put a straight perm.
It is a semi-long weighted with a pair of sink bangs.
Finally start cutting!
First of all, the whole is wet lightly so that it is easy to cut.
After that, the top of the bee (the part above the perimeter that is the most stretched of the head) is parted and cut from the bottom.
By the way, the point of the hair that brings everyone closer to Mr. Minoru is here!
1 Tabblebang By shortening the inside of the bangs slightly, it thickens slightly when lowered in full, and see-through the skin is transparent when lightly parted ... Such as, you can enjoy the change depending on the styling.
2 Cut that makes use of habit If the hair volume is reduced too much, it may spread to the other side.
While consulting about the balance around it, it is easy to handle and hard to spread, and maintains a balance that makes your own swell live.
3 Layer around the face and the layer of the hair = Cut with steps.
If you put a layer around the face, it will be easier to move, and it will have a cute finish.
If you make the hair in three places before and behind the mushrooms and momikage, it will look fashionable even when you put it together quickly.
After cutting the hair on the bee that you have deded together, it will be around your face.
Pull out the hair bundle of the upper part around the face and cut the tip of the hair a little.
In this way, when the hair bundle is lowered, there is a step, and it is easier to move (this is the layer cut).

Butler praises Tyler Hero, the heat's future warrior, "Thinking is not that of a rookie" (Basket Count) - Yahoo! News
Photo=Getty Images The Heat's first game of scrimmage against the Kings.
Duncan Robinson scored a team-high 18 points in a comfortable 104-98 win, followed by Tyler Hero with 15 and a backcourt run.
Robinson, one of the league's leading shooters, as well as the 13th-ranked rookie of the entire draft, and the hero step up will be a key factor for the Heat.
Hero missed 15 games between February and March due to an ankle injury, and the season ended with a lengthy suspension against the Hornets on March 12, his return.
Hero said, "We had a lot of time, so we were able to get 100% back in shape. It's the best I've ever felt," he said, but his performance in scrimmage was more convincing than words.
The late confluence of starting point guard Kendrick Nunn increased the hero's playing time and took advantage of that opportunity.
It's worth it because he's scored 15 goals in a different role.
Team leader Jimmy Butler praised the favorite hero again.
"He can be a handler, he can score goals, he can defend. He's a player who can do everything for the team. I can do it in any position because my way of thinking is not that of a rookie. I watch the footage and research it, and my teammates are banging their heads on where and how they move and get free, and what I should do with it."
Even before the start of the season, Butler likes his hero's rookie-like strength and his stoic attitude toward basketball.
That's why we invited them to practice at 4:00 a.m. and trained together.
Butler once said, "He has his opinion on everyone, and he doesn't back down. I can respect that kind of fighting spirit."
The butler is the type who always says what he thought, and if he thinks it will be for the team, he will clash with him and he will clash with him.
In the past, this has worsened my relationship with my teammates.
Butler is likely layering his younger days on his hero.
Butler's character, which is sometimes too harsh for his teammates, is a good guide for those who have the guts to just come about it.
If the relationship between two mutually respected teachers and children spreads throughout the team, the Heat should be able to move even further.

Shimada Sho's Matsuura hit a change ball with his first deadly base and carried it to the left front.
"If I lose for three years, I retire immediately. I wanted to hit it and win."
The talent who carried the no.4 last fall was heart-high.
The first and third rounds were fought mainly for three years, and the two years of strength were coming up.
Coach Ikeda gathered the players at the meeting and said, "It's been three years. I'm going to be the best member in the future," he told Nine.
On this day, four of the nine starters solidified their main axis in two years.
It is evidence that it devotes it to a serious game, too, and it reflects ruthlessly.
Matsuura said, "From now on, the level of the opponent's pitcher will also increase. I'm going to go in with the intention of bringing the runners back."
Saito, who pitched consecutively, didn't even step on second base with a good pitch that held him to one hit in the sixth inning, giving him a three-year look.
Number 10 said, "I'm inspired for three years by two years. If it leads to victory" and it is a favorable view as a synergistic effect.
The team, which is aiming to become a four-strong team for the third year in a row after the Shizuoka Tournament until last year, will not make memories of the remaining matches.

The new Corona has driven the live house, which is the base of music activities, to closure, and many musicians have lost place to sing and perform.
In order to believe in the power of music because there is no point in seeing ahead, singer and songwriter nappo (Nappo) who lives in Minamisoma City (46) and DAZU-O (37) of the music group "Mehikari Boys" in Iwaki City planned it.
Mr. Nappo writes and composes songs, and Mr. Dazuo raps.
When the project started in March of the corona disaster, singers and songwriters MANAMI (Manami) and Jun Kanno (38) from Fukushima City agreed one after another, and the circle expanded in an instant.
Mr. Nappo said, "It became a gorgeous face that can not be thought of in normal times. I want to fully enjoy this opportunity."
There was no opportunity for 16 people to gather as an infection control, and each was recorded in a live house or at home.
In an attempt to support the project, Iwaki City's artist Koa drew down the image character.
It is a blue and green expression of a climate rich in nature.
The finished song will be transmitted to the world on YouTube, and it aims to be made into a CD.
Next year will mark ten years since the earthquake, and the postponed Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games will be held.
"We have overcome difficulties, and we have a lot to shoulder. I hope that by presenting the song at the milestone, it will be encouraging for many people."

Instant detection of crisis occurrence from internet information, determination of hoaxes (JBpress) - Yahoo! News
"I want to be the first to know where and what kind of disasters and accidents have occurred!" 」
This is not limited to news organizations such as television and newspapers, but there is also a strong need for many companies such as social infrastructure companies and local governments.
The service that responds to this is "Specty" developed by Specpee, which analyzes information using AI.
【Photo】A professional team determines the authenticity of social media information with an alert from Specti
Now, the first way people know about disasters and accidents is shifting from television to internet information (social media).
Social media, such as Twitter, has become an important media outlet for disseminating information immediately after a disaster or accident.
However, it is difficult for human hands to constantly watch overflowing information and pull useful information out of it.
Specty has the function of detecting and analyzing information related to natural disasters and accidents from information flowing through social media such as Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, determining the authenticity of the information, and delivering it to the companies using it.
"We position negative impactful events that stop or stagnate social activities as "crises" (Mr. Kenjiro Murakami, Ceo) and crisis management support services that visualize various crises occurring in Japan and overseas.
NHK, which occurred during the Kumamoto Earthquake in April 2016, was the first major use case of Specty, and the recruitment movement spread rapidly among companies.
More than 350 companies in Japan, including television stations and newspapers, as well as companies that support social infrastructure such as electricity, gas, and transportation, and local governments around the country, are currently using the specs.
■ Analyze posts to determine the type of "crisis" and where it occurs
The specty delivers information in four steps: "Collecting Information", "Analysis and Content Classification", "Title", and "Authenticity Determination".
The company must specify in advance which areas (prefectures, cities, etc.) to collect information in, and categories of crises (disasters, accidents, etc.).
Specty collects posts that fall under its designation using apIs provided by social media.
Next, analyze and categorize the text, images, and videos included in the collected posts.
For example, if there is a video showing a fire truck, black smoke rising from the building, and an orange flame coming out of the room, it will be classified as "fire".
In addition, if it is an image of a car that has overturned, it is classified as "traffic accident", and if it is an image of a road with water, it is classified as "road flooding".
Specty also estimates where disasters and accidents occur.
"We often don't know where from the posts, so we use a combination of different information to estimate it," Murakami said.
For example, if a road sign or signboard is reflected in an image or video, information on the place name is extracted from it, and the location is identified by matching it with the place name database.

Japanese "chilled Chinese" does not chinese uke ... ?
"Cold Noodle Dishes" Unpopular (Hyundai Business) - Yahoo! News
Chilled Chinese noodles in China are "Japanese style cold noodles"
As mentioned at the beginning, chilled Chinese cuisine is a Chinese cuisine originating in Japan (Japanese-style Chinese) that was invented based on the Chinese "ryong bang mien (chilled mixed soba)".
Therefore, it does not exist in China originally, but due to the diversification of food, it has come to be seen in Japanese restaurants in summer.
Recently, Japanese convenience stores have also featured arrangement products called "Japanese soba ryofu / soba chilled Chinese" and "Kawaka chicken 絲 cool face / Sichuan style chicken chilled Chinese".
On the other hand, the popularity of Japanese-style Chinese cuisine is generally not high in China, pushed by popular punchy Chinese dishes such as Sichuan and Hunan cuisine.
Of course, the seasoning of Japanese-style Chinese is often familiar to Chinese people.
Therefore, it tends to be criticized badly when the impact is poorly, even if it is not bad.
"Chilled Chinese" is no exception, and it is still a minor presence in China.
By the way, the name of chilled Chinese noodles in China is "Japanese cold noodles".
It is recognized by The Chinese as one of Japanese cuisine.
The summer staple is "Liangpi"
In China, the noodle dish that feels summer is "Ryompy".
In Japan, many people are unfamiliar with it, but ryoso is a plain noodle made from flour, rice flour, starch, etc., originated in 陕 West (Shanxi) province.
It is said that it has a history of 2,000 years.
It is a staple of B-class gourmet that is also sold at stalls, and the price is around 10 to 20 yuan (150 to 300 yen), which is very reasonable.
It contains the letter "Cool", but it is not covered with ice like chilled Chinese in Japan.
Rather, room temperature is the basis.
The noodles are topped with your favorite ingredients, such as chopped cucumbers, carrots, and boiled moyashi, and added medicinal flavors such as coriander, chili pepper, ginger, and garlic.
Finally, a special seasoning is mixed with soy sauce, ra oil, vinegar, sesame paste, peanut paste, etc.
The noodles that are well-throated and pulled are often entangled with a spicy sauce with a refreshing acidity and rich acidity, and even when there is no appetite in the summer, it will enter smoothly.
In addition, since it permeates all over China, there are various toppings and seasonings, and it is one of the characteristics of ryosoe and one of the ways to enjoy it.

Benefits of "cold water showers" for the body and mind (Cosmopolitan) - Yahoo! News
Reduces inflammation such as muscle pain
A study published in The North American Journal of Medical Sciences that examined the effectiveness of hydrotherapy (a treatment using water) found that it can be expected to be effective for physical and mental healing.
By bathing in cold water after exercise, muscle pain and other inflammatory effects can be suppressed.
According to Douglas Casa, head of the Korey Stringer Institute, which studies sports medicine and teaches at the University of Connecticut, "It's important to exercise and take a cold water shower with as much time as possible. By lowering the body temperature immediately after moving the body, recovery from inflammation and fatigue due to exercise is faster."
Reduce fatigue
When exercising in high temperatures, the heart, muscles, and skin need more blood flow than usual.
"When exercising, myo-blood flow increases because my heart rate is higher, which increases blood flow to the heart and requires energy to contract muscles. Also, when it comes to the skin, a lot of blood flows in to regulate body temperature," says Casa.
"Taking a cold water shower lowers the temperature of the skin, reducing the amount of blood flow sent to the skin. Instead, blood flow is sent to internal organs such as the stomach and intestines, which makes it easier to consume water and nutrients after exercise. As a result, you can reduce the fatigue you feel after exercising."
Expected for Hormosis effect
Drozewski also explains that you can expect the "Hormisis effect" to be activated by bathing in cold water.
The hormosis effect is the idea that it is better to have a little bit of substances and stresses that are harmful to the body than not at all.
"Hypoxia, petit fasting, and cold water showers are prime examples of the expected hormosis effect for health. Cold water showers stimulate hormones and neurotransmitters to increase physical and physical resilience and resilience."

However, nagaya dome was struggling to win 7-1-1 hold in 12 previous games, and had lost seven consecutive games since August 23, 2013.
From such a difficult opponent, he scored for the first time in 23 innings (the stopover also counted in one inning) with a spectacular single shot and did not pass the flow of the game.
Coach Yano also commented, "It is a high level to be able to keep a sweet ball. There is a stateliness to watch, and there is an atmosphere even if the timing of hitting is a foul. I think he'll still hit it."
In the first inning, he hit a right-field hit, which marked his sixth consecutive hit and three consecutive hits.
The start of the season was a low start, but he has already hit seven home runs and 16 RBIs, and has already worked as the team's top and fourth player.
We will continue to get results in order to win.

Since its opening in April 2019, the online art museum HASARD has attracted attention for its convenience and newness, and has become even more popular with a new way of life caused by the coronal disaster.
Shinnosuke Konno, 26, a representative from Hachinohe City who started the site, said, "I wanted to create a service that makes it easy for everyone to enjoy art. I want you to come into contact with art only under difficult circumstances."
When you visit Azar, you will be surprised by the abundance of exhibits and the beauty of the images.
As of 24th, a total of 14 permanent and special exhibitions have been exhibited, and ultra-high-resolution works that convey not only color but also the texture of the brush attract the eye.
There is no need for membership registration or admission, and not only the person who sees it but also the artist who wants to open a solo exhibition does not have to pay.
The way it looks unique to online also attracts attention.
One of them is to move the picture.
Claude Monet's permanent exhibition It Begins to Move Again is digitally processed to move clouds, flowers and grasslands.
"I want to be able to get in people who are not interested in art" (Konno representative), so you can feel like you are in a picture.
Konno and art were first-year students.
At that time, when I visited the newly completed Aomori Prefectural Museum of Art with my family, I was shocked by the power of marc Chagall's three huge paintings of "Areco".
From the next day, the art class turned into a good time, and even after I went to Tokyo on the day I went to university, I began to visit galleries and other facilities.
At the same time, I felt that there were many people who did not have much opportunity to interact with art from various perspectives, such as museums not being nearby, large special exhibitions being held in the Tokyo metropolitan area, and it was difficult to go out due to childcare.
So, while working for an IT affiliate, he spent about two months launching a site where he could appreciate art on the Internet.
The average number of users reached 10,000 a month in the first 10 months, and after the spread of the new corona infection, it increased to about 30,000.
If anyone can appreciate art in a free way when they want to see it.
Azar's aim was accepted by more people, not attempted, by coronal disaster.
Konno stressed that the significance of art appreciation will enrich your imagination.
"When you have a lot of imagination, you can reach out to people in need.
I hope that by bringing art closer to home, we will become a better society."
Why the era of Chinese quality is over and the era of Japanese quality is coming (Modern Business) - Yahoo! News
A pandemic and a shift in values
Various predictions and discussions are being held on the world of after-pandemics.
On the business side, the article on July 8th "In fact, the work of 'managers' is starting to disappear in Japan now ... ! The cruel reality" , july 4 article "In the world of "After Corona", "Japanese manufacturing" is likely to make a big comeback ... ! There is a possibility that the change described in such as .
【Photo】The true nature of "The Strength of Japan" that only Japanese people do not know ... Unexpected reality in Asia
In addition, in terms of spirit, the flow of articles such as "The Heart of Complete Combustion" given to those who have become conscious of the end of life in Corona" and the june 10 article "Corona, let's review the utility of 'God's demand when it is hard' now full of riots" seems to become mainstream.
And it is a big flow of "From Chinese quality to Japanese quality" that it seems that the two "materials (economy and business)" and "spirit" will be clearly visible to our eyes as a form that combines them.
For example, if there is a defect or defect in a T-shirt or digital camera, it would be exasperasable, but there is no exception to the life of the person who purchased it.
On the other the other, the sloppy quality of Masks and Ventilators made in China, which has recently become a hot topic ... ... "China quality" in such products directly linked to life and safety is fatal.
No matter how cheap it is, you can't buy such a product.
Even if you pay a considerable price, you will still want "Japanese quality" products.
Of course, this trend is not happening only in Japan.
It is clear that Western countries, which have fallen into difficult situations due to a lack of masks and medical equipment, have made "returns" one after another due to the terribleness of "Chinese quality".
Safer and safer than cheap
In addition, products such as automobiles can also be fatal defects (death by accident).
No matter how much countries such as China and South Korea attack with the cheap selling strategy of "cheap or bad", after all it is not possible to compete with Japanese-made, and the article "After all, it wins by oneself, and the world's automobile manufacturers fall down to Toyota?" The the situation described in "Japan quality" is strongly required for the product named the car.
The pandemic also made many other products a wake-up time to the need for "security and security."
In addition, safety and security are important not only for "Japanese quality in manufacturing" but also for "Japanese quality in services such as logistics".
Like the toilet paper riot, even if the production capacity is proper, intermediate distribution may be stagnant and it may not reach you.
In addition, on April 17, "Who is the true culprit of the lack of masks!" As in the article "Don't allow fire robbers of the Chinese Communist Party administration", self-sufficiency in Japan was also an important element of "safety and security".
In the event of an emergency, it is important for any country to take precedence over its own country, and to be able to procure essentials such as masks (medical equipment) and food in its own country.
South Korea's Corona New Infected 100 Or More Than 100 In 115 Days = Overseas Influx Highest at 86 (Yonhap News) - Yahoo! News
Seoul United News: South Korea's Central Anti-Epidemic Task Force announced today that the number of people infected with the new coronavirus as of midnight on this day has increased by 113 from midnight the previous day to a total of 14,092.

98% reflection.
White paint derived from Teflon-processed frying pan, it turns out to increase cooling effect with insulation!
A big discovery!
This year was the rainy season, when the amount of precipitation was conspicuous, but if it is bright, the summer of extreme heat will be in full swing.
Hot and hot, scorching days that even cooling becomes bad ... Just imagining it already seems to make you sing, right?
Global warming is a major global problem, and human beings have been squeezing their wisdom on how to overcome the hot midsummer with even a little comfort.
One way is to wear light white clothing.
Look, you don't have to wear black to absorb heat in the summer, do you?
And, it seems that the case which uses the paint of the white system by applying the same principle to the construction of the house is increasing.
White was the latest research field, as it could not be made into a paint with properties that reflect more light and do not absorb heat, even if it was white.
Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) recently announced that he has found a method for combining white paints that can most efficiently bounce back solar heat and improve the cooling effect inside buildings in collaboration with researchers from Columbia University's School of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics.
It is said that it aims at the practical application at an early time.
Until now, white paints with the highest reflectance of the sun's rays were made of titanium oxide, which has a reflectance of 85%.
White paint using titanium oxide has already been applied to the roofs of buildings in high temperature environments, which are used to block solar heat and increase cooling efficiency.
However, the newly discovered white paint derived from the fluororesin of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), which is used in such teflon-processed frying pans.
It is a white paint that applys this Teflon effect, and reflects the sun's rays to nearly 98%, and it is said that a significant heat cut is possible.
Even in hot summers, thanks to the white paint using Teflon unexpectedly, it is easy to spend indoors without being exposed to extreme heat.
Such an era may be coming soon, right?
I feel like the roof of a Japanese house has a lot of dark colors, but from now on, white systems may become mainstream?
When will Amazon's annual big sale take place this year?

Tough eyes on mobile number migration, excessive deverment.
What happens to fees and points?
(New Switch) - Yahoo! News
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications is considering reviewing the MNP system, which allows the use of conventional telephone numbers when changing mobile carriers.
At a panel of experts on August 21, 2004, the government announced its policy of amending the MNP guidelines established in 2004.
Specific issues include the ideal way of MNP fees and whether or not to keep them for those who wish to move out.
With a rebound expected from telecommunications companies, attention will be focused on how it will lead to the promotion of healthy market competition.
In 2006, when the darkness MNP of telecommunications companies where unlimited mobile phone transfers were introduced, the user burden fee was 2,000 yen, but now it is 3,000 yen.
MNP fee revenue of three major mobile telecommunications companies is estimated to be 15.9 billion yen per year.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (D INTERNAL AFFAIRS) listed the current situation of MNP at the Working Group on Verification of Competition Rules (WG), a panel of experts discussing the competitive environment in the telecommunications market.
The time required for consumers to move to other telecommunications companies is also listed as a way to accept MNP reservation numbers.
Major telecommunications companies accept it on the web, but due to the convenience of the operation of the core system, the main time zone is 9-20 o'm.
The WG materials clearly stated that the direction of future examinations is in principle to be all-day.
It is also a problem for mobile carriers to provide points to people who wish to move out at MNP.
It is determined that excessive restraint could impede fair competition.
Shunichi Kita, a partner at Nomura Research Institute, a member of the WG, said, "We will promptly issue a number to users who do not grant permission, whether they have time to explain the offer of economic benefits or obtain permission from the user. It is important to thoroughly implement this process first."
However, among the series of issues, the structural problem of MNP fees is that "the higher the price, the less likely it is for customers to leak out, so it is difficult to motivate them to actively lower it" (person in charge of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications).
If some operators take the lead in lowering MNP fees, there will be more customer outflows from the companies, and there will be concerns that corporate efforts will not pay off.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications also pointed out that many countries overseas do not require user-borne fees for MNP, and it is possible that this will be the case in Japan.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (D INTERNAL AFFAIRS) would like to compile the results of the WG as a report around September and October, and then begin the procedures for revising the MNP Guidelines.
The timing of the revision is likely to be after 21 years.
Mobile telecommunications companies are likely to have trouble with sales and customer support.

Ferrari stolen 26 years ago found at bottom of river│Not restored to work (octane.jp) - Yahoo! News
In 1994, a Ferrari Mondial was stolen in the Netherlands.
Time had passed without the police being able to solve it, but 26 years later, the mondial was miraculously discovered.
The discovery of the Ferrari (4 photos) found at the bottom of the river was triggered by the fire department's dive training.
On July 8, a training diver discovered something wedge-shaped at the bottom of the river, and even the police and the Dutch army were on the move, and when he pulled something up, it was a Ferrari Mondial.
By matching the VIN number with a database of stolen cars, the Ferrari could be associated with a 1994 incident.
The car has been handed over to its legal owner, an insurance company, and then sent to a scraper.

For the time being, the company does not plan to sell specifically, and scrapers will keep it as an object.

First batter Genda attempted a safety bunt and slid the head to first base.
Mori, the leading hitter last season, struck out for the second time as a pro when he hit an infield hit.

It got stuck in a straight ball with a high inside angle from one ball, but the ball dropped to the front left.
Throughout his amateur days, he said that he had no memory.
The 27-year-old, who had been inspired by his alma mater Aomori's Hirosaki Miko's four-strong advance to the prefectural tournament in the summer for the first time in 20 years, took a joying water shower and smiled, "As expected, it felt good."
It was called "the man who didn't have it".
He was selected by Samurai Japan as an all-rounder who can protect the inside and outside field, and contributed to the world's best in the "Premier12" last November.
However, there was no experience of the sayonara strike in Seibu, and it was idioted by the tsuji supervisor and the Baba strategy, the defense, and the running base coach, "It did not have it, and you".
He bounced back from his negative reputation and produced his second goodbye win of the season.
Coach Tsuji said, "I asked the goddess of victory to ask only today. He hit me well."
2 in savings, and is third, one game behind softbank.
Tosaki, who still has only one home run this season and a batting average of 252, said, "I still have to hit. We will work together as a team to win the next one."
The hit which decided the game is made a chance of the recovery.

My husband almost stopped by me, but Ako seemed to be involuntarily "I understand, I'm under-power in household management, so please manage everything", and if you cut the big deal, it seems to be returned to "After all please".

Husband manages the household budget: In the case of B child, B child, a full-time housewife, is being handed living expenses by her husband and is busy every day.
Last spring, the freezer part of the refrigerator was broken, so B asked her husband to buy a refrigerator.
However, my husband reluctant to replace it, "The freezer is not good, but I can still use the refrigerated part, so it's okay".
However, in the summer, it seems that the husband himself wants to create an environment where he can eat ice cream at any time, and the flat hand seems to have turned over, "Refrigerator, after all buy it".
Then, B child seems to have complained to the friend involuntarily, "The husband is so pedicid that it is gott".
