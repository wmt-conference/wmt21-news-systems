CanCam model Honoka said, " It's beautiful, of course, but I have a very high professionalism and respect!" Tanaka Minami, who has longed for "hair style with movement", challenges hair style with movement like Minami-san.
I asked Mitsuki Asahi of the Omotesando hair salon"SUNVALLY", who actually works on Minami Tanaka's haircut, to make it "Minamikaze hair".
Report that cut process!
Nogizaka 46 Yamashita Mizuki, first cover with short hair!
First, check the faint hair before the cut.
Thin, soft, and plenty.
It has a habit, especially during the rainy season, so it is also possible to apply a straight perm.
It is a heavy semi-long with flowing bangs.
finally, the cut begins!
To make it easier to cut, first lightly wet the whole.
After that, the top of the bee (the part above the circumference that protrudes most of the head) is separated and cut from the bottom.
By the way, here is the point of hair that everyone gets close to Minoru!
1.By shortening the inside of the tabulbang bangs a little bit, it is slightly thicker when it is lowered in full, and it is see-through that the skin is transparent when it is divided lightly...Such as, you can enjoy the change depending on the styling.

While consulting the balance around it, keep a balance that is easy to handle and difficult to spread, and your own swell lives.
3 Layers around the face and hair layer = Cut with a step.
If you put a layer around the face, it becomes easy to move out, for a cute finish.
If you make your hair in 3 places in front and back of temples and sideburns, it looks fashionable even when you make it into a quick hair.
When I cut the hair on the bee which I kept separately, it is around the face.
Pull out the hair bundle of the upper part around the face in front, and cut the hair tip slightly.
This way, when the hair bundle is lowered, there is a step and it becomes easy to move (this is a layer cut).

In particular, the incidence of bicycle accidents in the past 5 years has been higher than the prefectural average in many years, and we planned a strategy to overcome this situation.
The name of the operation was multiplied by the meaning of the accident eradication to "bike " and"bicycle".
Related organizations are invited to provide driving guidance to the elderly and use of luminous reflective materials in traffic safety classrooms and other places more than ever before.
In the event of a crackdown, the department will issue a yellow card (guidance warning card) and urge caution.
The opening ceremony of the operation was held at the Shoko Gakuen Driving School in Tsuruoka City on the 21st.
About 30 people involved attended the event, and Chief Sato said,"I would like to ask for cooperation in order to reduce even one tragic accident."
The person in charge of the office showed the policy and activities of each organization.
As a start event of the strategy, a bicycle class was held.
A police officer in the car demonstrated how the impact on the bicycle was different when he hit the bicycle with the brake applied and when he hit the bicycle at about 55 km / h without stepping on the brake.
Koichi Kanai, Chairman of the Tsuruoka Regional Traffic Safety Promotion Committee, said,"I once again realized the horrors of traffic accidents.I want to call attention not only to the elderly, but also to young people."

Butler Once again praises Tyler Hero, the Future Hero of the Heat"The way of thinking is Not that of a rookie" (Basketball Count)・Yahoo!News
Photo = Getty Images The first game of the Heat's Scrimmage (practice game) was against the Kings.
In the 104-98 win, Duncan Robinson scored a team-high 18 points and Tyler Hero added 15.
As well as Robinson, the league's leading shooter, the 13th overall draft rookie and hero step-up is an important factor for the heat.
The Hero missed 2 to 3 of 15 games due to an ankle injury, and the season ended with a long suspension following the 3-12 Hornets ' return game.
The hero said, " We had a lot of time and we were able to get back to 100% condition.It's the best feeling I've ever felt, " he said, but his performance at Scrimmage was more convincing than words.
The late arrival of Kendrick Nan, the starting point guard, increased the hero's playing time and made use of that opportunity.
It is worth a lot because it is 15 points after doing a different role brilliantly.
Team leader Jimmy Butler once again praised his "favorite" hero.
"He can be a handler, he can score, he can defend, he can score, he can score, he can score, he can score, he can score, he can score, he can score, he can score, he can score, he can score, he can score, he can score, he can score, he can score.He's a player who can do everything for the team.I can do it in any position because the way of thinking is not that of a rookie.I look at the video and research it, and I am banging my head about where and how my teammates move and become free, and what I should do against it」
Prior to the start of the season, Butler has enjoyed the strength of his hero's non-rookie mentality and his stoic attitude towards basketball.
That's why I invited them to practice at 4 o'clock in the morning, and they trained together.
Butler once said, " He says his opinion to anyone, and he doesn't back down.I can respect that spirit."
The butler is the type to always say what he thought, and he will strike a tough opinion knowing that conflicts will occur if he thinks it will be for the team.
In the past, the relationship with his teammates had deteriorated.
Butler must have been a hero of his youth.
Butler's character, which is sometimes too harsh for his teammates, is a good guide for those who have the guts to follow.
If the relationship between 2 mentors and students who respect each other spreads to the whole team, the heat should be a team that can aim for even higher.

It was 2 years 4 that the opponent's appearance was the first appearance this summer.
Shimada Sho's Matsuura hit a change ball at the first dead base and carried it to the left front.
"When I lose 3 years, I retire immediately.I wanted to beat him and win."
Last fall, the talented player who played No. 4 was also heartfelt.
1 to 3 rounds were fought mainly in 3 years, and 2 years with power were turned around ahead.
Coach Ikeda gathered the players at the meeting and said, " It has been 3 years so far."We're going to be the best team in the future," he told Nine.
On this day, 9 of the 4 players started to solidify the main axis in 2 years.
It seems ruthless, but it is evidence that he is devoted to serious play.
He said, " I think the level of the pitcher is going to rise from now on.I'm going to return the runner."
Saito, who had a series of hits, made 6 of 1 hits and did not even step on second base, making him look out for the 3-year-old.

16 Musicians Associated with Fukushima Gather in the World of Singing with the People of Fukushima (Fukushima Minpo) - Yahoo!News
We want to deliver the energetic singing voices of Hama, Naka, and Aizu to the world.
Sixteen musicians associated with Fukushima Prefecture gathered together to create a message song.
The lyrics describe Fukushima Prefecture's single-minded struggle against the new coronavirus, as it steps toward recovery from the Great East Japan Earthquake and TEPCO's Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident.
The full version will be finished by next summer, which marks the milestone of the earthquake decade.
Twenty-four days, the song was published on the video posting site"YouTube".
The song is titled "Pray from Fukushima".
I put the positive attitude of people"I want to convey from Fukushima"on a bright and energetic melody.
Due to the influence of the new Corona, the live house, which is the base of music activities, was forced to close, and many musicians lost their place to sing and perform.
Because it is a time when we can't see the future, singer－songwriter nappo (46) living in Minamisoma City and DAZU-O (37) of the Iwaki city music group"Mexicali Boys"planned to believe in the power of music.
Mr. Nappo is in charge of lyrics and composition, and Mr. Dazuo is in charge of rap.
When the project started in March of the Corona Disaster, singer・songwriter MANAMI (28) and Jun Kanno (38) from Fukushima City agreed one after another, and the circle quickly expanded.
Mr. Nappo said, " I became a gorgeous face that I could not think of in normal times.I want to fully enjoy this opportunity."
As a precaution against infection, sixteen people were not provided with the opportunity to gather, and each recorded in a live house or home.
To support the project, Koa-san, a painter from Iwaki City, drew an image character.
In the shape of Fukushima Prefecture, it expresses a natural climate rich in blue and green.
The finished song will be released to the world on YouTube and will also be made into a CD.
Next year, the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics, which have been postponed, will be held in the ten years since the earthquake.
Mr. Dazuo said, " The things that we have overcome difficulties are big.I hope that the release of the song at the milestone will inspire many people."
The other participating musicians are as follows.

Instant detection of crises from Internet information, False Positives (JBPRESS) - Yahoo!News
"I want to know where and what kind of disaster or accident occurred first! 」
This is not limited to news organizations such as television and newspapers, but also many companies such as social infrastructure companies and local governments have strong needs.
The service that responds to this is"Spectre"developed by Spectee, which handles information analysis by AI.
[Photo] Expert team judges the authenticity of social media information with an alert from Spectacle
Now, the first way for people to know about the occurrence of disasters and accidents has begun to shift from television to internet information (social media).
Social media, such as Twitter, has become an important medium for disseminating information immediately after a disaster or accident occurs.
However, it is difficult for people to constantly monitor the overflowing information and extract useful information from it.
Specti has a function to detect natural disasters and accidents from information flowing through social media such as Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, analyze the contents, determine the authenticity of the information, and distribute it to users.
"We position a wide range of events with a negative impact, such as suspending or stagnating social activities, as"crises "" (CEO Kenjiro Murakami), a crisis management support service that visualizes various crises occurring both in Japan and abroad.
NHK at the time of the Kumamoto earthquake, which occurred in 2016/4, was the first major use case of Spectre, and then the movement of adoption spread rapidly among companies.
Not only television stations, newspapers and other media outlets, but also companies that support social infrastructure such as electricity, gas, and transportation, and more than 350 local governments across the country are currently using Spectre.
■ Analyze posts to determine the type and place of occurrence of"crisis"
Specti takes 4 steps to deliver information: "Collect information", "Analyze and classify content", "Title", and"Verify authenticity".
The user must specify in advance the region (prefecture, city, town, etc.) and the category of crisis (disaster, accident, etc.) in which information is collected.
Specti collects posts that fall under that designation using the API provided by social media.
Then, we analyze and classify the text, images, and videos contained in the collected posts.
For example, if a fire engine is shown, black smoke is rising from a building, and an orange flame is coming out from a room, it is classified as "fire".
In addition, if the image of a car overturned, it is classified as"traffic accident", and if the image of a road covered with water, it is classified as"road flood".
Specti also estimates the location of disasters and accidents.
"We often don't know the location from the post, so we combine various information to estimate it," says CEO Murakami.
For example, if a road sign or billboard is reflected in an image or video, it extracts the information of the place name from there, and identifies the place by matching with the place name database.
The Angels lost the opener goodbye...Otani struck out 5 of 1, 9 at full base with 3 balls (Baseball King) - Yahoo!News

The game was not finalized in the 9th round, and it entered an extended game starting with a special no-death second base this season.
Otani was the last batter to hit 9 times, so he became a second base runner.

Otani, who was sandwiched between two and three bases, became a touchout.

I have lived in the prefecture for less than 30 years since I was born.
When I used"zuru-mumi" which means "yoko-iri" in a conversation with a friend at a university (Tokyo), it was said that it was kyoton for a moment.

"Cold Chinese" in Japan is not Chinese uke ... ？
"Cold noodle dish" Unpopular reason (Modern Business) - Yahoo!News
In China, chilled Chinese is called"Japanese-style reimen" (Japanese-style reimen).」
As I mentioned at the beginning, Hiyashi-chuka is a Chinese cuisine (Japanese-style Chinese cuisine) that originated in Japan, which was invented based on the Chinese"Ryangbangmien" (hiyashi-mixed soba).
Therefore, although it does not exist in China originally, it has come to be seen in Japanese restaurants in summer due to the diversification of food.
Recently, Japanese convenience stores have also introduced "Japanese-style soba noodles/Soba cold Chinese noodles"and" Sichuan-style chicken noodles/Sichuan-style chicken cold Chinese noodles".
On the other hand, the popularity of Japanese-style Chinese is not high in China on the whole, driven by popular punchy Chinese dishes such as Sichuan and Hunan dishes.
Of course, Japanese-style Chinese seasoning is often familiar to the Chinese.
Therefore, it is not bad, but it tends to be severely criticized when it is poor in impact.
"Cold Chuka" is no exception, and it is still a minor existence in China.
By the way, the name of "Hiyashi chuka" in China is "Nichishiki reimen".
It is recognized by the Chinese as one of Japanese cuisine.
The classic of summer is " Ryampi ） 」
In China, the noodle dish that feels like summer is"Ryampi".
In Japan, many people may not be familiar with ryobushi, but ryobushi is a flat noodles made from flour, rice flour, starch, etc. that originated in Shaanxi Province.
It is said that it has a history of 2000 years.
It is a standard B-class gourmet that is also sold at stalls, and the price is around 10-20 yuan (150-300 yen), very reasonable.
It has the letter " ryo " in it, but it is not frozen with ice like in Japanese chilled Chinese food.
Rather, room temperature is the basis.
The noodles are topped with shredded cucumber, carrots, boiled moyashi, and other ingredients of your choice, and condiments such as coriander, pepper, ginger, and garlic are added to the noodles.
Finally, it is finished with a special seasoning mixed with soy sauce, chili oil, vinegar, sesame paste, peanut paste, etc.
The noodles have a good throat, and the sour taste is refreshing and the rich spicy sauce is often entangled in the noodles, and it enters smoothly even when there is no appetite in the summer heat.
In addition, since it has penetrated all over China, there are various toppings and seasonings, and it is one of the features and ways to enjoy it that there is a variety of variations.

Benefits of"Cold Shower" for Body and Mind (Cosmopolitan) - Yahoo!News
Reduce inflammation such as muscle pain
A study published in The North American Journal of Medical Sciences examined the effectiveness of hydrotherapy, which has proven to be effective in physical and mental healing.
By bathing in cold water after exercise, muscle pain and other inflammatory effects can be suppressed.
According to Douglas Casa, head of the Korey Stringer Institute, which studies sports medicine and teaches at the University of Connecticut,"It is important to exercise and take a cold shower as little time as possible.By lowering the body temperature immediately after moving the body, recovery from inflammation and fatigue due to exercise will be faster."
Reduce fatigue
When you exercise in high temperatures, your heart, muscles and skin will need more blood flow than usual.
"When you exercise, your heart rate increases, so you get more blood flow to the heart, and muscle blood flow increases because it takes energy to contract the muscles.And in the skin, a lot of blood flows in to regulate the body temperature,"says Casa.
"Taking a cold shower lowers the temperature of the skin, so we can reduce the amount of blood flow that is sent to the skin.Instead, blood flow is sent to internal organs such as the gastrointestinal tract, so it is easy to take water and nutrition after exercise.As a result, you can reduce the fatigue you feel after exercise」
Hope for Formisis effect
Drozewski also explains that bathing in cold water can activate the"Formisis effect".
The Formisis effect is the idea that it is better to have a little bit of harmful substances and stress for the body than not at all.
"Hypoxic exercise, petit fasting, and cold showers are typical examples of formisis effects for health.A cold shower stimulates hormones and neurotransmitters to increase physical and physical strength and resilience」

The batting ball that soared high landed to the middle of the left wing seat.

He went 0-2 in the fourth inning.
It was the 2nd ball after the first ball and the second ball after the foul.

The batting ball caught by the core is perfect enough to be convinced that it is a stand-in at the moment of hitting.
Following the match against Hiroshima on the 23rd (Koshien) the day before, the one shot that continued in 2 matches became a counterattack.
It was also a valuable one that hit from an opponent who was not good at it.
When he played against O OHNO in Koshien on the 17th, he scored 9 hits and scored 4.
However, if limited to Nagoya Dome, in the past 12 games allowed 7 wins and 1 losses in 1 hold, 2013 year 8 month 23 day from the draw was tormented and during the 7 losing streak.
From such a difficult opponent, at the Nagoya Dome, he scored the first time in 23 innings (also counted as 1 innings in the middle) with a powerful one shot, and did not pass the flow of the game.
Coach Yano also said, " It is high level to be able to catch a sweet ball firmly.There is a style to watch, and there is an atmosphere even if the timing of hitting is a foul.I think it's still going to hit me, " he said, adding that he expected more explosions.
He hit the right front bat at once, and this marks 6 consecutive hits and 3 consecutive hits.
It was a start ahead of the start, but 7 home runs and 16 RBIs have already worked well as the team's top and No. 4.
We will continue to leave the result in order to win.

I will tell you about my achievements as an educator in the Image of Masujiro Omura to a casting officer [Yamaguchi] | Ube Nippo Konomachi Media Web
A bronze statue of Masujiro Omura (1825-69), one of the top ten masterpieces of the Meiji Restoration, was seen at his birthplace, Yamaguchi City, on the 23rd.
The unveiling ceremony was held in the front garden of the Local Exchange Center for Coins and Coins, and local and administrative officials celebrated the completion of the ceremony.
Masujiro was a military scholar, Western scholar, and physician during the Bakumatsu-Ishin period.
After taking a lecture at 'Banshoshirabesho' (a research and educational institution for Western studies) of the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), he opened a private school 'Kyukyo・do' in Edo to teach Western studies, military studies, and medicine.
After returning to the Choshu Domain, he gave lectures on military science at the Yamaguchi Meirinkan.
The statue focused on Masujiro as an educator.
He was standing beside the globe, holding a calligraphy in his hand, and giving a lecture on Western studies.
The height of the statue with the pedestal is about 3 meters (1 to 55 meters), and it is said that it was made from the eyes of a disciple who receives a lecture by Masujiro.
The design was designed by local designer Marie Takami (27), a descendant of Masujiro's wife Kotoko.

Paris Saint・Germain, who beat Saint・Etienne 1-0 in the final of the Coupe de France at the Stade de France on May 24, won the championship for the first time in 2 years and the 13th time.
PSG wins 2 domestic titles
Neymar's goal in the first half against Saint・Etienne became the final goal, and PSG, which achieved the domestic 2 crown following the League Ann, has fallen into a situation that has to be feared for the Champions League on 8 May.
Kylian Mbappe, who played in the same match, was injured after a vicious sliding tackle by CB Loic Perrin.
In the first 30 minutes, the young French star was knocked down with his right ankle pinched and his face twisted in pain.
The players of both teams were involved in a heated exchange and a brawl.
EMVAPE, who seems to have twisted his right ankle, is unable to continue playing.
Perrin was given a red card.
After the game, Embape, with his right foot fixed, left the stadium with crutches on.
PSG will face Lyon in the Coupe de la Ligue final at 8/1/4: 10 GMT, but it will definitely be impossible to use Embape in this match.
We will have to wait for a medical report from the club, but we may miss the Champions League in Portugal.
Corona Magu" Art Familiar"Online Art Museum"HASARD" Konno - san (Hachinohe Native) Launched (Daily Tohoku Shimbun) - Yahoo!News
There is a museum where anyone can touch art for free when they like.
The collection ranges from famous painters such as Claude Monet and Gustav Klimt to unknown domestic artists.
Since its opening in 2019/4, the online art museum "HASARD"has captured the hearts of users with its convenience and novelty, and with the opportunity of a new way of life caused by the Corona disaster, attention has increased even more.
Shinnosuke Konno, 26, from Hachinohe City, who launched the site, said,"I wanted to create a service that everyone can easily enjoy art.I want people to come into contact with art under difficult circumstances."
When you visit Azar, you will be surprised by the abundance of exhibits and the beauty of the images.
As of 24, the museum has opened a total of 14 permanent and special exhibitions, attracting viewers with ultra-high-resolution works that convey not only the color but also the texture of the brush.
Membership registration and admission fees are not required, and the feature is that not only the viewer but also the artists who want to open a solo exhibition do not cost.
How to show unique online also attracts attention.
Moving the picture is one of them.
In Claude Monet's permanent exhibition,"It Begins to Move Again,"he uses digital processing to make clouds, flowers, and grasslands move.
"I want people who are less interested in art to get in," says Konno, so I can feel like I'm in a picture.
I met Konno Representative and art when I was in elementary school.
At that time, when I visited Aomori Prefectural Art Museum with my family, I was shocked by the power of Marc Chagall's"Aleco"3 huge paintings.
From the next day, art classes turned into a fun time, and after coming to Tokyo on the occasion of going to university, I came to visit galleries and other places.
At the same time, I felt that many people do not have much opportunity to interact with art from various points of view, such as the lack of museums nearby, large-scale exhibitions are held only in the metropolitan area, and it is difficult to go out due to childcare.
So, while working for an IT-related company, I spent about 2 months launching a site where I could appreciate art on the Internet.
In the first 10 months, the number of users reached an average of 1 million a month, and after the spread of the new corona infection, it increased to about 3 million.
When anyone wants to see it, I want to be able to appreciate art in a free form.
Azar's aim was accepted by more people by the Corona Disaster.
Konno emphasized the significance of art appreciation, saying that it enriches the imagination.
"When you have a lot of imagination, you can reach out to people in need.
I want art to become a better society by becoming familiar with it."
The Simple Reason why the era of Chinese quality is over and the era of Japanese quality is coming (Modern Business) - Yahoo!News
A pandemic and a shift in values
Various predictions and discussions have been made about the after-pandemic world.
On the business side, 7/8 article"Actually in Japan now"managers"work is beginning to disappear ... ！The cruel reality", 7/4 article "In the world of"after Corona", in fact"Japanese manufacturing" is likely to be revived ... ！ It is possible that such a change will occur.
[Photo] The true identity of the"strength of Japan"that only Japanese people do not know...Surprising Reality Seen in Asia
In addition, on the mental side, 6 month 26 day article"Corona to give to people who have come to be aware of the end of life in the"complete combustion knowledge"", 6 month 10 day article"Corona, now full of riots"Let's review the utility of the"God's request when it is painful"Seems to be going to become mainstream.
And it seems that we can see clearly in our eyes as a form in which these 2 " materials (economy and business)"and"spirit" coalesce, is a large flow from Chinese quality to Japanese quality.
For example, if there is a defect or defect in a T・shirt or digital camera, it is infuriating, but there is no separate article in the life of the person who purchased it.
In contrast, the sloppy quality of Chinese-made masks and respirators that have recently become a hot topic ... ... "Chinese quality"in such products that are directly linked to life and safety is fatal.
No matter how cheap you are, you can not buy such goods.
They would ask for"Japanese quality"products even if they paid a considerable price.
Of course, this trend is not happening only in Japan.
It is clear from the fact that Western countries, which were in a difficult situation due to a shortage of masks and medical equipment, still made"returns"one after another due to the terrible"Chinese quality".
Safe and secure than cheap
In addition, products such as automobiles are also products where defects can be fatal (death by accident).
Even if countries such as China and South Korea put on an offensive in the cheap selling strategy of"cheap or bad", after all can not compete in Japan, article of 6/16 " Still win alone, the world's car manufacturers will fall down to Toyota? The reason for this situation is that"Japanese quality"is strongly required for automotive products.
And this pandemic reminded us that"safety and security" are necessary for many other products as well.
In addition, security and safety are important not only in"Japanese quality in manufacturing"but also in"Japanese quality in services such as logistics".
Like the toilet paper commotion, there are times when there is a proper production capacity, but the intermediate distribution is blocked and it does not reach the hand.
In addition, 4/17"Who is the real culprit of the lack of masks!"The article"Do not allow fire thieves of the CCP regime"made me keenly aware that self・sufficiency in Japan is an important element of"security and safety".
In the event of an emergency, it is very important for all countries to give priority to their own countries, and to be able to procure essential items such as masks (medical equipment) and food within their own countries.

98% reflection.
It turns out that it enhances the cooling effect by white paint derived from the frying pan of teflon processing, heat insulation!
it's a big discovery!
This year was the rainy season with a lot of precipitation that is not usual, but the summer of intense heat will be in full swing at dawn.
It's hot and hot, and it's hot and hot, and it's hot and hot, and it's hot and hot, and it's hot and hot, and it's hot and hot, and it's hot and hot...just imagining it, it seems like it's going to get dumped, isn't it?
Global warming is a major global problem, and mankind has squeezed wisdom on how to overcome the hot midsummer comfortably even a little.
1 way is to wear thin white clothes.
Look, you don't have to wear black clothes to absorb heat in the summer, do you?
And the same principle is applied to the architecture of the house, and it seems that the case of using white paint is increasing.
Even if white is white, it may not be possible to make paints with characteristics that reflect more light and do not absorb heat, that was also the latest research field.
The Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) announced that they have collaborated with researchers from Columbia University's School of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics to find a way to mix white paint that can most efficiently repel solar heat and improve the cooling effect inside buildings.
It is said that it is aimed at the early practical application.
Until now, the white paint, which has the highest reflectivity of the sun's rays, has been made of titanium oxide, which reaches 85% reflectivity.
White paint using titanium oxide has already been applied to the roofs of buildings in high temperature environments, helping to block solar heat and increase cooling efficiency.
However, what was newly discovered was a white paint derived from the fluoropolymer of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), which is used in the frying pan of teflon processing.
It is a white paint that applies this teflon effect, and it reflects the sun's rays to nearly 98%, and it is said to be possible to drastically cut heat.
Even in the hot summer, thanks to the white paint using teflon surprisingly, it is easy to spend indoors without being exposed to the intense heat.
That era may be coming up close, right?
I feel like the roofs of Japanese houses have a lot of dark colors, but will the white system become mainstream from now on?
When will Amazon's annual big sale be held this year?
US Amazon Dot com revealed the postponement of the annual large sale"Prime Day"and US CNBC reported on 7/21.
It is held every year on 7 May, but this year it was reported that it has been forced to postpone due to the spread of new coronavirus infection.
"Details will be announced soon," an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement.
"Prime Day has become a special celebration event, in the past 5 years we look forward to.This year, it will be held later than usual, while ensuring the safety of employees and helping customers and sellers」
However, he said that "details will be announced soon" and did not specify the date of the event.
Meanwhile, I decided to hold the event in India.
A press release was posted on the country's website.
He explained that it will be conducted from 8-6 am 0 to 48 hours.
Prime Day has been held at the same time around the world so far, but this year may take an unusual step.
■ Large-scale event that will sell 2 billion yen in 7600 days Amazon started a large-scale sale for this member in 2015 as a sales promotion measure in the summer when sales decrease.
Initially it was a 24-hour event, but the scale expanded year by year, and last year it was held in 18 countries such as the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, India, Japan, China, and Australia from 7.15 am to 0-48 hours.
According to the company, last year, sales for 2 days exceeded previous sales for"Black Friday" (the first day of year-end sales) and "Cyber Monday" (the next Monday).
This event also contributed to the acquisition of new subscribers of paid members"Prime", and last year the number of applications on the first day was the record number of 1 day, and the next day there was also the second number.
In addition, last year, it said that it sold 1 billion 7,500 million products worldwide.
About this, Internet retailer, a specialized magazine in the online shopping industry, reported that the global total sales for 2 days increased 70% year-on-year to 71-6000 million dollars (about 7600 billion yen).
Strict eyes on mobile number migration, excessive detainment.
what about fees and points?
(New Switch) - Yahoo!News
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications is in full swing to review the MNP system, which allows users to use their existing phone numbers as they are when changing mobile carriers.
At a meeting of experts on the 21st, he announced a policy to amend the guidelines of the MNP, which was enacted in 2004.
There are a wide variety of specific issues, such as how MNP fees should be and whether or not they should be detained for those who wish to move out.
With the expected backlash from telecommunications companies, attention is focused on whether it will promote healthy market competition.
In 06, when MNP was introduced, the user fee was 2000 yen, but now it is 3000 yen.
The MNP commission revenue of 3 major mobile telecommunications companies is estimated to be 15.9 billion yen per year.
On May 21, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications listed the current situation regarding MNP at the"Working Group on Verification of Competition Rules (WG)," a meeting of experts to discuss the competitive environment in the telecommunications market.
The time required for issuing MNP reservation numbers when consumers move to another telecommunications company is also a yardstick.
Major telecommunications companies accept it on the web, but due to the convenience of the operation of the core system, the mainstream reception time is 9-20 o'clock.
In the WG document, it was clearly stated that all-day response would be a principle as a direction for future consideration.
For those who wish to move out in MNP, it is also a problem that mobile carriers try to detain by granting points.
This is because it is judged that excessive retention may hinder fair competition.
Shunichi Kita, Partner at Nomura Research Institute, who is a member of the WG, said,"We will promptly issue a number to users who do not grant permission from users if they have time to explain the provision of economic benefits.It is important to thoroughly implement this process first."
However, in a series of issues, there is a structural problem that"the higher the MNP fee, the more difficult it is for customers to flow out, so it is difficult to motivate them to actively lower it." (The person in charge of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications)
If some operators take the initiative to lower MNP fees, they will increase the outflow of customers from that company, and it is also a concern that corporate efforts will not be rewarded.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications has also pointed out that many countries overseas do not ask for user-paid fees for MNP, and it is possible that this will happen in Japan as well.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications summarized the results of the WG in a report around 9-10 May, and then decided to start the procedure for amending the MNP guidelines.
It is believed that the revision will take place after 21 years.
Mobile operators are likely to worry about sales and customer support, too.

Tangshan played as a special designated player last season in J3, scoring 10 goals in 8 games.
The 178-centimetre, 65-kilogram spaniard has a phenomenal scoring rate in J3 with 15 goals in 11 games, thanks to his sense of taking the back of the defender in an instant movement and his calmness to shoot in front of a crowded opponent's goal.
In the match against Hiroshima, STRIKER Ademiuson and midfielder Onose were out of the bench due to injuries, and Karayama got a chance, but there was no chance to play.
Miyamoto explained the conditions of Ademiuson and Onose for the match against Kobe, saying,"They are not 100% of the time, but they are willing and willing to prepare for it."
If the two are to be preserved, there is a possibility that they will be benched to Tangshan again.

Last spring, because the freezer part of the refrigerator broke, Ms. B asked her husband"I want you to buy a refrigerator".
However, my husband hesitated to change, saying,"The freezer is not good, but the refrigerated part can still be used, so it's okay."
However, it seems that in the summer, my husband wanted to prepare an environment where he could eat ice cream at any time, so he turned his palm upside down and said,"Let's buy a refrigerator after all."
So B child-san involuntarily"husband is so stingy"and seems to have complained to a friend.
