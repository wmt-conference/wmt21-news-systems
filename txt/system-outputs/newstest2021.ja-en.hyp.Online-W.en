Honoka gets a "Minami Tanaka-style haircut"!
Report on the cut (CanCam.jp) - Yahoo! News
Adding layers to heavy semi-long hair to make it soft and "Minami-like.
CanCam model Honoka says, "Not only is she beautiful, but she has a very high level of professionalism that I admire! "We challenged her to create a hairstyle with movement like Minami Tanaka's, which she admires.
I asked Mr. Mitsuki Asahi of SUNVALLY, a hair salon in Omotesando, who actually cuts Minami Tanaka's hair, to give me a "Minami-esque haircut".
Here's a report on the cutting process!
Nogizaka46 Mizuki Yamashita's first cover with short hair!
First, we checked Honoka's hair before the cut.
It's thin, soft, and abundant.
She sometimes has her hair straightened and permed because it's a bit unruly, especially during the rainy season.
She has heavy semi-long hair with flowing bangs.
Finally, the cutting begins!
First, wet the entire hair lightly to make it easier to cut.
Then, separate the area above the bees (the area above the most protruding part of the head) and start cutting from the bottom.
By the way, here are some tips on how to make your hair look more like Minami's!
1 Taboo Bangs By shortening the inner part of the bangs slightly, you can make them a little thicker when fully down, or see-through when lightly parted... You can change the look depending on how you style it.
2 Cut to make the most of your hair texture If you have a lot of hair texture and reduce the amount of hair too much, it may spread even more.
We consulted with the client to find the right balance to keep the hair manageable and prevent it from spreading, while allowing the client's own curls to shine through.
3 Layers around the face and hair buns Layers = a cut with steps.
Layers around the face help to create movement and a cute finish.
Create a bun at the temples, in front of the hairline, and behind the hairline for a stylish look even when the hair is quickly gathered.
Separate the hair above the bees and cut the hair around the face.
Pull the hair bundle at the top of the hair around the face forward, and cut the ends of the hair into little pieces.
This way, when the hair is pulled down, there will be a stepped look and it will be easier to create movement (this is called a layered cut).

However, only 11,000 stores in the prefecture, which has more than 120,000 restaurants, have issued the stickers.
Therefore, Governor Yoshimura announced a partnership with an Internet reservation site, saying, "I'm thinking of doing this at the end of the month, but I'm going to tie up with Gurunavi so that when you make a reservation, you can see the restaurants that have issued the declaration stickers and know when you make the reservation.
"The important thing is not to lump them all together as 'nightlife districts. What is important is not to lump them all together as 'nightlife districts,' but to make a clear distinction between restaurants that take measures against infectious diseases and those that do not. It is also important to make efforts to increase the number of stores that do.

Tsuruoka Police Department to Work with Related Organizations to Raise Safety Awareness
A collision test between a car and a bicycle was conducted at a bicycle class held as the starting event of the new strategy at Shoko Gakuen driving school in Tsuruoka City.
The Tsuruoka Police Station (Chief Keizo Sato) has launched the "Bye-bye Accident Zero Operation" in an effort to eliminate accidents involving bicycles and motorcycles, which have been occurring at a high rate in its jurisdiction in recent years.
In addition to promoting awareness of accident prevention together with traffic safety organizations in the area, the police will also strengthen the crackdown on violations of traffic rules by bicycles.
This year, there have been three fatal traffic accidents within the jurisdiction of the station, in which people riding motorcycles or bicycles died.
Although the number of accidents is on a downward trend, the percentage of accidents involving bicycles was about 11.7% as of June 30, and that involving motorcycles was about 5.8%, both higher than the prefectural average.
In particular, the percentage of accidents involving bicycles has been higher than the prefectural average for the past five years, and we have planned a campaign to overcome this situation.
The name of the campaign is a combination of the words "bike" and "bicycle" with the meaning of eradicating accidents.
We will ask the organizations concerned to give more instructions to the elderly on how to drive and to use reflective materials at traffic safety classes.
The police department will issue yellow cards (instruction warning cards) to the drivers to warn them of the danger.
On the 21st, a ceremony was held at Shoko Gakuen driving school in Tsuruoka City to mark the start of the campaign.
About 30 people attended the ceremony, and Chief Sato said, "I would like to ask for your cooperation in reducing even one tragic accident.
A representative of the police station presented the policy and the activities of each group.
A bicycle class was held as the starting event of the campaign.
A police officer in a car demonstrated how the impact on a bicycle is different if the bicycle is hit with the brakes applied or if it is hit without the brakes at a speed of about 55 kilometers per hour.
Mr. Koichi Kanauchi, chairman of the Tsuruoka District Council for Promotion of Traffic Safety Activities, said, "I realized once again the horror of traffic accidents. I would like to call for caution not only among the elderly but also among young people.

Mr. Kisuke said, "It's been a while since I've seen a performance, so my voice wasn't in good shape, but it was a fulfilling time.
Guest performers included rakugo storyteller Katsura Kotome, 31, of Osaka City, and the Tsuyama Magic Club, a magician group.
The Comedy Akasaka-tei was opened in 1996 by the former Akasaka Town as the nation's first public parlor.
It had continued to hold regular monthly yose and delivery yose, but due to the effects of the new corona, it stopped holding yose after its last performance in February this year.
Demonstrations in the Russian Far East for an Unusual 15 Days in a Row: Protesting the Governor's Detention and the Regime
Demonstrators in the Khabarovsk region of Russia's Far East protest the detention and dismissal of Governor Furgal on April 25 (AP)
A demonstration to protest against the detention and dismissal of the governor of Khabarovsk in the Russian Far East took place in the region on April 25.
This is the 15th consecutive day of demonstrations, an unusual situation.
Criticism has also been directed at President Putin.
In the capital, Moscow, the security authorities did not take the usual step of detaining the protesters en masse, indicating the administration's cautious stance in consideration of the feelings of the local residents.
Former Governor Furgal, a member of the far-right Liberal Democratic Party, overwhelmingly defeated the incumbent candidate of Putin's ruling party, United Russia, in the 2006 gubernatorial runoff election with about 70% of the vote.
He was one of the few non-ruling party governors in Russia, but he was detained by security authorities on the 9th of this month.
He is suspected of involvement in two murders of businessmen in 2004 and 2005.

Students of Okayama University's special support school create "Amabie" Bizen Pottery figurines to cheer up the students：Sanyo Shimbun Digital｜Sandeji
Students of the high school for special needs attached to Okayama University (Hirai, Naka Ward, Okayama City) are making Bizen ware figurines of "Amabie," a monster that is believed to calm plagues, as gifts for local elderly people.
Due to the effects of the new coronavirus, it is difficult for the students to sell their products in stores and interact with local residents, as they usually do in the past.
Eleven high school students have been working on the project three days a week in the morning since June as part of their classes.
After molding the clay, which they stretched with a lot of effort, they wrapped straw around the clay to make a "Hidasuki," a red pattern unique to Bizen Pottery.
It takes about two to three weeks to complete the process, including drying and firing.
A third-year student (18) said, "I am trying my best to make them with the hope that the elderly will be able to stay healthy despite the new Corona.
On the 27th, 40 Bizen ware will be delivered to the residents of Okayama City Yurakuen, a nursing home for the elderly, with whom the students have been in contact through choral performances.
The production of Bizen Pottery is scheduled to continue until the end of July, and the recipients of the remaining pieces will be decided in the future.

Akashi Shogyo's Nakamori gives up 0 hits, 7 Ks in 3 innings!
Tigers and G's praise him, Hanshin's Wada TA 'still top class' (Sankei Sports) - Yahoo! News
I'm not sure what to make of it.
Shunsuke Nakamori (3rd year), a right-handed pitcher with 151kg, who is one of the top candidates for the draft, pitched with dignity, allowing no hits and striking out 7 in 3 innings.
Yutaka Wada, 57, technical advisor to the Hanshin baseball team, who observed the game, praised his performance.
The start of the game was delayed 39 minutes for maintenance due to the continuous rain.
The mound was muddy.
Even so, he was fired up for his long-awaited first official game of the year.
He gave up one walk at the end, but pitched a no-hitter with dignity.
He struck out seven and pitched three shutout innings to help his team win the game in five innings.
"I felt like I was floating the whole time. I'm glad I was able to strike out with my straight pitches, but I want to fix the fact that I couldn't find the low pitches that were changing. Nakamori's self-evaluation was harsh, but he marked the fastest speed of 148 km/h on the day, and the professional eyes of Hanshin, Giants and Orix behind the net gave him high marks.
It was the first time that Hanshin's Wada TA observed him in person since the first game of the Koshien Tournament last summer (second inning, 4-3 Hanasaki Tokuei).
He said, "He is growing. He is still one of the best high school players. Even when he was down, his form didn't collapse and he was able to control it well. I think he's going to be a top candidate.
The Giants' scout, Kishi, also said, "He was the best I've seen recently.
I'm not sure if I'm going to be a pro or a college student at the end of June.
At the end of June, he said he was 50/50 between going pro and going on to college. "I want to go pro, but I can't decide yet," he said.
Before that, his goal is to win this year's tournament, which ends in the top eight.
The rule of the tournament is that 20 members on the bench can be changed for each game.
In this game, all 16 third-year players played.
In order for all 39 third-year students to play, they must continue to win their remaining three games.
"We've been practicing hard for three years, and this is our last tournament. I want to win all the games, including the Koshien. I've always been told by coach Sama that I can't get a complete game, so I'll try to do that.

Butler again praises Heat's future youngster Tyler Hero: "His mindset is not that of a rookie" (Basket Count) - Yahoo!
The Heat's first scrimmage of the season was against the Kings.
In a 104-98 win, Duncan Robinson scored a team-high 18 points and Tyler Hero followed with 15 points in the backcourt.
Robinson, one of the best shooters in the league, and Hero, a rookie who was the 13th overall pick in the draft, will be important for the Heat to step up.
Hero missed 15 games in February and March due to an ankle injury, and after his return game against the Hornets on March 12, the season took a long hiatus.
Hero said, "I had plenty of time to get back to 100 percent condition. I've had a lot of time to get back to 100 percent and it's one of the best feelings I've ever felt," he said.
Kendrick Nunn, the team's starting point guard, was late to join the team, which gave the hero more playing time, and he took advantage of the opportunity.
The 15 points he scored were worth a lot, as he played a different role than usual.
Jimmy Butler, the team's leader, praised his favorite hero again.
"He can handle, he can score, he can play defense. He's a player who can do everything for the team. He can play any position because his mindset is not that of a rookie. I watch film and study it, and I know where my teammates are going to move to get free and what I need to do about it.
Even before the start of the season, Butler has been impressed with Hero's rookie-like competitive spirit and his stoic approach to basketball.
That's why he's invited him to his private practices, which start at 4 a.m., and has worked out with him.
Butler once said, "He speaks his mind to everyone and doesn't back down. I respect that kind of fighting spirit.
Butler is the type of person who always says what he thinks, and if he thinks it is in the best interest of the team, he will give his opinion, even if it causes conflict.
Butler is a man who always says what he thinks, and if he thinks it is in the best interest of the team, he will give his opinion, even if it causes conflict.
I think Butler sees his hero as a younger version of himself.
Butler's personality, which is sometimes too harsh for his teammates, can be a good guide for those who have the guts to follow him.
If their mutual respect and mentorship spreads to the team as a whole, the Heat will be a team that can aim even higher.

With the bases loaded and no outs in the first inning, Matsuura of Shimada Sho hit a breaking ball to left field.
"I wanted to make them win by hitting. I wanted to make them win by hitting myself.
I wanted to make them win by hitting the ball myself." The talented player, who also played fourth base last fall, was proud.
The first three rounds of the tournament were played mainly by the third-year players, while the second-year players, who were more powerful, were put on reserve.
Coach Ikeda gathered the players in a meeting and said, "The three years have carried us this far. From now on, we'll go with our best lineup," he told the players.
On this day, four of the nine starters were second-year players.
It may seem ruthless, but it is proof that the team is committed to playing a serious game.
Matsuura said, "From now on, the level of opposing pitchers will increase. I'm going to try to bring runners home myself.
Saito, who pitched six innings in a row, did not allow even a runner to reach second base, showing the determination of a third-year player.
The number 10 said, "The second year's performance will inspire the third year. I hope this will lead to victory.
The team is aiming to make it to the top four for the third year in a row, including last year's Shizuoka tournament, and has no intention of making the remaining games a memory.
16 Musicians Associated with Fukushima to Sing with the People of the Prefecture (Fukushima Minpo) - Yahoo! News
Sixteen musicians associated with Fukushima Prefecture have come together to sing with the people of the prefecture.
Sixteen musicians associated with Fukushima Prefecture have come together to create a message song.
The song is about Fukushima Prefecture's efforts to recover from the Great East Japan Earthquake and the accident at TEPCO's Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant, and to fight the new coronavirus.
The song will be sung by the people of Fukushima Prefecture, and the "complete version" of the song will be completed by next summer, the tenth anniversary of the disaster.
On April 24, the song was released on the video sharing website YouTube.
The name of the song is "Pray from Fukushima.
The song is called "Pray from Fukushima," and it features a bright and cheerful melody that conveys the positive attitude of people from Fukushima.
Due to the effects of the new Corona, live houses, which are the bases of music activities, have been forced to close, and many musicians have lost their places to sing and perform.
Nappo, 46, a singer and songwriter living in Minamisoma City, and Dazuo, 37, a member of the music group "Mexicali Boys" in Iwaki City, planned this project to believe in the power of music in times when the future is uncertain.
Nappo will be in charge of lyrics and composition, while Dazuo will be in charge of rapping.
When the project started in March, the year of the Corona disaster, MANAMI (28), a singer/songwriter from Fukushima City, and JUN KANNO (38), a singer/songwriter from Fukushima City, agreed to join the project one after another, and the circle spread quickly.
Ms. Nappo said, "We have a gorgeous lineup, which is unthinkable under normal circumstances. I want to enjoy this opportunity to the fullest," he said with a look of emotion.
As a precaution against infection, the sixteen members of the group did not gather together, but each recorded at a live house or at home.
To encourage the project, Koa, a painter from Iwaki City, drew an image character.
The character represents Fukushima Prefecture, with blue and green colors representing the rich natural climate.
The completed song will be sent out to the world via YouTube and will also be made into a CD.
Next year will mark the tenth anniversary of the disaster, and the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics, which were postponed, are scheduled to be held.
Dazuo said, "We have overcome a lot of difficulties and we have a lot to carry. By releasing songs at this milestone, I hope they will encourage many people.
The other participating musicians are as follows

Internet-based crisis detection and hoax detection (JBpress) - Yahoo! News
"I want to know where and what kind of disaster or accident has occurred as soon as possible! I want to know where and what kind of disaster or accident occurred first!
This need is not limited to news organizations such as TV and newspapers, but is also strong in many companies such as social infrastructure companies and local governments.
Spectee, an AI-based information analysis company, has developed a service called "Spectee" to meet this need.
Photo] A team of experts judges the authenticity of social media information through alerts from Spectee.
Nowadays, the first way people learn about disasters and accidents is shifting from television to the Internet (social media).
Social media such as Twitter has become an important medium for disseminating information immediately after a disaster or accident occurs.
However, it is difficult for people to constantly watch the overflow of information and extract useful information from it.
Specty has a function that detects natural disasters and accidents from information flowing through social media such as Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, analyzes the content, determines the authenticity of the information, and then distributes it to the companies using the information.
It is a crisis management support service that visualizes the various crises occurring in Japan and overseas, and defines "crises" as "a wide range of events with a negative impact that can stop or stagnate social activities" (Kenjiro Murakami, CEO).
NHK (Japan Broadcasting Corporation) was the first major use case of SPECTY after the Kumamoto earthquake in April 2016, and since then, the adoption of SPECTY has spread rapidly among companies.
In addition to TV stations, newspapers, and other media organizations, more than 350 companies in Japan, including companies that support social infrastructure such as electricity, gas, and transportation, as well as local governments across the country, are currently using SPECTYS.
Analyzing posts to determine the type of "crisis" and its location
Specty delivers information in four steps: information collection, analysis and content classification, titling, and authenticity judgment.
The user company specifies in advance the region (e.g., prefecture or municipality) and the category of crisis (e.g., disaster or accident) for which information is to be collected.
Specty collects posts that correspond to these specifications using APIs provided by social media.
It then analyzes and classifies the text, images, and videos contained in the collected posts.
For example, if the video shows a fire truck, black smoke coming from a building, and orange flames coming from a room, it will be classified as "fire.
If the video shows an overturned car, it is classified as a "traffic accident," and if the video shows a flooded road, it is classified as a "flooded road.
Spectre also estimates the location of the disaster or accident.
"In many cases, the location cannot be determined from the postings, so we combine various information to estimate the location," says CEO Murakami.
For example, if there is a road sign or a signboard in the image or video, we extract the information of the place name from it and check it against the place name database to identify the location.

There are fears of heavy rains in Nagano Prefecture, mainly in the southern part of the prefecture, on the 26th, and the central and southern parts of the prefecture need to be on alert for landslides.
In Takaki Village, a prefectural road that is closed to traffic has been washed away, leaving residents isolated once again.
Sandbags and temporary bridges were swallowed by the swollen river and swept away.
A little after 3:00 a.m., a surveillance camera set up by the prefectural Iida construction office in Takaki village captured the scene.
This is a detour road built on the riverbed to replace a prefectural road that was closed due to a landslide, and has been open to residents' vehicles only since March 17.
As a result, 56 people from 33 households in the Oshima area are now isolated again, and the Iida Construction Office is planning to start restoration work as soon as the water recedes.
Warm and humid air is flowing in toward the rainy season front, and heavy rainfall of 30 millimeters per hour or more is expected in some areas of the prefecture through the 26th.
The forecasted rainfall for the next 24 hours until 6:00 p.m. on the 26th is 80 millimeters in the central part of the prefecture and 120 millimeters in the southern part.
The meteorological observatory has issued a heavy rainfall warning for the Saku, Suwa, and Kiso areas.
"The weather forecast is for heavy rain in the Saku, Suwa and Kiso areas. ...? I'm sorry.
What's the difference between a dialect and a real dialect?
I'm a resident of Chiba Prefecture, near Tokyo.
I was born and have lived in the prefecture for almost 30 years.
I've been living in the same prefecture for less than 30 years since I was born, and when I used the word "zurumikomi," which means "sideways entry," in a conversation with a friend at university in Tokyo, I was met with a moment of disbelief.
They understood what I meant by the flow and the sense of the word, but I was told by Tokyoites and Saitamaites that they don't use it.
- It's true that "zurukomi" means to cheat and get in the way. I don't know.
I think I can guess what it means.
And one more thing.
I didn't realize this until you pointed it out, but the expression "uchinchi" meaning "my house" is not used at all in books, and I didn't hear it from my friends either, so I looked it up when I was growing up and found it was a dialect.
- What? ... So that's how it was?
I'm not sure if it's because I've never heard it before, or because I've never heard it since I grew up. ... ... ...
Japanese "Chilled Chinese Food" is not popular among Chinese people...? ...
"The reason why cold noodle dishes are not popular in China (Gendai Business) - Yahoo! News
Chilled Chinese noodles are called "Japanese cold noodles" in China
As mentioned at the beginning of this article, cold Chinese noodles are a Chinese dish (Japanese style Chinese) that originated in Japan and was invented based on the Chinese "lian bun mien" (cold mixed noodles).
Therefore, it does not originally exist in China, but with the diversification of food, it has become common to see it in Japanese restaurants in the summer.
Recently, Japanese convenience stores have also introduced products with the name of "Japanese Soba Cold Soba" or "Szechuan Chicken Cold Soba".
On the other hand, the popularity of Japanese style Chinese food is generally not high in China, pushed by the trendy and punchy Chinese cuisines such as Sichuan and Hunan.
Not surprisingly, the flavors of Japanese Chinese food are often familiar to Chinese people.
Therefore, although it is not bad, it tends to be severely criticized for its lack of impact.
"Cold Chinese noodles are no exception to this rule, and are still a minor item in China.
By the way, the name of chilled Chinese food in China is "Japanese cold noodles".
In China, the name of chilled Chinese noodles is "Japanese cold noodles," and it is recognized by the Chinese as one of the Japanese dishes.
The standard summer dish is "lian pi".
In China, the noodle dish that reminds us of summer is probably "lian pi".
Although many people in Japan may not be familiar with it, lianpi is a flat noodle dish made of wheat flour, rice flour, and starch that originated in Shaanxi Province.
It is said to have a history of 2,000 years.
It is a staple of B-grade gourmet food sold at food stalls, and is very reasonably priced at around 10 to 20 yuan (150 to 300 yen).
Although it has the word "cool" in it, it is not served with ice like Japanese chilled Chinese noodles.
Rather, it is basically served at room temperature.
The noodles are topped with shredded cucumbers, carrots, boiled bean sprouts, and other ingredients of your choice, and condiments such as pak choi, chili, ginger, and garlic are added.
Finally, pour on the special seasoning, which is a mixture of soy sauce, raayu, vinegar, sesame paste, and peanut paste.
The thick and spicy sauce with a refreshing sour taste is so well mixed with the noodles that it is easy to eat even when you are feeling a bit tired and have no appetite.
Another characteristic of liangui is that it has become so popular throughout China that it is available in a wide variety of toppings and flavors.

"The benefits of cold water showers for the body and mind (Cosmopolitan) - Yahoo! News
Reduces inflammation in muscle aches and pains
"A study published in The North American Journal of Medical Sciences on the effectiveness of hydrotherapy (water therapy) found that it can have a positive effect on physical and mental healing.
Cold water after a workout can help reduce muscle pain and other inflammatory effects.
According to Professor Douglas Kasa, director of the Korey Stringer Institute for Sports Medicine and a professor at the University of Connecticut, "It's important to take a cold shower as soon as possible after exercising. The sooner you lower your body temperature after a workout, the faster you will recover from the inflammation and fatigue caused by exercise," he says.
Reduce fatigue
When you exercise in high temperatures, your heart, muscles and skin need more blood flow than usual.
"During exercise, the heart rate is higher, which increases blood flow to the heart, and muscle blood flow increases because it takes more energy to contract the muscles. When you exercise, your heart rate is higher, so there is more blood flow to the heart, which requires more energy to contract the muscles, and more blood flows to the skin to regulate body temperature," says Casa.
"Taking a cold shower lowers the temperature of the skin, thus reducing the blood flow to the skin. Instead, blood flow is sent to internal organs such as the stomach and intestines, making it easier to consume water and nutrients after exercise. As a result, the fatigue felt after exercise can be reduced.
Hopes for a hormesis effect
Dr. Dorozhevsky also explains that cold water exposure can be expected to activate the "hormesis effect.
The hormesis effect is the idea that it is better to have a little bit of harmful substances and stress in the body than none at all.
"Hypoxia, fasting, and cold water showers are examples of the hormesis effect that can be expected for good health. Cold water showers stimulate hormones and neurotransmitters, which help to develop physical and mental toughness and resilience.

Hanshin Oyama hits No. 7 for 2nd straight game!
I'm not sure what to make of it.
I'm not sure what to make of it.
The ball soared high and landed in the middle of the left field bleachers.
It was Oyama's second consecutive game with an arch, and he circled the diamond.
When he returned to the bench, he showed his white teeth.
"I was swinging well, and I was able to focus on my target pitch and swing as hard as I could.
With the score 0-2 in the fourth inning, I came to bat first.
I swung aggressively at the first pitch, and after fouling off the second pitch.
I didn't miss Yu Ohno's sweet 134km slider.
The ball was so perfect that I was sure it was going into the stands as soon as I hit it.
It was his second consecutive hit, following the one against Hiroshima at Koshien on the previous day, and it sparked a counterattack.
It was also a valuable hit against an opponent he was not very good at.
When they faced Yu Ohno at Koshien on March 17, they scored four runs on nine hits.
However, at Nagoya Dome, he had allowed 7 wins, 1 loss, and 1 hold in his previous 12 games, and had suffered 7 straight losses with a draw since August 23, 2013.
He scored his first run in 23 innings at Nagoya Dome (even his surrender in the middle of the game counted as one inning) with a powerful single to keep the game going.
Manager Yano said, "His ability to get rid of sweet pitches is of a high level. Even when he's hitting a foul ball at the right time, he's got atmosphere. I think he's still going to hit." He had high hopes for more explosions.
In the first inning, he hit a single to right, marking his sixth consecutive game with a hit and his third consecutive game with multiple hits.
He may have started the season as a reserve, but his 7 home runs and 16 runs batted in are already tops on the team, and he's doing a perfect job as the number 4.
He will continue to produce results for the sake of victory.

Japan rugby 7-man men's team unites for medal in first training camp in four months (Sankei Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
The head coach (HC) of the Japanese men's seven-man rugby team, Kensuke Iwabuchi, was interviewed by the press online on April 25, and expressed his determination to "unite and work toward the goal of winning a medal" at the Tokyo Olympics, which have been postponed until next year.
Due to the postponement of the Olympics, Yusaku Kuwazuru (Coca-Cola), the captain of the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics team, and Kenju Fukuoka (Panasonic), a member of the 2016 Olympics team who also played in the 15-man World Cup in 2007, have left the team.
The coach said, "Of course, it will have a big impact, but we will move forward with players who can fight together.
The team started a training camp for national team candidates in Tokyo and Oita on this day.
This is the first time since March that the training camp involves overnight stays, and it will last until March 28, but as a measure to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, the team will not practice with contact.
The national team has been selected to return to the top group for the 7-man World Series (WS) next season, where they will be able to participate in all the games, but since the WS itself, which is played around the world, is uncertain, HC Iwabuchi said that they are negotiating with countries that allow the national team to enter the country to play strengthening games.

A woman in her 40s in Suwa City, Nagano Prefecture, has been found to be infected with a new type of coronavirus.
This is the first time that a medical worker has been infected in Suwa.
The infection was confirmed in a woman in her 40s, a medical worker in Suwa City.
The number of infected people in the prefecture has increased to 87, and this is the first time a healthcare worker has been infected.
According to the prefectural government, the woman began coughing and expectorating on the 13th, and has been visiting three medical institutions since the 17th.
She was hospitalized on the 23rd, and on the 24th, she was found to be positive.
She is said to have a mild illness, and her four family members who were in close contact with her have no symptoms.
The woman had been working until the 16th and had not visited outside of the prefecture for two weeks prior to the onset of the disease.
The route of infection is currently under investigation.
The woman's employer, Suwa Red Cross Hospital, announced on the evening of the 24th that they had an infected employee.

The Macau Casino Control Authority has inspected the implementation of quarantine measures in casino facilities... Macau casino authority inspects quarantine measures in place (Macau News) - Yahoo!
About 40 casinos in Macau were closed for 15 days from February 5 to 19 during the outbreak of the new coronavirus infection (COVID-19), but have resumed operations since February 20 with strict quarantine measures in place.
The Macau Casino Regulatory Authority (DICJ) requires operators to protect the health of their employees and guests to the maximum extent possible. For example, at a baccarat table, three to four people can be seated at one table at the same time), and slot machines are required to operate one or two tables at a time, in order to reduce the risk of cross-infection.
Disinfection of chips and other gaming equipment has also been strengthened.
Guests are also required to wear masks, take their temperature, and present a valid health code (generated by entering the guest's recent stay in the area, whether or not they have had any contact with the new corona patients, whether or not they have any symptoms such as fever or cough, and their contact information) upon entering the area.
From midnight on July 15, a negative certificate for the new coronavirus nucleic acid test (issued by an authorized facility in Macau or Guangdong Province and valid for a certain period of time only) is also required.
The reason for the new requirement to present a negative certificate is the relaxation of the waterfront measures between Macau and Guangdong (elimination of the 14-day quarantine, with various conditions) starting at 6 a.m. on July 15, and this is a precautionary measure.
On July 18, in response to the change in admission conditions from July 15, Director General of the DICJ, Mr. Adrian Ho, and others inspected the implementation of quarantine measures at casino facilities. In addition, DICJ held a meeting with representatives of the security departments of the six casino operators to reiterate the need to protect the health of employees and guests by thoroughly controlling the entry of guests.
The DICJ will continue to conduct strict patrols of the casino facilities and will have regular meetings with the operators to assess the situation and to adjust quarantine measures at the casinos in accordance with the guidelines of the government health department.
Lin Song, director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of the Department of Health, and others accompanied the inspection of the casino facilities, and provided guidance on disinfecting gaming chips and keeping a safe distance between the seats of electronic casino equipment.
Due to the sharp decline in inbound passengers caused by quarantine measures, including restrictions on entry into the country, casino sales for the first six months of this year decreased by 77.4% from the same period last year to MOP33.72 billion (about 451.9 billion yen).
A message to the medical profession in lieu of the Bonbori Festival next month (Hokkoku Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
Due to the new coronavirus, the annual "Yuwaku Bonbori Festival" has been cancelled in Yuwaku Onsen.
Fans from all over the country and local residents will write their messages on about 350 paper lanterns, which will wrap the hot spring resort in the light of ale and bring comfort to visitors.
The Bonbori Festival is a reenactment of the festival that appears in the anime "Hanasaku Iroha," which was modeled on Yuwaku Onsen, and is organized by the Yuwaku Onsen Tourist Association.
The festival started in 2011, the year the anime was broadcast, and is visited by many anime fans from all over Japan every year.
Every year, from the lighting ceremony in July to the main festival in October, bonbori are lit up on the stairs leading to the Yuwaku Inari Shrine next to the Soyu Spa.
This year, the festival had to be cancelled due to the new Corona model, but the association came up with the idea of this project after a number of local and national fans said they would miss having bonbori in Yuwaku in the summer.
In response, the association came up with the idea for this project, calling it the "Recovery Campaign," hoping to contribute to the healing and recovery of the world in the wake of the corona disaster.
So far, about 50 students from the local Yuwaku Elementary School and Shibahara Junior High School have written messages with illustrations one by one, and more than 100 applications have been received from all over Japan.
After filling out the form, send it to the association in a self-addressed envelope, and you will receive a photo of your message attached to a bonbori and lit up.
The fee is 6,000 yen per set and applications will be accepted until the total number of bonbori reaches 350.
The bonbori will be lit until the end of November.
Shinichiro Yamashita, 48, who has been the festival's executive committee chairman since its inception, said, "Reading the messages encourages us. Next year, we want to hold a grand festival to mark the 10th anniversary," he said.
For the campaign, we have prepared newly drawn illustrations of the characters of Hanasaku Iroha and the Asano River Bridge.
From the first day, a clear file with the illustration will be given to users of special accommodation plans at inns in Yuwaku Onsen.
Moriyama Gogen, the core four supporting Seibu, work together with spirit (Tospo Web) - Yahoo! News
I'm not sure what to make of this.
In the ninth inning of the 2-2 loss to Lotte at MetLife on March 24, four slumping players who are still far from their best showed their determination to win.
Genda led off the inning with a head-slide to first base off a safety bunt.
Then No. 3 Mori, who has been hitting .182 in the last six games, laid down a bunt to load the bases with one out.
After Yamakawa, the fourth baseman, was given a no-show, Tonosaki, who had replaced Mori in the fifth spot, crushed a straight ball by Masuda to give the team a 3-2 victory.
The hero, Togosaki, said, "(Genda's safety) caught me off guard even as I was on the bench, and I knew I had to do something about it. Tomoya bunted, and I could tell that he was believing in me behind the plate and was trying to connect. Before Mr. Yamakawa went to first base to honor me, he told me to be aggressive! I was able to put my mind to it.
Mori and Yamakawa, the first and second round picks in the 2001 draft, Tonosaki, the third round pick in 2002, and Genda, the third round pick in 2004, are the "core four" of the team's fielders, whom team officials refer to as "the heart of our team.
All of them have been captains in their amateur days and have a greater sense of responsibility than most.
Sotozaki, who took over the captaincy from Yamakawa in his senior year at Fuji University, said, "Yamakawa-san is a good talker, so he is the captain who leads the team with his words. On the other hand, I'm not much of a talker, so I left the talking to the vice-captain, who is a good talker, and stayed in the background." Each of them is supporting the new captain, Genda, and the new players' president, Mori, by showing their own individuality.
Manager Tsuji said, "Genda's safety? That's not a sign. But that made me think, 'Okay, I can go. Tomoya had a great bunt. Tomoya bunted beautifully, and Tonosaki hit well," praised the soulful cooperation of Moriyama and Togen.
All four are now struggling with batting averages of .240 to .500, but even if they can't hit, they are supporting the team with their wisdom and ways to win.

China to close U.S. consulate general in Chengdu after U.S. Secretary of State's criticism of Communist Party: Hokkaido Shimbun Doshin E-Edition
The Chinese media reported on Tuesday that the gates of the U.S. Consulate General in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, which the Chinese government had asked to be closed, had been sealed.
It also reported that a person believed to be a staff member was carrying luggage and leaving the building.
It is expected to be closed by the morning of the 27th.
The U.S. government has confirmed the closure of the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, Texas in the south of the country, further intensifying the confrontation between the U.S. and China.
On April 25, Chinese leader Xi Jinping showed his readiness to reject U.S. Secretary of State Pompeo's speech criticizing the Communist Party's one-party rule system, saying it "stirred up an ideological confrontation and sparked a new Cold War between China and the United States" through a commentary article in the state-run Xinhua News Agency.
A statue of Masujiro Omura on a tatami mats tells of his achievements as an educator.
On the 23rd, a bronze statue of Masujiro Omura (1825-69), one of the ten outstanding figures of the Meiji Restoration, was unveiled in his birthplace of Chinkenzhi, Yamaguchi City.
The unveiling ceremony was held in the front yard of the Chikusenji Community Exchange Center, where the statue was installed, and local and administrative officials celebrated the completion.
Masujiro was a military scientist, Western scholar, and doctor during the late Edo period.
After teaching at the Bansho Shirabesho, the Shogunate's institution for research and education of Western studies, he opened a private school in Edo called Hatodo and taught Dutch studies, military science and medicine.
After returning to the Choshu domain, he lectured on military science at Yamaguchi Meirinkan.
The bronze statue focuses on Masujiro as an educator.
The statue takes the form of him standing beside a globe, holding a book in his hand and giving a lecture on Dutch studies.
The height of the statue, including the pedestal, is about 3 meters (1.55 meters for the statue), and it was made from the perspective of a disciple receiving a lecture from Masujiro.
It was designed by Marie Takamine, 27, a local designer and a descendant of Kotoko, Masujiro's wife.
It was erected by the Executive Committee for the 150th Anniversary of the Death of Masujiro Omura (chaired by Satoshi Okamoto), which was formed by the Chosenji Community Association, and collected donations.
About 12.8 million yen was collected from 1,104 people across the country.
The total cost of the project, including the installation of name plates, was about 12 million yen.

Corona disaster 'brings art closer to home': Online art museum 'HASARD' launched by Konno from Hachinohe (Daily Tohoku Shimbun) - Yahoo!
There is a museum where anyone can come into contact with art for free, whenever they want.
The collection ranges from famous painters such as Claude Monet and Gustav Klimt to unknown artists in Japan.
Since its "opening" in April 2019, the online art museum "HASARD" has won the hearts of users for its convenience and novelty, and its attention has further increased with the new lifestyle of the Corona disaster.
The site's representative, Shinnosuke Konno, 26, a native of Hachinohe and a resident of Tokyo, said, "I wanted to create a service where anyone can easily enjoy art. I want people to come into contact with art when they are in difficult situations.
When you visit Azar, you will be amazed at the variety of exhibits and the beauty of the images.
As of the 24th, a total of 14 exhibitions, both permanent and special, are open to the public, and the ultra-high resolution images, which convey not only the colors but also the texture of the brush strokes, attract the viewers.
There is no need to register as a member or pay an admission fee, so there is no cost not only to the viewer but also to the artist who wants to hold a solo exhibition.
The unique way of showing works online also attracts attention.
Moving the paintings is one of them.
In Claude Monet's permanent exhibition, "It Starts to Move Again," clouds, flowers, and grasslands are digitally processed to make them move.
In the permanent exhibition of Claude Monet, "It Begins to Move Again," clouds, flowers, and meadows are digitally processed to look as if they are moving, because Mr. Konno wants to make it possible for people who are not interested in art to enter the museum.
Mr. Konno's first encounter with art was when he was in elementary school.
When he visited the newly completed Aomori Museum of Art with his family, he was shocked by the power of the three huge paintings of "Aleko" by Marc Chagall.
From the next day, art class turned into a fun time, and even after moving to Tokyo for college, he started visiting galleries.
At the same time, I realized that many people do not have many opportunities to interact with art from various perspectives, such as the lack of museums nearby, the fact that most of the major exhibitions are held in the Tokyo metropolitan area, and the difficulty of going out due to childcare.
So, while working at an IT-related company, she spent about two months setting up a website where people could view art on the Internet.
The number of users reached an average of 10,000 per month in the first 10 months, and increased to about 30,000 after the spread of the new corona infection.
Azar's aim is to make it possible for anyone to appreciate art in any way they want, whenever they want.
Azar's aim was unintentionally accepted by more and more people due to the corona disaster.
Mr. Konno stressed the significance of appreciating art as it enriches one's imagination.
"When we have a rich imagination, we can reach out to those in need.
I hope that by making art more accessible, we can create a better society.
A simple reason why the era of Chinese quality is ending and the era of Japanese quality is coming (Gendai Business) - Yahoo! News
Changing Values in a Pandemic
There has been a lot of discussion and predictions about the world after the pandemic.
On the business front, the July 8 article, "In fact, 'managerial' jobs are starting to disappear in Japan ... It's a cruel reality. On the business front, I wrote an article on July 8, "The brutal reality" and an article on July 4, "Why Japanese manufacturing is actually going to make a big comeback in the post-Corona world ...! I'm not sure. "There is a possibility that the changes described in the articles of July 4 and 5 will occur.
What is the true nature of Japan's strength that only the Japanese know? Surprising reality in Asia
In terms of spirituality, I believe that the trend described in my June 26 article, "Corona: A Guide for Those Who Have Become Aware of the End of Life," and my June 10 article, "Corona: Now is the Time to Reconsider the Benefits of 'Asking God in Times of Distress,'" will become the mainstream.
And what we will see more clearly as the merging of these two concepts of "material (economic and business)" and "spirit" is the major trend of "Chinese quality to Japanese quality.
For example, it is annoying if a T-shirt or digital camera is defective, but the life of the person who purchased it is not in danger.
On the other hand, the sloppy quality of masks and respirators made in China has become a hot topic recently. ... The "Chinese quality" of such products, which are directly related to life and safety, is fatal.
I cannot buy such products no matter how cheap they are.
No matter how cheap they are, they will not buy such products, and will seek "Japanese quality" products even if they have to pay a considerable price.
Of course, this trend is not only happening in Japan.
It is evident from the fact that Western countries that have fallen on hard times due to shortages of masks and medical equipment have returned the products one after another because of the terrible quality of Chinese products.
Safety and security rather than cheapness
In addition, products such as automobiles are also products where a defect can be fatal (death by accident).
"No matter how much China, South Korea, and other countries attack with their "cheap is as good as cheap" strategy, in the end they cannot compete with Japanese products. The reason for the situation described in the June 16 article, "Will the World's Automakers Bow Down to Toyota?" is that "Japanese quality" is strongly demanded in automotive products.
The recent pandemic has reminded us that "safety and security" are also necessary for many other products.
Safety and security are important not only for "Japanese quality in manufacturing" but also for "Japanese quality in services such as logistics.
As in the case of the toilet paper fiasco, there are times when the production capacity is in place, but the product does not reach the customer's hands due to delays in intermediate distribution.
In addition, in the April 17 article "Who is the real culprit behind the mask shortage? Don't allow the Chinese Communist regime to steal from the fire" on April 17, I was made keenly aware that self-sufficiency within Japan is also an important element of "safety and security.
It is very important to be able to procure necessities such as masks (medical equipment) and food within one's own country, as it is natural for any country to put its own country first in an emergency.
South Korea's Corona cases exceed 100 for first time in 115 days, with 86 most coming from overseas (Yonhap News) - Yahoo!
The number of people infected with the new coronavirus as of midnight this morning increased by 113 from midnight the previous day to a total of 14,092, the South Korean Central Epidemic Control Headquarters announced on Wednesday.
This is the first time in 115 days that the number of new infections per day has exceeded 100 since April 1 (101).
It is believed that this is because 32 sailors were found to be infected on a Russian ship that entered the port of Busan, and 32 of 293 workers who returned from Iraq on April 24 tested positive.
The number of newly infected people in South Korea had been in the 30-60 range, except for the 20th (26 people).
Of the new infections announced on January 25, 86 were from overseas, the highest number since January 20, when the first case was reported in South Korea.
The highest number was 36 from Iraq, 34 from Russia, 5 from the Philippines, and 3 from the US.
On the other hand, 27 people were confirmed to be infected in the city, 11 in Seoul and Gyeonggi-do, and 5 in Busan.
The five people in Busan were employees of a repair company who had boarded a Russian ship.
The number of deaths remained unchanged from the previous day, with a total of 298.
Nagoya's Miyahara Wins Corona Positive for First Time Since J1 Soccer League Resumes
Nagoya, a J1 soccer team, announced on Tuesday that defender Kazuya Miyahara, 24, has tested positive for the new coronavirus.
This is the first time a player has tested positive since the J-League resumed.
This is the third player from the club to test positive for the new coronavirus, following FW Mu Kanazaki (31) and Australian goalkeeper Mitchell Langerak (31), who were both infected in June.
The two players have already received treatment and returned to the game.
This season, Miyahara was on the bench for the J1 match against Oita at the Showa Denko Dome Oita on March 22.
Nagoya held a press conference online on April 25 and revealed that PCR tests were conducted on 60 players and staff members on the same day.
98% reflective.
Turns out the white paint, derived from a Teflon coated frying pan, insulates and improves the cooling effect!
No way, great discovery!
This year's rainy season was marked by unusually high precipitation, but once it clears, the extremely hot summer will be in full swing.
It's so hot that even the air conditioning is not working properly... Just thinking about it makes you groan, doesn't it?
Global warming is a major problem worldwide, and human beings have been trying to figure out how to overcome the heat of summer in a more comfortable way.
One way is to wear thin, white clothes.
See, there is no need to wear heat-absorbing black clothes in summer, right?
And the same principle is being applied to the construction of houses, where white paints are increasingly being used.
Although white is white, the question of whether it is possible to make a paint that reflects more light and does not absorb heat has been the subject of the latest research.
The Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), in collaboration with researchers from the Department of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics at Columbia University, has recently developed a new coating that can most efficiently reflect solar heat and improve the cooling effect inside buildings. They announced that they have found a way to formulate a white paint that can most efficiently repel solar heat and increase the cooling effect inside buildings.
It is expected to be put to practical use in the near future.
Until now, the white paint with the highest solar reflectivity has been titanium dioxide, which has a reflectivity of 85%.
White paints using titanium dioxide have already been applied to the roofs of buildings in high temperature environments to block solar heat and improve cooling efficiency.
However, the newly discovered white paint is derived from polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) fluoropolymer, which is used in Teflon-coated frying pans.
This white paint, which applies the Teflon effect, is said to be able to reflect up to 98% of sunlight and cut heat significantly.
Even in the hot summer, it is surprisingly easy to spend time indoors without being exposed to the intense heat, thanks to the white paint made of Teflon~.
Such an era may be coming soon, don't you think?
The roofs of Japanese houses seem to be mostly dark in color, but maybe white will become the mainstream in the future?
When will Amazon's annual big sale be held this year?
Amazon.com has announced the postponement of its annual big sale, Prime Day, CNBC reported on July 21.
The event is held every year in July, but this year it was reported that it had to be postponed due to the spread of the new coronavirus.
A spokesman for Amazon said in a statement, "Details will be announced shortly.
"Prime Day has become a special celebratory event that we look forward to over the past five years. This year, we're holding it later than usual to ensure the safety of our employees and to support our customers and sellers.
However, he did not give a specific date for the event, saying only that "details will be announced soon.
On the other hand, we have decided to hold the conference in India.
A press release was posted on the country's website.
It explained that the event would be held for 48 hours starting at midnight on August 6.
The Prime Day has been held simultaneously all over the world, but this year may be an unusual measure.
In the past, Prime Day has been held simultaneously around the world, but this year, Amazon may be taking an unusual step.
Last year, the sale was held for 48 hours from midnight on July 15 in 18 countries, including the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Germany, France, India, Japan, China, and Australia.
According to the company, last year, sales during the two-day period surpassed previous sales on Black Friday (the first day of the year-end shopping season) and Cyber Monday (the following Monday).
The event also helps attract new paid Prime subscribers, with a record number of sign-ups on the first day and a second record number the following day.
In addition, 175 million products were sold worldwide last year, according to the company.
In this regard, Internet Retailer, a magazine specializing in the online shopping industry, reported that total global sales for the two-day period increased 70% from the previous year to 7.16 billion dollars (about 760 billion yen).
Mobile number migration, a hard look at excessive retention.
What about fees and points?
(Newswitch) - Yahoo! News
The Ministry of Public Management, Home Affairs, Posts and Telecommunications (MIC) is in the process of reviewing the Mobile Number Portability and Protection (MNP) system, which allows users to keep their existing phone numbers when changing cell phone carriers.
At a meeting of experts held on March 21, the ministry announced its plan to revise the guidelines for MNP, which were established in 2004.
Specific issues to be discussed include the nature of MNP fees and the pros and cons of retaining those who wish to move out.
While there is expected to be a backlash from telecom companies, attention will be focused on whether or not this will lead to the promotion of healthy market competition.
In 2006, when MNP was first introduced, the user fee was 2,000 yen, but now it is 3,000 yen.
The three major mobile communication companies' MNP fee income is estimated at 15.9 billion yen per year.
On the 21st, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) listed the current situation surrounding MNP at the Working Group (WG) on the Verification of Competition Rules, an expert panel that discusses the competitive environment of the telecommunications market.
The time required for issuing an MNP reservation number, which is necessary for consumers to move to another telecommunications company, was also raised as an issue.
Major telecom companies are accepting applications via the web, but due to the operation of their backbone systems, the hours are mostly from 9am to 8pm.
In the WG document, it was clearly stated that all day service should be the principle as a direction for future study.
The WG also considers it a problem that mobile communication companies try to keep people who want to move out by MNP by giving them points.
The WG believes that excessive retention may hinder fair competition.
Shunichi Kita, a partner at Nomura Research Institute who serves as a member of the WG, said, "We will either have time to explain the economic benefits provided or obtain permission from the user, and if the user does not give permission, we will promptly issue the number and terminate the service. It is important to make this process thorough first," he suggested.
However, among the series of issues, there is a structural problem with MNP fees: "The higher the fee, the harder it is for customers to flow out, so it is difficult to motivate companies to actively lower their fees.
If some companies take the initiative in lowering their MNP fees, there is concern that this will lead to an increase in outflow of customers from those companies and that corporate efforts will not be rewarded.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) has also pointed out that many overseas countries do not require user fees for MNP, and it is possible that this will be the case in Japan as well.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) hopes to compile the results of the WG into a report around September or October, and then begin the process of revising the MNP guidelines.
In the event of a revision, it is expected to take place in 2009 or later.
The mobile communication companies are likely to have a lot on their minds, including how to handle sales and customer support.

Masuda Shrine, located in the Takagushi district of Tano, Hizen-cho, Karatsu City, is dedicated to Officer Keitaro Masuda (1869-95), who was killed in the line of duty 125 years ago in an effort to combat cholera, an epidemic that spread throughout the region.
The shrine has held a grand festival every year in late July, but this year it was cancelled due to the new coronavirus.
This year, however, due to the new coronavirus, the festival was cancelled and only a Shinto ritual will be held on the 26th.
The community association has organized the festival, which has included a parade of floats with Officer Masuda on a white horse and fireworks.
Nearly 200 people attend the festival every year, including bereaved families living in Kumamoto Prefecture, police officials, and local residents.
Mr. Yoshinori Takeda, 72, chairman of the community association, said, "This festival has been held in the community every year and it is very popular. It's a shame that the festival has to be cancelled," he said.
This year, the prefectural police also canceled a memorial service for police academy students.
On March 21, Chief Superintendent Yumiko Sugiuchi, Karatsu Police Chief Hiroto Fukushima, and others visited Komatsu Island off Takagushi Port, where the deceased was cremated, and offered flowers at the monument.
Chief Sugiuchi said, "The spirit of bravery and dedication is the origin of the police. I would like to pass it on as the way it should be.
Officer Masuda, who was born in Kumamoto Prefecture, was transferred to Takagushi in July 1895.
He worked tirelessly, including disinfecting patients' homes, and was later infected with cholera himself.
"He died at the age of 25, just four days after his arrival, saying, "I will carry all the cholera in Takagushi on my shoulders.

Dodgers Betts signed for 12 years for 39.1 billion yen!
Second largest in history, behind only Angels Trout!
Los Angeles Dodgers outfielder Mookie Betts has signed a new contract.
He was traded from the Boston Red Sox in the off-season.
Before his first year at his new home, he has signed a contract through 2032.
I'm not sure what to make of it.
I'm not sure what to make of it.
I'm not a baseball player, but I can do this!
Betts made his major league debut at the age of 21 in 2014.
He has contributed to the Boston Red Sox as the centerpiece of their powerful batting lineup and as a strong-shouldered right fielder.
From 2015 to last season, he has been the pinnacle of mid-range hitters, recording more than 40 doubles every year.
In 2018, when he became the world's best, he was the leading hitter and MVP with a .346 batting average.
Last year, Betts turned down a 10-year, $300 million offer from the Red Sox, according to CBS Sports.
In the offseason, he and left-handed ace pitcher David Price were traded to the Dodgers in exchange for money and multiple players.
The contract for this season is for one year and $27 million.
The new deal reportedly is for 12 years, starting in the 2021 season and ending in 2032, for a total of $365 million (about $39.1 billion).
The biggest contract in MLB today is Los Angeles Angels outfielder Mike Trout's 12-year, $426 million deal, which is worth about $45.6 billion.
Betts' contract is the second largest after Trout's.
As for Betts, who will become a free agent (FA) this offseason, a battle was inevitable once he hit the market.
This is in keeping with the recent trend of signing long-term, high-priced contracts before becoming a free agent.
In the turbulent MLB, Betts has found long-term stability.
A Health Hot Seminar to Explain Diseases of the Eye Related to Daily Life by Dr. Kinoshita, Chief of Ophthalmology, Hiramatsu Hospital
Dr. Akio Kinoshita, chief of ophthalmology at Hiramatsu Hospital, explains about dry eyes and other eye diseases.
Dr. Akio Kinoshita, head of the ophthalmology department at Hiramatsu Hospital, explains about dry eyes and other problems in a "relieving seminar" at Yonezawa's main store in Saga City.
On the 25th, the "Health Relief Seminar" (sponsored by the Saga Shimbun and co-sponsored by Yonezawa Eyeglasses) was held at Yonezawa Eyeglasses' main store in Shimoda-machi, Saga City, where experts gave advice on various health-related issues.
Dr. Akio Kinoshita, head of the Department of Ophthalmology at Hiramatsu Hospital (Ogi City), explained about eye diseases that are deeply related to our daily lives, such as dry eyes and cataracts.
Mr. Kinoshita explained that dry eye is called a "tear disease" and that it is a disease in which the quality of tears collapses and tears are not distributed evenly over the surface of the eye.
Ms. Kinoshita said that contact lens users are about four times more likely to suffer from this disease, and urged people to be careful not to use contact lenses for long periods of time or to sleep with them on.
She also suggested measures such as placing the computer screen below eye level and humidifying the air-conditioned room.
She also introduced ingredients and foods that are effective against dry eyes.
"The omega-3 contained in blue fish prevents the evaporation of tears, and the mucin contained in natto and okra improves the quality of tears.
As for cataract surgery, the seminar touched on the differences between monofocal and multifocal intraocular lenses, which are inserted in place of the lens.
The seminar was attended by about 40 people.
As a precautionary measure against infection by the new coronavirus, the seminar was divided into two sessions, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, and held in small groups.
I'm not sure what to make of it, but I think it's a good idea.

G Osaka coach Tsuneyasu Miyamoto: "His scoring ability is outstanding" (Sports Hochi) - Yahoo! News
G-Osaka manager Tsuneyasu Miyamoto (43) was interviewed on the 25th, before the game against Kobe (Noesta, 26th), which will be the fourth consecutive win for G-Osaka, and he revealed his expectations for Shouji Karayama (17), a third-year high school student who made the first team last week.
Karayama, who was promoted to the top flight after skipping a grade this season, was put on the bench for the match against Hiroshima on March 22.
He didn't give him an opportunity to play, but said of the striker, who has scored three goals in five J3 matches so far this season, "He is outstanding in terms of scoring goals, and although he is 17, I want him to work harder and harder. He is 17 years old, but I want him to work even harder. I've seen players go overseas at a young age, but I want him to play with a high level of awareness and ambition.
Karayama scored 8 goals in 10 games in the J3 last season, when he was a specially designated player.
He is slender at 178 centimeters and 65 kilograms, but he has scored 11 goals in 15 games in the J3 with his instantaneous movement to get behind the defenders and his calmness before shooting in front of a crowded opponent's goal.
Karayama was given a chance against Hiroshima when FW Ademilson and MF Onose came off the bench due to injury, but he did not get the chance.
Ademilson and Onose are not at 100%, but they are both very motivated and ready to go," Miyamoto said.
If Ademilson and Onose are kept out, Karayama could be on the bench again.
At G-Osaka, midfielder Doan (now with PSV) and FW Usami made their J1 debuts at the age of 16 years and 11 months and 17 years and 0 months, respectively, and moved overseas as teenagers.
Karayama, now 17 years and 10 months old, is expected to follow in their footsteps and make his J1 debut.
Ferrari stolen 26 years ago found at the bottom of a river│Not restored, but turned into a work of art (octane.jp) - Yahoo! News
In 1994, a Ferrari Mondial was stolen in the Netherlands.
The police were unable to solve the case, but 26 years later, the Mondial was miraculously found.
The Ferrari found at the bottom of the river (4 photos) The trigger for the discovery was a diving training session at the fire department.
On July 8, a diver during the training found something wedge-shaped sinking to the bottom of the river, and the police and even the Dutch army were dispatched to pull it out, which turned out to be a Ferrari Mondial.
By checking the VIN number against a database of stolen cars, they were able to link this Ferrari to the 1994 incident.
The car was handed over to its legal owner, an insurance company, and then sent to a scrapper.
Lowie van DE Ooyevaar, the scrapper, said, "There are still some parts left, but they are for art like decorating. We have already received many requests from people who want to make tables out of mondials that have been torn apart. We will use engine blocks and glass plates," he said.
For the time being, there are no concrete plans to sell them, and they will be kept by scrap dealers as objects of art.
Seibu's Tonosaki hits his first grand slam
It's the first time I've ever done that.
(Sankei Sports) - Yahoo! News
(Pacific League, Seibu 3x-2 Lotte, 9th inning, Seibu 6-3, 24th, MetLife) I'll take it!
I'm not sure what to make of it, but I think it's a good idea.
He made the most of an opportunity created by Genda's head sliding and Mori's sacrifice hit.
The team won the game as a team, and made a saving of two.
The voltage of the Leo fans at the MetLife Dome reached its peak.
Tonosaki hit a sac fly for the first time in his six years as a professional.
The crowd of 4,825 people was excited.
"I went into the batter's box with the intention of doing something about it, because Gen (Genda) and Tomoya (Mori) had connected with me.
In the ninth inning, the score was 2-2.
With the score 2-2 in the ninth inning, the first batter, Genda, attempted a safety bunt and made a spirited head-slide to first base.
After an infield single, Mori, last season's top hitter, sacrificed him to first base for the second time in his professional career.
Yamakawa, the fourth baseman, was given a walk.
The senior from Fuji University was walked, and Tonosaki's insides were on fire.
"I was thinking, 'Damn. I was thinking, 'Damn,' but Yamakawa-san told me to be aggressive before I went to first base, and that really got me going.
I got stuck on a high inside pitch from the first pitch, but the ball landed in front of me in left field.
I don't remember ever hitting a good-bye ball in my amateur career.
The 27-year-old, who was inspired by his alma mater, Hirosaki Jitsu High School in Aomori Prefecture, which made it to the top four of the summer prefectural tournament for the first time in 20 years, took a shower of joy and smiled, saying, "As expected, it felt good.
"He was called "the guy who doesn't have it.
He was selected for the Samurai Japan team as a versatile player who can defend the infield and outfield, and contributed to the world's No. 1 team in the Premier 12 tournament last November.
However, he had never hit a grand slam in his career with Seibu, and was teased by manager Tsuji and manager Baba as "the guy who doesn't have it.
He bounced back from his negative reputation to win his second game of the season.
Manager Tsuji praised him, saying, "I asked the goddess of victory to take care of me just for today. You did a great job.
We are in third place, one game behind the leader SoftBank, with two games in hand.
With only one home run this season and a batting average of 252, Tonosaki said, "I still need to hit more. We'll work together as a team to win the next one.
We'll use the game-winning hit as a catalyst to get back on track.

Minoru Pig Farming Acquires JGAP Certification (Daily Tohoku Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
Minoru Minoru Pig Farm (Representative: Minoru Nakanowatari), which raises about 50,000 pigs a year at farms in Towada City and Rokunohe Town, visited Mayor Hisashi Oyamada at Towada City Hall on April 20 to report that its farms had acquired JGAP (livestock and livestock products) certification, which indicates the safety of agricultural and livestock products.
This is the second pig farming business in the prefecture to receive this certification.
The company is involved in the production of "Garlic Pork," which uses garlic powder produced in the prefecture as a special feed, and "Jyoton," which uses rice produced in the prefecture.
Of the five farms, the fifth farm (located in Rokunohe Town), which raises about 10,000 pigs and produces "Jiyou pork," acquired JGAP certification this time.
The company decided to acquire the certification because it felt that it needed to be certified in order to be selected by major buyers, and also because it learned that the certification was a condition for procuring foodstuffs for the Tokyo Olympics athletes' village.
From August last year, with the support of Aomori Bank, they made preparations together with the bank's employees who are certified as JGAP instructors.
On March 3 of this year, they underwent an audit by a certification body and cleared a total of 113 criteria, including food safety.
The certification was granted on March 13.
The visit was attended by Mr. Minoru Wataru Nakano, president of the company, Mr. Wataru Nakano, managing director, Mr. Takeo Yamada, manager of the Towada Minami branch of Aomori Bank, and Mr. Nobuhiro Ishigo, business advisor of the bank's Corporate Support Department.
Mayor Oyamada said, "It's very wonderful. I hope you will promote JGAP certification to expand sales channels.
Mr. Minoru Nakanowatari, president of the company, expressed his enthusiasm, saying, "I would like to contribute to Towada City by continuing to make efforts to brand pigs.
Mr. Dai Nakanowatari, executive director of the company, expressed his future goals, saying, "We will aim to obtain certification for the remaining four farms as well.

Torrential rains damage "traffic" in Hokuto: Route 152 closed for 10 kilometers, JR Iida Line partially inoperable
A line of cars waits for a detour on National Route 152, which was closed to all traffic, in the afternoon of April 22.
The Tenryu area of Hamamatsu City was severely damaged by the torrential rains in July, which caused tremendous damage in Kyushu and other parts of Japan, even in Shizuoka Prefecture.
National Route 152, the main road, and the JR Iida Line, which is the "mainstay of daily life," were still affected by the landslide, and there are many areas that will require time for restoration.
In addition to the inconvenience of daily life, residents are becoming increasingly worried about the negative impact on their economic activities.
At the Sejiri Bridge over the Tenryu River in the district's Ryuzan Town, a long line of cars waits for traffic during the day.
The first car remained stationary for nearly 40 minutes.
National Route 152 was closed for about 10 kilometers, and traffic had to be diverted to the other side of the Tenryu River to get around the town.
However, the road is narrow and all sections are alternating one-way traffic, so the waiting time is unpredictable.
In this town, a landslide occurred on the national highway on the 9th, and the road was closed due to the danger of falling rocks on the nearby slopes.
On the 13th, cracks were found in the Akiba Tunnel within the restricted section, and there is still no indication of when traffic will reopen.
In 2018, a national highway in the town was also closed due to a soil collapse, affecting the lives of residents and tourism.
Kimie Tamamoto, 76, a representative of the Dragon Mama Processing Plant, which sells local products, said, "The new coronavirus has put a damper on the number of customers. The number of visitors has dropped sharply," she said in a low voice.
The JR Iida Line was closed between Mizukubo Station (Mizukubo-cho, Mizukubo Ward) and Hiraoka Station (Nagano Prefecture) due to the collapse of a slope beside the tracks.
Shiori Ukai, 16, who was attending Hamamatsu Kohoku High School Sakuma Branch School in Sakuma-cho, Hamamatsu City, had to be picked up and dropped off by car about an hour each way from Oarashi Station, which is located in the same ward.
"She hopes for a quick recovery, saying, "It's too much work for both me and my parents to drive.
According to JR Tokai, it is expected to take about three months to reopen the train service, and from March 27, an extra train will run between Mizukubo and Oarashi stations, one in the morning and one in the evening on weekdays.
In the town of Mizukubo, landslides have occurred frequently on forest roads that are also used for daily life.
In some cases, it takes several hours to get around them.
Keiji Kumagai, 69, the head of the Mizukubo Forest Cooperative, said, "The removal of logs from the forest has been delayed. There are isolated islands of land everywhere. We are also worried about future rains,' he said, clouding his expression.
Shoya Nakajima's absence from the championship ceremony was his own choice?

Japan midfielder Shoya Nakajima seems to be on his way out of Porto.
This is the first time that we have seen a player from a team in the Portuguese League.

Ring of light, horizontal rainbow co-starring Yamagata observes vertigo and circular horizontal arc
A horizontal rainbow-colored horizontal arc appeared at the same time beneath the vertigo surrounding the sun.
A ring of light surrounding the sun and a horizontal rainbow-colored arc appeared simultaneously in Yamagata City just before 9:00 a.m. on the 24th.
According to the Yamagata District Meteorological Observatory, both the vertigo and the ring-horizon arc are phenomena that occur when sunlight hits fine ice crystals in clouds and is refracted or reflected.
While ordinary rainbows appear in the opposite direction of the sun, the ring-horizon arc is characterized by its appearance in the same direction as the sun.
While vertigo is a relatively common phenomenon, the ring-shaped horizontal arc appears less frequently than vertigo.
The vertigo was also seen in Takahata Town that day.
Chieko Takeda, 75, a housewife in Fukuzawa, checked the rainbow at home around 11 a.m. when her daughter told her that a strange rainbow was appearing.
She said she saw it for about 20 minutes and said, "I've never seen one before. I was worried that it might be a sign of something bad, but I'm glad to have seen something so rare," she said with a smile.

45% of families where the wife holds the purse!
Are our husbands like that happy? Are you happy or unhappy?
When my husband says, "I don't have enough money for this month's allowance... I'm sure there are some wives who are upset or annoyed when their husbands say, "I don't have enough money this month.
In a family where this conversation takes place, the wife is the one who holds the wallet.
How many families do you know where the wife holds the purse?
Let's also take a look at the percentage of households where the wives have separate wallets and where the wallets are managed jointly.

In the case of Ako, the wife manages the household budget. Ako is a mother with two daughters, one in the third year of high school and the other in the first year of high school.
Ms. A is in charge of the entire household budget.
As the cost of cramming for college entrance exams became too much and the month of deficit increased, she tried to negotiate with her husband to lower her allowance, but as expected, he resisted.
At that time, he asked me to show him what kind of income and expenditure I had, so I showed him my family account book.
I thought I had listed all our expenses, but when I looked at the account book, I could see that we were not making enough money to be in the red.
Her husband almost gave up on her, saying, "You've got enough," but she couldn't help but say, "Okay, I'm not good enough to manage the household budget, so please manage everything yourself.
Later, when Ms. A interviewed her husband, he said, "I'm not happy about being in charge of things like allowance, but I really don't have the time or energy to manage the various things that go in and out of the household budget (for example, school materials, PTA fees, etc.).

However, when summer came, he wanted to have an environment where he could eat ice cream anytime he wanted, and his palm flipped over and said, "Let's buy a refrigerator after all.
I'm sure you'll be pleased to know that I'm not the only one who's a bit stingy.
This is the first time I've ever seen a player in the top flight of a team.
Japan national team midfielder Takehide Kubo (19), who played for Mallorca in the Spanish first division this season, seems to be gradually narrowing down his transfer targets.
Although Mallorca has been relegated to the second division, Kubo's reputation has skyrocketed due to his success at the end of the season.
However, he will not be able to return to Real Madrid, the club that holds the "right" to him due to the non-EU quota, and will play for another club next season.
He has already received offers from about 30 clubs, but R Madrid is planning to let him train with a domestic club.
Spanish newspaper Marca reported that Real Sociedad, Villarreal, Granada, Getafe, and Betis are the most likely destinations for Kubo, and that "five clubs are interested in him, but R Madrid wants a club in the middle of the league or higher.

On the evening of July 24, less than a year before the opening of the Tokyo Olympics, which had to be postponed due to the spread of the new coronavirus, the Junior Chamber of Japan (JC) held a nationwide fireworks event to brighten up society as much as possible.
Unfortunately, the weather in Fukui Prefecture was rainy, but the fireworks were launched as scheduled at nine locations, adding color to the summer night sky.
The event was organized by the Japan Council of Commerce and Industry (JC), which called on its block councils across the country, hoping that it would be a signal for Japan to overcome the sense of stagnation caused by the spread of infection and be reborn anew.
The event started at 8:00 p.m. at 117 locations in 46 prefectures.
At the Ichinodani Asakura Clan Ruins in Fukui City, a total of 53 fireworks (No. 2 to No. 4) were launched for about two minutes while the surrounding mountains were covered with mist.
The light from the fireworks made the Karamon gate and other structures stand out in the darkness, creating a fantastic atmosphere.
The event was also held in Tsuruga City's Matsubara Beach and along the Mana River in Ono City.
In order to prevent infection, the launch sites were not announced in advance in order to avoid attracting too many spectators.
