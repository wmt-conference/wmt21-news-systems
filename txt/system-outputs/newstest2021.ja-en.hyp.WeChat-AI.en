Honoka becomes [Tanaka Minami style hair]!
Report on the full cut (CanCam.jp) - Yahoo! News
Add a layer to the heavy semi-long [Minami style] for fluffy hair
CanCam model Honoka took on the challenge of creating a hairstyle with movement like Tanaka Minami, who she admires, saying, "Of course it's beautiful, but it's also very professional and I respect it!"
I asked Asahi Mitsuteru of the hair salon "SUNVALLY" in Omotesando, who is actually working on Tanaka Minami's haircut, to make it "Minami style hair."
Report on the cutting process!
Nogizaka 46 Yamashita Mizuki, first cover with short hair!
First, check out the faint hair before cutting.
Thin, soft and plentiful.
I have a habit, especially during the rainy season, so I sometimes apply a straight perm.
It is a heavy semi-long with flowing bangs.
The cut finally starts!
To make it easier to cut, first lightly wet the whole.
After that, the top of the bee (the part above the area where the head protrudes the most) is separated and cut from the bottom.
By the way, here are the key points of hair that brings you closer to the real thing!
1 Tablebang By shortening the inside of the bangs a little, you can enjoy changes depending on the styling, such as slightly thicker when fully lowered, and see-through when lightly divided.
2 Cut the hair to make the most of your hairline If you have a lot of hair and you want to reduce the volume of your hair, it may spread too much.
While discussing the balance around that, it is easy to handle and difficult to spread, and keeps a balance that makes your own swell live.
3 The layer around the face and the hair layer = cut with steps.
Adding layers around the face makes it easier to move, creating a cute finish.
If you make your hair in three places, the front and back of the temple and sideburns, it will look stylish even when you put it together quickly.
Cut the hair above the bees that you have divided into sections, and place them around the face.
Pull the hair bundle on the upper part around the face forward and cut the tip of the hair.
This way, when the hair bundle is lowered, there will be steps, making it easier to move (this is layer cutting).

Governor Yoshimura to "partner with Gurunavi" against Corona (Sankei Sports) - Yahoo! News
Governor Yoshimura Hirofumi (45) of Osaka Prefecture made a remote appearance from the prefectural office on Osaka ABC TV's "Cast" (Monday to Friday, March 48) on the 20th, revealing that they are considering partnering with restaurant information website Gurunavi as part of measures to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus.
From the beginning of this month, Osaka Prefecture will issue "infection prevention declaration stickers" to businesses that comply with the guidelines in order to promote efforts to prevent the spread of infection and provide peace of mind to citizens.
However, only 11,000 stores have issued stickers in the prefecture, which is said to have more than 120,000 restaurants alone.
Governor Yoshimura said, "We are planning to do it at the end of the month, but we will form a partnership with something like Gurunavi, and we will set up a store that issues declaration stickers when making a reservation so that you can understand them at the reservation stage," and declared a partnership with an internet reservation site.
He said, "The important thing is not to lump it together with 'night town.' We should clearly separate the restaurants that are taking measures against infectious diseases from those that are not. It is also important to make efforts to increase the number of restaurants that are doing it."

On display is a notebook in which Kenji Miyazawa (1896-1933), a poet and writer of children's stories, wrote that he and the residents of Toyosawa-cho, where he grew up, sent donations to the areas affected by the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923 (Taisho 12).
It is a valuable document that shows the connection between Kenji and Toyosawa-cho, and introduces the culture and history of the town.

On September 15th, it was written, "Tokyo City Earthquake Relief Donation (Local Soldiers)," and along with the symbols "o" and "X" the names of Kenji and the residents of Toyosawa-cho at the time and the amount of the donation were written.
Taneichi, in his fourth year of high school graduation from Lotte, has his first professional shutout!
No. 4 Yasuda V hit, Toritani no good push 2 points (Baseball King) - Yahoo! News
● Seibu 0 - 5 Lotte ○ ＜10th inning, MetLife Dome＞ For Lotte, starter Atsuki Taneichi threw 136 pitches in the 9th inning by himself, his first professional complete game in his 4th year.
He won his third victory in this season's Pacific League shutout, stopping the team's losing streak with 2.
In the first inning, Taneichi allowed Suzuki Shohei, the leader, to hit a double to break the third base line, but immediately after that, he hit Genda Sosuke with a triple, and Suzuki Masaru, who was aiming to advance, also touched out at third base.
Helped by the calm response of the defense on his side, he was able to get through the pinch of standing up with zero, and after the second inning, he tossed the Seibu batting line with a combination of sliders and forks, centering on his proud straight.
He got better and lined up zeros on the scoreboard.
The batting line was struggling to hit the opponent's starter, Honda Keisuke, but Kanno Takeshi, the third batter at the top of the seventh inning, came out with a walk, and Oka Daikai, the substitute, succeeded in stealing two.
Yasuda Naonori, the 4th batter, took this chance and hit the right front with a value of 1,000 gold, finally breaking the balance.
Then, in the next 8 innings, he attacked the opponent's 3rd position, Miyagawa Tetsu, and scored 4 points at once, including 2 runs between left and middle, which was the first time since the transfer of Toritani Kei, who was on the way.
He folded as if to push the young ace candidate of the Marines and decided the game at once.
Taneichi finished with three outs in the eighth inning, and continued with nine innings with over 100 pitches.
"I was so strong," he said, causing a pinch of two dead bases with consecutive walks, but in the end, he struck out the 10th strikeout of the day with a high straight from Spangenberg and set the game.
He smiled with joy.
Bye bye to accident with new operation Tsuruoka police station and related organizations to raise safety awareness | Yamagata Shimbun
At a bicycle class held as the start event of the operation, a collision experiment between a car and a bicycle was conducted = Shoko Gakuen Driving School in Tsuruoka City
In recent years, the Tsuruoka Police Station (Chief Sato Keizo) has launched the "Bye Bye Accident Zero Operation" in an attempt to eliminate accidents involving bicycles and motorcycles, which have a high rate of occurrence in the area.
In addition to working with traffic safety organizations in the area to raise awareness of accident prevention, they will also strengthen the crackdown on bicycle traffic rule violations.
There have been three traffic fatalities in the jurisdiction of the station this year, with motorcyclists and cyclists killed.
Although the number of accidents has been on a decreasing trend, the rate of accidents involving bicycles was about 11.7% as of June 30, and that involving motorcycles was about 5.8%, both higher than the prefectural average.
In particular, the rate of bicycle accidents in the past five years has often exceeded the prefectural average, and we planned a strategy to overcome this situation.
The name of the operation is "bike" and "bicycle" multiplied by the meaning of eradicating accidents.
Related organizations will be encouraged more than ever to provide driving guidance to the elderly and use night light reflective materials in traffic safety classes.
The station issues yellow cards (guidance warning tickets) in the event of a crackdown to warn people.
The opening ceremony of the operation was held on the 21st at Shoko Gakuen Driving School in Tsuruoka City.
About 30 people involved attended, and Chief Sato said, "I would like to ask for your cooperation to reduce even one tragic accident."
A representative from the station showed the policy and the activities of each organization.
A bicycle class was held as the start of the operation.
A police officer in a car demonstrated how the impact on a bicycle differs between hitting a bicycle with the brakes applied and hitting it at about 55 km / h without stepping on the brakes.
Kaneuchi Hiroshi, chairman of the Tsuruoka Regional Traffic Safety Activities Promotion Committee, said, "I realized once again the horror of traffic accidents, and I would like to call attention not only to the elderly but also to young people."

On the 25th, a regular yose was held for the first time in five months at the public yose "Owarai Akasakatei" (Sobun, Akaiwa), which had been closed due to the new coronavirus.
Rakugo storyteller Kaminarimon Kisuke (75), who is based at Akasakatei, and others drew laughter from visitors with their professional storytelling.
At the request of a vassal who had been told by the lord to abstain from alcohol, Kisuke performed "Prohibition Banya," in which a liquor store trying to bring in sake has a comical exchange with the gatekeeper.
The crisp way he spoke and the way he drank with relish made me laugh many times.
A company employee (58) from Naka-ku, Okayama, who visited with his wife, said with a smile, "The way they spoke and the way they interacted was exquisite, and I was immediately drawn in."
Kisuke said, "It was my first performance in a while and my voice was not in good condition, but it was a fulfilling time."
Guest rakugo storyteller Katsura Kotome (31) from Osaka City and the magic group Tsuyama Magic Club also appeared.
Comedy Akasakatei opened in 1996 in the former Akasaka-cho as the first public yose in Japan.
They continued to hold regular yose and delivery yose once a month, but due to the new Corona, they cancelled the yose after their last performance in February this year.

He struck out seven and contributed to a cold win five times with three zero shutouts.
"Overall, I was floating. It was good that I was able to get a blank swing on the straight, but I want to correct the fact that I was able to identify a low change ball." Nakamori's self-evaluation was tough, but he marked the fastest 148km on the day, and the eyes of the Hanshin, Giants and ORIX professionals behind the net were highly evaluated.
Hanshin and Wada TA visited Nama for the first time since the first game at Koshien last summer (second round, 4-3 Hanasaki Tokuei).

It is truly amazing that we have been able to finish despite the corona disaster. "

Butler once again praises Tyler Hero, the young warrior who will be the future of the Heat "The way of thinking is not that of a rookie" (Basketball Count) - Yahoo! News
Photo by Getty Images The Heat's first game of scrimmage (practice game) was against the Kings.
Duncan Robinson scored a team-high 18 points in the 104-98 win, followed by Tyler Hero with 15 points.
Robinson, one of the best shooters in the league, as well as rookie and hero, the 13th overall pick in the draft, will be an important factor for the Heat.
Hero missed 15 games from February to March due to an ankle injury, and the season went into a long hiatus after his return game against the Hornets on March 12.
Hero said, "I had plenty of time, so I was able to get back to 100% condition, which is the best feeling I've ever felt," but his performance at scrimmage was more convincing than words.
Due to the late arrival of starting point guard Kendrick Nunn, the hero's playing time increased, and he took advantage of that opportunity.
The value is great because he scored 15 points after playing a different role.
Team leader Jimmy Butler once again praised the "favorite" hero.
"He can be a handler, he can score, he can defend. He can do everything for the team. He can play in any position because his mindset is not that of a rookie. He watches videos and studies, and he's trying to figure out where his teammates move, how they get free, and what he should do about it."
Even before the start of this season, Butler has liked the hero's unyielding rookie spirit and stoic approach to basketball.
That's why I invited him to private practice starting at 4am and trained with him.
Butler once said, "He gives his opinion to everyone and doesn't back down, and I respect his fighting spirit."
The butler is the type who always says what he thinks, and if he thinks it will benefit the team, he will give harsh opinions knowing that conflicts will occur.
In the past, his relationship with his teammates deteriorated.
Butler must be comparing his youth to his hero.
Butler's personality, which is sometimes too harsh for his teammates, is a good guide for those who have the guts to follow him.
If the relationship between the two teachers and students, who respect each other, spreads throughout the team, the Heat should be able to become a team that can aim even higher.
Shimada takes the initiative in the first round of the 2020 summer Shizuoka Prefecture high school baseball tournament 4th round Shimada Sho - Hamamatsu Johoku Ko | Shizuoka Shimbun @S
Shimada Sho - Hamamatsu Johokko 1st inning, Shimada Sho deadless, Matsuura hits first at Kusanagi Stadium
The fourth round (Kusanagi first game) Hamamatsu Johokko 000000 - 041000 × - 5 Shimada Shoko game time 1 hour 26 minutes
[Review] Shimada Sho took advantage of the early opportunity and won a shutout against Hamamatsu Johokko.
Shimada Sho took the lead with Matsuura's two-run timely hit on the first no-hitter.
He added two more points with infield goro and squeeze.
Starting pitcher Saito pitched well with only one hit in the sixth inning and no runs.
Hamamatsu Johokko could not take advantage of the opportunity to finish second in the final round.
■ The fourth round led by three years
In the second year, Matsuura took the lead in gratitude
It was the 4th place in the second year, which was his first appearance this summer, that broke his opponent's appearance.
Matsuura of Shimada Sho hit a change ball at the first deadless full base and carried it to the left front.
"If I lost for three years, I would retire immediately. I wanted to hit and win."
The talented player who played the 4th position last fall was proud.
In the first three rounds, they fought mainly for three years, and in the two years when they had power, they were on the sidelines.
Ikeda gathered the players at a meeting and told Nine, "It's been three years since I've been here. From now on, I'll go with the best members."
On this day, four of the nine starters solidified their main axis in two years.
It may seem cruel, but it is proof that they are committed to serious competition.
Matsuura is reassuring, saying, "From now on, the level of the opposing pitcher will also increase, and I will approach it with the intention of returning the runner."
Saito, who pitched in consecutive innings, pitched well with only one hit in the sixth inning and did not even step on second base, showing his pride for three years.
The number 10 shirt was received favorably as a synergistic effect, saying, "Two years will inspire me for three years. I hope it will lead to victory."
The team, which is aiming to finish in the top four for the third consecutive year, including the Shizuoka tournament until last year, has no intention of making memories in the remaining games.
Singing with the people of Fukushima 16 musicians with connections to Fukushima Prefecture gather in the world (Fukushima Minpo) - Yahoo! News
I want to deliver the energetic voices of Hama, Naka and Aizu to the world.
Sixteen musicians associated with Fukushima Prefecture gathered to create a message song.
The lyrics depict Fukushima Prefecture's dedication to fighting the new coronavirus as it moves toward recovery from the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident.
The "complete version" will be completed by next summer, which marks the 10th anniversary of the earthquake, with the voices of the citizens of the prefecture.
On the 24th, the song was released on YouTube.
The title of the song is "Pray from Fukushima."
The bright and energetic melody expresses people's positive attitude and their desire to "convey from Fukushima."
Due to the impact of the new Corona, live music venues that serve as bases for musical activities have been forced to close, and many musicians have lost the opportunity to sing and perform.
In order to believe in the power of music when the future is uncertain, the event was organized by singer / songwriter Nappo (46), who lives in Minamisoma, and Dazu O (37), a member of the music group Mexicali Boys in Iwaki.
Nappo will write the lyrics and music, and Dazuo will rap.
When the project started in March of the Corona disaster, singer-songwriter Manami (28) and Kanno Jun (38) from Fukushima City agreed one after another, and the circle quickly expanded.
Nappo says, "We have a gorgeous lineup that would be unthinkable in normal times, and I want to fully enjoy this opportunity."
As a countermeasure against infection, there was no opportunity for 16 people to gather, and each recorded at a live venue or at home.
To support the project, Iwaki City painter Koa drew the image character.
In the shape of Fukushima Prefecture, the blue and green colors express a climate rich in nature.
The completed songs will be broadcast to the world via YouTube, with the aim of making them into CDs.
Next year marks the 10th anniversary of the earthquake, and the postponed Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics are also scheduled.
Dazuo said, "We have a lot to carry as we have overcome difficulties, and I hope that releasing a song at a milestone will encourage many people."
Other participating musicians are as follows.

Instant detection of crisis occurrence from internet information and determination of hoaxes (JBpress) - Yahoo! News
"I want to know as soon as possible where and what kind of disasters and accidents occurred!"
This is not limited to news organizations such as television and newspapers, but many companies such as social infrastructure companies and local governments also have strong needs.
A service that responds to this is Spectee, developed by Spectee, a company that analyzes information using AI.

Today, the first way for people to learn about disasters and accidents is shifting from television to online information (social media).
Social media such as Twitter has become an important medium for disseminating information immediately after a disaster or accident occurs.
However, it is difficult to constantly monitor the overflowing information and extract useful information from it manually.
Spectrum detects information about natural disasters and accidents from social media such as Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, analyzes the content, determines the authenticity of the information, and distributes it to users.
It is a crisis management support service that visualizes various crises occurring in Japan and overseas, "positioning a wide range of events that have a negative impact, such as stopping or stagnating social activities, as" crises "(CEO Murakami Kenjiro).
NHK at the time of the Kumamoto earthquake in April 2016 was the first major use case of Specty, and since then, recruitment has spread rapidly among companies.
In addition to news organizations such as TV stations and newspapers, more than 350 companies in Japan, including companies that support social infrastructure such as electricity, gas and transportation, and local governments across the country, are currently using Specty.
■ Analyze posts to determine the type and location of the "crisis"
Spectrum distributes information in four steps: "Information collection," "analysis and content classification," "titling," and "authenticity determination."
Companies that use the service must specify in advance the areas where information will be collected (prefectures, municipalities, etc.) and the categories of crises (disasters, accidents, etc.).
Spectrum collects posts that fall under that designation using APIs provided by social media.
They then analyze and classify the text, images and videos contained in the collected posts.
For example, if there is a video showing a fire engine, black smoke rising from the building, and orange flames coming from the room, it is classified as a "fire."
In addition, images of overturned cars are classified as "traffic accidents," and images of roads covered with water are classified as "road flooding."
Spectrum also estimates the location of disasters and accidents.
"We often don't know the location from posts, so we make estimates by combining various information," says Murakami.
For example, if a road sign or sign is reflected in an image or video, information on place names is extracted from it, and the location is identified by comparing it with a place name database.
The Angels lost the opening game by saying goodbye... Otani struck out three balls at full base in the first and ninth innings (Baseball King) - Yahoo! News
○ Athletics 7x-3 Angels ● < July 24th local time Oakland Coliseum > Angels player Otani Shohei (26) started the opening game against the Athletics on the 24th (25th Japan time) as the "3rd designated hitter."
In the first inning, he hit his first hit of the season in the middle, but in the next four at-bats, he was out of action, with one hit and one strikeout in five at-bats.
Otani played against Montana again at first base with one death in the third inning.
In the third at-bat of the fifth inning, which was 1-1, he faced second right hand Pettit at first base with one death, and he also fell to Yugoro.
In the fourth at-bat of the eighth inning, with a 2-1 lead, he faced Diekman, the fifth left arm, as the first batter.
He hit the straight of the second ball in the opposite direction at a good angle, but it did not go over the fence and he fell to the left.
In the bottom of the eighth inning, when the Angels had a one-point lead, relief right fielder Batley lost two points and allowed a comeback, but in the top of the ninth inning, the new catcher, No. 7 Castro, took the team's first solo shot this season to the right.
They tied 3-3 at the last minute.
After that, he had two outs, one at second base, and his batting order was second trout.
The Athletics bench shunned Trout and chose the Otani game with two dead bases.
Otani was expected to win, but struck out three balls in front of Hendrix, the guardian of the Athletics.
The game was not settled in the ninth inning, and the game went into extra time, starting with a deadless second base, an exception this season.
Otani was the last batter in the ninth inning, so he became a second baseman.
In the top of the 10th inning, the Angels' first baseman, Walsh, hit a scathing first base, but Olson, who caught the ball well, sent it to third base.
Otani, caught between second and third base, was touchout.
After that, the Angels had two outs, but in the end, Simmons, the 8th, fell to a double.
On the other hand, the Angels were in a pinch at second and third base after Robles, who continued to play throughout the inning, hit a dead ball and threw a wild pitch.
At this point, new manager Maddon shifted the infield to five players, but Robles walked the 4th Davis with a walk to full base.
Milner, who replaced him with his left arm, was carried to the right seat with a grand slam to say goodbye to No. 5 Olson, and the game was decided.
Isolated again... 56 people from 33 households in Takagi village will be swept away by a temporary bridge due to rising water The fear of heavy rain in the southern part of the prefecture on the 26th (NBS Nagano Broadcasting) - Yahoo! News
In Nagano Prefecture, there is a risk of heavy rain mainly in the southern part until the 26th, and the central and southern parts need to be on alert for landslides.
In Takagi Village, the prefectural road that is closed to traffic has been washed away, and residents are isolated again.
Sandbags and temporary bridges are swallowed by the swollen river and washed away.
Just after 3: 00 a.m., a surveillance camera set up by the prefectural Iida Construction Office in Takagi Village captured the footage.
Instead of the prefectural road that was closed due to a landslide, this road was built on the riverbed, and from the 17th, only residents' cars could pass.
As a result, 56 people from 33 households in the Oshima area have been isolated again, and the Iida Construction Office hopes to begin restoration work as soon as the water recedes.
Warm and moist air will flow towards the rainy season front, and heavy rain of more than 30mm per hour is expected to fall in some parts of the prefecture until the 26th.
The expected amount of rainfall for the 24 hours until 6: 00 p.m. on the 26th is 80 mm in the central part and 120 mm in the southern part, and it is necessary to be alert for landslides in the central and southern parts until late at night on the 26th.
The Meteorological Observatory has issued a heavy rain warning for the Saku, Suwa and Kiso areas.
"Cheating crowded" and "Uchinchi" don't get through... ...?
"Words I really thought were not dialects" (Netorabo) - Yahoo! News
I am a citizen of Chiba Prefecture near Tokyo.
I have lived in the prefecture for less than 30 years since I was born.
When I used the word "cheating," which means "sideways," in a conversation with a friend at university (Tokyo), it was instantly pronounced "cheating."
They understood the meaning through the flow and the sense of the word, but Tokyo residents and Saitama residents told me not to use it.
It's true, "Is it cheating and cheating?"
Since it seems to be connected, the meaning can be guessed somehow.
And one more thing.
I didn't notice this when it was pointed out, but the expression "Uchinchi," which means "my house," was not used at all even when I read books, and I didn't hear it from my friends, so when I looked it up as an adult, it was a dialect.
What, "Uchinchi"... ... was that so?
I also use it in my hometown (Gunma Prefecture), but I didn't notice it because I naturally stopped using it as an adult...
Japanese "chilled Chinese" is not popular with Chinese...?
"Cold noodle dishes" unpopular reason (modern business) - Yahoo! News
Chilled in China Chinese is "Japanese style cold noodles"
As mentioned at the beginning, chilled Chinese is a Chinese dish (Japanese style Chinese) that originated in Japan and was invented based on Chinese "chilled noodles."
Therefore, although it does not originally exist in China, due to the diversification of food, it has come to be seen in Japanese restaurants in summer.
Recently, Japanese convenience stores have also started offering "Japanese style soba ryomen / soba chilled Chinese" and "Kawakodori shiryomen / Sichuan style chicken chilled Chinese."
On the other hand, Japanese Chinese cuisine is generally not very popular in China, overtaken by popular and punchy Chinese dishes such as Sichuan and Hunan cuisine.
Naturally, the seasoning of Japanese-style Chinese food is often familiar to Chinese people.
Therefore, although it is not bad, if it has little impact, it tends to be criticized.
"Chilled Chinese" is no exception, and is still a minor presence in China.
By the way, the name of chilled Chinese noodles in China is "Japanese-style cold noodles."
It is recognized by Chinese as one of Japanese cuisine.
The standard summer dish is Liangpi.
In China, when it comes to noodle dishes that feel like summer, it is "Liangpi."
Many people in Japan may not be familiar with it, but Liangpi is a flat noodle made from flour, rice flour and starch that originated in Shanxi Province.
It is said to have a history of 2,000 years.
It is a standard B-grade gourmet that is also sold at street stalls, and the price is very reasonable, around 10-20 yuan (150-300 yen).
Although it contains the word "Ryo," it is not made with ice like Japanese chilled Chinese.
Rather, room temperature is basic.
The noodles are topped with your favorite ingredients such as shredded cucumbers, carrots and boiled bean sprouts, and condiments such as coriander, chili pepper, ginger and garlic are added.
Finally, it is finished with a special seasoning mixed with soy sauce, chili oil, vinegar, sesame paste and peanut paste.
The noodles are smooth and plump, and the spicy sauce, which is refreshing and rich in acidity, is well intertwined, so even when you are feeling hot in the summer and have no appetite, it goes smoothly.
In addition, since it has spread throughout China, there are various toppings and seasonings, and there are many variations, which is one of the characteristics and ways to enjoy it.

Benefits of "cold water shower" for body and mind (Cosmopolitan) - Yahoo! News
Reduces inflammation such as muscle pain
A study published in The North American Journal of Medical Sciences that examined the effectiveness of hydrotherapy (a treatment that uses water) found that it can be effective for physical and mental healing.
Cold water after exercise can reduce muscle pain and other inflammatory effects.
According to Professor Douglas Casa, director of the Korey Stringer Institute, which studies sports medicine, and a professor at the University of Connecticut, "It is important to exercise and take a cold shower as little time as possible, and lowering your body temperature immediately after moving your body will speed recovery from inflammation and fatigue caused by exercise."
Reduces fatigue
When you exercise in high temperatures, your heart, muscles and skin need more blood flow than usual.
"During exercise, the heart rate increases, so there is more blood flow to the heart, and muscle blood flow increases because it takes energy to contract the muscles, and as for the skin, a lot of blood flows in to regulate body temperature," says Professor Casa.
"Taking a cold shower lowers the temperature of the skin, which reduces the blood flow to the skin. Instead, it sends blood to internal organs such as the gastrointestinal tract, making it easier for water and nutrients to be ingested after exercise. As a result, it reduces the fatigue felt after exercise."
Expected hormesis effect
Dorozevsky explains that exposure to cold water can be expected to activate the "hormesis effect."
The hormesis effect is the idea that it is better to have a little bit of harmful substances and stress than none at all.
"Hypoxic exercise, petit fasting, and cold water showers are typical examples of hormesis effects for health, and cold water showers stimulate hormones and neurotransmitters, which can improve physical and physical strength and resilience."
Shizuoka Prefecture sports supporters commission two bicycle teams | Shizuoka Shimbun @S
Hirano (center) and others receiving a plate commissioned by Fujinokuni sports supporters = Oyama-cho
On the 24th, Shizuoka Prefecture commissioned two cycling teams from the eastern part of the prefecture as "Fujinokuni Sports Supporters" to help promote sports in the prefecture.
"Team Bridgestone Cycling" based in Mishima City and "Levante Fuji Shizuoka" based in Fuji City.

Hanshin Oyama, 2 games in a row, 7!
Director Yano "It's stately to watch" (Sankei Sports) - Yahoo! News
(SE League, Chunichi 2-5 Hanshin, 7th round, Hanshin 4-3, 24th, Nagoya D) The momentum of the 4th place has not stopped.
The ball soared high and landed in the middle of the left seat.
Oyama made two consecutive arches and circled the diamond.
When he returned to the bench, he peeked out his white teeth.
"While I had a good swing, I was able to narrow down my target and make a bold swing."
In the fourth inning, 0-2, he batted first.
He swung aggressively from the first ball, and the second ball after the foul.
I didn't miss Ohno's sweet 134kg slider.
The ball caught with the core was so perfect that I was convinced it was a stand-in the moment I hit it.
Following the match against Hiroshima (Koshien) on the 23rd the day before, one shot in two consecutive games was a signal of counterattack.
It was also a valuable shot from an opponent he was not good at.
Against Ohno, when they played at Koshien on the 17th, they had 9 hits and scored 4 points.
However, as far as Nagoya Dome is concerned, they have allowed seven wins, one loss and one hold in their past 12 games, and have been suffering seven consecutive losses since August 23, 2013, with a draw.
From such a difficult opponent, he scored for the first time in 23 innings at Nagoya Dome (dropping out in the middle was counted as one inning) with a dynamic shot and did not pass the flow of the game.
Coach Yano also expressed his hope for further explosions, saying, "It's a high level to be able to finish a sweet ball well. It's stately to watch, and there's an atmosphere even if the timing of hitting is a foul. I think he will still hit."
He hit a right forward in the first inning, marking six consecutive hits and three consecutive multiple hits.
Although the start of the season was a preliminary start, his seven home runs and 16 RBI have already been impeccable as the team's top and fourth.
We will continue to produce results for victory.

Iwabuchi HC "United for medals" rugby sevens men's training camp for the first time in four months (Sankei Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
Iwabuchi Kensuke, head coach of the Japan men's rugby sevens team, spoke to the press online on the 25th, expressing his determination to "unite and work towards our goal of winning medals" regarding the Tokyo Olympics, which have been postponed to next year.
In response to the postponement of the Olympics, Kuwazuru Yusaku (Coca-Cola), captain of the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics team, and Fukuoka Kenki (Panasonic), who also played an active role in the 2019 World Cup with 15 players, left the team.
The commander said, "Of course it will have a big impact, but we will move forward with players who can compete together."
From this day on, the team will be divided into Tokyo and Oita and begin training camps for national team candidates.
This is the first time since March that a training camp with overnight stays will be held until the 28th, but as a measure to prevent infection with the new coronavirus, there will be no practice involving contact.
The national team has decided to return to the top group, which will be able to participate in all games of the seven-player World Series (WS) from next season, but since it is unclear whether the WBS itself will be held as it travels around the world, Iwabuchi HC revealed that they are focusing on countries that will allow the national team to enter and are negotiating a strengthening match.
"Medical workers" infected For the first time in Nagano Prefecture, all female contacts in their 40s at Suwa Red Cross Hospital will undergo PCR tests (NBS Nagano Broadcasting) - Yahoo! News
A woman in her 40s in Suwa, Nagano Prefecture, was found to be infected with a new type of coronavirus.
This is the first time in the prefecture that a medical worker at Suwa Red Cross Hospital has been infected.
The infection was confirmed by a woman in her 40s, a medical worker in Suwa.
The number of infected people in the prefecture has reached 87, and this is the first time that a medical worker has been infected.
According to the prefecture, the woman developed coughing and phlegm on the 13th and visited three medical institutions after the 17th.

Macau casino supervisory authority inspects the implementation of epidemic prevention measures at casino facilities... required to present a new coronavirus negative certificate when entering (Macau Newspaper) - Yahoo! News
About 40 casino facilities in Macau were closed for 15 days from February 5th to 19th due to the outbreak of a new type of coronavirus infection (COVID-19), but since the 20th of the same month, they have reopened after taking strict measures to prevent disease.
The Macau Casino Regulatory Authority (DICJ) requires the operating company to protect the health of employees and guests as much as possible when reopening, ensuring the distance between gaming (casino) tables, allowing adjacent seats for table games (for example, at a baccarat table, only three to four people can sit at one table at the same time), and stipulating that slot machines should be operated every one or two, to reduce the risk of cross-infection.
Disinfection of gaming equipment such as chips has also been strengthened.
In addition, guests are required to wear a mask, check the temperature, and present a valid health code (generated by entering their most recent stay, contact with a new type of corona patient, symptoms such as fever and cough, and contact information) when entering.
From midnight on July 15th, a new type of coronavirus nucleic acid test negative certificate (limited to those within the validity period issued by a licensed facility in Macau or Guangdong Province) was added to the condition.
The reason behind the new requirement to present a negative certificate is the relaxation of border control measures between Macau and Guangdong Province from 6: 00 a.m. on the 15th (abolition of quarantine for 14 days, with various conditions), which will be a precautionary measure.
The DICJ announced on July 18th that, in response to the change in admission conditions from the 15th of the same month, Director General of the DICJ, Adriano Ho, and others inspected the implementation of epidemic prevention measures at casino facilities, and held a meeting with representatives from the security departments of the six casino operators, asking them once again to protect the health of employees and guests by thoroughly controlling guest admission.
DICJ stated that it will continue to conduct strict patrols of casino facilities and will have regular meetings with the operating company in accordance with the situation and evaluation, and that it will adjust epidemic prevention measures at casinos as appropriate in accordance with the guidelines of the Government Health Bureau.
Hayashimatsu, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the Health Bureau, and others accompanied them on their visit to the casino facilities, where they were given instructions on how to disinfect gaming (casino) chips and keep a safe distance between the seats of electronic casino equipment.
Due to the sharp decline in inbound passengers due to anti-epidemic measures, including restrictions on entry, casino sales from January to June this year decreased 77.4% from the same period last year to 33.72 billion macao pataca (Japanese yen equivalent: About 451.9 billion yen).
Light Ale from Yuwaku Onsen Next month, a message to medical professionals instead of Bonbori Festival (Hokkoku Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
At Yuwaku Onsen, where the annual Yuwaku Bonbori Festival has been cancelled due to the new coronavirus, an initiative will begin on August 1st to light bonbori with messages of support for medical professionals.
About 350 sheets of paper written by fans and local residents from all over the country will be pasted on them, enveloping the hot spring town with the light of ale and delivering healing to visitors.
The Bonbori Festival is an event that recreates the festival that appears in the anime "Hanasaku Iroha" modeled on Yuwaku Onsen, and is organized by the Yuwaku Onsen Tourism Association.
It began in 2011 when the anime was broadcast, and every year many anime fans from all over the country visit.
Every year, from the lighting ceremony in July to the main festival in October, bonbori lanterns are hung on the stairs leading to Yuwaku Inari Shrine next to the soyu.
This year, the festival was forced to be cancelled due to the new Corona, but fans from the local area and across the country said, "It's sad that there are no bonbori in the summer of Yuwaku," and the association came up with the idea for this event.
The campaign was called the "Recovery Campaign" with the aim of helping to heal and recover the world, which is in dire straits due to the corona disaster.
So far, about 50 students from local Yuwaku Elementary School and Shibahara Junior High School have been asked to write illustrated messages one by one, and more than 100 applications have been received from all over the country.
If you purchase the message form from the association's website, fill it out, put it in a return envelope and send it to the association, you can receive a photo that is attached to a bonbori and lit.
Each set costs 6,000 yen, and applications will be accepted until the total number of bonbori reaches 350.
The bonbori will be lit until the end of November.
Yamashita Shinichiro (48), who has been the chairman of the festival's executive committee since the first festival, said, "Reading the message encourages us. Next year we want to hold a grand festival that will mark the 10th anniversary."
For the campaign, we also prepared illustrations of the blooming Iroha characters and Asanogawa Ohashi Bridge.
From the 1st, clear files with illustrations will be sent to users of special accommodation plans at ryokan in Yuwaku Onsen.
Core 4 "Moriyama Gaigen," which supports Seibu, is a partnership of souls (Tokyo Sports Web) - Yahoo! News
"Moriyama Gogen," which Seibu is proud of, showed a spirit of cooperation and produced the second Sayonara win this season.
The match against Lotte (MetLife) on the 24th was 2-2 in the ninth inning, and the four players, who were still far from their best, showed their tenacity to win.
The lead, Genda, went from safety bunt to first base with head sliding.
Then, in the last six games, Mori, the third batter, who is at rock bottom with a batting average of 10%, 8 minutes and 2 rin, decided to send a bunt and hit second base.
Yamakawa, the fourth, was shunned, and Sotozaki, who replaced Mori and returned to the fifth from that day, smashed Masuda's straight ball, leading to a 3-2 victory.
Hero Sotozaki said, "(Genda's safety) was unexpected even for me on the bench, and I thought I had no choice but to do something about it. I could feel that Tomoya also believed in me behind me with a bunt and connected me. Yamakawa shunned me and said, 'Be proactive!' Before going to first base, so I was able to get my feelings into it," and the three of them thought that they had created a flow of goodbye.
Mori and Yamakawa, who were first and second in the 2013 draft, Sotozaki, who was third in 2014, and Genda, who was third in 2016, are the "core four" of fielders that team officials call "the heart of our current team."
All of them have experience as captains when they were amateurs, and their sense of responsibility is second to none.
Sotozaki, who took over as captain from Yamakawa when he was in his fourth year at Fuji University, said, "Yamakawa is a captain who leads the team with words because he is good at talking. On the other hand, I am not good at speaking, so I was the type to leave the conversation to the vice-captain who is good at talking and stand behind him."
Director Tsuji said, "Genda's safety? That's not a sign, but I thought, 'I can go with that.' Tomoya was also a great bunt. Sotozaki also hit well," praising the spirit of "Moriyama Gogen."
All four are currently struggling with a batting average of 20% 4-5 minutes, but they support the team with their wisdom and ability to win even if they can't hit.

Omura Masujiro's achievements as an educator to Suzenji [Yamaguchi] | Ube Nippo Konomachi Media Web
On the 23rd, a bronze statue of Omura Masujiro (1825-69), one of the ten heroes of the Meiji Restoration, was unveiled in his birthplace, Suzenji, Yamaguchi.
An unveiling ceremony was held in the front yard of the Suzenji Community Exchange Center, where local and government officials celebrated the completion.
Masujiro was a scholar of military science, a scholar of Western studies, and a doctor during the end of the Edo period and the Meiji Restoration.
After teaching at 'Bansho Shirabesho,' a research and educational institution for Western studies of the bakufu, he opened a private school 'Kyukyodo' in Edo and taught Western studies, military science and medicine.
Even after returning to the Choshu Domain, he gave lectures on military science at Yamaguchi Meirinkan.
The statue focused on Masujiro as an educator.
Standing beside a globe, holding a book in his hand, he gave a lecture on Western studies.
The height of the statue, including the pedestal, is about 3 meters (statue 1.55 meters), and it is said that it was made from the perspective of a disciple attending Masujiro's lecture.
It was designed by local designer Takami Marie (27), a descendant of Masujiro's wife Kotoko.
It was built with donations collected by the Omura Masujiro 150th Anniversary Project Executive Committee (Chairman Okamoto Satoshi), whose parent organization is the Suzenji Community Association.
Approximately 12.8 million yen of purified goods were collected from 1,104 people nationwide.
The project cost, including the installation of the name board, is approximately 12 million yen.
The surplus donations will be used to maintain the statue.
Chairman Okamoto said, "Masujiro, who continued to have high aspirations and made a great contribution as an educator, is the pride of his hometown, and a bronze statue that will be the hope of local children who will lead the future."

After the game, Embappe left the stadium on crutches with his right leg fixed.
PSG will play the Coupe de la League final against Lyon at 4: 10 on August 1st Japan time, but it will definitely be impossible to use Embappe in this match.
He will have to wait for the medical report to be released by the club, but there is a possibility that he will miss the Champions League in Portugal.
Corona disaster "art closer" online museum "HASARD" launched by Konno (from Hachinohe) (Daily Tohoku Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
There are museums where anyone can touch art for free whenever they want.
They range from famous painters such as Claude Monet and Gustav Klimt to unknown artists in Japan.
Since its opening in April 2019, the online art museum "HASARD" has captured the hearts of users for its convenience and newness, and the new lifestyle caused by the corona disaster has further increased its attention.
Representative Konno Shinnosuke (26) from Hachinohe City, who launched the website and lives in Tokyo, says, "I wanted to create a service where anyone can easily enjoy art. I want people to experience art under difficult circumstances."
When you visit Other, you will be surprised by the abundance of exhibits and the beauty of the images.
As of the 24th, a total of 14 exhibitions, both permanent and special, are open to the public, and the ultra-high resolution works that convey not only the color but also the texture of the brush attract viewers.
Membership registration and admission fees are not required, and there is no cost not only for viewers but also for artists who want to hold solo exhibitions.
The way it is shown online also attracts attention.
Moving pictures is one of them.
In Claude Monet's permanent exhibition "It begins to move again," clouds, flowers and grasslands are digitally processed to move.
Representative Konno said, "I want to make it possible for people who are not interested in art to enter," so you can feel like you are in a picture.
Representative Konno first encountered art when he was in elementary school.
At that time, when I visited the newly completed Aomori Museum of Art with my family, I saw three huge paintings of Marc Chagall's "Aleko" and was shocked by their power.
From the next day, the art class turned into a fun time, and even after moving to Tokyo on the occasion of going to university, he began to visit galleries.
At the same time, I felt that many people do not have many opportunities to interact with art from various perspectives, such as the lack of museums nearby, the fact that major exhibitions are only held in the Tokyo metropolitan area, and the difficulty of going out due to childcare.
So, while working at an IT company, he spent about two months launching a website where people could appreciate art on the Internet.
The number of users reached an average of 10,000 a month in the first 10 months, and increased to about 30,000 after the outbreak of the new corona.
If anyone can appreciate art freely when they want to see it.
Other's aim was unexpectedly accepted by more people due to the corona disaster.
Konno emphasized the significance of art appreciation, saying it enriches the imagination.
"When you have a rich imagination, you can reach out to people in need.
I want a better society by making art more accessible. "
A simple reason why the era of Chinese quality is coming to an end and the era of Japanese quality is coming (modern business) - Yahoo! News
Pandemic changes values
Various predictions and discussions are being made about the world of after pandemics.
On the business side, there is a possibility that the changes described in the July 8 article, "Actually, 'managerial' jobs are starting to disappear in Japan...! That cruel reality," and the July 4 article, "In the post-Corona world, 'Japanese manufacturing' is actually likely to make a big comeback...!"
[Photo] The true nature of "Japan's strength" that only Japanese people know... an unexpected reality seen in Asia
In terms of mental health, articles such as the June 26th article, "Corona: A Guide to Complete Combustion for People Who Have Become Conscious of the End of Life," and the June 10th article, "Corona: Now that we are full of riots, let's reconsider the benefits of 'asking God in times of hardship'" are likely to become mainstream.
What we can clearly see as a combination of these two "materials (economy and business)" and "spirit" is the major trend from "Chinese quality to Japanese quality."
For example, if a T-shirt or digital camera is defective or defective, it would be infuriating, but the life of the person who purchased it is not different.
On the other hand, the sloppy quality of masks and ventilators made in China, which have recently become a hot topic... "Chinese quality" in products that are directly linked to life and safety is fatal.
You cannot buy such products no matter how cheap they are.
They will want "Japanese quality" products even if they pay a considerable price.
Of course, this trend is not happening only in Japan.
It is clear from the fact that Western countries, which had fallen into a difficult situation due to a shortage of masks and medical equipment, still returned products one after another due to the severity of "Chinese quality."
Safety and security over cheapness
In addition, products such as automobiles are products whose defects can be fatal (death from accidents).
No matter how much countries such as China and South Korea attack with the "cheap or bad" strategy, they will not be able to compete with Japanese products in the end, and the situation described in the article on June 16th, "Will the world's automobile manufacturers bow down to Toyota?" Is because "Japanese quality" is strongly required for automobile products.
The pandemic also reminded us that many other products need "safety and security."
In addition, safety and security are important not only for "Japanese quality in manufacturing" but also for "Japanese quality in logistics and other services."
Like the toilet paper scandal, even though production capacity is in place, there are times when intermediate distribution is delayed and cannot be delivered.
Furthermore, as in the April 17th article "Who is the real culprit behind the lack of masks? Don't forgive the Chinese Communist Party government for stealing fire places," it made me keenly aware that self-sufficiency in Japan is also an important element of "safety and security."
In the event of an emergency, it is natural for any country to give priority to its own country, and it is very important to be able to procure essential goods such as masks (medical equipment) and food within its own country.
More than 100 new cases of corona infection in South Korea for the first time in 115 days = the highest number of overseas inflows at 86 (Yonhap News) - Yahoo! News
[Seoul Yonhap News] South Korea's Central Epidemic Control Headquarters announced on the 25th that the number of people infected with the new coronavirus as of midnight on the same day had increased by 113 from midnight the previous day, bringing the total to 14,092.
It was the first time in 115 days since April 1 (101) that the number of new infections per day exceeded 100.
In addition to the fact that 32 sailors were found to be infected on a Russian ship that entered Busan Port, 32 of the 293 workers who returned from Iraq on the 24th tested positive.
The number of new infections in South Korea was in the range of 30-60 except for the 20th (26 people).
Of the new infections announced on the 25th, 86 were from overseas, the highest number since January 20th, when the first case was reported in Korea.
The largest number of arrivals came from Iraq at 36, with 34 from Russia, five from the Philippines and three from the United States.
On the other hand, 27 people were infected in the city, 11 in Seoul and Gyeonggi Province and 5 in Busan.

The death toll remained unchanged from the previous day, bringing the total to 298.
Nagoya's Miyahara player is corona positive soccer J1, first since the league resumed | Shizuoka Shimbun @S
Nagoya, a member of J1 soccer, announced on the 25th that it has been confirmed that defender Miyahara Kazuya (24) has tested positive for a new type of coronavirus.
This is the first time a player has tested positive since the J. League resumed.
This is the third player in the club, following FW Mu Kanazaki (31) and Australian goalkeeper Mitchell Langerack (31) who were infected in June.
Both have already received treatment and returned to the game.
This season, Miyahara was on the bench for the J1 match against Oita at Showa Denko Dome Oita on the 22nd.
Nagoya held an online press conference on the 25th, and revealed that 60 players and staff were tested on the same day.

It turns out that white paint derived from Teflon frying pans and insulation enhance cooling effect!
A great discovery!
This year, the rainy season was marked by an unusually high amount of rainfall, but the extremely hot summer will be in full swing when the light comes.
It's hot and hot, and the burning days that even the air conditioner doesn't work ... It seems like you'll be sick just by imagining it, right?
Global warming is a major global problem, and humanity has been trying to figure out how to overcome the hot summer comfortably.
One way to do this is to wear thin white clothes.
Look, you don't have to wear black to absorb heat in summer, do you?
The same principle is applied to the construction of houses, and the use of white paint is increasing.
Even if white is white, the latest research field was whether it could be made into a paint that reflects more light and does not absorb heat.
The Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), in collaboration with researchers from Columbia University's Department of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics, announced that they have found a method for blending white paint that can most efficiently repel solar heat and increase the cooling effect inside buildings.
They aim for early practical use.
Until now, the white paint with the highest reflectivity of sunlight was made of titanium oxide, which has a reflectivity of 85%.
White paint using titanium oxide has already been applied to the roofs of buildings in high-temperature environments, helping to block solar heat and increase cooling efficiency.
However, what has been newly discovered is a white paint derived from the fluorine resin of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), which is used in Teflon processed frying pans.
It is a white paint that applies this Teflon effect, and it is said to be able to significantly cut heat by reflecting sunlight up to 98%.
Even in the hot summer, thanks to the white paint using Teflon, it is easy to spend time indoors without being exposed to the heat.
Such an era may be coming soon, right?
I feel that the roofs of Japanese houses tend to have dark colors, but will white be the mainstream in the future?
When is Amazon's annual big sale this year?
CNBC reported on July 21st that Amazon.com has announced the postponement of its annual major sale, Prime Day.
It is held in July every year, but this year it was reported that it had to be postponed due to the spread of a new type of coronavirus.
■ A spokesperson said, "Details will be announced shortly," an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement.
"Prime Day has become a special celebration event that we have been looking forward to for the past five years, and this year it will be held later than usual while ensuring the safety of employees and supporting customers and retailers."
However, he only stated that "details will be announced soon," and did not reveal a specific date.
On the other hand, they decided to hold it in India.
A press release was posted on the country's website.
He explained that it will be held for 48 hours from midnight on August 6th.
Prime Day has been held simultaneously around the world, but this year it may take an unusual step.
A large-scale event that sells 760 billion yen in two days Amazon started this large-scale sale for members in 2015 as a sales promotion measure in the summer when sales are declining.
Initially, the event was a 24-hour event, but it has expanded year by year, and last year it was held for 48 hours from midnight on July 15th in 18 countries including the US, Canada, UK, Germany, France, India, Japan, China and Australia.
According to the company, last year, sales on two days exceeded previous sales on Black Friday (the first day of the year-end sales season) and Cyber Monday (the following Monday).
This event has also contributed to the acquisition of new subscribers to the paid member "Prime," and last year, the number of applications on the first day reached a record high, followed by the next day.
Last year, it sold 175 million products worldwide.
Internet Retailer, a magazine specializing in the online shopping industry, reported that global sales over the two days were $7.16 billion, up 70% from the previous year.
Strict eyes on mobile number migration and excessive retention.
What about fees and points?
(New Switch) - Yahoo! News
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) is in full swing considering a review of the same number transfer system (MNP), which allows users to keep their existing phone number when changing mobile communications companies.
At a meeting of experts on the 21st, they announced their intention to revise the MNP guidelines established in 2004.
There are a wide range of specific issues, such as the nature of MNP fees and the pros and cons of retaining those who wish to move out.
As opposition from telecommunications companies is expected, attention is focused on whether this will promote healthy market competition.
When MNP was introduced in 2006, the user fee was 2,000 yen, but now it is 3,000 yen.
The MNP fee revenue of the three major mobile communications companies is estimated at 15.9 billion yen per year.
On the 21st, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) listed the current situation surrounding MNP at the Working Group on Verification of Competition Rules (WG), a panel of experts discussing the competitive environment in the telecommunications market.
He also cited the time it takes to issue MNP reservation numbers, which are required when consumers move to other telecommunications companies.
Major telecommunications companies accept applications on the web, but due to the convenience of operating core systems, the acceptance time is mainly from 9: 00 to 20: 00.
In the WG materials, it was clearly stated that the direction of future consideration would be to respond all day in principle.
It is also a problem that mobile communication companies try to keep people who wish to move out with MNP by granting points.
This was based on the judgment that excessive retention could hamper fair competition.
Kita Shunichi, a partner at Nomura Research Institute, who is a member of the WG, suggests, "We will get permission from users to give them time to explain the provision of economic benefits, and we will promptly issue numbers to users who do not give permission. It is important to thoroughly implement this process first."
However, among a series of issues, there is a structural problem with MNP fees: "The higher the fee, the harder it is for customers to flow out, so it is difficult to motivate them to actively lower it" (Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications official).
There is also concern that if some businesses take the initiative to lower MNP fees, the outflow of customers from those companies will increase and corporate efforts will not be rewarded.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications has also pointed out that many countries overseas do not require user fees for MNP, and it is possible that this will happen in Japan.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) plans to compile a report on the results of the WG around September and October, and then begin the process of revising the MNP guidelines.
It is expected that the revision will take place after 2021.
Mobile phone companies are likely to struggle with sales and customer support.
Chunichi and Katsuno did not get the right to win even though they conceded no points in the sixth inning (Sankei Sports) - Yahoo! News
Chunichi pitcher Katsuno Shokei (23) started the Hanshin 8th round (Nagoya Dome) on the 25th.
He had four hits and no runs in six innings.
"I pitched last time, so I thought it was my last chance, so I threw it. There was a foreball, but I was able to play against my opponent without worrying too much."
He pitched for the first time this season, and in the previous game against Hanshin (Koshien) on the 18th, he started twice, but both struggled to control the ball and dropped out by the fourth inning.
Unable to fulfill his role as a starter, this time it was a backwater mound for the survival of the first team.
This time, he was bullish with a ball full of emotion against a strong tiger batting line.
When a straight ball in the late 140kg range ran, I was able to effectively use change balls such as count balls.
In the sixth inning, he was hit by the leading Suns with a double between the left and middle, but he hit Oyama on the left and Boer on the second, killing two at third base.
In the match against Fukudome, who was welcomed here, he chased him with two balls and finally forked.
In a three-ball game, he struck out a blank and survived the pinch.
Katsuno finished the sixth inning with 83 pitches, but at the end of the midfield game, Yoda came off the bench and announced a change of pitcher.
Nishi Isamu, who played the pitching game, had 108 pitches at the same time, but he got off the mound first and did not get the right to win for the first time this season.

Masuda Shrine, located in the Takagushi district of Tano, Hizen-cho, Karatsu City, enshrines Officer Masuda Keitaro (1869-1895), who died in the line of duty for his efforts to combat the infectious disease cholera that spread to the area 125 years ago.
The annual festival has been held in late July every year, but this year it was cancelled due to the new coronavirus.
On the 26th, the chairman of the local government will hold a Shinto ritual.
At the annual festival, the residents' association held a parade of police officer Masuda's floats on white horses and fireworks.
Every year, nearly 200 people attend, including bereaved families living in Kumamoto Prefecture, police officials, and local residents.
Takeda Yoshinori (72), the chairman of the local government, says, "The annual festival that has been connected to the local community is crowded every year. It is very regrettable that it was cancelled."
The prefectural police also cancelled a memorial service for police school students this year.
On the 21st, General Manager Sugiuchi Yumiko and Karatsu Police Chief Fukushima Hiroto visited Komatsushima off the coast of Takagushi Port, where she was cremated, and laid flowers at the monument.
Chief Sugiuchi said, "The spirit of bravery and dedication is the origin of the police, and I want to pass it on as it should be."
Officer Masuda, a native of Kumamoto Prefecture, was assigned to Takagushi in July 1895 (Meiji 28).
He took measures without sleep, such as disinfecting patients' homes, and later contracted cholera himself.
He said, "I will carry all the cholera from Takagushi," and died at the age of 25 just four days after taking office.

You can do this outside of baseball!
Betts made his major league debut in 2014 at the age of 21.
He has contributed to the team as the center of the Boston Red Sox's strong batting line and as a strong right fielder.
From 2015 to last season, he hit more than 40 doubles every year, making him the pinnacle of middle-distance hitters.
In 2018, when he became the best in the world, he batted .346 and won the top batter and MVP.
According to 'CBS Sports', Betts turned down a 10-year, $300 million (about 32.1 billion yen) offer from the Red Sox last year.
In the offseason, he and left-arm ace pitcher David Price were traded to the Dodgers in exchange for money and multiple players.
He signed a one-year, $27 million (About 2.9 billion yen) contract this season.
The new contract reported this time is for a total of $365 million (about 39.1 billion yen) over 12 years from the 2021 season to the 2032 season.

"Hot Seminar" where Kinoshita Akio, director of the ophthalmology department at Hiramatsu Hospital, explained dry eyes, etc. = Yonezawa Saga Main Store of Glasses in Saga City
The "Health Hot Seminar" (hosted by Saga Newspaper and co-hosted by Megane no Yonezawa) was held on the 25th at Megane no Yonezawa Saga Main Store in Shimoda-cho, Saga City, where experts give advice on various health issues.
Kinoshita Akio, director of the ophthalmology department at Hiramatsu Hospital (Ogi City), explained about eye diseases that are deeply related to daily life, such as dry eyes and cataracts.
Dry eye is said to be a "tear disease" and it is explained that the quality of tears collapses and tears do not spread evenly on the surface of the eyes.
Kinoshita said, "Contact lens users are about four times more likely," and cautioned, "Don't use it for a long time or sleep while wearing it."
Measures were taken, such as placing the computer screen below eye level and humidifying in air-conditioned rooms.
Ingredients and foods that are effective for dry eyes were also introduced.
"'Omega-3', which is found in green fish, prevents tears from evaporating, and 'mucin', which is found in natto and okra, improves the quality of tears."
Regarding cataract surgery, there are single focus and multi-focus intraocular lenses that are inserted instead of the lens, and I touched on the differences in appearance.
About 40 people attended the seminar.
As a measure to prevent infection with the new type of coronavirus, the event was divided into two parts, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, and was held with a small number of people.

[G Osaka] 17 years old What are the chances of making your J1 debut against FW Karayama and Kobe?
Director Miyamoto "Scoring power is outstanding" (Sports Hochi) - Yahoo! News
G Osaka coach Miyamoto Tsuneyasu (43) gave an interview on the 25th ahead of the match against Kobe (Noesta on the 26th), where they are on the verge of winning four consecutive games, and revealed his expectations for high school third-year student FC Karayama Shoji (17), who joined the first team for the first time in the previous season.
The commander will make Karayama, who was promoted to the top rank this season, a bench member for the match against Hiroshima on the 22nd.
Although he did not give him a chance to play, he also ordered the striker, who has scored three goals in five games so far this season in J3, to "stand out in terms of scoring points. I'm 17 years old, but I want him to play more gamshala. I've seen players go abroad at a young age, but I want him to play with high awareness and greed."
Karayama scored 8 goals in 10 games for J3, which he played as a specially designated player last season.
Although he is slender at 178cm and 65kg, he boasts an astonishing scoring rate of 11 goals in 15 games in J3, thanks to his sense of getting behind the defender with instant movement and his calmness to shoot in front of a crowded opponent's goal.
In the match against Hiroshima, FM Ademiusson and MF Onoze were off the bench due to injuries, and Karayama got a chance, but did not have a chance to play.
In preparation for the match against Kobe, Miyamoto explained the state of Ademiusson and Onoze, saying, "Both of them are not 100%, but they are highly motivated to prepare."
If they are to be preserved, there is a possibility that Tangshan will be on the bench again.
At G Osaka, MF Doan (now PSV) made his J1 debut at the age of 16 years and 11 months, and FW Usami made his J1 debut at the age of 17 years and 0 months, and moved overseas in his teens.
Karayama, who is currently 17 years and 10 months old and is expected to be the next talent, is also expected to make his J1 debut as a successor to them.
A Ferrari that was stolen 26 years ago is found at the bottom of a river, but it will not be restored (octane.jp) - Yahoo! News
In 1994, a Ferrari Mondial was stolen in the Netherlands.
Time passed without the police being able to solve the problem, but 26 years later, the mondial was miraculously discovered.
The discovery of the Ferrari (4 photos) found at the bottom of the river was triggered by the fire department's diving training.
On July 8th, a diver in training found something wedge-shaped that sank to the bottom of the river, and the police and even the Dutch army were dispatched, and when they pulled something up, it turned out to be a Ferrari Mondial.
By matching the VIN number to a database of stolen cars, the Ferrari could be linked to the 1994 incident.
The car was handed over to its legal owner, an insurance company, and then sent to a scrap dealer.
Scrap dealer Lowie van DE Ooyevaar said, "There are still some parts left, but they are for art like decorating. We have already received many requests from people who want to make a table out of a dismembered mondial. We will use engine blocks and glass plates."
For the time being, there are no plans to sell it, and the scrap dealer will store it as an object.

The team that won the competition together saved 2.
The voltage of the Leo Party packed into the MetLife Dome, their home base, reached its climax.
Sotozaki made his first Sayonara hit in his sixth year as a pro.
It excited a crowd of 4,825.
"Gen (Genda) and Tomoya (Mori) connected me, so I entered the batting with the intention of doing something about it." His colleague's obsession with winning inspired the number 5.
The ninth inning was 2-2.
Leading batter Genda tried a safety bunt and a spirited head sliding to first base.
When he hit infield, Mori, the top batter last season, made his second professional sacrifice.
The fourth, Yamakawa, shunned the declaration.
A senior from Fuji University was made to walk, and Sotozaki's heart was burning.
"I thought," Damn. "Before Yamakawa went to first base, he said," Be proactive, "so I was really excited."
From the first ball, he was stuck on a straight ball with a high inner angle, but the ball fell to the left.
Throughout his amateur days, he said, "I have no memory."
The 27-year-old, who had been inspired by his alma mater, Aomori's Hirosaki Sanetaka, advancing to the top four in the summer prefectural tournament for the first time in 20 years, took a joyful water shower and smiled, saying, "As expected, it felt good."
He was called "the man who doesn't have it."
He was selected by Samurai Japan as a versatile player who can protect the infield, and contributed to the world's best at "Premier 12" last November.
However, at Seibu, he had no experience with Sayonara hitting, and coach Tsuji and coach Baba's strategy, defense and running coach bullied him, saying, "You don't have it."
He repelled his negative reputation and produced his second Sayonara win this season.
Coach Tsuji praised him, saying, "I asked the goddess of victory for today. She played well."
With two savings, they are in third place, one game behind SoftBank.
Sotozaki, who has only hit one home run this season and has a batting average of 252, said, "We still have to hit. We will work as a team to win the next one."
The one hit that decided the game will be an opportunity to recover.

Steady progress toward brand pig farming, acquisition of JGAP (Daily Tohoku Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
Minoru Pig Farm (Representative Nakanowatari Minoru), which raises about 50,000 pigs a year at farms in Towada City and Rokunohe Town, visited Mayor Oyamada Hisashi at Towada City Hall on the 20th and reported that their farm has acquired JGAP (livestock and livestock products) certification, which indicates the safety of agricultural and livestock products.
This is the second case of a pig farming business in the prefecture.
The company is involved in the production of "garlic pork," which uses powdered garlic from the prefecture as a special feed, and "jiyoton," which uses rice from the prefecture.
This time, of the five farms, the fifth farm (Rokunohe Town), which breeds about 10,000 pigs and produces "local pigs," obtained JGAP certification.
The company aimed to obtain certification because they thought that "certification is necessary to be selected by major buyers" and learned that it was a condition for procuring ingredients for the Olympic Village for the Tokyo Olympics.
With the support of Aomori Bank since August last year, preparations were made together with bank employees qualified as JGAP instructors.
On March 3rd this year, it was reviewed by a certification body and cleared a total of 113 criteria including food safety.
It was certified on the 13th of the same month.
The visit was attended by Nakanowatari Minoru, president of the company, Nakanowatari Dai, managing director, Yamada Takeo and Towada Nanji, manager of Aomori Bank, and Ishigo Yoshihiro, business advisor of the bank's corporate support department.
Mayor Oyamada cheered, saying, "It is very wonderful. I hope you will greatly promote (JGAP certification) and expand sales channels."
Representative Nakanowatari Minoru was enthusiastic, saying, "I would like to contribute to Towada City by continuing to make efforts to brand pig farming."
Managing Director Nakanowatari said, "We aim to obtain certification for the remaining four farms as well," referring to future goals.

Coach Yoda also said, "I think (the condition) is about 70 to 80%. This is my own feeling, so it's like that from what I see, but I think it's enough, it's a faster recovery than I expected. I wasn't particularly concerned about the way I ran after hitting, and I think if I gradually get used to it, my starting lineup will be close."
Takahashi himself decided, "I will get back what I left as soon as possible."

Heavy rain, damage to "traffic" in Kitato National Route 152 closed for 10km, some sections of the JR Iida Line closed | Shizuoka Shimbun @S
National Route 152 has been completely closed to traffic, and a line of cars waiting to take a detour that alternates on one side: Ryuzan-cho, Tenryu-ku, Hamamatsu on the afternoon of the 22nd (part of the photo has been processed)
The Tenryu area of Hamamatsu City was one of the hardest hit areas in Shizuoka Prefecture after heavy rains in July caused extensive damage to Kyushu and other parts of Japan.
The impact of landslides remains on the main road, National Route 152, and the JR Iida Line, which is the "foot of life," and many areas require time to recover.
In addition to the inconvenience of daily life, residents are increasingly worried about the negative impact on economic activities.
At Sejiri Bridge over the Tenryu River in Ryuzan-cho, the ward, a long line of cars waiting to pass continues during the day.
The lead car stopped for nearly 40 minutes.
National Route 152 has been closed for about 10 kilometers, and it is necessary to take a detour to the other side of the Tenryu River to move around the town.
However, the width of the road is narrow, and all sections alternate on one side, so waiting times are unpredictable.
In the town, a landslide occurred on the national highway on the 9th, and traffic was closed due to the risk of falling rocks on nearby slopes.
On the 13th, cracks were found in the Akiba Tunnel within the restricted section, and there is still no timetable for when traffic will resume.
In the town, the national highway was closed in 2018 due to the collapse of the soil, damaging residents' lives and tourism.
Tamamoto Kimie (76), president of the Dragon Mama processing plant, which sells specialty products, said, "We are in a tailspin when the new coronavirus has kept customers away. The number of visitors has decreased significantly."
The JR Iida Line was closed between Mizukubo Station (Mizukubo Town, Ward) and Hiraoka Station (Nagano Prefecture) due to a slope collapse beside the track.
Ukai Shiori (16), who used to commute from Oarashi Station (the same town) in the closed section to Hamamatsu Kohoku High School Sakuma Branch School in Sakuma-cho, the same ward, needed a car transfer that took about an hour one way.
He hopes for a speedy recovery, saying, "A car is a heavy burden for both parents and myself."
According to JR Central, it is expected to take about three months to reopen, and from the 27th, a special train will run between Mizukubo Station and Oarashi Station on weekdays morning and evening.
In Mizukubo Town, landslides occur frequently on forest roads that are also residential roads.
In some cases, the detour takes several hours.
Kumagai Keiji (69), president of the Mizukubo Town Forest Association, said, "The removal of raw wood has been delayed. There are isolated islands on land everywhere. I'm worried about future rain."
Nakajima Shoya, is it your choice to be absent from the victory ceremony?
Local Media News (Football Channel) - Yahoo! News

Portugal's ZAP reported based on information from Recordo.
Porto, who won the Portuguese league in the 2019 / 20 season, held a victory ceremony on the pitch during their last home war on the 20th of this month.
However, the fact that Nakajima was not here was a hot topic.
Nakajima, who refused to join the team during the league suspension due to the new coronavirus, has been sidelined ever since.
Under such circumstances, he was absent from the victory ceremony, so this summer's transfer is being discussed.
According to Record, Porto invited Nakajima to the ceremony.
However, Nakajima just didn't show up.
As a result, it says, "Nakajima is increasingly out of manager Sergio Conceição's plans for next season and needs to leave the club in the next transfer window."
Nakajima, who was the number 10 at a prestigious Portuguese club, seems to be leaving after one year.
They may have already started looking for a new place.

45% of families have their wives holding their wallets!
Is my husband happy or unhappy?
Is there a wife who is shocked or angry when her husband says, "I don't have enough allowance this month..."?
The family where this conversation is established is the family where the wife holds the wallet.
How many families in the world have their wives holding their wallets?
Also, let's look at the percentage of "separate wallets for couples" and "jointly managed."
Who holds the household wallet?
Matsui Securities Co., Ltd. conducted an online survey of 800 people nationwide, including 400 men and women in their 20s and 30s (young couples) who have been married for less than three years, and 400 men and women in their 50s and 60s (mature couples) who have been married for more than 30 years.
Who holds the household purse?
Wife: 45.0% Husband: 24.8% The most common result was families where the wife manages the household budget.
No matter who manages it, there are twists and turns in household management, but there seem to be various episodes.
My wife manages the household budget: In the case of child A, child A is a Wah Mama from Alafif who has a daughter who is in her third year of high school and first year of high school.
Child A is in full control of the household budget.
As I was about to take my university entrance exams, the number of months when I was losing money was increasing, so I negotiated with my husband to reduce my allowance, but as expected, he resisted.
At that time, he asked me to show him what kind of income and expenditure I had, so I showed him my household accounts.
I should have listed all my expenses, but when I looked at the household accounts, it was not enough to make a loss.
My husband was about to say, "It's enough, isn't it?," but Ako couldn't help but say, "I understand, I'm not good at managing my household budget, so please take care of everything."
Later, when Ako interviewed her husband, she said, "Although I am dissatisfied with the way my allowance is managed, my real intention is that I don't have the time or energy to manage various household expenses (such as school teaching materials and PTA expenses)."
Husband manages the household budget: In the case of B child B child, a stay-at-home mother, is given living expenses by her husband and manages it every day.
Last spring, the freezer part of the refrigerator broke, so B asked her husband to buy a refrigerator.
However, my husband was reluctant to replace it, saying, "The freezer is no good, but you can still use the refrigerated part, so it's okay."
However, in the summer, her husband wanted to create an environment where he could eat ice cream anytime, so he turned his hand over and said, "Let's buy a refrigerator."
So, B child unexpectedly complained to her friend, "My husband is so stingy that he gets stingy."
Kubo Takehide's transfer destination has been narrowed down to five clubs in the Spanish first division (Tokyo Sports Web) - Yahoo! News
It seems that the transfer destination of Japan national team MF Kubo Takehide (19), who played for Mallorca in the Spanish first division this season, is gradually being narrowed down.
Although Majorca were relegated to the second division, Kubo's reputation soared due to his performance at the end of the season.
However, due to being outside the EU, it will be difficult for him to return to Real Madrid, which has "ownership rights," so he plans to play for another club next season.
Offers have already been received from about 30 clubs, but R Madrid plans to train warriors at domestic clubs.
The Spanish newspaper Marca reported that Real Sociedad, Villarreal, Granada, Getafe and Betis were the most likely transfer destinations for Kubo, and that "five clubs are interested in acquiring Kubo, but R Madrid wants a club that is in the middle of the league or higher."
Among them, Villarreal and R Sociedad will qualify for next season's European League (EL), and Granada will also participate from the second qualifying round of the EL, meeting the team requirements of R Madrid.
What kind of decision will the world's number one big club make to leave "Japan's treasure"?
