Honoka becomes [Minami Tanaka style hair]!
"CanCam.jp - Yahoo!
Add a layer to the heavy semi-long for fluffy hair
CanCam model Honoka said, "Of course it's beautiful, but I respect it because it's very professional!"
I asked Mitsuteru Asahi of the hair salon "SUNVALLY" in Omotesando, who actually works on Minami Tanaka's haircut, to give me "Mina Mina Real Hair."
Report on the cutting process!
Nogizaka 46 Yamashita Mitsuki, first cover with short hair!
First of all, check the hair before cutting.
Thin, soft and large.
I have a habit, and especially during the rainy season, I sometimes apply a straight perm because it gets dull.
A heavy semi-long with flowing bangs.
Cut finally starts!
First, lightly wet the whole to make it easier to cut.
After that, the top of the bee (the part above the protruding circumference of the head) is separated and cut from the bottom.
By the way, here are the points of hair that are close to you!
1 Table Bang By shortening the inside of the bangs a little, you can enjoy changes depending on the styling, such as slightly thicker when fully lowered, see-through when lightly divided.
2 Cut to make the most of your habit If you have a habit of having a lot of hair, it may spread out too much.
While discussing the balance around that, it is easy to handle but difficult to spread, and maintains a balance that makes your swell live.
3 Layer around the face and curly hair layer = cut with steps.
Adding a layer around the face makes it easier to move, creating a cute finish.
If you make your hair on the front and back of the temple and sideburns, it will look stylish even when you put it together quickly.
When I cut the hair on the bee that I had separated, it was around my face.
Pull the hair bundle on the upper part around the face forward and cut the hair tip slightly.
This way, when the hair bundle is lowered, there will be steps, making it easier to move (this is layer cutting).

"Governor Yoshimura to Partner with Gurunavi" (Sankei Sports) - Yahoo!
Osaka Governor Yoshimura Hirofumi (45) appeared remotely from the prefectural office on Osaka's ABC TV "Cast" (Monday - Friday, March 48) on the 20th, revealing that he is considering partnering with restaurant information website Gurunavi as part of measures to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus.
From the beginning of this month, Osaka Prefecture will issue "infection prevention declaration stickers" to businesses that comply with the guidelines in order to promote initiatives to prevent the spread of infection and provide peace of mind to citizens.
However, only 11,000 stores issue stickers in the prefecture, which is said to have more than 120,000 restaurants alone.
Governor Yoshimura said, "We are planning to do it at the end of the month, but we will form a partnership with Gurunavi and set up a store that issues declaration stickers when making a reservation so that you can understand it at the reservation stage."
He said, "The important thing is not to lump it together with 'Night Town.' We should clearly separate the restaurants that are taking measures against infectious diseases from the ones that are not, and it is important to make efforts to increase the number of restaurants that are doing it."
"Be careful when traveling to Yamanashi, Miyazaki, and Okinawa" "Be careful when traveling to Tokyo, Osaka, etc."
Nagano Prefecture said on Tuesday that the number of people infected with the new coronavirus is on the rise, and called on residents to "act carefully, including taking basic infection prevention measures," when traveling to Yamanashi, Miyazaki and Okinawa.
According to the prefecture, the number of new infections in Yamanashi, Miyazaki and Okinawa prefectures in the past week exceeded "1.0 per 100,000 people," so they are calling for "careful action such as thorough basic infection prevention measures" when traveling.
Hokkaido, Miyagi, Tochigi, Gifu, Hiroshima, Kagawa, Saga and Nagasaki prefectures, which have already surpassed the 1.0 figure, have made similar calls.
In addition, regarding travel to and from Tokyo, Saitama, Chiba, Kanagawa, Aichi, Shiga, Kyoto, Osaka, Hyogo, Nara, Wakayama, Fukuoka, and Kagoshima Prefectures, where the number of newly infected people in the last week exceeded "2.5 per 100,000," the government is calling for people to "carefully judge the necessity again and consider refraining from those at high risk of serious illness, such as the elderly." (As of July 25)

No. 4 Yasuda V, Toritani No 2 (Baseball King) - Yahoo!
In the first round of the tournament, the starting pitcher, Atsuki Taneichi, threw 136 pitches in nine innings, his first professional shutout in four years.
He won his third victory with the best shutout in the Pa League this season and stopped the team's losing streak at 2.
In the first round, Taneichi allowed Shohei Suzuki, the leader of the team, to hit second base to break the third base line, but immediately after that, he hit Sosuke Genda with three goro, and Masaru Suzuki, who was aiming for the advance, also touched out at third base.
Helped by the calm response of the friendly defense, he got through the rising pinch with zero, and after the second inning, he tossed the Seibu batting line with a combination of slider and fork, centering on the proud straight.
He kept improving and lined up zeros on the scoreboard.
The batting line was struggling to hit the opponent's starter Keisuke Honda, but Takeshi Kanno, the third batter in the first seven innings, went out with a walk, and Daikai Oka, the substitute, succeeded in stealing.
Yasuda Naonori, the fourth player, took this chance and hit a right-handed hit with a value of 1,000 gold.
Then, in the next eight innings, he attacked the opponent's third baseman Tetsu Miyagawa, and scored four goals at once, including a two-run left-center hit for the first time since Takashi Toritani's transfer.
He folded as if pushing the young ace candidate of the Marines and decided the game at once.
In the eighth inning, Taneichi finished with all three players, and he continued to play nine times over 100 balls.
In the end, he struck out the 10th strikeout of Spangenberg with a high straight.
He smiled with joy.
New operation to raise awareness of safety in cooperation with Tsuruoka police station and related organizations | Yamagata Shimbun
A collision experiment between a car and a bicycle was conducted at a bicycle class held as the start event of the operation = Shoko Gakuen Driving School in Tsuruoka City
Tsuruoka Police Station (Chief Keizo Sato) started the "Bye Bye Accident Zero Operation" in order to eliminate accidents involving bicycles and motorcycles, which have a high rate of occurrence in the jurisdiction in recent years.
In addition to promoting awareness of accident prevention with traffic safety organizations in the jurisdiction, the government will strengthen the crackdown on bicycle traffic rule violations.
There have been three traffic fatalities in the area this year, including the deaths of motorcyclists and cyclists.
Although the number of accidents is on a decreasing trend, the rate of accidents involving bicycles is about 11.7% as of June 30, and about 5.8% of accidents involving motorcycles, both of which are higher than the prefectural average.
In particular, the incidence of bicycle accidents in the past five years has often exceeded the prefectural average, and we planned a strategy to overcome this situation.
The name of the operation was a combination of the words "I" and "I" to eliminate accidents.
Related organizations will be encouraged more than ever to provide driving guidance to the elderly and use night light reflective materials in traffic safety classes.
The station issues yellow cards (guidance warning tickets) to warn people when cracking down.
The opening ceremony of the operation was held on the 21st at Shoko Gakuen Driving School in Tsuruoka City.
About 30 people were in attendance, and Chief Sato said, "I would like to ask for your cooperation to reduce even one tragic accident."
A representative from the station presented the policy and the activities of each organization.
A bicycle class was held as the start of the operation.
A police officer in a car demonstrated how the impact on a bicycle differs between a collision with a bicycle by applying the brake and a collision at about 55 km / h without stepping on the brake.
Kinuchi Koichi, chairman of the Tsuruoka District Regional Traffic Safety Activities Promotion Committee, said, "I realized once again the horror of traffic accidents, and I would like to call attention not only to the elderly but also to young people."

At the request of a vassal who has been ordered to abstain from alcohol by the lord, Kisuke shows off "Prohibition Banya," in which a liquor store that tries to bring sake has a humorous exchange with the gatekeeper.
The sharp way he spoke and the way he drank sake deliciously made me laugh many times.
A company employee (58) from Naka-ku, Okayama, who visited with his wife, said with a smile, "The way he talked and took time was exquisite, and I was immediately drawn in."
Kisuke said, "It was my first performance in a while and my voice was not in the right tone, but it was a fulfilling time."
Guest rakugo performer Katsura Kotome (31) from Osaka City and magic group Tsuyama Magic Club also appeared.
Owarai Akasaka-tei opened in 1996 in the former Akasaka-cho as the first public yose in Japan.
They continued to hold regular yose and demae yose once a month, but due to the new Corona, they cancelled their yose after their performance in February this year.

He was one of the few non-ruling governors in Russia, but was detained by security officials on the 9th this month.

Butler once again praises Tyler Hero, the future of the Heat "The way of thinking is not that of a rookie" (Basketball Count) - Yahoo!
Photo: Getty Images The Heat's scrimmage (practice) first game against the Kings.
Duncan Robinson scored a team-high 18 points in the 104-98 win, followed by Tyler Hero with 15 points.
Robinson, one of the best shooters in the league, and the 13th-overall draft rookie, Hero, will step up to the plate for the Heat.
Hero missed 15 games in February and March with an ankle injury, and his last game of the season was against the Hornets on March 12.
"I had plenty of time to get back to 100 percent, which is the best feeling I've ever felt," Hero said, but his scrimmage performance was more convincing than words.
The late arrival of starting point guard Kendrick Nunn gave Hero more playing time, and he took advantage of the opportunity.
It's worth it because he's scored 15 goals in an extraordinary role.
Jimmy Butler, the team leader, once again praised the "favorite" hero.
"He can be a handler, he can score, he can defend. He's a player who can do everything for the team. He can play any position because his mentality is not that of a rookie. He's looking at the footage, studying it, figuring out where his teammates are going and how they're going to be free and what he's going to do about it."
Even before the start of the season, Butler liked his hero's rookie spirit and stoic approach to basketball.
That's why I invited him to private practice starting at 4am and trained with him.
Butler once said, "He gives his opinion to everyone and doesn't back down, and I respect that kind of fighting spirit."
The butler is the type who always says what he thinks, and if he thinks it will benefit the team, he will give harsh opinions knowing that conflicts will occur.
In the past, his relationship with his teammates deteriorated.
Butler may be a hero to his youth.
Butler's personality, which is sometimes too harsh on his teammates, is a good guide for those with the guts to follow.
If the teacher-student relationship between the two, who respect each other, spreads throughout the team, the Heat will be able to aim higher.

He added two more points with infield goro and squeeze.
Saito, the starter, pitched well with only one hit in the sixth inning and no runs.
Hamamatsu Johokko did not take advantage of the opportunity of the final two deaths.
3 years led the 4th round
2 years, Matsuura, thanks first
It was the fourth time in two years, his first appearance this summer, that he failed his opponent.
Matsuura of Shimada Sho hit the ball at the first deadless base and carried it to the left.
"If I lose for three years, I retire immediately. I wanted to hit and win."
The talented player who played 4th last fall was proud.
In the first three rounds, they fought mainly for three years, and in the two years when they had power, they were in reserve.
Ikeda gathered the players at a meeting and told Nine, "The past three years have connected us. From now on, we will go with the best team."
On this day, four of the nine starting players solidified their core in two years.
It may seem cruel, but it is proof that he is committed to serious competition.
Matsuura said, "From now on, the level of the opposing pitcher will also increase, and I will go with the intention of returning the runner."
Saito, who pitched in a row, pitched well, limiting the sixth inning to one hit, and did not even step on second base, showing his pride for three years.
The number 10 shirt has been well received as a synergy, saying, "Two years will inspire me for three years. If it leads to victory."
The team, which is aiming to finish in the top four for the third consecutive year, including the Shizuoka tournament until last year, has no intention of making memories in the remaining games.
16 musicians from Fukushima Prefecture gather in the world (Fukushima Minpo) - Yahoo!
I want to deliver the energetic singing of Hama, Naka and Aizu to the world.
Sixteen musicians associated with Fukushima Prefecture gathered to create a message song.
The lyrics describe Fukushima Prefecture's dedication to fighting the new coronavirus as it moves toward recovery from the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident.
The "complete version" will be completed by next summer, the 10th anniversary of the earthquake, with the voices of the citizens of the prefecture.
The song was released on YouTube.
The title of the song is "Play from Fukushima."
The cheerful melody expresses people's positive attitude and desire to "convey it from Fukushima."
Due to the influence of the new Corona, the live house that was the base of music activities was forced to close, and many musicians lost the place to sing and perform.
In order to believe in the power of music when the future is uncertain, a singer-songwriter living in Minamisoma City, Mr. Nappo (46), and Mr. Dazuo (37) of the music group "Mexicali Boys" in Iwaki City planned the event.
Nappo will write and compose the music, and Dazuo will rap.
When the project started in March of the Corona disaster, singer and songwriter Manami (28) and Jun Kanno (38) from Fukushima City agreed one after another, and the circle quickly expanded.
Nappo says with a blank look on his face, "We have a gorgeous lineup that would be unthinkable in normal times, and I want to fully enjoy this opportunity."
As a measure against infection, there was no opportunity for 16 people to gather, and each recorded at a live house or home.
To support the project, Koa, a painter from Iwaki City, drew the image character.
In the shape of Fukushima Prefecture, blue and green express the rich natural climate.
The finished song will be sent to the world via YouTube, with the aim of making it into a CD.
Next year marks the tenth anniversary of the earthquake, and the postponed Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics are scheduled to be held.
Dazuo said, "We have a lot to carry as we have overcome difficulties, and I hope releasing a song at a milestone will encourage many people."

"I want to know quickly where and what disasters and accidents occurred!"
There is a strong need for this not only in news organizations such as television and newspapers, but also in many companies such as social infrastructure companies and municipalities.
Spectee, an AI-driven information analysis company, has developed a service that responds to this.
Photo An alert from Specty allows a team of experts to determine the authenticity of social media information
Today, the first means for people to know about disasters and accidents is shifting from television to online information (social media).
Social media such as Twitter has become an important medium for disseminating information immediately after a disaster or accident.
However, it is difficult to manually monitor the overflowing information and extract useful information from it.
Specty detects and analyzes information related to natural disasters and accidents from social media such as Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, determines the authenticity of the information, and distributes it to users.
It is a crisis management support service that visualizes various crises occurring in Japan and overseas.
At the time of the Kumamoto Earthquake in April 2016, NHK was the first major use case of Specty.
More than 350 companies in Japan, including television stations, newspapers and other news organizations, as well as companies that support social infrastructure such as electricity, gas and transportation, and local governments across the country, are currently using Specty.
■ Analyze posts to determine the type and location of the crisis
Spectrum distributes information in four steps: Collection of information, analysis and classification, titling, and authenticity.
The user company should specify in advance the area (prefecture, city, ward, town, village, etc.) where information is collected and the category of crisis (disaster, accident, etc.).
Spectrum collects posts corresponding to the designation using APIs provided by social media.
They then analyze and classify the text, images and videos in the collected posts.
For example, if a video shows a fire truck, black smoke rising from a building, and orange flames coming from a room, it is classified as a "fire."
In addition, images of overturned cars are classified as "traffic accidents," and images of flooded roads are classified as "road flooding."
Spectrum also estimates the location of disasters and accidents.
"We often don't know the location from posts, so we combine various information to estimate," says Murakami.
For example, if a road sign or sign appears in an image or video, information on place names is extracted from it and compared with a place name database to identify the location.

On July 24 (local time), Shohei Otani (26) of the Angels started the opening game against the Athletics in enemy territory as the "3rd designated hitter."
In the first round, he hit his first hit of the season, but after four at-bats, he had one hit in five at-bats and struck out one.
In the third inning, Otani faced Montana again at first base.
In the third at-bat of the fifth inning, which was 1-1, he faced Pettit, the second right hand, at first base and also collapsed.
In the fourth at-bat of the eighth inning, with a 2-1 lead, he faced Diekman, the fifth batter.
He bounced the second ball straight back at a good angle in the opposite direction, but it didn't fence-over and he fell to the left.
In the bottom of the eighth inning, the Angels took a one-run lead, but Batley, their right hand man, lost two points and allowed them to reverse.
They tied 3-3 at the last minute.
After that, he had two hits and two bases, and his batting order was second trout.
The Athletics bench shunned Trout and chose the Otani game with two dead bases.
Otani was expected to win, but struck out three balls in front of Hendrix, the guardian of the Athletics.
The game was not settled in the 9th inning, and the game went into extra time starting with an undefeated second base, an exception this season.
Otani was the last batter in the 9th inning, so he became a second baseman.
In the top of the 10th inning, the Angels' first baseman, Walsh, hit a devastating first base, but first baseman Olson, who caught the ball, threw it to third base.
Sandwiched between second and third base, Otani was a touchout.
The Angels then had two hits, but in the end Simmons fell to the ground.
On the other hand, the Angels were in a pinch at third base with Robles hitting a dead ball and a wild pitch.
At this point, the new manager Maddon made a shift to reduce the infield to five players, but Robles walked the 4th Davis with a walk and full base.
Milner, who was replaced by his left arm, was sent to the right seat with a grand slam to say goodbye to Olson.

Heavy rain is expected to fall in Nagano Prefecture on the 26th, mainly in the southern part of the prefecture.
In Takaki Village, the closed prefectural road has been washed away, and residents are isolated again.
Sandbags and temporary bridges were drunk and washed away by the swollen river.
Just after 3: 00 a.m., a surveillance camera installed by the prefectural Iida construction office in Takaki village captured it.
This road was built on the riverbed instead of the prefectural road that was closed due to a landslide, and from the 17th it was only accessible to residents' cars.
As a result, 56 people from 33 households in the Oshima area have been isolated again, and Iida Construction Office wants to start restoration work as soon as the water recedes.
Warm and moist air flows towards the baiu front, and heavy rain of more than 30 mm per hour is expected to fall in some areas of the prefecture until the 26th.

"Cheating crowd" and "Uchinchi" don't work...?
"I thought it was not a dialect" - Yahoo!
I am from Chiba Prefecture near Tokyo.
I have lived in the same prefecture for nearly 30 years.
When I used "cheating crowded," which means "sideways entry," in a conversation with a friend at university (Tokyo), it was instantly dismissed.
They understood the meaning through the flow and sense of the word, but the citizens of Tokyo and Saitama told me not to use it.
It's true that "cheating crowded = cheating and crossing?"
Since it seems to be connected, the meaning can be inferred.
And then another.
I didn't notice this when it was pointed out, but the expression "Uchinchi," which means "my house," was never used even when I read books, and I didn't hear it from my friends.
What was "Uchinchi"?
I use it in my hometown (Gunma Prefecture), but I didn't notice it because I naturally stopped using it as an adult...
Japanese "chilled Chinese" is not popular with Chinese...?
"Cold Noodle Dishes" - Yahoo!
Chilled in China Chinese noodles are "Japanese-style cold noodles"
As mentioned at the beginning, chilled Chinese cuisine is a Chinese cuisine (Japanese-style Chinese cuisine) that originated in Japan, invented based on Chinese "chilled mixed soba."
Therefore, although it does not originally exist in China, it has come to be seen in Japanese restaurants in summer due to the diversification of food.
Recently, Japanese convenience stores have also introduced arranged products titled "Japanese style soba cool mask / soba chilled Chinese" and "Kawakodori shiryo mask / Sichuan style chicken chilled Chinese."
On the other hand, Japanese Chinese cuisine is not generally popular in China, pushed by popular Chinese cuisine such as Sichuan cuisine and Hunan cuisine.
Naturally, the seasoning of Japanese-style Chinese is often familiar to Chinese people.
Therefore, although it is not bad, if it has little impact, it tends to be criticized.
"Chilled Chinese" is no exception and is still a minor presence in China.
By the way, the name of chilled Chinese noodles in China is' Japanese-style cold noodles. '
It is recognized by Chinese as a Japanese dish.
The standard summer dish is ryampi.
In China, the noodle dish that feels summer is "Liangpi."
In Japan, many people may not be familiar with it, but Liangqi is a flat noodle made from flour, rice flour, starch, etc. that originated in Shanxi Province.
It is said to be 2,000 years old.
It is a standard B-grade gourmet sold at street stalls, and the price is very reasonable, around 10-20 yuan (150-300 yen).
It contains the word 'Ryo,' but it is not covered with ice like Japanese chilled Chinese food.
Rather, temperature is basic.
The noodles are topped with ingredients of your choice, such as shredded cucumbers, carrots and boiled bean sprouts, and condiments such as coriander, chili pepper, ginger and garlic are added.
Finally, a special seasoning mixed with soy sauce, chili oil, vinegar, sesame paste and peanut paste is added.
The noodles are smooth and smooth, and the spicy sauce, which is refreshing and rich in acidity, is well entwined.
In addition, since it has spread throughout China, there are various toppings and seasonings, and the variety of variations is also a characteristic of Ryokan and one way to enjoy it.

"Cold water shower" benefits body and mind (Cosmopolitan) - Yahoo!
Reduces inflammation like muscle pain
The study, published in The North American Journal of Medical Sciences, looked at the effectiveness of hydrotherapy, a form of water-based therapy that has been shown to provide both physical and mental healing.
Being exposed to cold water after exercise can help reduce muscle pain and other inflammatory effects.
"It's important to exercise and take a cold shower for as little time as possible," said Douglas Casa, director of the Korey Stringer Institute for Sports Medicine and a professor at the University of Connecticut. "Getting your body temperature down as soon as you move can help you recover from inflammation and fatigue caused by exercise."
Reduces fatigue
Exercising in high temperatures causes the heart, muscles and skin to need more blood flow than normal.
"When you're exercising, your heart rate goes up, so there's more blood flow to the heart, you need more energy to contract the muscles, so there's more muscle blood flow, and when it comes to the skin, there's more blood flowing in to regulate body temperature," says Professor Casa.
"A cold shower lowers the temperature of the skin, reducing the flow of blood to the skin. Instead, it sends blood to internal organs such as the gastrointestinal tract, making it easier to get water and nutrients after exercise. As a result, it reduces the fatigue you feel after exercise."
Expect hormesis effect
Dorozevsky explains that exposure to cold water can activate the hormesis effect.
The hormesis effect is the idea that it is better to have a little bit of harmful substances and stress than no matter what.
"Hypoxic exercise, petit fasting, and cold water showers are prime examples of the hormesis effect on health, which stimulates hormones and neurotransmitters to increase physical strength and resilience."
Shizuoka Prefecture sports supporters commission two bicycle teams | Shizuoka Shimbun at S
Hirano players (center) and others receiving commissions from Fujinokuni sports supporters = Oyama-cho
On the 24th, Shizuoka Prefecture commissioned two cycling teams in the eastern part of the prefecture as "Fujinokuni Sports Supporters" to help promote sports in the prefecture.
Team Bridgestone Cycling based in Mishima City and Levante Fuji Shizuoka based in Fuji City.
Seiya Hirano of Team Bridgestone Cycling, who received a commission plate from Governor Heita Kawakatsu at Fuji Speedway in Oyama Town, expressed his aspirations, saying, "I want to work as a team to liven up cycling with the citizens of the prefecture."
Levante Fuji Shizuoka received the commission plate from Executive Officer Shuichi Shimizu and Regional Strategy Office Manager.
Hanshin Oyama, 2 games in a row, 7!
"Yano" (Sankei Sports).
(Se League, Chunichi 2-5 Hanshin, 7th round, Hanshin 4-3, 24th, Nagoya D) The momentum of 4th place does not stop.
The ball flew high and landed in the middle of the left seat.
Oyama made two consecutive arches and went around the diamond.
When I returned to the bench, I saw white teeth.
"While I had a good swing, I was able to narrow down my target and swing decisively."
In the fourth inning of 0-2, he batted first.
He swung aggressively from the first ball and the second after the foul.
I didn't miss Ono's sweet 134kg slider.
The ball he hit with his core was so perfect that he was convinced to stand in the moment he hit it.
The first shot in two consecutive games following the game against Hiroshima (Koshien) on the 23rd the day before was a signal of counterattack.
It was also a valuable shot from an opponent I was not good at.
When he faced Ohno Yu at Koshien on the 17th, he had nine hits and four points.
However, in the case of Nagoya Dome, they have allowed seven wins, one loss and one hold in their past 12 games, and have been suffering from seven consecutive losses since August 23, 2013 after a draw.
From such a difficult opponent, he scored his first goal in 23 innings at Nagoya Dome (even dropping out in the middle was counted as one inning) with a dynamic shot and did not pass the flow of the game.
Coach Yano also expressed his hopes for further explosions, saying, "Being able to finish a sweet ball well is a high level. It has a style to watch, and there is an atmosphere even if the timing of hitting is a foul. I think he will still hit."
He hit right in the first inning, which marked his sixth consecutive hit and third consecutive multiple hits.
He started the season as a backup, but his seven home runs and 16 RBI have already worked perfectly as the team's top and fourth.
We're going to keep getting results to win.

"The Seven Dwarfs of Rugby" - Yahoo!
Iwabuchi Kensuke, head coach of the Japan men's national rugby sevens team, told reporters online on the 25th that he was determined to "unite and work towards winning the medal that is our goal" for the Tokyo Olympics, which have been postponed to next year.
Following the postponement of the Olympics, Yusaku Kuwazuru (Coca-Cola), captain of the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics team, and Kenki Fukuoka (Panasonic), who also played an active role in the 2019 World Cup with 15 players, left the team.
The commander said, "Of course it will have a big impact, but we will move forward with players we can compete with."
From this day, the team will be divided into Tokyo and Oita and will start training camps for national team candidates.
The training camp, which involves accommodation, will be held until the 28th for the first time since March, but they will not practice with contact as a measure to prevent infection with the new coronavirus.
The national team has decided to return to the top group, which will be able to participate in all games of the seven-player World Series (WBS) from next season, but due to uncertainty about the holding of the WBS itself, which will compete around the world, Iwabuchi HC revealed that they are negotiating a strengthening match by narrowing down their opponents to countries that allow the national team to enter.

Macau Casino Regulatory Authority inspects the implementation of epidemic prevention measures at casino facilities... Mandatory presentation of new coronavirus negative certificate at admission (Macau Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
About 40 casino facilities in Macau were closed for 15 days from February 5 to 19 due to the new Corona-Uyl Infection (COVID-19) epidemic, but reopened after 20 February with strict epidemic prevention measures.
The Macau Casino Regulatory Authority (DICJ) requires the operating company to provide maximum protection for the health of employees and guests when reopening the casino, and to reduce the risk of cross-infection by stipulating that the distance between gaming (casino) tables should be secured, that table games should be seated next to each other (for example, at the Baccarat table, only three to four people can sit at one table at a time), and that slot machines should be operated every one or two.
Disinfection of gaming equipment such as chips has also been strengthened.
Guests are also required to wear a mask, check their temperature, and present a valid health code (generated by entering their most recent stay, contact with a new Corona patient, symptoms such as fever and cough, and contact information) upon entry.
From midnight on July 15, it was also a condition to present a new coronavirus nucleic acid test negative certificate (limited to those within the validity period issued by a licensed facility in Macau or Guangdong).
The reason for the new requirement to present a negative certificate is the relaxation of border control measures between Macau and Guangdong Province (abolition of quarantine and quarantine for 14 days, with various conditions) from 6: 00 a.m. on the 15th, which is a preventive measure accompanying this.
The DICJ announced on July 18 that, in response to the change in admission conditions from July 15, the Director General of the DICJ, He Hohan (Adriano Ho), and others, had inspected the implementation of epidemic prevention measures at casino facilities, and held a meeting with representatives of the security departments of the six casino operators, asking them to protect the health of employees and guests by thoroughly controlling guest admission.
The DICJ said that it will continue to conduct strict patrols of casino facilities and will have regular meetings with the operating company in accordance with the situation and assessment, and will adjust epidemic prevention measures at casinos as appropriate in accordance with guidelines from the Government Health Bureau.
Hayashimatsu, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the Health Bureau, and others accompanied the delegation to the casino facility, where they were given instructions on how to disinfect gaming (casino) chips and keep a safe distance between seats of electronic casino equipment.
Due to the sharp decline in inbound passengers due to measures to prevent disease, including restrictions on entry, casino sales for the first six months of this year decreased 77.4% from the same period of the previous year to 33.72 billion macao pataca (equivalent to about 451.9 billion yen).
A Message to Medical Professionals Instead of Bonbori Festival Next Month - Yahoo! News
At Yuwaku Onsen, where the annual Yuwaku Bonbori Festival has been cancelled due to the new coronavirus, efforts will begin on August 1st to light bonbori with messages of support for medical professionals.
About 350 bottles of paper written by fans and local residents from all over the country will be affixed to wrap the hot spring town in the light of ale and deliver healing to visitors.
The Bonbori Festival is an event that reproduces the festival that appears in the anime "Hana Saku Iroha" modeled on Yuwaku Onsen, and is organized by the Yuwaku Onsen Tourist Association.
It began in 2011 when the anime was broadcast, and many anime fans visit every year from all over Japan.
Every year, from the lighting ceremony in July to the main festival in October, bonbori are lit up on the stairs leading to Yuwaku Inari Shrine next to the soyu.
This year, the festival was forced to be cancelled due to the new Corona, but fans from the local area and all over the country said that it was sad that there were no bonbori in the summer of Yuwaku, so the association came up with this project.
The "Recovery Campaign" was launched with the aim of helping to heal and recover the world that is in dire straits due to the Corona Disaster.
So far, about 50 students from Yuwaku Elementary School and Shibahara Junior High School have been asked to write messages with illustrations, and more than 100 applications have been received from all over Japan.
If you purchase the message form from the association's website, fill it out, put it in a reply envelope and send it to the association, you can receive a photo of it attached to a bonbori and lit.
For 6,000 yen per set, applications will be accepted until there are about 350 bonbori.
The bonbori will be lit until the end of November.
Yamashita Shinichiro (48), who has been the chairman of the festival's executive committee since the first festival, said, "Reading the messages encourages us, and we want to hold a grand festival next year that marks the 10th anniversary."
For the campaign, we also prepared original illustrations of blooming Iroha characters and Asanogawa Ohashi Bridge.
From the 1st, clear files with illustrations will be sent to special accommodation plan users at ryokan in Yuwaku Onsen.
Core 4 supporting Seibu "Gegen Moriyama" is soul cooperation (Tospo Web) - Yahoo!
Seibu's proud "Moriyama Gaigen" showed a spirit of cooperation and produced the second Sayonara victory this season.
In the match against Lotte (MetLife) on the 24th, the four players, who were still far from their best, showed their obsession with winning in the ninth inning, 2-2.
Genda went from safety bunt to first base with head sliding.
Then, in the last six games, Mori, who is at the bottom with a batting average of 10%, 8 minutes and 2 rin, sent a bunt and killed one second.
Yamakawa, the 4th player, was shunned, and Sotozaki, who replaced Mori and returned to the 5th player from that day, shattered Masuda's ball, leading to a 3-2 victory.
Hero Sotozaki said, "(Genda's safety) was unexpected even for me on the bench, and I thought I had no choice but to do something about it. I could feel that Tomoya also believed in me behind with a bunt and connected me. Yamakawa shunned me and told me to 'be proactive!' Before going to first base, so I was able to get my feelings into it," and he expressed his gratitude to the three people who made the farewell flow.
Mori and Yamakawa, who were first and second in the 2013 draft, Sotozaki, who was third in 2014, and Genda, who was third in 2016, are the "Core 4" fielders that team officials call "our heart right now."
All of them have experience as captains when they were amateurs, and their sense of responsibility is second to none.
Sotozaki, who took over as captain from Yamakawa in his fourth year at Fuji University, said, "Mr. Yamakawa is a captain who leads the team with words because he is good at talking. On the other hand, I am not good at talking, so I left the talk to the vice captain who is good at talking, and I was the type to stand behind."
Director Tsuji praised the spirit of "Moriyama Gogen," saying, "Genda's safety? That's not a sign, but I thought, 'Yeah, I can go' with that. Tomoya was also a great bunt. Sotozaki hit well."
All four of them are currently struggling with a batting average of 20% to 4-5 minutes, but they support the team with the wisdom to win even if they can't.

Image of Omura Masujiro to Suzenji | Ube Daily
On the 23rd, a bronze statue of Omura Masujiro (1825-69), one of the ten heroes of the Restoration, appeared in his birthplace, Suzenji, Yamaguchi.
An unveiling ceremony was held in the front yard of the Suzenji Community Exchange Center, where local and government officials celebrated its completion.
Masujiro was a military scholar, a scholar of Western studies, and a doctor in the late Edo period and the Meiji Restoration.
After teaching at 'Bansho Shirabesho,' a research and educational institution of Western studies of the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), he opened a private school 'Kyukyodo' in Edo and taught Western studies, military science and medicine.
Even after he returned to Choshu Domain, he gave lectures on military science at Yamaguchi Meirinkan.
The statue focused on Masujiro as a teacher.
He stood by the globe, held a calligraphy in his hand, and gave a lecture on Western studies.
The statue, which combines the pedestals, is about 3 meters high (1.55 meters), and is said to have been made from the perspective of a disciple attending Masujiro's lectures.
It was designed by local designer Takami Marie (27), a descendant of Masujiro's wife Kotoko.
It was built by the Omura Masujiro 150th Anniversary Project Executive Committee (Chairman Okamoto Satoshi), whose parent organization is the Suzenji Community Association, seeking donations.
Approximately 12.8 million yen was raised from 1,104 people nationwide.

The money will be used to maintain the statue.
Chairman Okamoto said, "Masujiro, who kept his aspirations high and made a great contribution as an educator, is the pride of his hometown, and the statue will be the hope of local children who will lead the future."

Online art museum "Hasard" Konno (from Hachinohe) launched (Daily Tohoku Shimbun) - Yahoo!
There is a museum where anyone can touch art for free.
They range from famous painters such as Claude Monet and Gustav Klimt to unknown artists in Japan.
Since its opening in April 2019, the online museum "HASARD" has captured the hearts of users for its convenience and newness, and its attention has further increased with the new lifestyle caused by the Corona disaster.
Shinnosuke Konno (26), a representative from Hachinohe City who launched the website and lives in Tokyo, says, "I wanted to create a service where everyone can easily enjoy art.
What surprises me when I visit Azar is the abundance of exhibits and the beauty of the images.
As of the 24th, a total of 14 exhibitions, both permanent and special, are open to the public.
Membership registration and admission fees are not required, and it is characterized by no cost not only for viewers but also for artists who want to hold solo exhibitions.
The unique online presentation also attracts attention.
Moving pictures is one of them.
In Claude Monet's permanent exhibition "It starts moving again," he digitally processes clouds, flowers and grasslands to move.
Konno says, "I want to make it possible for people who are not interested in art to enter," so you can feel like you are in a picture.
The encounter of art with the representative of Konno was in elementary school.
At that time, when I visited the newly completed Aomori Museum of Art with my family, I saw three huge paintings of Marc Chagall's "Aleko" and was shocked by their power.
From the next day, art classes changed to a fun time, and even after moving to Tokyo to go to university, he began visiting galleries.
At the same time, I felt that many people do not have many opportunities to interact with art from various perspectives, such as not having a museum nearby, large exhibitions are only held in the Tokyo metropolitan area, and it is difficult to go out due to childcare.
While working at an IT company, he spent about two months launching a website where people can appreciate art on the Internet.
The number of users reached an average of 10,000 a month in the first 10 months, and increased to about 30,000 after the new Corona infection spread.
If anyone can appreciate art freely when they want to see it.
Other's aim was unexpectedly accepted by more people due to the Corona disaster.
Konno emphasized the significance of art appreciation, saying it enriches the imagination.
"When you have a rich imagination, you can help people in need.
I want a better society by making art more accessible. "

On the business side, there is a possibility that the changes mentioned in the July 8 article, "In fact, the jobs of 'managers' are starting to disappear in Japan...!

In terms of the spirit, the article on June 26, "The Guide to Complete Burning," which is given to people who have become conscious of the end of their lives in Corona, "and the article on June 10," Corona, now full of riots, let's reconsider the utility of 'asking God in times of hardship' "are likely to become mainstream.
What we can clearly see as a combination of these two "materials (economy and business)" and "spirit" is the major trend from "Chinese quality to Japanese quality."
For example, it would be infuriating if a T-shirt or digital camera was defective or defective, but the life of the person who purchased it is not different.
On the other hand, the sloppy quality of masks and ventilators made in China, which have recently become a hot topic... "Chinese quality" in products directly linked to life and safety is fatal.
No matter how cheap, such products cannot be purchased.
They will demand "Japanese quality" products even at a considerable price.
Of course, this trend is not unique to Japan.
It is clear from the fact that Western countries, which were in a difficult situation due to a shortage of masks and medical equipment, returned one after another because of the "Chinese quality."
Safer than cheaper
Products such as cars are also products whose defects can be fatal (death by accident).
No matter how much China, South Korea, and other countries launch an offensive with the strategy of "cheap or bad," they will not be able to compete with Japanese products in the end, and the situation described in the article on June 16, "Will the world's automobile manufacturers bow down to Toyota?" Is because "Japanese quality" is strongly required for automobile products.
The pandemic also served as a reminder that many other products must be safe and secure.
Safety and security are important not only for "Japanese quality in manufacturing" but also for "Japanese quality in logistics and other services."
Like the toilet paper scandal, there are cases where production capacity is in place but intermediate distribution is delayed and cannot be reached.
Furthermore, as in the article on April 17, "Who is the real culprit of the lack of masks? Do not forgive the theft of fire sites by the Chinese Communist Party government," self-sufficiency in Japan was also an important element of "security and safety."
In the event of an emergency, it is natural for any country to prioritize its own country, and it is very important to be able to procure essential items such as masks (medical equipment) and food within its own country.
More than 100 new corona infections in South Korea in 115 days (Yonhap News) - Yahoo!
SEOUL, South Korea (Reuters) - The number of people infected with a new type of coronavirus rose to 14,092 as of midnight on Tuesday, the country's central disease control headquarters said.
It was the first time in 115 days since April 1 (101) that the number of new infections exceeded 100 per day.
In addition to 32 seafarers found to be infected on a Russian ship entering Busan Port, 32 of the 293 workers who returned from Iraq on the 24th tested positive.
The number of new infections in South Korea was in the range of 30-60 except for the 20th (26).
Of the new infections announced on January 25, 86 came from overseas, the highest number since January 20, when the first infection occurred in Korea.
The largest number of arrivals came from Iraq (36), with 34 from Russia, five from the Philippines and three from the US.
On the other hand, 27 people were infected in the city, 11 in Seoul and Gyeonggi-do, and 5 in Busan.
The five in Busan were employees of a repair company on board a Russian ship.
The death toll remained unchanged from the previous day, at 298.

White paint from Teflon frying pans turns out to enhance cooling effect with insulation!
No way!
This year, it was the rainy season with an unusually high amount of rainfall, but the extremely hot summer will be in full swing when it comes tomorrow.
It was so hot and hot that even the air conditioning was not effective... just imagining it makes you wonder, right?
Global warming is a major global problem, and humanity has been working on how to overcome the hot summer with a little comfort.
One way is to wear thin white clothes.
See, you don't have to go out of your way to wear heat-absorbing black in the summer, do you?
The same principle is applied to the construction of houses, and white paint is increasingly used.
Even if white is white, the latest research field was whether it could be made into a paint that reflects light more and does not absorb heat.
Now, researchers at the Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), in collaboration with researchers at Columbia University's School of Applied Physics and Mathematics, have found a way to blend white paint that can most efficiently repel solar heat and increase the cooling effect inside buildings.
They aim for early commercialization.
Until now, the white paint with the highest reflectivity of sunlight has been made of titanium oxide, which has a reflectivity of 85 percent.
White paint using titanium oxide has already been applied to the roofs of buildings in high-temperature environments to help block solar heat and increase cooling efficiency.
However, what was newly discovered was a white paint derived from the fluorine resin of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) used in Teflon processed frying pans.
It is a white paint that applies this Teflon effect and reflects sunlight up to 98%, making it possible to significantly cut heat.
Even in the hot summer, thanks to the white paint using Teflon, it is easy to spend time indoors without being exposed to the heat.
That time may be coming, right?
I feel that the roofs of Japanese houses are often dark, but in the future, white will become mainstream?
When is Amazon's annual sale?
Amazon.com has announced the postponement of its annual "Prime Day" sale, CNBC reported on July 21.
It is held every July, but this year it was reported that it had to be postponed due to the spread of new coronavirus.
■ Spokesperson, "More details will be announced shortly," an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement.
"Prime Day has become a special celebration event that we have been looking forward to for the past five years, and this year it will be held later than usual while ensuring employee safety and supporting customers and retailers."
However, he did not give a specific date, stating that "details will be announced soon."
On the other hand, I decided to hold it in India.
Press release posted on the country's website.
It will be held for 48 hours from midnight on August 6.
Prime Day has been held simultaneously around the world, but this year it may take an unusual step.
■ Large-scale event to sell 760 billion yen in two days Amazon started this large-scale sale for members in 2015 as a sales promotion measure during the summer when sales were declining.
It was originally a 24-hour event, but has expanded year by year, and last year it was held for 48 hours from midnight on July 15 in 18 countries including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, India, Japan, China and Australia.
Last year, the company said, its two-day sales surpassed those of its predecessors on Black Friday (the first day of the holiday shopping season) and Cyber Monday (the following Monday).
The event has also contributed to the acquisition of new subscribers to the paid membership "Prime," and last year the number of applications on the first day was the highest in one day, followed by the next day.
Last year, the company sold 175 million products worldwide.
Online retailer Internet Retailer said total global sales for the two days were $7.16 billion, up 70 percent from a year earlier.
Strict eyes on mobile number migration and excessive retention.
What about fees and points?
Yahoo!
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) is in the process of reviewing the MNP system, which allows users to use their existing phone number when changing mobile communications companies.
At a meeting of experts on the 21st, it announced its intention to revise the MNP guidelines established in 2004.
Specific issues include the MNP fee and the pros and cons of retaining those who wish to move.
With opposition from telecommunications companies expected, attention is focused on whether this will promote healthy market competition.
In 2006, when MNP was introduced, the user fee was 2,000 yen, but now it is 3,000 yen.
The MNP fee revenue of the three major mobile communications companies is estimated to be 15.9 billion yen annually.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) listed the current situation surrounding MNP at the Working Group on Verification of Competition Rules (WG), an expert meeting to discuss the competitive environment in the telecommunications market.
The time required to issue MNP reservation numbers when consumers move to other telecommunications companies was also a success.
Major telecommunications companies accept applications on the web, but due to the convenience of operating core systems, the acceptance time is mainly from 9 to 20: 00.
In the WG document, it was clearly stated that, in principle, all-day correspondence would be the direction of future consideration.
There is also a problem with mobile phone companies offering points to people who want to move out of the MNP to keep them.
It was judged that excessive retention could hinder fair competition.
Shunichi Kita, a partner at Nomura Research Institute, who is a member of the working group, suggests, "It is important to get permission from users to give them time to explain the provision of economic benefits, and to immediately issue a number to users who do not give permission.
However, among a series of issues, there is a structural problem that "the higher the MNP fee, the less customers will flow out, so it is difficult to motivate them to actively lower it" (a person in charge of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications).
There is also concern that if some businesses take the initiative in lowering MNP fees, the outflow of customers from those companies will increase and corporate efforts will not be rewarded.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) also points out that many countries overseas do not require user fees for MNP, and it is possible that this will happen in Japan.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) will compile a report on the results of the WG in September and October, and then begin the process of revising the MNP Guidelines.
The time frame for the amendment is likely to be after 2021.
Mobile carriers are likely to have their heads in the sand over sales and customer support.
Chunichi, Katsuno, no points in six innings (Sankei Sports)
Chunichi pitcher Katsuno Shokei (23) started the 8th round of Hanshin (Nagoya Dome) on 25th.
He had four hits and no runs in six innings.
"I had a pitch last time, so I thought it was my last chance to throw. I had a foreball, but I was able to compete with my opponent without worrying too much."
In his first game of the season and the previous game against Hanshin (Koshien) on the 18th, he struggled with control of both starts and dropped out by the fourth inning.
Unable to play the role of starter, this time it was a backwater mound to survive the first team.
This time, he was bullish with a ball full of emotion against a fierce tiger batting line that was doing well.
When a straight ball ran in the late 140kg range, I was able to effectively use change balls such as count balls.
In the sixth inning, he was hit by a double in the left middle by the leading Suns, but he left Oyama to fly and Boer to double, killing two third base.
In the match against Fukudome, he chased him with two balls and finally forked.
He struck out in a three-ball game to keep out the pinch.
Katsuno had 83 balls after the sixth inning, but at the end of the midfield game, Yoda came off the bench and announced the change of pitcher.
Nishi Isamu, who played the pitching game, had 108 pitches at the same point, but got off the mound first and did not earn the right to win his first victory this season.

Certification began in 2004 with the aim of developing sales channels for small businesses.
It was renewed after 15 years.
In March of this year, products recommended by each chamber of commerce were reviewed and 22 items were certified, including local sake and hats handmade by craftsmen.
There are 121 items, including 99 items such as sweets, seasonings and cosmetics inherited from the old brand.
We will continue recruiting.
Products with particularly excellent quality are awarded the Best Selection Award.
This time, it was given to Hiruzen Jersey Yogurt from the Hiruzen Dairy Agriculture Cooperative (Maniwa).

The annual festival has been held annually in late July, but this year it was cancelled due to the new coronavirus.
On the 26th, only Shinto rituals will be held by the chairman of the municipality.
The annual festival was held by the residents' association, and there was a parade of Officer Masuda's floats on white horses and fireworks.
Nearly 200 people attend every year, including bereaved families living in Kumamoto Prefecture, police officials and local residents.
This year, he says, the number of inquiries from the media has increased due to the Corona disaster, and the chairman of the local government, Takeda Yoshinori (72), says, "The annual festival that has been connected in the community is crowded every year. It's very regrettable that it was cancelled."
The prefectural police also canceled the memorial service for police school students this year.
On the 21st, Chief Sugiuchi Yumiko and Chief Fukushima Hiroto of the Karatsu Police Station visited Komatsushima off the coast of Takagushi Port where she was cremated and offered flowers at the monument.
Chief Sugiuchi said, "The brave and dedicated spirit is the origin of the police, and I want to take over as it should be."
Officer Masuda from Kumamoto Prefecture was assigned to Takagushi in July 1895.
He took measures without sleep, such as disinfecting patients' homes, and later contracted cholera.
He died at the age of 25 just four days after taking office, saying, "I will carry all the cholera from Takagushi."

A "Kenko Hot Seminar" (hosted by Saga Shimbun and co-hosted by Megane no Yonezawa) was held on the 25th at Megane no Yonezawa Saga Main Store in Shimoda-cho, Saga.
Akio KINOSHITA, director of the ophthalmology department of Hiramatsu Hospital (Ogi City), explained about eye diseases deeply related to daily life such as dry eyes and cataracts.
Dry eye is said to be a "disease of tears," and it is explained that the quality of tears collapses and tears do not spread evenly on the surface of the eyes.
Kinoshita said contact lens users are about four times more likely to use them, and warned them not to use them for long periods of time or sleep while wearing them.
Measures were taken, including placing the computer screen below eye level and humidifying in air-conditioned rooms.
Ingredients and foods effective for dry eyes were also introduced.
"Omega-3 contained in blue fish prevents tears from evaporating, and mucin contained in natto and okra enhances the quality of tears."
As for cataract surgery, there are single-focus and multi-focus intraocular lenses inserted instead of the lens, and I touched on the difference in appearance.
About 40 people attended the seminar.
As a preventive measure against the new coronavirus infection, the event was held in two parts, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, with a small number of people.

[G Osaka] 17 years old, what are the chances of making your J1 debut against Kobe?
"Sports News - Yahoo!
G Osaka coach Miyamoto Tsuneyasu (43) gave an interview on the 25th before the match against Kobe (Noesta on the 26th), where they are fighting for their fourth consecutive win, and revealed his expectations for third-year high school student Karayama Shoji (17), who joined the first team for the first time in the previous season.
The commander will make Karayama, who was promoted to the top this season, a bench member against Hiroshima on the 22nd.
Although he did not give him a chance to play, he also ordered the striker, who has scored three goals in five games in J3 so far this season, to say, "There is something that stands out about scoring points. I am 17 years old, but I want him to do more gameshara. I have seen players go abroad at a young age, but I want him to play with high awareness and greed."
Tangshan scored eight goals in 10 games for J3, who was a specially designated player last season.
Although he is thin at 178cm and 65kg, he boasts an amazing scoring rate of 11 goals in 15 games in J3, thanks to his sense of taking the back of the DF with instant movement and his calm ability to shoot in front of a crowded opponent's goal.
In the match against Hiroshima, Ademiusson and Onoze were off the bench due to injuries, and Karayama had a chance, but did not play.
In preparation for the match against Kobe, Miyamoto explained the condition of Ademiusson and Onoze, saying, "Both of them are not 100%, but they are highly motivated and are preparing."
If they are preserved, there is a possibility that Tangshan will be on the bench again.
At G Osaka, MF Doan (now PSV) made his J1 debut at the age of 16 years and 11 months, and FW Usami made his J1 debut at the age of 17 years and 0 months.
Karayama, who is currently 17 years and 10 months old, is expected to make his J1 debut as a successor to them.
A Ferrari stolen 26 years ago is found at the bottom of the river.
A Ferrari Mondial was stolen in the Netherlands in 1994.
Time passed without the police being able to solve it, but 26 years later the mondial was miraculously discovered.
The discovery of the Ferrari (4 photos) at the bottom of the river was triggered by the fire department's diving training.
On July 8, a trained diver found something wedge-shaped sinking at the bottom of the river, and the police and even the Dutch army were called out and pulled it up to find it was a Ferrari Mondial.
By matching the VIN number to a database of stolen cars, the Ferrari was linked to the 1994 incident.
The car was handed over to its legal owner, an insurance company, and then sent to a scrap dealer.
Scrap contractor Lowie van DE Ooyevaar said: "There are still some parts left, but it's for the art of decorating - we've already had a lot of requests from people who want to make a table out of a dismembered mondial - we use engine blocks and glass plates."
For the time being, there are no plans for a specific sale, but scrap dealers will keep it as an object.
Seibu Sotozaki hits first Sayonara
Sixth year pro, "the man who doesn't have" finally!
Yahoo!
(PA League, Seibu 3x-2 Lotte, 9th round, Seibu 6-3, 24th, MetLife) It's an obsession!
Seibu's Sotozaki Osamu (27) hit his first Sayonara in his sixth year as a pro in the ninth inning of the Lotte 9th round (MetLife) on the 24th, contributing to a 3-2 victory.
He took advantage of the opportunity presented by Genda's head sliding and forest sacrifice.
As a team, the winning team saved 2.
The voltage of the Leo Party packed into the MetLife Dome reached its peak.
Sotozaki hit his first Sayonara in his sixth year as a pro.
The crowd was 4,825.
"Gen (Genda) and Tomoya (Mori) connected me, so I entered the at-bat with the feeling of doing something about it."
The ninth inning was 2-2.
The first batter, Genda, tried a safety bunt and had a spirited head sliding on first base.
After an infield hit, Mori, the top batter last season, hit his second professional hit.
Number 4, Yamakawa, avoided declaring.
A senior from Fuji University was made to walk, and Sotozaki's heart was burning.
"I thought," Damn. "Yamakawa told me to be aggressive before going to first base, so I was really excited."
He got stuck on a straight ball with a high inner angle from one ball, but the ball fell to the left.
He said that he had "no memory" throughout his amateur days.
The 27-year-old, who was inspired by his alma mater, Hirosaki Sanetaka in Aomori, advancing to the top four in the prefectural tournament for the first time in 20 years, took a water shower of joy and smiled, saying, "It felt good as expected."
He was called the man who didn't have it.
He was selected by Samurai Japan as a versatile player who can protect the infield, and contributed to the world's best in "Premier 12" last November.
However, he had no experience with Sayonara hitting in Seibu, and was bullied by coach Tsuji and coach Baba's strategy and defense and running base coach saying, "You don't have it."
He repaid his negative reputation and won his second Sayonara victory this season.
Director Tsuji praised him, saying, "I asked the goddess of victory to do it today.
In the second round, they finished third, one game behind SoftBank.
Sotozaki, who has only one home run this season and batting average of 252, said, "I still have to hit. We will work as a team to win the next one."
The hit that decided the game will be an opportunity to recover.

Minoru Buta, which raises about 50,000 pigs a year at farms in Towada City and Rokunohe Town, visited Mayor Hisashi Oyamada at Towada City Hall on the 20th and reported that its farm has acquired JGAP (livestock and livestock products) certification, which indicates the safety of agricultural and livestock products.
This is the second case of a pig farming business in the prefecture.
The company is engaged in the production of 'garlic pork,' which uses powdered garlic produced in the prefecture as special feed, and 'jiyoton,' which uses rice produced in the prefecture.
Of the five farms, Farm No. 5 (Rokunohe Town), which breeds about 10,000 pigs and produces "local pigs," obtained JGAP certification.
The company aimed to obtain certification because they thought that certification was necessary to be selected by major buyers and learned that it was a condition for procuring ingredients for the Tokyo Olympics Olympic Village.
With the support of the Bank of Aomori since last August, they made preparations together with bank staff qualified as JGAP instructors.
On March 3 this year, it was reviewed by a certification body and cleared a total of 113 standards including food safety.
It was certified on 13 May.
The visit was attended by Minoru Nakanowatari, CEO of the company, Dai Nakanowatari, Managing Director of Aomori Bank, Takeo Yamada, Manager of Towada Nanji, and Yoshihiro Ishigo, Business Advisor of the bank's Corporate Support Department.
Mayor Oyamada cheered, saying, "It is very wonderful. I hope you will greatly promote (JGAP certification) and expand sales channels."
CEO Minoru Nakanowatari was enthusiastic, saying, "I will continue to make efforts to brand pig farming and contribute to Towada."
"We aim to obtain certification for the remaining four farms," said Nakanowatari Dai, managing director of the company.

The result was double.
Fukuda, who was in the lead, went out with a middle hit, and Ishikawa Ko (Toho High School), who was in first place, scored a bunt before throwing, creating a first baseman with one death and second base.
This is where the number 3, who was just promoted that day, comes in.
Chunichi fans who packed Nagoya Dome cheered loudly.
As a result, he was hit by a bat on the slider of Isamu NISHI's first pitch, but he was hit by a double with two deaths at third base with minimal work, and Iryo hit the first shortstop infield.
"It is ideal to hit, but I am happy because Iryo hit and scored."
It was originally expected to take three to four weeks to return, but he returned quickly in two weeks.
Coach Yoda also said, "I think (the condition) is around 70-80%. This is my own feeling, so it looks like that from what I see, but I think it's enough and I'm recovering faster than I expected. I wasn't particularly concerned about the way I ran after hitting, and I think my starting lineup will be close as I gradually get used to it."
Takahashi himself decided to "get back what he had left as soon as possible."

Heavy rain, scars on "traffic" in Kitato National Route 152 closed for 10 kilometers, part of JR Iida Line closed | Shizuoka Shimbun at S
National Route 152 has been completely closed to traffic, and a line of cars waiting for a one-way detour = On the afternoon of the 22nd, Tatsuyama-cho, Tenryu-ku, Hamamatsu (part of the photo has been processed)
The Tenryu area in Hamamatsu City was one of the hardest hit areas in Shizuoka Prefecture by the torrential rains in July that caused extensive damage in Kyushu and other parts of Japan.
The effects of landslides remain on National Route 152, the main road, and the JR Iida Line, the "foot of daily life," and many areas require time to recover.
In addition to the inconvenience of daily life, residents are worried about the negative impact on economic activities.
At Sejiri Bridge over the Tenryu River in Ryuzan-cho, the same ward, a long line of cars waiting for traffic continues during the day.
The lead car stopped for nearly 40 minutes.
National Route 152 has been completely closed for about 10 kilometers, and a detour to the opposite bank of Tenryu River is required to move around the town.
However, the width of the road is narrow, and all sections are one-way traffic, so waiting time is unpredictable.
In the town, a landslide occurred on the national highway on the 9th, and traffic was closed due to the risk of falling rocks on nearby slopes.
On the 13th, cracks were found in the Akiba Tunnel in the restricted section, and there is no prospect of resuming traffic.
In 2018, the national highway was closed due to the collapse of the soil, damaging residents' lives and tourism.
Tamamoto Kimie (76), president of the Dragon Mama Processing Plant, which sells specialty products, said, "This is a boost while customers have been away due to the new coronavirus. The number of visitors has decreased significantly."
The JR Iida Line was out of service between Mizukubo Station (Mizukuba-cho, the same ward) and Hiraoka Station (Nagano Prefecture) due to a slope collapse beside the track.
Ukai Shiori (16), who went to Hamamatsu Kohoku High School Sakuma Branch School in Sakuma-cho, the same ward from Oarashi Station (the same town) on the closed section, needed a one-hour car transfer one way.
He hopes for a speedy recovery, saying, "A car is a heavy burden on parents and myself."
According to JR Tokai, it is expected to take about three months to reopen, and from the 27th, a special train will run between Mizukubo Station and Oarashi Station on weekdays morning and evening.
In Mizukubo Town, landslides occur frequently on forest roads that are also residential roads.
In some cases, detours take several hours.
Kumagai Keiji (69), president of the Mizukubo Town Forestry Association, said, "The removal of raw wood has been delayed. There are isolated islands on land everywhere. I'm worried about future rain."

The Portuguese newspaper ZAP reported on Record.
Porto, who won the Portuguese league in the 2019 / 20 season, held a victory ceremony on the pitch during their last home war on the 20th of this month.
However, it was talked about that Nakajima was not here.

Nakajima just didn't show up.
As a result, "Nakajima is increasingly out of Sergio Conceiçon's plans for next season and needs to leave the club in the next transfer window."

They may already be looking for new ground.

Is my husband happy or unhappy?
Is there a wife who is shocked or angry when her husband says, "I don't have enough money this month?"
The family where this conversation is established is one where the wife holds the wallet.
How many families in the world have wives holding their wallets?
Let's also look at the percentage of "couple separate wallets" and "jointly managed."
Who holds the household wallet?

Who holds the household wallet?
Wife: 45.0% Husband: 24.8% The most common result was that the wife managed the household budget.
No matter who manages it, household management has twists and turns, but there seem to be various episodes.
My wife manages the household budget: In the case of child A Child A is a Wah Mama in Alafif with a daughter in her third year of high school and first year of high school.
Child A fully manages the household budget.
As I was preparing for university entrance exams and the school fees were high, there were many months when I was in the red, so I negotiated with my husband to lower my allowance, but as expected, he resisted.
At that time, he asked me to show him what kind of balance I had, so I showed him my household account.
I should have listed all my expenses, but when I looked at my household accounts, I didn't have enough income to lose money.
My husband was about to say, "It's enough," but Ms. A unexpectedly said, "I understand, I am not strong enough in household management, so please manage everything."
Later, when A child interviewed her husband, she said, "Although she is dissatisfied with the fact that her allowance is managed, she does not have the time or energy to manage various household expenses (such as school materials and PTA expenses)."
Husband manages the household budget: In the case of B child B child, a housewife, is given living expenses by her husband and manages it every day.
Last spring, the freezer part of the refrigerator broke, so B asked her husband to buy a refrigerator.
However, my husband was reluctant to replace it, saying, "The freezer is useless, but the refrigerator part can still be used, so it's okay."
However, in the summer, she wanted to create an environment where her husband could eat ice cream at any time.
It seems that B child unexpectedly complained to her friend that "her husband is stingy enough to get a" do. "
The club was relegated to the Spanish First Division (Spanish First Division).
It seems that the transfer destination of Japan national team midfielder Kubo Takehide (19), who played for Spanish first division club Mallorca this season, is gradually being narrowed down.
Although Mallorca was relegated to the second division, Kubo's reputation soared with his success at the end of the season.
However, due to the fact that he is outside the EU, it is difficult for him to return to Real Madrid, which has "ownership rights," so he will play for another club next season.
About 30 clubs have already offered him, but R Madrid plans to train him at domestic clubs.
The Spanish newspaper Marca reported that Real Sociedad, Villarreal, Granada, Getafe and Betis were the most likely destinations for Kubo, and that "five clubs are interested in acquiring Kubo, but R Madrid wants a club in the middle of the league or higher."
Among them, Villarreal and R Sociedad will qualify for next season's European League (EL), and Granada will participate in the second qualifying round of the EL, meeting the team requirements of R Madrid.
What kind of decision will the world's number one big club make about the departure of "Japan's treasure"?
