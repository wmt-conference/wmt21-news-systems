Semilarski v. Prosecutor's Office: Former Deputy Mayor of Tartu will be considered for cassation on August 4
This means that a decision on it is likely to be made in early September.
The courts of the first two instances refused to consider Semilarski's lawsuit, but in April, his cassation appeal was accepted by the State Court.
On 12 December 2019, the Tartu Administrative Court returned the complaint to the applicant, as its resolution was not within its competence as an administrative court.
The court ruling stated that the complaint contained a claim for compensation for damage caused during criminal proceedings.
"The prosecutor's office and the county court should regulate such issues," Anett Kreutzmann, a spokeswoman for the Tartu courts, previously explained to ERR.
According to her, Valvo Semilarski appealed the ruling in the district court, which on February 5 did not change the decision of the court of first instance.
Now the State Court will have to say its word.
According to Semilarski's defense attorney, attorney-at-law Oliver Nääes, his client had been wrongly suspected of bribery for about two years.
Now he demands that the prosecutor's office refute the untrue allegations against him and compensate him for moral damage.
The reason for filing a complaint to the court were the statements made by the prosecutor for special cases of the Liuna District Prosecutor's Office, Margus Gross, in October 2017, when Semilarski, together with several other at the time deputy mayor of Tartu, Artyom Sverd, was convicted.
"We would like to remind you that when I was detained, the Security Police and the Prosecutor's Office immediately organized a press conference and informed the entire Republic of Estonia that the leaders of Tartu, one of the most influential local governments, will be in charge.
These public suspicions that hung in the air accompanied me for about two years.
And now that these allegations and suspicions have turned out to be false, the prosecutor's office does not want to say anything about it," Semilarski commented in early August 2019.
According to Oliver Näes, at the press conference, the prosecutor went beyond the legal framework in which the prosecutor's office should operate.
"The allegation of bribes and mis-selling turned out to be false, but that's not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly stressed in its rulings on Russia, as well as on Lithuania, that during the investigation phase, representatives of the state should be careful when choosing words so that suspects are not presented before the suspects.
The prosecutor's office is also obliged to do this by the presumption of innocence, which, unfortunately, was not observed in this case against Valvo Semilarski," Näes said.
"The public presentation of Semilarski as a serious offender and a bribe-taker in circumstances where the facts underlying the suspicion of bribery are still being clarified is unacceptable for a wrongdoer, which contradicts the presumption of wrongdoer.
As rus.err.ee wrote, Valvo Semilarski, the former deputy mayor of Tartu, will not be prosecuted on bribery charges - the criminal case against him was partially closed in July.
At the same time, the former official is being tried on charges of knowingly violating anti-corruption legislation when conducting transactions on a particularly large scale.
According to the indictment, between 2015 and 2017, the former deputy mayor of Tartu participated more than thirty times in meetings of the city government in making decisions related to companies operating in Tartu, with the owners or managers of the larvae.
According to Gross, in all these cases Semilarski had personal interests, and therefore he had to step aside from participating in decision-making.
Earlier, as rus.err.ee wrote, the prosecutor's office charged Semilarski with suspicion of taking a bribe and violating anti-corruption legislation in conducting transactions on a particularly large scale.
This happened in October 2016, when he was detained along with another deputy mayor, Artem Suvorov (Centrist Party).
Then, the Prosecutor's Office and the Security Police said that there was strong evidence against both deputy mayors.
Both officials then resigned.
Suvorov's case later came to court, which fully acquitted the politician.
The judicial investigation into Valvo Semilarski is still ongoing.
The ex-soloist of the group "Hands Up" visited the Tver region

The singer is probably resting in the beautiful city of Tver region with his family.

At the same time, most fans remain FOR the old version: "Sergei, the old version of the song is clearly 1,000,000 times better!
Support me loyal fans of "Hands Up," "We don't need a "new crumb."

U.S. urges Qatar and its neighbors to end dispute
It is necessary to restore trust and unity between Qatar and other states, according to U.S. Special Representative for Iran Brian Hook.
He said the conflict between the emirate and other countries in the region had lasted too long and was damaging to regional interests in stability, prosperity and security.

In response, Doha said that neighbors simply envy Qatar's economic success - according to the IMF, Qatar has been leading GDP per capita for several years by a large margin.
The emirate is the third largest exporter of natural gas, the sixth largest exporter of natural gas and oil products.

How will the Central Bank's decision to reduce the key rate affect the economy
The Bank of Russia is expected to cut the key rate again.
It dropped another 0.25 percentage points, to 4.25% per annum - formally another historic low.
Judging by the return of the short rate cut, as well as the tone of the Central Bank's statements and updated forecasts for the Russian economy, the regulator looks at the economic outlook more optimistic than before.
This means that the current cycle of monetary easing could soon come to a halt.
"We have continued to soften monetary policy, primarily given that there are still risks of inflation deflecting down from 4% in 2021," Bank of Russia Governor Elvira Nabiullina said.
They are associated with a significant decline in economic activity, a fall in domestic and external demand.
According to Nabiullina, the economic recovery will take more than a year and a half.
At the same time, she noted that after the removal of restrictions due to the pandemic, economic processes have revived: energy consumption, consumer and investment demand have been restored, construction and production of consumer goods have expanded, and annual freight turnover has slowed.
According to the updated forecast of the Central Bank, in 2020, the economy will shrink 4.5-5.5 percent (before that, it was expected 4-6 percent), and the economic recovery growth in 2021 will be 3.5-4.5 percent, in 2022 - 2.5-3.5 percent.
In addition, the Bank of Russia revised its forecast for annual oil prices to $38 and $40 per barrel Urals in 2020 and 2021, respectively.
Earlier, the Central Bank expected $27 and $35 per barrel.
Finally, the Bank of Russia's inflation forecast for 2020 was 3.7-4.2% against the previously expected 3.8-4.8%.
The Bank of Russia's view on the economic situation is becoming more optimistic, which brings us closer to the end of the easing cycle, according to Russian and CIS "Renaissance Capital" economists Sofya Donetsk and Andrei Melashchenko.
Thus, the Bank of Russia has been consistently lowering the key rate for more than a year, since the beginning of last summer it has already dropped by 3.5 percentage points.
And at the last meeting in June, the Central Bank lowered it by one percentage point at once because of low inflation rates due to depressed demand and the need to stimulate the economy, which has stalled due to the pandemic and its associated restrictions.
The chances of fine-tuning monetary policy remain (at the next meeting on September 18 and before the end of the year), but the limit is already close, agrees chief analyst of Rosbank Evgeny Koshelev.
The combination of inflationary risks also indicates the proximity of a pause in interest-rate policy easing - disrupted supply chains, possible cost increases due to measures to prevent an epidemic, and a faster (than expected) recovery in demand.
In addition, subsequent actions by the Bank of Russia will require greater attention to inflationary processes during the harvest season, as well as external volatility, which has increased amid geopolitical conflicts, Koshelev points out.
In one way or another, the key rate reduction will lead to a further decrease in rates for the most reliable borrowers, as well as, possibly, for mortgages, says Maxim Petrovitch, senior economist at the analytical department of Otkritie bank.
The rate correction will be less pronounced than the key rate reduction, he clarifies.
Interest rates on loans may fall by another 0.3-0.6 percentage points during the second half of the year, mortgage rates may end the year in the range of 6.2-7%, does not exclude the economist of "BKC Premier" Anton Pokatovich.
Average deposit rates, in his opinion, will also fall - in the coming months they could fall to 4.2-4.5% (now barely above 4.5%).
Next, they could drop to 4% if the Central Bank reduces the key rate in the fall, according to Pokatovich.

Poll: Lithuania's ruling Union of Peasants and Greens again tops party rankings
The Union of Peasants and Greens of Lithuania, which heads the ruling coalition of the Seimas, topped the party rankings.
This was revealed by a survey conducted by the sociological research company Vilmorus commissioned by the newspaper Lietuvos rytas.
After winning the 2016 parliamentary elections, "peasants" lost the first place and for a long time the leading critic of Russia in Lithuania, the opposition "Union of Fatherland - Christian Democrats (Conservatives), was in the lead.
However, recently, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda, assessing the electoral capabilities of the parties, said that the Union of Peasants and Greens after this year's parliamentary elections would probably be able to form a coalition again.
The announcement has angered conservatives.
The latest poll showed that if parliamentary elections were held today, 17.6 percent of voters would vote for peasants, and 17.2 percent for conservatives.
According to Vilmorus director Vladas Gaidys, the gap is within the margin of error, and yet the ruling parties have fallen behind the conservatives.
According to Gaidis, the sociological success of the "peasants" was helped by the news that their electoral list would be headed by Prime Minister Saulius Skvernialis.
The politician was first on the list of "peasants" and in the 2016 election.
In third place is the Social Democratic Party, for which 7.1 percent of respondents are now ready to vote.
In a month, it unexpectedly lost 2 percent.
The fourth is the Labour Party, led by businessman of Russian origin Viktor Uspassky (6.2 percent).
The rest of the political organizations, judging by the poll, will not yet be able to overcome the 5% electoral barrier.

Extra requirements for applications for public procurement will be excluded by law
The legislation may establish exhaustive requirements for applications for participation in procurement.
In the autumn session, the plenary session of the State Duma plans to consider in the second reading a bill establishing requirements for the content and composition of an application for participation in procurement, the participants of which can only be small and medium-sized businesses.
The government is amending the law "On the procurement of goods, works, services by certain types of legal entities."
The draft law was developed in accordance with the road map for the implementation of the Strategy for the Development of Small and Medium Enterprises in the Russian Federation until 2030, approved by the government.
It provides for the preparation of a draft law on an exhaustive list of documents that customers are entitled to require as part of an application from participants in the procurement - subjects of small and medium-sized businesses.
And also - about the list of requirements for these documents.
To date, the law "On the procurement of goods, works, services by certain types of legal entities" framework regulates the procurement activities of certain types of legal entities.
Requirements for the content, form, design and composition of the application for participation in the procurement are set by customers independently in the procurement documentation.
"As a result, customers set excessive requirements for the content, registration of the application, the mandatory presence in its composition of certificates, certificates, extracts, the period of receipt of which in the authorized bodies may be comparable to the period of submission for the application.
The new draft law provides for the establishment of an exhaustive list of documents that customers are entitled to require as part of an application from procurement participants who are subjects of small and medium-sized businesses.
"The adoption of the document will eliminate the arbitrary establishment by customers of requirements for the composition and content of applications of participants who are small and medium-sized businesses," the explanatory note reads.

The authorities of the Moscow region told about the fate of closed landfills
Solid waste landfills continue to be closed in the Moscow region.
This year, the authorities promise to eliminate the latter.
Some of the 39 existing landfills are being upgraded into modern waste processing facilities.
But this option is not possible for every landfill - many of them have overgrown dense residential development.
After the landfill closes, it gets up for recultivation - the body of the landfill is covered with soil, degassing and infiltration removal systems are installed.
This makes it possible to stop chemical processes inside the landfill, so that it does not ignite, does not emit stench, does not poison soil and groundwater.
And then the former landfill remains elevated by a useless pile among the surrounding residential buildings.
Why not make it something useful?
For example, in Ruz, where just the other day the redevelopment of the Annino landfill was completed, the authorities are considering making a ski slope out of the pile.
The landfill, which was in operation from 1976 to 2016, has expanded beyond the land allocated to it.
Therefore, during the recultivation, it was necessary to buy out neighboring areas, de facto long ago already clogged with garbage.
"Some time will pass, the landfill will fit down, the fortress will be built up, and we will think what can be done to make it start to benefit.
The ski resort catches the eye," Nikolai Parfenov, head of the Russian district, told reporters.
Two landfills to become renewable energy production sites
Torbeyevo landfills in Lyubertsy and Timokhovo in Bogorodsky District will become sites for the production of renewable energy sources from landfill and biological gases.
By the end of the year, a gas-piston power plant will be launched on the territory of Torbeyov, capable of generating up to 8 million kilowatt-hours of electricity per year, and about 0.95 gigacalories of thermal energy will be provided by conventional power plants.
Timokhovo will produce 72.5 million kilowatt hours and continue to operate as a garbage processing complex.
A museum could be set up at the Kuchino balashikha landfill, which was closed after complaints from residents about the Direct Line with the country's president.
"There was such an idea - to create a museum of recultivation of landfills near Moscow," - said the deputy chairman of the government - the Minister of Ecology and Natural Resources of the region Dmitry Kurakin.
Israel reports drone crash in southern Lebanon

Mikhail Degtyarev, acting governor of Khabarovsk Krai, for the first time after his appointment went out to the participants of actions in support of the arrested ex-head of the region, Sergei Furgal.
The meeting was broadcast on his Instagram page.
"Moscow hears everyone, so I sent you a trio so that the region would not descend without power... I repeat once again about Furgal: he is "a" - my comrade, "b" - one-party, "c" - I am very worried about his fate,
According to Degtyarev, the Khabarovsk Territory cannot now remain without a leader, so he was appointed by President Vladimir Putin to the post of head of the region, so that "a wonderful building (the regional government) functions, everything works."
The acting governor explained that he had not gone to the protesters before because he could not communicate with thousands of demonstrators.
Therefore, he conducts broadcasts on social networks and reads all comments on them.
On July 25, two consecutive protests were held in Khabarovsk.
Rallies in support of the former governor have been held in the region since July 11.
On the eve of the next action, Mikhail Degtyarev announced that he would leave the city on the day of the rally.
His motorcade was stopped by protesters and called to speak about the fate of the arrested ex-governor of Furgal.

Beautiful tall minarets only decorated Ayia Sofia
Once again, about Ayia-Sofia, the text of Fr. Vladimir Zelinsky came across, saying that it was necessary to protest.
First, there was a free entrance - hurrah!
I wasn't in Istanbul, but free entry to the House of God is better than paid entry.
Secondly, Muslims have just as honestly conquered this land as the Orthodox have conquered the Volga-Oka River, the Muslim Caucasus (and set up a church in Grozny) and planted apple trees on Mars.
God help!
Jews conquered the Holy Land.
The Americans conquered America.
Will we return everything to everyone?
Do you think there will be no pagans who will demand the return of their capitol, in the place of which the Tenth Church?
Third, Muslims improved the building and invested in it.
That is, they, like the factories and estates that the Leninists took from the bourgeoisie into their own ownership, belong to the Leninists - to Putin and other nomenclature.
They have improved everything - from the Kremlin to Angara, so it's all of them rightfully progressives.
Beautiful tall minarets have very decorated Ayia Sofia, very.
There was a silly ink, there was a silly ink with beautiful minarets.
Fourth, there are no "Islamic" or "Orthodox" civilizations.
There are believers, there are hypocrites, there are hanjis who combine faith and hypocrisy.
A believer in the categories of civilization does not think.
This is the thinking of a British Foreign Office official, Toynbee, who is ashamed to think so.
And to the believer everywhere is the place of prayer.
And always.
The believer does not pray only where he is asked to leave - he is removed to another place and prays there.
He is a believer, not an advocate.
We are cowboys, not grim stones.

Rwandan man admits setting fire to Nantes cathedral
A Rwandan national who volunteered at St. Peter and Paul's Cathedral in the French city of Nantes confessed to setting it on fire a week after the fire.
This was reported on Sunday by France-3 TV channel.
According to him, the man, who was already detained on July 19, the day after the fire, was detained again the day before.
He appeared before an investigating judge on Saturday evening.
After being charged with wilful damage to property, the man admitted organising arson at three locations - under a large organ, under a small organ and near an electrical shield.
Now he faces up to 10 years in prison and a 150,000 euro fine.
The motive of the 39-year-old from Rwanda has not yet been reported.
It is only known that he voluntarily assisted in the cathedral and on the day of the fire had to close its doors.
However, according to CCTV footage, he left the religious institution 15 minutes after receiving calls about a fire in the building.
The fire in the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul occurred on July 18.
More than 200 firefighters fought for several hours for the Gothic architecture monument.
However, they were unable to save the stained glass windows from the times of Louis XII and the unique Baroque organ.
The situation was brought under control only three hours after the fire started.
No one was injured as a result of the incident.
The current fire is not the first in the history of the temple.
In 1972, a fire destroyed its roof.
It took 13 years to eliminate the consequences of that fire.
For parishioners, the cathedral was reopened only in 1985.

I knew that Bryant's self-indulgence couldn't be hurt by a thrash-talk to discourage his sports rage.
Kobi had a killer instinct, so I tried to talk him out of the game in an aggressive way on the court.
On the platform I gave him compliments: "Oh!
Koby, scored well, a great pass!
Listening to my enthusiastic responses, he almost forgot that it is necessary to take the ball once again and score another 3 - 4 points.
We communicated well with Kobi," Kirilenko quotes Evening Moscow as saying.
He also spoke about his first game against Jordan.
"I took care of him.
The first three minutes of the match I ran in full admiration of the fact that there is a legend next to me that I saw only on TV.

Soon I went away from delight, a couple of times covered his throws...
In that game, my team won, and Jordan still scored 44 points," added the head of the RFB.

This has nothing to do with LGBT and feminism," said the actor, who played the father of a boy who dressed in women's clothing.
He stressed that he was "proud of the work" and did not consider it propaganda.

"Then on a couple of occasions we met disgruntled locals who didn't understand what we were doing.
But we were open, so the people who first came forward with claims began to help us," he concluded.
The shooting incident, the publication explains, occurred in September 2019 in Kabardino-Balkaria: a drunk man attacked a vehicle of a film crew with a weapon, after which he was detained by police officers.
Earlier it was reported that the public commissioner for the protection of the family, Olga Baranets, sent a complaint to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Roskomnadzor against the more.tv service that hosted the Russian series "Chiki."
Baranez accused the creators of the series of "propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations and feminism," drawing attention to the fact that the main characters of the film work as prostitutes, and the series itself contains "scenes of physical and psychological violence."
The ombudsman was also outraged that "a lot of attention was paid in the series to the homosexual sexual orientation" of the minor character.
The comedy drama "Chiki" tells about three prostitutes who started a new life and opened a business on the advice of a friend.
