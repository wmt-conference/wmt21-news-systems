The hurricane will bring heavy rainfall to Mexico, with 150 to 250 liters of rain per square meter predicted in some areas.
The authorities have prepared about 800 shelters for the population.
10 thousand people, including rescuers, soldiers of the National Guard and the military will help people.

Semilarski against the prosecutor's office: the appeal of the former deputy mayor of Tartu will be considered on August 4
This means that a decision on it is likely to be made in early September.
The courts of the first two instances refused to consider Semilarski's claim, but in April his appeal was accepted by the State Court.
On 12 December 2019, the Tartu Administrative Court returned the complaint to the applicant, as its resolution does not fall within its competence as an administrative court.
The court ruling stated that the complaint contained a claim for damages caused in the course of criminal proceedings.
"It is up to the prosecutor's office and the county court to regulate such matters," Anette Kreitsmann, spokeswoman for the Tartu courts, explained to ERR earlier.
According to her, Valvo Semilarski appealed the ruling to the district court, which on February 5 did not change the decision of the court of first instance.
Now Gossud will have his say.
According to Semilarski's defense attorney, sworn lawyer Oliver Njaes, his client was unjustifiably suspected of bribery for about two years.
He is now demanding that the prosecutor's office refute the false allegations against him and compensate him for moral damages.
The reason for filing the complaint with the court was the statements made by the prosecutor for special cases of the Lõuna District Prosecutor's Office, Margus Gross, in October 2017, when Semilarski, together with another deputy mayor of Tartu at the time, Artem Suvorov, was detained on suspicion of committing several crimes.
"Let's recall that when I was detained, the Security Police and the Prosecutor's Office immediately organized a press conference and informed the entire Republic of Estonia that the leaders of Tartu - one of the most influential local government bodies - are corrupt.
These public suspicions, hanging in the air, accompanied me for about two years.
And now that these allegations and suspicions have turned out to be false, the prosecutor's office does not want to say anything about it," Semilarski commented in early August 2019.
According to Oliver Njaes, at the press conference, the prosecutor went beyond the legal framework in which the prosecutor's office should operate.
"The allegation of bribery and corruption turned out to be false, but that is not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly stressed in its rulings on Russia, as well as on Lithuania, that at the investigation stage, state representatives should be careful in their choice of words, so that suspects are not presented as criminals before sentencing.
The prosecutor's office is also obliged to do so by the presumption of innocence, which, unfortunately, was not respected in this case against Valvo Semilarski," said Näes.
"The public presentation of Semilarski as a serious offender and bribe-taker, in circumstances where the facts underlying the suspicion of bribery are still being clarified, is unacceptable, contrary to the presumption of innocence and unfair to the complainant," the lawyer added.
According to rus.err.ee, the former vice-mayor of Tartu, Valvo Semilarski, will not be prosecuted on charges of bribery - the criminal case against him was partially closed in July.
At the same time, the former official is being tried on charges of knowingly violating anti-corruption legislation during large-scale transactions.
According to the indictment, between 2015 and 2017, the former deputy mayor of Tartu participated more than thirty times in meetings of the city council when making decisions related to companies operating in Tartu, with whose owners or managers Semilarski actively communicated on a personal level outside working hours.
According to Gross, in all these cases Semilarski had personal interests, and therefore he should have removed himself from participation in decision-making.
Earlier, as rus.err.ee wrote, the prosecutor's office presented Semilarski with suspicions of taking bribes and violating anti-corruption legislation when conducting transactions on a large scale.
This happened in October 2016, when he was detained together with another deputy mayor, Artem Suvorov (Center Party).
At the time, the Prosecutor's Office and the Security Police stated that there was strong evidence against both deputy mayors.
Both officials have since resigned.
Suvorov's case later went to court, which completely exonerated the politician.
The judicial investigation into the case of Valvo Semilarski is still ongoing.
The ex-soloist of the band "Hands Up" visited Tver region
The ex-soloist of the group "Hands Up," and now a solo artist, businessman and actor Sergey Zhukov posted a photo from Kalyazin, Tver region, on his official Instagram account.

Probably, the singer is vacationing in the beautiful city of Tver region with his family.
Residents of the region have already thanked the performer for his visit, and expressed hope for a meeting and personal communication.
The new "Kroshka" referred to in the post is probably a new version of an old song, which Zhukov has now recorded with blogger and musician David Manukyan (DAVA M).
At the same time, most fans remain FOR the old version: "Sergei, the old version of the song is clearly 1 000 000 times better!

The US has called on Qatar and its neighbours to end their dispute
It is necessary to restore trust and unity between Qatar and other states, according to US Special Representative for Iran Brian Hook.
He said the conflict between the emirate and other countries in the region had gone on for too long and was detrimental to regional interests in stability, prosperity and security.
So far, the US has unsuccessfully tried to mediate a settlement of the dispute, which Washington sees as a "threat to efforts to contain Iran."
The UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Bahrain severed diplomatic relations with Qatar three years ago.
They imposed a transport blockade, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorism.
In response, Doha said that its neighbors are simply jealous of Qatar's economic success - according to the IMF, Qatar has been leading in GDP per capita by a wide margin for several years.
The emirate is the third in terms of natural gas reserves, the sixth natural gas exporter and a major exporter of oil and petroleum products.

Former U.S. diplomat calls Pompeo's remarks against China "primitive and ineffective"

How the Central Bank's decision to cut the key rate will affect the economy
As expected, the Bank of Russia cut its key rate again.
It dropped another 0.25 percentage points, to 4.25% per annum - formally another historic low.
Judging by the return of a short rate cut, as well as the tone of the Central Bank's statements and updated forecasts for the Russian economy, the regulator is more optimistic about economic prospects than before.
This means that the current monetary easing cycle may soon come to a halt.
"We have continued to ease monetary policy, primarily taking into account that there are still risks of inflation deviating down from 4% in 2021," said Bank of Russia Governor Elvira Nabiullina.
They are associated with a significant decline in economic activity and a fall in domestic and external demand.
According to Nabiullina, economic recovery will take more than a year and a half.
At the same time, she noted that after the lifting of restrictions due to the pandemic, economic processes revived: energy consumption, consumer and investment demand recovered, construction and production of consumer goods expanded, and the annual rate of decline in transport turnover and industrial production slowed down.
According to the revised forecast of the Central Bank, in 2020 the economic contraction will be 4.5-5.5% (previously it was expected to be 4-6%), and the recovery growth of the economy in 2021 will be 3.5-4.5%, in 2022 - 2.5-3.5%.
In addition, the Bank of Russia revised its forecast for annual oil prices to $38 and $40 per barrel of Urals in 2020 and 2021, respectively.
Earlier, the Central Bank expected $27 and $35 per barrel.
Finally, the Bank of Russia's inflation forecast for 2020 was 3.7-4.2% compared to the previously expected 3.8-4.8%.
The Bank of Russia's view of the economic situation is becoming more optimistic, which brings us closer to the end of the easing cycle, according to Renaissance Capital's Russia and CIS economists Sofia Donets and Andrey Melashchenko.
Thus, the Bank of Russia has been consistently lowering the key rate for more than a year; since the beginning of last summer, it has already dropped by 3.5 percentage points.
And at the last meeting in June, the Central Bank immediately lowered it by one percentage point due to low inflation rates due to depressed demand and the need to stimulate the economy, which slowed down due to the pandemic and related restrictions.
Chances for fine-tuning the monetary policy remain (at the next meeting on September 18 and until the end of the year), but the limit is already close, agrees Evgeny Koshelev, chief analyst at Rosbank.
The combination of pro-inflationary risks also points to the proximity of a pause in interest rate policy easing - disrupted supply chains, a possible increase in costs due to epidemic prevention measures and a faster (than expected) recovery in demand, he says.
To top it off, the subsequent actions of the Bank of Russia will require more attention to inflationary processes during the harvest season, as well as external volatility, which has increased amid geopolitical conflicts, Koshelev points out.
One way or another, the reduction in the key rate will lead to a further reduction in rates for the most reliable borrowers, and possibly also for mortgages, says Maxim Petronevich, senior economist at the analytical department of Otkritie Bank.
The correction in rates will be less pronounced than the reduction in the key rate, he said.
Interest rates on consumer loans may fall by another 0.3-0.6 percentage points during the second half of the year, mortgage rates may end the year in the range of 6.2-7%, BKS Premier economist Anton Pokatovich does not exclude.
Average deposit rates, in his opinion, will also fall - in the coming months they could drop to 4.2-4.5% (currently barely above 4.5%).

Poll: Lithuania's ruling Union of Farmers and Greens again tops party rankings
The Lithuanian Peasants' and Greens' Union, which heads the ruling coalition in the Seimas, topped the party rankings.
This was shown by a poll conducted by the sociological research company Vilmorus for the newspaper Lietuvos rytas.
After winning the parliamentary elections in 2016, the "peasants" lost the first place and for a long time the main critic of Russia in Lithuania, the opposition "Fatherland Union - Christian Democrats (conservatives), was in the lead.
Nevertheless, recently Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda, assessing the electoral possibilities of the parties, said that the Union of Farmers and Greens will probably be able to form a coalition again after this year's parliamentary elections.
The announcement sparked outrage among conservatives.
The latest poll showed that if the parliamentary elections were held today, 17.6 percent of voters would vote for the peasants and 17.2 percent for the conservatives.
According to the director of Vilmorus, Vladas Gaidis, the gap is within the margin of error, and nevertheless, the ruling party has ceased to lag behind the conservatives.
According to Gaidis, the news that Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis would head their electoral list contributed to the sociological success of the "peasants."
This politician was at the top of the list of "peasants" in the 2016 election.
In third place is the Social Democratic Party, which 7.1 percent of respondents are now ready to vote for.
It unexpectedly lost 2 percent for the month.
The fourth is the Labour Party, led by Russian-born businessman Viktor Uspaskich (6.2 percent).
Other political organizations, according to the poll, will not yet be able to overcome the 5 percent electoral threshold.

Unnecessary requirements for applications for public procurement will be excluded by law
The legislation may establish comprehensive requirements for applications for participation in procurement.
In the autumn session, at the plenary session of the State Duma, it is planned to consider in the second reading a bill establishing requirements for the content and composition of an application for participation in a procurement, the participants of which can only be small and medium-sized businesses.
Amendments are made by the government to the law "On procurement of goods, works and services by certain types of legal entities."
The bill is designed to implement the roadmap for the implementation of the Strategy for the Development of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises in the Russian Federation until 2030, approved by the government.
It provides for the preparation of a draft law on an exhaustive list of documents that customers are entitled to request as part of the application from procurement participants - small and medium-sized businesses.
As well as a list of requirements for these documents.
Today, the law "On procurement of goods, works and services by certain types of legal entities" regulates the procurement activities of certain types of legal entities.
The requirements for the content, form, design and composition of the application for participation in the procurement are set by the customers themselves in the procurement documentation.
"As a result, customers set excessive requirements for the content, design of the application, the mandatory presence in its composition of certificates, certificates, extracts, the deadline for receipt of which in the authorized bodies is comparable to the deadline for submitting applications, which leads to the impossibility of participating in such a purchase and reducing the number of participants in the purchase," the explanatory note to the bill says.
The new bill provides for the establishment of an exhaustive list of documents that customers are entitled to require as part of the application from procurement participants who are small and medium-sized enterprises.
"The adoption of the document will eliminate the arbitrary establishment of requirements by customers for the composition and content of applications of participants who are small and medium-sized businesses," the explanatory note says.

This is necessary for the development of the territory, for the construction of socially significant facilities, as well as infrastructure and cultural heritage, the head of the region stressed.
Also during the conversation, a problematic issue was raised with a 30% reduction in the intake of milk from cooperatives.
This was due to the redistribution of milk purchases by the processing company in favour of peasant farms.
Because of this, the share of receiving products from cooperatives has decreased.
The head of the region instructed the acting minister of agriculture to go to the site, study the structure of milk sales, analyze the experience of other territories and determine options for solving the problem.

The authorities of the Moscow region spoke about the fate of closed dumps
Solid waste landfills continue to be closed in the Moscow region.
This year, the authorities are promising to eliminate the latter.
Some of the 39 landfills that existed in the region are being upgraded into modern waste processing facilities.
But this option is not possible for every landfill - many of them are overgrown with dense residential development.
After the landfill is closed, it is subject to reclamation - the body of the landfill is covered with soil, and degassing and infiltrate removal systems are installed.
This allows you to stop the chemical processes inside the landfill so that it does not ignite, does not emit a stench, and does not poison the soil and groundwater.
And then the former landfill is left to rise in a useless heap among the residential buildings that surround it.
Why not make something useful out of it?
For example, in Ruza, where the reclamation of the Annino landfill was completed just a few days ago, the authorities are considering the option of turning the heap into a ski slope.
This landfill, which operated from 1976 to 2016, grew so much that it exceeded the boundaries of the land allocated for it.
Therefore, during the reclamation, it was necessary to buy out the neighboring plots, which had de facto been clogged with garbage for a long time.
"Some time will pass, the range will "settle down," it will gain strength, and we will think about what can be done to make it useful.
What catches the eye is the ski resort," Nikolai Parfenov, head of the Ruza district, told reporters.
Two landfills will become sites for the production of renewable energy
The Torbeevo landfills in Lyubertsy and Timokhovo in Bogorodsky District will become sites for the production of renewable energy sources from landfill and biological gases.
By the end of the year, a gas piston power plant will be launched on the territory of Torbeyev, capable of generating up to 8 million kilowatt-hours of electricity and about 0.95 gigacalories of thermal energy per year, which will provide for the landfill's own needs - heat supply for administrative and industrial premises.
Timokhovo will produce 72.5 million kilowatt hours and will continue to operate as a waste treatment facility.
And a museum may be created at the Balashikha "Kuchino" firing range, which was closed after residents complained about the "Direct Line" with the country's president.
"There was such an idea - to create a museum of landfill reclamation in the Moscow region," said Deputy Prime Minister - Minister of Ecology and Natural Resources of the region Dmitry Kurakin.
Israel reports drone crash in southern Lebanon
An Israeli army drone has crashed in southern Lebanon.
The military said he collapsed "during an operational activity."

There is no risk of information leakage," the Israeli army said on Twitter.
Recall that this week the Israeli army decided to strengthen its military units on the border with Lebanon, fearing the revenge of the Lebanese Hezbollah movement for the killing of its fighters in Syria.
Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah promised not to let the death of any of his "brothers" go unanswered.

Furgal's replacement first came out to the protesters
The acting governor of the Khabarovsk Territory, Mikhail Degtyarev, for the first time after his appointment, came out to the protesters in support of the arrested former head of the region, Sergey Furgal.
The meeting was broadcast on his Instagram page.
"Moscow hears everyone, that's why it sent you an acting governor, so that the region does not slide without power...

According to Degtyarev, now the Khabarovsk Territory cannot remain without a leader, so he was appointed to the post of head of the region by decree of President Vladimir Putin, so that "the wonderful building (the regional government) functions, everything works, the budget is spent on social needs."
The acting governor explained that he did not go to the protesters earlier because he could not communicate with thousands of demonstrators.
So he broadcasts on social media and reads all the comments on them.
On July 25, two consecutive protests were held in Khabarovsk.
Rallies in support of the former governor have been held in the region since July 11.
On the eve of the next rally, Mikhail Degtyarev announced that he would leave the city on the day of the rally.
His motorcade was stopped by protesters who called on him to speak out about the fate of the arrested ex-governor Furgal.
Degtyarev had previously refused to meet with the protesters.
"There is actually something for the head to do than to go out and communicate with those who are shouting under the windows," the acting governor said.

Beautiful tall minarets adorned the Hagia Sophia
Once again about the Hagia Sophia - I came across a text by Fr Vladimir Zelinsky saying that we should protest.
First, there was free admission - hooray!
I have not been to Istanbul, but a free entrance to the House of God is better than a paid one.
Second, the Muslims conquered this land as honestly as the Orthodox conquered the Volga-Oka interfluve, the Muslim Caucasus (and put a church in Grozny) and planted apple trees on Mars.
God help us!
The Jews conquered the Holy Land.
The Americans conquered America.
Are we going to return everything to everyone?
Do you think there will be no pagans who will demand the return of their temple, on the site of which is the Church of the Tithes?
Thirdly, the Muslims improved the building and invested in it.
In other words, it belongs to them, just as the factories and estates that the Leninists seized from the bourgeoisie belong to the Leninists - Putin and the rest of the nomenklatura.
They improved everything from the Kremlin to the Angara, so it's all theirs by right of progressives.
The beautiful tall minarets decorated the Hagia Sophia very, very much.
There was a stupid inkwell, and then there was a stupid inkwell with beautiful minarets.
Fourth, there are no "Islamic" or "Orthodox" civilizations.
There are believers, there are hypocrites, there are hypocrites who combine faith and hypocrisy.
The believer does not think in terms of civilization.
This is the thinking of the British Foreign Office official Toynbee, a believer is ashamed to think so.
And for a believer, everywhere is a place of prayer.
And always.
The believer does not pray only where he is asked to leave, but goes to another place and prays there.
He is a believer, not a defender.
We are koloboks, not sullen stones.

Rwandan man admits to setting fire to Nantes cathedral
A native of Rwanda, who worked at the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul in the French city of Nantes on a voluntary basis, confessed to his arson a week after the fire.
This was reported on Sunday by France 3 television.
According to him, the man, who was already detained on July 19, the day after the fire, was detained again the day before.
He appeared before an investigating magistrate on Saturday evening.
After being charged with malicious damage to property, the man admitted to setting fires in three locations - under a large organ, under a small organ and near an electrical panel.
He now faces up to 10 years in prison and 150,000 euros in fines.
The motives of the 39-year-old Rwandan have not yet been reported.
It is only known that he voluntarily helped in the cathedral and had to close its doors on the day of the fire.
However, according to CCTV footage, he left the religious institution 15 minutes after receiving calls about a fire in the building.
A fire broke out in the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul on July 18.
More than 200 firefighters battled for hours to save the gothic monument.
However, they were unable to save the Louis XII stained glass windows and the unique Baroque organ.
The situation was brought under control only three hours after the fire started.
No one was injured in the incident.
The current fire is not the first during the existence of the temple.
In 1972, a fire destroyed its roof.
It took 13 years to clean up the aftermath of that fire.
The cathedral was reopened to parishioners only in 1985.

the decision to expand the RPL would not have been supported by either UEFA or FIFA
President of the Russian Football Union (RFU) Alexander Dyukov believes that expanding the Russian Premier League (RPL) to 18 teams is wrong at the moment.
"First of all, it was the RPL's decision, but I agree with it because it's not right to change the rules after the tournament is over.
It violates the integrity of the tournament and the sporting principle.
And, of course, this decision would not be supported by either UEFA or FIFA," Dyukov said after the Russian Cup final between Zenit and Khimki (1-0).
Currently, there are 16 clubs in the RPL, but an option to increase the number of teams to 18 was considered.

Kirilenko shares memories of playing with Bryant and Jordan in the NBA
The head of the Russian Basketball Federation (RBF) Andrei Kirilenko shared his memories of playing against the legendary Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan in National Basketball Association (NBA) matches.
I knew that Bryant's ego could not be hurt by some trash talk, so as not to stimulate his sports rage.
Kobe had a killer instinct, so on the court I tried to talk to him so that he did not perceive the game in an aggressive way.
I complimented him on the court: "Oh!
Kobe, well scored, great pass!
Listening to my enthusiastic responses, he slightly forgot about the need to once again pick up the ball and score another 3-4 points.
We communicated well with Kobe," Kirilenko told Vechernyaya Moskva.
He also talked about his first game against Jordan.
"I took care of him.
For the first three minutes of the match I was running around in complete awe of having a legend next to me that I had only seen on TV.
While I was breathless with joy, Michael scored a lot of points.
Soon I moved away from enthusiasm, covered his throws a couple of times...
In that game, my team won, but Jordan still scored 44 points," the head of the Russian Basketball Federation added.
Kirilenko spent 12 seasons in the NBA.
He was selected by the Utah Jazz with the 24th overall pick in the 1999 draft.
In addition to Utah, where he spent ten seasons, the Russian forward played for the Minnesota Timberwolves and Brooklyn Nets.
In a total of 797 games, he averaged 11.8 points, 5.5 rebounds, 2.7 assists and 1.8 blocks.
Earlier it was reported that Kirilenko will put forward his candidacy for the election of the head of the RFB.
Degtyarev surprised by information on purchase of Sakhalin-1 gas in dollars
The acting governor of the Khabarovsk Territory, Mikhail Degtyarev, on Sunday, July 26, during a meeting with residents of Sovetskaya Gavan, was surprised that the region buys Sakhalin gas produced by the American company Exxon Neftegas in dollars.
American gas is contracted in dollars until 2025.
"Honestly, I didn't know that, and I'm so blown away by that information.
I had no idea that this was still possible in 2020 in Russia," RIA Novosti quoted him as saying.
Degtyarev noted that this issue was discussed with Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak during his visit to Khabarovsk on July 24.
The acting governor also stressed that by 2025, Gazprom will switch to supplying Russian thermal power plants and capacities, which means that Russian gas purchased in rubles "at normal prices" will be used.
The Sakhalin-1 project is being implemented through a production sharing agreement, where Exxon Neftegas Ltd is the operator of the project with a 30% stake, Rosneft has another 20%, Japan's Sodeco has 30% and India's ONGC has 20%.
The Khabarovsk region has been purchasing gas from this project since 2005.

Actor of Russian TV series responds to accusations of "LGBT and feminist propaganda"
The actor of the Russian series "Chiki," whose creators were accused of "propaganda of LGBT and feminism," responded to the claims about the film.
The authors "understood the severity of the issues raised and did not want to offend anyone," said American Steven Thomas Ochsner in an interview with the publication "Rise."
"It seems to me that this is a story about power and the general aspects of human life.
It has nothing to do with LGBT and feminism," said the actor, who played the father of a boy who dressed in women's clothes.
He stressed that he was "proud of the work" and did not consider it propaganda.
At the same time, the American added, he is frightened by the reaction of some people to the storyline of the series: for example, there was a case when "a man in a deep binge shot the set and said that all this was not true."
"Then there were a couple of cases when we met disgruntled locals who didn't understand what we were doing.
But we were open, so people who first came with complaints started helping us," he concluded.
The case of shooting, the publication explains, occurred in September 2019 in Kabardino-Balkaria: a drunk man attacked the car of the film crew with a weapon, after which he was detained by police officers.
Earlier it was reported that the public commissioner for the protection of the family, Olga Baranets, sent a complaint to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Roskomnadzor about the service more.tv, which posted the Russian series "Cheeky."
Baranets accused the creators of the series of "propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations and feminism," drawing attention to the fact that the main characters of the film work as prostitutes, and the series itself contains "scenes of physical and psychological violence."
The ombudsman was also outraged by the fact that "the series pays a lot of attention to the homosexual sexual orientation" of a minor character.
The comedy-drama "Cheeky" tells the story of three prostitutes who start a new life and open a business on the advice of a friend.
