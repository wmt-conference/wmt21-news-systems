Hurricane Hannah alerts two Mexican states

The hurricane will bring heavy downpours to Mexico, with some areas predicting between 150 and 250 litres of rain per square metre.
The authorities have prepared about 800 shelters for the population.
Ten thousand people, including rescuers, National Guard soldiers and the military, will provide assistance to people.

Hannah's arrival in Mexico is expected Sunday morning.
Semilarski vs. the prosecutor's office: the cassation of the former deputy mayor of Tartu will be considered on August 4
This means that a decision on it is likely to be made in early September.
The courts of the first two instances refused to consider Semilarski's claim, but the Supreme Court accepted his cassation appeal in April.
On December 12, 2019, the Tartu Administrative Court returned the complaint to the applicant, since its resolution does not fall within his competence as an administrative court.
The court ruling stated that the complaint contains a claim for compensation for damage caused during criminal proceedings.
"The prosecutor's office and the county court should regulate such issues," Anett Kreitsmann, spokeswoman for the Tartu courts, previously explained to the ERR correspondent.
According to her, Valvo Semilarski appealed this decision in the district court, which on February 5 did not change the decision of the court of first instance.
Now the State Court will have to say its word.
According to Semilarski's lawyer, sworn lawyer Oliver Niaes, his client was unreasonably suspected of bribery for about two years.
Now he demands that the prosecutor's office refute the incorrect allegations against him and compensate him for moral damage.
The reason for filing a complaint with the court was the statements of the prosecutor for special cases of the Lyunas district prosecutor's office, Margus Gross, made by him in October 2017, when Semilarski, together with the then other deputy mayor of Tartu, Artem Suvorov, was detained on suspicion of committing several crimes.
"Recall that when I was detained, the Security Police and the Prosecutor's Office immediately organized a press conference and informed the whole Republic of Estonia that the leaders of Tartu - one of the most influential local government bodies - were corrupt.
These public suspicions hanging in the air accompanied me for about two years.
And now, when these allegations and suspicions turned out to be false, the prosecutor's office does not want to say anything about it, "Semilarski commented in early August 2019.
According to Oliver Niaes, at a press conference, the prosecutor went beyond the legal framework within which the prosecutor's office should operate.
"The allegation of bribery and corruption turned out to be false, but this is not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly stressed in its rulings on Russia, as well as on Lithuania, that during the investigation phase, representatives of the state should be careful when choosing words, so that suspects would not be presented as criminals before sentencing.
The prosecutor's office is also obliged to do this by the presumption of innocence, which, unfortunately, was not observed in this case against Valvo Semilarski, "Niaes said.
"The public presentation of Semilarski as a serious offender and bribe-taker in circumstances where the facts underlying the suspicion of bribery are still being clarified is unacceptable, which contradicts the presumption of innocence and is unfair to the applicant," the lawyer added.
As rus.err.ee wrote, the former deputy mayor of Tartu, Valvo Semilarski, will not be prosecuted on bribery charges - the criminal case against him was partially closed in July.
At the same time, the former official is being tried on charges of deliberately violating anti-corruption legislation when conducting transactions on a particularly large scale.
According to the indictment, between 2015 and 2017, the former deputy mayor of Tartu participated more than thirty times in meetings of the city council when making decisions related to companies operating in Tartu, with whose owners or managers Semilarski actively communicated on a personal level outside working hours.
According to Gross, in all these cases Semilarski had personal interests, and therefore he had to withdraw from participation in decision-making.
Earlier, as rus.err.ee wrote, the prosecutor's office presented Semilarski with suspicions of receiving a bribe and violating anti-corruption legislation when conducting transactions on a particularly large scale.
This happened in October 2016, when he was detained together with another deputy mayor, Artem Suvorov (Centre Party).
At that time, the prosecutor's office and the Security Police stated that there was strong evidence against both deputy mayors.
After that, both officials resigned.
Suvorov's case later reached the court, which fully acquitted the politician.
The judicial investigation into the case of Valvo Semilarski is still ongoing.
Ex-soloist of the group "Hands Up" visited the Tver region
Former soloist of the group "Hands Up," and now solo performer, businessman and actor Sergei Zhukov posted a photo from Kalyazin, Tver region, on his official Instagram account.

U.S. urges Qatar and its neighbors to end dispute
It is necessary to restore trust and unity between Qatar and other states, U.S. Special Representative for Iran Brian Hook believes.
He said the conflict between the emirate and other countries in the region has been going on for too long and harms regional interests in stability, prosperity and security.
So far, the US has tried unsuccessfully to mediate a settlement of the dispute, which Washington views as "a threat to efforts to contain Iran."
Diplomatic relations with Qatar were severed three years ago by the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Bahrain.
They imposed a transport blockade, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorism.
In response, Doha said that neighbors are simply jealous of Qatar's economic success - according to the IMF, Qatar has been leading by a wide margin in GDP per capita for several years.
The Emirate is the third largest exporter of natural gas, the sixth largest exporter of natural gas and a major exporter of oil and oil products.

How the Central Bank's decision to reduce the key rate will affect the economy
The Bank of Russia is expected to cut the key rate again.
It fell another 0.25 percentage points, to 4.25% per annum - formally another historic low.
Judging by the return of the short rate cut step, as well as the tone of the Central Bank's statements and updated forecasts for the Russian economy, the regulator looks at economic prospects more optimistically than before.
This means that the current cycle of monetary easing may soon come to a halt.
"We continued to soften monetary policy, primarily given that there are still risks of inflation deviating from 4% in 2021," said the head of the Bank of Russia, Elvira Nabiullina.
They are associated with a significant decline in economic activity, a fall in domestic and external demand.
According to Nabiullina, economic recovery will take more than a year and a half.
At the same time, she noted that after the lifting of restrictions due to the pandemic, economic processes revived: energy consumption, consumer and investment demand were restored, construction and production of consumer goods expanded, and the annual rate of decline in freight turnover of transport and industrial production slowed.
According to the updated forecast of the Central Bank, in 2020 the economy will shrink by 4.5-5.5% (previously 4-6% was expected), and the economic recovery in 2021 will amount to 3.5-4.5%, in 2022 - 2.5-3.5%.
In addition, the Bank of Russia revised its forecast for annual oil prices to $38 and $40 per barrel of Urals in 2020 and 2021, respectively.
Previously, the Central Bank expected $27 and $35 per barrel.
Finally, the Bank of Russia's inflation forecast for 2020 amounted to 3.7-4.2% against the previously expected 3.8-4.8%.
The Bank of Russia's view of the economic situation is becoming more optimistic, which brings us closer to the end of the easing cycle, according to economists for Russia and the CIS Renaissance Capital, Sofia Donets and Andrei Melashchenko.
Thus, the Bank of Russia has been consistently reducing the key rate for more than a year, since the beginning of last summer it has already fallen by 3.5 percentage points.
And at the last meeting in June, the Central Bank lowered it immediately by one percentage point due to low inflation rates due to depressed demand and the need to stimulate the economy, which slowed down due to the pandemic and related restrictions.
The chances of fine-tuning monetary policy remain (at the next meeting on September 18 and until the end of the year), but the limit is already close, agrees the chief analyst of Rosbank, Evgeny Koshelev.
The combination of pro-inflationary risks also points to the proximity of a pause in easing interest rate policy - disrupted supply chains, possible cost increases due to epidemic prevention measures and a faster (than expected) recovery in demand, he says.
To top it off, the Bank of Russia's subsequent actions will require greater attention to inflationary processes during the harvest season, as well as external volatility, which has increased amid geopolitical conflicts, Koshelev points out.
One way or another, a reduction in the key rate will lead to a further reduction in rates for the most reliable borrowers, as well as, possibly, on mortgages, says Maxim Petronevich, senior economist at the analytical department of Otkritie Bank.
The adjustment of rates will be less pronounced than the reduction of the key rate, he clarifies.

Poll: The ruling Union of Peasants and Greens of Lithuania once again topped the rating of parties
The Union of Peasants and Greens of Lithuania, which heads the ruling coalition of the Seimas, topped the rating of parties.
This was shown by a survey conducted by the sociological research company Vilmorus since the order of the newspaper Lietuvos rytas.
After winning the 2016 parliamentary elections, the "peasants" lost first place and for a long time led the main critic of Russia in Lithuania, the opposition "Fatherland Union - Christian Democrats (Conservatives).
However, recently, the President of Lithuania, Gitanas Nauseda, assessing the electoral possibilities of the parties, stated that the Union of Peasants and Greens, after this year's parliamentary elections, will probably be able to form a coalition again.
The announcement sparked outrage from conservatives.
The latest poll showed that if parliamentary elections were held today, 17.6 percent of voters would vote for peasants and 17.2 percent for conservatives.
According to Vilmorus director Vladas Gaidis, the gap is within the margin of error, and yet the ruling parties have stopped lagging behind the conservatives.
According to Gaidis, the sociological success of the "peasants" was facilitated by the news that their electoral list will be headed by Prime Minister Saulus Skvernjalis.
This politician was first on the list of "peasants" in the 2016 elections.
In third place is the Social Democratic Party, for which 7.1 percent of respondents are now ready to vote.
During the month, it unexpectedly lost 2 percent.
The fourth is the Labour Party, headed by a businessman of Russian origin, Viktor Uspaskikh (6.2 percent).
The rest of the political organizations, judging by the poll, will not yet be able to overcome the 5 percent electoral barrier.

Excess requirements for applications for public procurement will be excluded by law
The law may establish exhaustive requirements for applications for participation in procurement.
In the autumn session, at the plenary session of the State Duma, it is planned to consider in the second reading a bill establishing requirements for the content and composition of an application for participation in the procurement, the participants of which can only be small and medium-sized businesses.
Amendments are being made by the government to the law "On the procurement of goods, works and services by certain types of legal entities."
The bill was developed in compliance with the roadmap for the implementation of the Strategy for the Development of Small and Medium Enterprises in the Russian Federation until 2030, approved by the government.
It provides for the preparation of a draft law on an exhaustive list of documents that customers have the right to require as part of an application from procurement participants - small and medium-sized businesses.
And also - on the list of requirements for these documents.
To date, the law "On the procurement of goods, works, services by certain types of legal entities" provides a framework for regulating the procurement activities of certain types of legal entities.
The requirements for the content, form, registration and composition of the application for participation in the procurement are established by the customers themselves in the procurement documentation.
"As a result, customers establish excessive requirements for the content, registration of an application, the mandatory presence in its composition of certificates, certificates, extracts, the period of receipt of which in the authorized bodies is comparable to the period of submission of applications, which leads to the impossibility of participating in such a procurement and a reduction in the number of participants in the procurement," the explanation to the bill reads.
The new bill provides for the establishment of an exhaustive list of documents that customers have the right to require as part of an application from procurement participants who are small and medium-sized businesses.
"The adoption of the document will eliminate the arbitrary establishment by customers of requirements for the composition and content of applications of participants who are subjects of small and medium-sized businesses," the explanatory note says.

First of all, the construction of the Sports House in Ust-Orda has been resumed.
The order for this facility was given by the President of the Russian Federation fourteen years ago.
But only now has the situation been brought to a standstill.
866 million roubles will be spent on construction.
The deadline for delivery of the structure is 2022.
And already this year, a school in the village of Bayandai should be put into operation.
At the moment, the finishing of the premises has been completed.
Of the remaining works - landscaping.
In general, the programme for the construction of preschool and secondary education facilities is of particular importance for the region.
For your district in particular.
The demographic situation here is the best in the region.
And we must create all conditions for the education and leisure of children of all ages, noted Igor Kobzev, Acting Governor of Irkutsk Region.
At the meeting, the head of the region instructed all mayors to actively engage in the development of master plans for human settlements.
This is one of the main conditions for the comprehensive development of the district.
All settlements must have established boundaries and a master plan.
This is necessary for the development of the territory, for the construction of socially significant facilities, as well as infrastructure and cultural heritage, the head of the region stressed.
Also, during the conversation, a problematic issue was raised with a 30% reduction in milk intake from cooperatives.
This was due to the redistribution by the processing enterprise of the purchase of milk in favor of peasant farms.
Because of this, the share of receiving products from cooperatives has decreased.
The head of the region instructed the acting minister of agriculture to go to the site, study the structure of milk sales, analyze the experience of other territories and determine options for solving the problem.

Moscow Region Authorities Tell About Fate of Closed Landfills
Solid municipal waste landfills continue to be closed in the Moscow region.
This year, the authorities promise to eliminate the latter.
Some of the 39 existing landfills in the region are being modernized into modern waste processing complexes.
But this option is not possible for every landfill - many of them have grown into dense residential development.
After the landfill is closed, it rises for recultivation - the body of the landfill is poured with soil, gas-freeing and infiltration systems are installed.
This makes it possible to stop chemical processes inside the landfill, so that it does not ignite, does not emit stench, does not poison the soil and groundwater.
And then the former landfill remains elevated by a useless pile among the residential buildings that surrounded it.
Why not make something useful out of it?
For example, in Ruz, where the recultivation of the Annino test site was completed just the other day, the authorities are considering the option of making a ski slope out of a pile.
The landfill, which operated from 1976 to 2016, has grown beyond the boundaries of the land allocated for it.
Therefore, during the recultivation, it was necessary to buy out neighboring plots, de facto already clogged with garbage for a long time.
"Some time will pass, the test site will" sit down, "fortresses will be built, and we will think what can be done to make it begin to benefit.
A ski resort catches the eye, "Nikolai Parfyonov, head of the Ruz district, told reporters.
Two landfills will become sites for the production of renewable energy sources
Torbeevo landfills in Lyubertsy and Timokhovo in Bogorodsky District will become sites for the production of renewable energy sources from landfill and biological gases.
By the end of the year, a gas-piston power plant will be launched on the territory of Torbeyev, capable of generating up to 8 million kilowatt-hours of electricity and about 0.95 gigacalories of thermal energy per year, which will provide for the landfill's own needs - heat supply to administrative and industrial premises.
Timokhovo will produce 72.5 million kilowatt-hours and will continue to operate as a garbage processing complex.
A museum could be created at Balashikha's Kuchino test site, which was closed after residents complained about the Straight Line with the country's president.
"There was such an idea - to create a museum for the recultivation of landfills near Moscow," said Deputy Prime Minister - Minister of Ecology and Natural Resources of the region Dmitry Kurakin.
Israel reports drone crash in southern Lebanon

Beautiful tall minarets only adorned Ayia Sofia
Once again about Ayia Sofia - the text of Fr. Vladimir Zelinsky came across that supposedly it is necessary to protest.
First, there was free entry - cheers!
I haven't been to Istanbul, but it's better to have a free entrance to the House of God than a paid one.
Second, the Muslims conquered this land just as honestly as the Orthodox conquered the Volga-Okskoye inter-river, the Muslim Caucasus (and set up a church in Grozny) and planted apple trees on Mars.
God help us!
The Jews conquered the Holy Land.
The Americans conquered America.
Will we return everything to everyone?
Do you think that there will be no Gentiles who will demand the return of their capital, in the place of which is the Tithe Church?
Third, Muslims have improved the building and invested in it.
That is, it is theirs, just as the factories and estates that Leninists took from the bourgeoisie into their property belong to Leninists - Putin and other nomenklatura.
They've improved everything from the Kremlin to Angara, so it's all their rightful progressives.
Beautiful tall minarets very decorated Ayia Sofia, very much.
There was a stupid ink box, there was a stupid ink box with beautiful minarets.
Fourthly, there are no "Islamic" or "Orthodox" civilizations.
There are believers, there are hypocrites, there are khanges that unite faith and hypocrisy.
A believer in the categories of civilization does not think.
This is the thinking of British Foreign Office official Toynbee, who believes it is a shame to think so.
And to the believer there is a place of prayer everywhere.
And always.
A believer does not only pray where he is asked to leave - he leaves for another place and prays there.
He is a believer, not a defender.
We are koloboks, not sullen stones.

A Rwandan confessed to setting fire to a cathedral in Nantes

the decision to expand the RPL would not be supported by either UEFA or FIFA
The president of the Russian Football Union (RFU), Alexander Dukov, believes that it is currently wrong to expand the Russian Premier League (RPL) to 18 teams.
"First of all, it was the decision of the RPL, but I will agree with it, because it is wrong to change the rules after the tournament is over.

The acting governor of Khabarovsk Krai, Mikhail Degtyarev, on Sunday, July 26, during a meeting with residents of Soviet Harbour, was surprised that the region buys Sakhalin gas produced by the American company Exxon Neftegas for dollars.
American gas is contracted in dollars until 2025.
"Honestly, I didn't know it, and I'm in such a knockdown because of this information.
I had no idea that this was still possible in 2020 in Russia, "RIA Novosti quoted him as saying.
Degtyarev noted that this issue was discussed with the head of the Ministry of Energy of Russia Alexander Novak during his visit to Khabarovsk on July 24.
The acting governor also stressed that by 2025, Gazprom will switch to supplying Russian thermal power plants and facilities, which means that Russian gas purchased in rubles "at normal prices" will be used.
The Sakhalin-1 project is being implemented through a production sharing agreement, where Exxon Neftegas Ltd is the operator of the project with a 30% stake, Rosneft has another 20%, Japan's Sodeco 30% and India's ONGC 20%.
The Khabarovsk Territory has been acquiring gas from this project since 2005.

Actor of Russian TV series responds to accusations of "propaganda of LGBT and feminism"
The actor of the Russian TV series "Chiki," whose creators were accused of "propaganda of LGBT and feminism," responded to the claims against the film.
The authors "understood the severity of the issues raised and did not want to offend anyone," said American Stephen Thomas Oxner in an interview with the publication "Rise."
"It seems to me that this is a story about strength and general aspects of human life.
This has nothing to do with LGBT and feminism, "said the actor, who played the father of a boy who dressed in women's clothing.
He stressed that he is "proud of the work" and does not consider it propaganda.
At the same time, the American added, he is frightened by the reaction of some people to the storyline of the series: for example, there was a case when "a man in deep breath shot the set and said that all this was not true."
"Then there were a couple of cases where we met disgruntled locals who didn't understand what we were doing.
But we were open, so people who first came with claims began to help us, "he concluded.
The shooting incident, the publication explains, occurred in September 2019 in Kabardino-Balkaria: a drunk man attacked a film crew car with a weapon, after which he was detained by police officers.
Earlier it was reported that the public commissioner for the protection of the family, Olga Baranets, sent a complaint to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Roskomnadzor about the service more.tv, which hosted the Russian series "Chiki."
Baranets accused the creators of the series of "propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations and feminism," noting that the main characters of the film work as prostitutes, and the series itself contains "scenes of physical and psychological violence."
The ombudsman was also outraged that "the series pays a lot of attention to the homosexual sexual orientation" of the minor character.
The comedy drama "Chicky" tells about three prostitutes who started a new life and opened a business on the advice of a girlfriend.
