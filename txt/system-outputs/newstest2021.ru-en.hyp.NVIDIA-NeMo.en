Hurricane Hanna alerts in two Mexican states

The hurricane will bring heavy downpours to Mexico, with 150 to 250 litres of rainfall per square meter forecast in some areas.
Authorities have prepared about 800 shelters for the population.
Ten thousand people, including rescuers, members of the National Guard and the military, will provide assistance to people.
So far, the hurricane has reached the coast of the U.S. state of Texas with winds of 150 km / h.

Semilarski against the prosecutor's office: the appeal of the former deputy mayor of Tartu will be considered on August 4
This means that a decision on it is likely to be made in early September.
The courts of the first two instances refused to consider Semilarski's claim, but in April, the Supreme Court accepted his appeal.
On December 12, 2019, the Tartu Administrative Court returned the complaint to the applicant, as its resolution does not fall within the competence of the administrative court.
The court ruling stated that the complaint contained a claim for compensation for damage caused in the course of criminal proceedings.
"It is up to the prosecutor's office and the county court to regulate such matters," Anette Kreitsmann, press secretary for the Tartu courts, previously explained to ERR.
According to her, Valvo Semilarski appealed the ruling to the district court, which did not change the decision of the court of first instance on February 5.
Now the State Court will have to say its word.
According to Semilarski's defense attorney, attorney-at-law Oliver Nez, his client was unjustifiably suspected of bribery for about two years.
Now he is demanding that the prosecutor's office refute the false allegations against him and compensate him for moral damages.
The reason for filing a complaint with the court was the statements made by the prosecutor for special cases of the Luunas District Prosecutor's Office, Margus Gross, in October 2017, when Semilarski, along with another at the time vice-mayor of Tartu, Artem Suvorov, was detained on suspicion of having committed several crimes.
"Let us recall that when I was detained, the Security Police and the prosecutor's office immediately organized a press conference and informed the entire Republic of Estonia that the leaders of Tartu, one of the most influential local government bodies, were corrupt.
These public suspicions, hanging in the air, accompanied me for about two years.
And now that these allegations and suspicions have turned out to be false, the prosecutor's office does not want to say anything about it, "Semilarski commented in early August 2019.
According to Oliver Nez, at the press conference, the prosecutor went beyond the legal framework within which the prosecutor's office should operate.
"The allegation of bribery and corruption has turned out to be false, but this is not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly stressed in its rulings on Russia, as well as on Lithuania, that at the stage of the investigation, representatives of the state must be careful when choosing their words, so that suspects are not presented as criminals before sentencing.
The prosecutor's office is also bound by the presumption of innocence, which, unfortunately, was not respected in this case against Valvo Semilarski, "Nez said.
"The public portrayal of Semilarski as a serious offender and bribe-taker in circumstances where the facts underlying the suspicion of bribery are still being clarified is unacceptable, contrary to the presumption of innocence and unfair to the applicant," the lawyer added.
According to rus.err.ee, the former deputy mayor of Tartu, Valvo Semilarski, will not be prosecuted on charges of bribery - the criminal case against him was partially closed in July.
At the same time, the former official is being tried on charges of knowingly violating anti-corruption legislation when conducting transactions on a particularly large scale.
According to the indictment, between 2015 and 2017, the former deputy mayor of Tartu participated more than thirty times in meetings of the city council when making decisions related to companies operating in Tartu, with the owners or managers of which Semilarski actively communicated on a personal level during off-hours.
According to Gross, Semilarski had personal interests in all of these cases, and therefore he had to withdraw from decision-making.
Earlier, as rus.err.ee wrote, the prosecutor's office presented Semilarski with suspicions of taking bribes and violating anti-corruption legislation when conducting transactions in particularly large amounts.
This happened in October 2016, when he was detained along with another deputy mayor, Artem Suvorov (Centre Party).
At that time, the prosecutor's office and the Security Police said that there was strong evidence against the two vice-mayors.
After that, both officials resigned.
The case of Suvorov later reached the court, which fully acquitted the politician.
The judicial investigation into the Valvo Semilarski case is still ongoing.
The former soloist of the group "Hands Up" visited the Tver region
The former soloist of the group "Hands Up," and now a solo performer, businessman and actor, Sergei hukov, posted on his official Instagram account a photo from Kalyazin in the Tver region.

U.S. calls on atar and its neighbors to end the dispute
It is necessary to restore trust and unity between atar and other states, believes U.S. Special Representative for Iran Brian Hook.
He said the conflict between the emirate and other countries in the region has been going on for too long and is damaging regional interests in stability, prosperity and security.
So far, the US has unsuccessfully tried to mediate a dispute that Washington views as "a threat to efforts to contain Iran."
Diplomatic relations with atar were severed three years ago by the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Bahrain.
They imposed a transport blockade, accusing atar of supporting terrorism.
In response, Doha said that its neighbors are simply jealous of atar's economic success - according to the IMF, atar has been leading in terms of GDP per capita for several years by a wide margin.
The Emirate is the third largest exporter of natural gas, the sixth largest exporter of natural gas and a major exporter of oil and petroleum products.

How will the decision of the Central Bank to reduce the key rate affect the economy?
The Bank of Russia expectedly cut its key rate again.
It dropped another 0.25 percentage points, to 4.25 per annum - formally the next historical low.
Judging by the return of the short rate cut, as well as the tone of the Central Bank's statements and updated forecasts for the Russian economy, the regulator is looking at economic prospects more optimistically than before.
This means that the current cycle of monetary easing may soon come to a halt.
"We have continued to soften the monetary policy, especially given that there are still risks of inflation falling below 4 in 2021," the head of the Bank of Russia, Elvira Nabiullina, said.
They are associated with a significant decline in economic activity and a fall in domestic and external demand.
Economic recovery, according to Nabiullina, will take more than a year and a half.
At the same time, she noted that after the lifting of restrictions due to the pandemic, economic processes have revived: energy consumption, consumer and investment demand have recovered, construction and production of consumer goods have expanded, and the annual rate of decline in the turnover of transport and industrial production has slowed.
According to the updated forecast of the Central Bank, in 2020 the economy will shrink by 4.5-5.5 (previously it was expected to be 4-6), and the recovery growth of the economy in 2021 will be 3.5-4.5, and in 2022 - 2.5-3.5.
In addition, the Bank of Russia has revised its forecast for annual oil prices to 38 and 40 per barrel of Urals in 2020 and 2021, respectively.
Previously, the Central Bank expected 27 and 35 dollars per barrel.
Finally, the Bank of Russia's inflation forecast for 2020 was 3.7-4.2, compared to the previously expected 3.8-4.8.
The Bank of Russia's view of the situation in the economy is becoming more optimistic, which brings us closer to the end of the cycle of easing, according to Renaissance Capital economists for Russia and the CIS, Sofia Donets and Andrei Melashchenko.
Thus, the Bank of Russia has been consistently lowering its key rate for more than a year; since the beginning of last summer, it has already dropped by 3.5 percentage points.
And at the last meeting in June, the Central Bank lowered it by one percentage point at once because of low inflation rates due to depressed demand and the need to stimulate the economy, which has been slowing down due to the pandemic and related restrictions.
The chances of fine-tuning the monetary policy remain (at the next meeting on September 18 and before the end of the year), but the limit is already close, agrees the chief analyst of Rosbank, Evgeny Koshelev.
The combination of pro-inflationary risks also points to a near pause in interest rate policy easing - disrupted supply chains, possible cost increases due to epidemic prevention measures, and a faster-than-expected recovery in demand, he says.
On top of that, the Bank of Russia's subsequent actions will require greater attention to inflationary processes during the harvest season, as well as external volatility, which has increased amid geopolitical conflicts, points out Koshelev.
One way or another, a reduction in the key rate will lead to a further reduction in rates for the most reliable borrowers, as well as, possibly, on mortgages, says Maksim Petronevich, senior economist at the analytical department of Otkritie Bank.
The adjustment of rates will be less pronounced than the reduction of the key rate, he clarifies.
Rates on consumer loans could fall by another 0.3-0.6 percentage points during the second half of the year, mortgage rates could end the year in the range of 6.2-7, says Anton Pokatovich, an economist at BKS Premier.
Average interest rates on deposits, in his opinion, will also fall - in the coming months they could fall to 4.2-4.5 (now barely above 4.5).
Further, they could drop to 4 if the Central Bank lowers the key rate in the autumn, believes Pokatovich.

Earlier, it became known that the party of the prime minister returned 110,100 euros to the state, which were recognized as a prohibited donation.

Poll: Lithuania's ruling Union of Farmers and Greens again tops party ratings
The Union of Peasants and Greens of Lithuania, which heads the ruling coalition of the Seimas, headed the rating of parties.
This was shown by a survey conducted by the sociological research company Vilmorus since the order of the newspaper Lietuvos rytas.
After winning the 2016 parliamentary elections, the "peasants" lost first place and, for a long time, the main critic of Russia in Lithuania, the opposition Fatherland Union - Christian Democrats (Conservatives), was in the lead.
However, recently, the President of Lithuania, Gitanas Nauseda, assessing the electoral capabilities of the parties, said that the Union of Peasants and the Greens, after this year's parliamentary elections, will probably be able to form a coalition again.
The announcement sparked outrage among the Conservatives.
The latest poll showed that if parliamentary elections were held today, 17.6 percent of voters would vote for the peasants and 17.2 percent for the Conservatives.
According to the director of Vilmorus, Vladas Gaidis, the gap is within the margin of error, and yet the ruling party has stopped lagging behind the conservatives.
According to Gaidis, the news that Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis will head their electoral list contributed to the sociological success of the "peasants."
This politician was also the first on the list of "peasants" in the 2016 elections.
In third place is the Social Democratic Party, for which 7.1 percent of respondents are now ready to vote.
In a month, it unexpectedly lost 2 percent.
The fourth is the Labour Party, headed by a Russian-born businessman, Viktor Uspaskikh (6.2 percent).
According to the poll, other political organizations will not be able to overcome the 5 per cent electoral threshold.

Unnecessary requirements for public procurement applications will be eliminated by law
The law may establish exhaustive requirements for applications to participate in the procurement.
In the autumn session, at a plenary session of the State Duma, it is planned to consider in the second reading a bill establishing requirements for the content and composition of an application for participation in the procurement, which only small and medium-sized businesses can participate in.
Amendments are being made by the government to the law "On the procurement of goods, works and services by certain types of legal entities."
The bill is designed to implement the roadmap for the implementation of the Strategy for the Development of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises in the Russian Federation until 2030, approved by the government.
It provides for the preparation of a draft law on an exhaustive list of documents that customers are entitled to demand as part of an application from procurement participants - small and medium-sized businesses.
And also about the list of requirements for these documents.
Currently, the law "On the procurement of goods, works and services by certain types of legal entities" provides a framework for regulating the procurement activities of certain types of legal entities.
The requirements for the content, form, design and composition of the application for participation in the procurement are established by the customers themselves in the procurement documentation.
"As a result, customers are setting excessive requirements for the content, registration of the application, the mandatory presence of certificates, certificates, and extracts in its composition, the deadline for receiving them in the authorized bodies is comparable to the deadline for submitting applications, which leads to the impossibility of participating in such a procurement and a reduction in the number of participants in the procurement," reads the explanation to the bill.
The new bill provides for the establishment of an exhaustive list of documents that customers have the right to demand as part of an application from procurement participants who are small and medium-sized businesses.
"The adoption of the document will prevent customers from arbitrarily establishing requirements for the composition and content of applications by participants who are small and medium-sized businesses," the explanatory note reads.

US experts call Pompeo the worst secretary of state in the country's history
International affairs experts Aaron David Miller and Richard Sokolski have named Mike Pompeo the worst secretary of state in the history of the United States.
The article with their opinion was published by CNN on July 23.
"In just two short years, Mike Pompeo - with an eye on the presidency in 2024 and support for President Donald Trump - has become not only the worst secretary of state in U.S. history, but also the most politically biased," the text says.
Experts accused Pompeo of "politicizing the office of Secretary of State and desecrating the institution he runs" in order to advance his personal political agenda and protect Trump "from accountability and the rule of law."

The head of the region, Igor Kobzev, met with the mayors of the Ust-Orda Buryat district
During the workshop, which took place today, July 24, the government of Irkutsk region discussed the main directions for the development of remote agricultural areas.
During working visits to the districts of the Ust-Orda Buryat District, the head of the region gave a number of instructions.
Today, the mayors reported on their performance.
First of all, the construction of the Sports House in Ust-Orda has been resumed.
The instruction for this facility was given by the President of the Russian Federation fourteen years ago.
But only now has the situation been broken.
866 million rubles will be spent on construction.
The completion date for the construction is 2022.
And already this year, a school in the village of Bayandai should be put into operation.
At the moment, the finishing of the premises has been completed.
Of the remaining work - landscaping.
In general, the programme for the construction of preschool and secondary education facilities is of particular importance for the region.
For your district in particular.
The demographic situation here is the best in the region.
And we are obliged to create all conditions for the education and leisure of children of all ages, said the acting Governor of Irkutsk Region, Igor Kobzev.
At the meeting, the head of the region instructed all mayors to actively engage in the work on the development of master plans for human settlements.
This is one of the main conditions for the comprehensive development of the district.
All settlements must have established boundaries and a master plan.
This is necessary for the development of the territory, for the construction of socially significant facilities, as well as infrastructure and cultural heritage, the head of the region stressed.
Also, during the conversation, a problematic issue was raised with the reduction of milk intake from cooperatives by 30.
This was due to the redistribution by the processing company of the purchase of milk in favor of peasant farms.
Because of this, the share of production intake from cooperatives has declined.
The head of the region instructed the acting minister of agriculture to visit the site, study the structure of milk sales, analyze the experience of other territories and identify options for solving the problem.

Moscow region authorities told about the fate of closed landfills
In the Moscow region, solid waste landfills continue to be closed.
This year, the authorities promise to eliminate the latter.
Some of the 39 existing landfills in the region are being upgraded into modern waste processing facilities.
But this option is not possible for every landfill - many of them are overgrown with dense residential development.
After the landfill is closed, it is reclaimed - the body of the landfill is filled with soil, degassing and infiltration removal systems are installed.
This makes it possible to stop chemical processes inside the landfill, so that it does not ignite, emit stench, or poison the soil and groundwater.
And then the former landfill is left to rise in a useless heap among the residential buildings surrounding it.
Why not make it something useful?
For example, in Ruza, where the recultivation of the Annino landfill was just recently completed, the authorities are considering the option of making a ski slope out of a pile.
The landfill, which operated from 1976 to 2016, has grown beyond the boundaries of the land allocated to it.
Therefore, during recultivation, it was necessary to buy out the neighboring areas, which, in fact, have long been clogged with garbage to the eyeballs.
"Some time will pass, the site will" settle down, "and we will think about what can be done to make it useful.
It is a ski resort that catches the eye, "the head of the Ruz district, Nikolai Parfyonov, told journalists.
Two landfills will become sites for the production of renewable energy sources
The Torbeevo landfills in Lyubertsy and Timokhovo in Bogorodsky District will become sites for the production of renewable energy sources from landfill and biological gases.
By the end of the year, a gas piston power plant capable of generating up to 8 million kilowatt-hours of electricity and about 0.95 gigacalories of thermal energy per year will be launched on the territory of Torbeev, which will provide the landfill with its own needs - heat supply for administrative and industrial premises.
Timokhovo will produce 72.5 million kilowatt-hours and will continue to operate as a waste treatment facility.
And a museum could be created at the Balashikha Kuchino training ground, which was closed after residents complained about the "direct line" with the president of the country.
"There was such an idea - to create a museum of recultivation of landfills in the Moscow region," said Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Ecology and Natural Resources of the region Dmitry Kurakin.
Israel reports drone crash in southern Lebanon
An Israeli army unmanned aerial vehicle crashed in southern Lebanon.

According to Degtyarev, now the Khabarovsk Territory cannot remain without a leader, so he was appointed to the post of head of the region by decree of President Vladimir Putin, so that "the wonderful building (the regional government) functions, everything works, the budget is spent on social needs."
The acting governor explained that he had not gone to the protesters before because he could not communicate with thousands of demonstrators.
That is why he broadcasts on social media and reads all the comments on them.

Beautiful high minarets only decorated Ayia Sofia
Once again, about Hagia Sophia, there was a text by Fr. Vladimir elinsky, which, they say, should be protested.
First of all, there was a free entrance - cheers
I haven't been to Istanbul, but free admission to the House of God is better than a paid one.
Secondly, the Muslims have just as honestly conquered this land as the Orthodox have conquered the Volga-Oka region, the Muslim Caucasus (and set up a church in Grozny) and planted apple trees on Mars.
God is to help
Jews conquered the Holy Land.
The Americans conquered America.
Will we return everything to everyone?
Do you think there will be no pagans who will demand the return of their temple, in the place of which the Tithe Church?
Thirdly, the Muslims improved the building and invested in it.
That is, it belongs to the Leninists - Putin and other nomenklatura - just like the factories and estates that the Leninists took from the bourgeoisie as their property.
They have improved everything - from the Kremlin to Angara, so it's all their rightful progressors.
The beautiful tall minarets decorated Ayia Sofia very much, very much.
There was a silly inkwell, there was a silly inkwell with beautiful minarets.
Fourth, there are no "Islamic" or "Orthodox" civilizations.
There are believers, there are hypocrites, there are hypocrites who combine faith and hypocrisy.
The believer does not think in terms of civilization.
This is the mindset of British Foreign Office official Toynbee, who is ashamed to think like this.
And there is a place of prayer for believers everywhere.
And always.
The believer does not pray only where he is asked to leave - he leaves for another place and prays there.
He is a believer, not a defender.
We are koloboks, not sullen stones.

The actor of the Russian TV series responded to accusations of "propaganda of LGBT and feminism"
The actor of the Russian TV series "Chiki," whose creators were accused of "promoting LGBT and feminism," responded to the complaints about the film.
The authors "understood the severity of the issues raised and did not want to offend anyone," American Stephen Thomas Oxner said in an interview with the publication "The Rise."
"It seems to me that this is a story about strength and general aspects of human life.
It has nothing to do with LGBT and feminism, "said the actor, who played the boy's father, who was dressed as a woman.
He stressed that he was "proud of the work" and did not consider it propaganda.
At the same time, the American added, he is frightened by the reaction of some people to the storyline of the series: for example, there was a case when "a man in deep binge shot the set and said it was not true."
"Then there were a couple of cases when we met disgruntled locals who did not understand what we were doing.
But we were open, so people who initially came with complaints began to help us, "he concluded.
The shooting incident, the publication explains, occurred in September 2019 in Kabardino-Balkaria: a drunken man attacked a camera crew vehicle with a weapon, after which he was detained by police officers.
Earlier it was reported that the public commissioner for the protection of the family, Olga Baranets, filed a complaint with the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Roskomnadzor against the service more.tv, which hosted the Russian series "Chiki."
Baranets accused the creators of the series of "promoting non-traditional sexual relations and feminism," drawing attention to the fact that the main characters of the film work as prostitutes, and the series itself contains "scenes of physical and psychological violence."
The ombudsman was also outraged by the fact that "the series pays a lot of attention to the homosexual sexual orientation" of the minor character.
The comedy drama "Chiki" tells the story of three prostitutes who started a new life and started a business on the advice of a friend.
