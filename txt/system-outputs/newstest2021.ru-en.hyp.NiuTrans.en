Two Mexican states declare alarm over Hurricane Hanna
Mexico's National Civil Defense Authority has declared an "orange" (high) alert level in the two eastern states of Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon due to the approaching Hurricane Hanna, TASS reports.
The hurricane will bring heavy downpours to Mexico, with between 150 and 250 litres of rain per square metre forecast in some areas.
The authorities have prepared about 800 shelters for the population.
10,000 people will be helping people, including rescuers, National Guard soldiers and military personnel.
At the moment, the hurricane has reached the coast of the US state of Texas with a wind speed of 150 km / h.
Hannah's arrival in Mexico is expected on Sunday morning.
Semilarski against the prosecutor's office: the cassation of the former deputy mayor of Tartu will be considered on August 4
This means that a decision on it is likely to be made in early September.
The first two courts refused to consider Semilarski's claim, but in April his cassation appeal was accepted into proceedings by the Supreme Court.
On 12 December 2019, the Tartu Administrative Court returned the complaint to the applicant, since its resolution is not within its competence of the administrative court.
The court order stated that the complaint contains a claim for compensation for damages caused during criminal proceedings.
"The prosecutor's office and the county court should regulate such issues," Anett Kreitsmann, spokesperson for Tartu courts, explained to ERR earlier.
According to her, Valvo Semilarski appealed the decision in the district court, which on February 5 did not change the decision of the court of first instance.
Now the Supreme Court will have to say its word.
According to Semilarski's defense lawyer, sworn lawyer Oliver Nyaes, his client was unreasonably suspected of bribery for about two years.
Now he is demanding that the prosecutor's office refute the incorrect allegations against him and compensate him for moral damages.
The reason for filing the complaint in court was the statements made by the prosecutor for special cases of the Lyunas District Prosecutor's Office, Margus Gross, in October 2017, when Semilarski, along with another then vice mayor of Tartu, Artem Suvorov, was detained on suspicion of committing several crimes.
"Recall that when I was detained, the Security Police and the Prosecutor's Office immediately organized a press conference and informed the whole Republic of Estonia that the leaders of Tartu - one of the most influential local government bodies - are corrupt.
These public suspicions hanging in the air accompanied me for about two years.
And now that these allegations and suspicions have turned out to be false, the prosecutor's office doesn't want to say anything about it, "Semilarski commented in early August 2019.
According to Oliver Nyaes, at the press conference the prosecutor went beyond the legal framework within which the prosecutor's office should operate.
"The allegations of bribes and salesmanship turned out to be false, but this is not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly emphasized in its decisions on Russia, as well as on Lithuania, that at the stage of the investigation representatives of the state should be careful when choosing words, so that suspects are not presented as criminals before sentencing.
The prosecutor's office is also obliged to this by the presumption of innocence, which, unfortunately, was not observed in this case against Valvo Semilarski, "Nyaes said.
"The public representation of Semilarski as a serious offender and bribe in circumstances where the facts underlying the suspicion of bribery are still being investigated is unacceptable, which contradicts the presumption of innocence and is unfair to the applicant," the lawyer added.
As rus.err.ee wrote, the former deputy mayor of Tartu Valvo Semilarski will not be held liable on charges of bribery - the criminal case initiated against him in July was partially closed.
At the same time, the former official is being tried on charges of knowingly violating anti-corruption legislation during transactions on a particularly large scale.
According to the indictment, between 2015 and 2017, the former deputy mayor of Tartu participated more than thirty times in City Council meetings when making decisions related to companies operating in Tartu, with whose owners or managers Semilarski actively communicated on a personal level outside working hours.
According to Gross, in all of these cases Semilarski had personal interests, and therefore he had to withdraw from participation in decision-making.
Earlier, as rus.err.ee wrote, the prosecutor's office suspected Semilarski of taking bribes and violating anti-corruption legislation during transactions on a particularly large scale.
This happened in October 2016, when he was detained along with another deputy mayor, Artem Suvorov (Centre Party).
At that time, the prosecutor's office and the Security Police stated that there was strong evidence against both vice mayors.
After that, both officials resigned.
Suvorov's case later reached the court, which fully justified the politician.
The trial of Valvo Semilarski is still ongoing.

US calls on Qatar and its neighbours to end dispute
It is necessary to restore trust and unity between Qatar and other states, US Special Representative for Iran Brian Hook believes.
He stated that the conflict between the emirate and other countries in the region has been going on for too long and is damaging regional interests in the sphere of stability, prosperity and security.
So far, the US has tried unsuccessfully to mediate a settlement of the dispute, which Washington sees as a "threat to efforts to contain Iran."

The Emirate is the third largest natural gas reserve, the sixth exporter of natural gas and a major exporter of oil and petroleum products.

How the Central Bank's decision to cut the key rate will affect the economy
The Bank of Russia was expected to cut its key rate again.
It fell by another 0.25 percentage points to 4.25% per annum - formally another historic low.
Judging by the return of the short rate cut step, as well as the tone of the Central Bank's statements and updated forecasts for the Russian economy, the regulator is more optimistic about the economic outlook than before.
This means that the current monetary policy easing cycle may soon stop.
"We continued easing monetary policy, primarily given that there are still risks of inflation falling down from 4% in 2021," said Bank of Russia Governor Elvira Nabiullina.
They are associated with a significant decline in economic activity, a fall in domestic and external demand.
According to Nabiullina, economic recovery will take more than a year and a half.
At the same time, she noted that after the lifting of restrictions due to the pandemic, economic processes revived: energy consumption, consumer and investment demand recovered, construction and output of consumer goods expanded, and the annual rate of decline in freight turnover of transport and industrial production slowed.
According to the updated forecast of the Central Bank, in 2020 the economic contraction will be 4.5-5.5% (previously 4-6% was expected), and economic recovery growth in 2021 will be 3.5-4.5%, in 2022 - 2.5-3.5%.
In addition, the Bank of Russia revised its forecast for annual oil prices to $38 and $40 per barrel of Urals in 2020 and 2021, respectively.
Previously, the Central Bank expected $27 and $35 per barrel.
Finally, the Bank of Russia's inflation forecast for 2020 was 3.7-4.2%, compared to the previously expected 3.8-4.8%.
The Bank of Russia's view on the economic situation is becoming more optimistic, which brings us closer to the end of the easing cycle, Renaissance Capital economists Sophia Donets and Andrey Melashchenko believe.
For example, the Bank of Russia has been consistently reducing its key rate for more than a year; since the beginning of last summer, it has already dropped by 3.5 percentage points.
And at the last meeting in June, the Central Bank lowered it immediately by one percentage point due to low inflation rates due to depressed demand and the need to stimulate the economy, which slowed down due to the pandemic and related restrictions.
Chances of fine-tuning monetary policy remain (at the next meeting on September 18 and until the end of the year), but the limit is already close, agrees Evgeny Koshelev, chief analyst at Rosbank.
A set of pro-inflationary risks also indicates the proximity of a pause in easing interest rates - broken supply chains, possible cost increases due to epidemic prevention measures, and a faster (compared to expectations) recovery in demand, he says.
To top it off, the Bank of Russia's subsequent actions will require more attention to inflation processes during the harvest season, as well as external volatility that has increased amid geopolitical conflicts, Koshelev points out.
One way or another, a reduction in the key rate will lead to a further reduction in rates for the most reliable borrowers, as well as, possibly, mortgages, says Maxim Petronevich, senior economist at the analytical department of Otkritie Bank.
The rate correction will be less pronounced than the key rate reduction, he clarifies.
Consumer loan rates may fall by another 0.3-0.6 percentage points during the second half of the year, mortgage rates may end the year in the range of 6.2-7%, BKS Premier economist Anton Pokatovich does not exclude.
Average deposit rates, in his opinion, will also fall - in the coming months they may fall to 4.2-4.5% (now barely above 4.5%).
Then they could fall to 4% if the Central Bank cuts its key rate in the fall, Pokatovich believes.
The centrist party promises to pay all its debts by the end of the year
The general secretary of the Centre Party Mikhail Korb spoke about this in an interview with ERR.

Poll: Lithuania's ruling Union of Peasants and Greens tops party rating again
The Lithuanian Union of Peasants and Greens, which heads the ruling coalition of the Seimas, topped the rating of parties.
This was shown by a survey conducted by the sociological research company Vilmorus, commissioned by the newspaper Lietuvos rytas.

Nevertheless, recently the President of Lithuania Gitanas Nauseda, assessing the electoral possibilities of the parties, stated that after this year's parliamentary elections the Union of Peasants and Greens could probably form a coalition again.
This statement caused indignation among conservatives.
The latest poll showed that if parliamentary elections were held today, 17.6 percent of voters would vote for farmers, and 17.2 percent for conservatives.
According to Vilmorus director Vladas Gaidis, the gap is within the margin of error, and yet the ruling parties have stopped lagging behind the conservatives.
According to Gaidis, the sociological success of the "peasants" was facilitated by the news that Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis will head their electoral list.
This politician was the first on the list of "peasants" in the 2016 elections.
In third place is the Social Democratic Party, for which 7.1 percent of respondents are now ready to vote.
During the mess, it suddenly lost 2 percent.
The fourth is the Labour Party, headed by businessman of Russian origin Viktor Uspasskikh (6.2 percent).

Excess requirements for applications for public procurement will be excluded by law
The legislation may establish comprehensive requirements for applications for participation in procurement.
In the autumn session, at a plenary session, the State Duma plans to consider in the second reading a bill establishing requirements for the content and composition of an application for participation in a purchase, the participants of which can only be small and medium-sized businesses.
Amendments are being made by the government to the law "On procurement of goods, works, services by certain types of legal entities."
The bill was developed in pursuance of the roadmap for the implementation of the Strategy for the Development of Small and Medium Enterprises in the Russian Federation until 2030, approved by the government.
It provides for the preparation of a draft law on an exhaustive list of documents that customers have the right to demand as part of an application from procurement participants - small and medium-sized businesses.
And also - about the list of requirements for these documents.
Currently, the law "On procurement of goods, works, services by certain types of legal entities" regulates the procurement activities of certain types of legal entities.
Requirements for the content, form, registration and composition of an application for participation in a purchase are established by customers independently in the procurement documentation.
"As a result, customers establish excessive requirements for the content, registration of an application, the mandatory presence of certificates, certificates, extracts in its composition, the period of receipt of which in the authorized bodies is comparable to the period of submission of applications, which leads to the impossibility of participation in such a purchase and a reduction in the number of participants in the purchase," reads the explanation to the bill.
The new bill provides for the establishment of an exhaustive list of documents that customers have the right to demand as part of an application from procurement participants who are small and medium-sized businesses.
"The adoption of the document will eliminate the arbitrary establishment by customers of requirements for the composition and content of applications of participants who are small and medium-sized businesses," the explanatory note says.

Moscow Region authorities spoke about the fate of closed landfills
Solid household waste landfills continue to be closed in the Moscow region.
This year, the authorities promise to eliminate the latter.
Some of the 39 landfills that existed in the region are being modernized into modern waste processing complexes.
But this option is not possible for every landfill - many of them have acquired dense residential development.
After the landfill is closed, it stands up for reclamation: the body of the landfill is covered with soil, degassing and infiltration systems are installed.
This makes it possible to stop chemical processes inside the landfill, so that it does not ignite, does not emit a stench, does not poison the soil and groundwater.
And then the former landfill is left to rise in a useless pile among the residential development surrounding it.
Why not make it something useful?
For example, in Ruza, where the reclamation of the "Annino" landfill was completed just a few days ago, the authorities are considering an option to make a ski slope out of a heap.
This landfill, which was in operation from 1976 to 2016, grew so that it went beyond the boundaries of the land allocated for it.
Therefore, during the reclamation, it was necessary to buy out neighboring areas, de facto long ago clogged with garbage.
"Some time will pass, the training ground will" sit down ," there will be fortresses, and we will think about what can be done to make it start to benefit.
A ski resort is striking, "the head of the Ruz district, Nikolai Parfenov, told reporters.
Two test sites to become renewable energy production sites
The Torbeevo landfills in Lyubertsy and Timokhovo in Bogorodsky District will become sites for the extraction of renewable energy sources from landfill and biological gases.
By the end of the year, a gas-piston power plant will be launched on the territory of Torbeyev, capable of generating up to 8 million kilowatt-hours of electricity and about 0.95 gigacalories of thermal energy per year, which will meet the landfill's own needs - heat supply to administrative and production facilities.
Timokhovo will produce 72.5 million kilowatt-hours and will continue to operate as a waste processing complex.
A museum could be created at Balashikha's Kucino training ground, which was closed after complaints from residents about Direct Line with the country's president.
"There was such an idea - to create a museum of reclamation of landfills in the Moscow region," - said the deputy chairman of the government - the minister of ecology and nature management of the region Dmitry Kurakin.

Beautiful tall minarets just decorated Ayia Sophia
Once again, about Ayia Sophia, a text by Fr. Vladimir Zelinsky came across that, they say, it is necessary to protest.
First, there was free admission - cheers!
I haven <unk> t been to Istanbul, but free admission to the House of God is better than paid.
Secondly, Muslims conquered this land as honestly as Orthodox conquered the Volga-Okskoye interriver, the Muslim Caucasus (and put up a church in Grozny) and planted apple trees on Mars.
God help!
Jews conquered the Holy Land.
The Americans conquered America.
Will we return everything to everyone?
Do you think there will be no pagans who will demand the return of their church, where the Tithe Church is located?
Thirdly, the Muslims improved this building and invested in it.
That is, they, as well as the factories and estates that Leninists took from the bourgeoisie as their property, belong to Leninists - Putin and other nomenclature.
They have improved everything from the Kremlin to the Angara, so it is all of them rightfully progressive.
Beautiful tall minarets very much decorated Ayia Sophia, very much.
There was a stupid ink, there was a stupid ink with beautiful minarets.
Fourth, there are no "Islamic" or "Orthodox" civilizations.
There are believers, there are hypocrites, there are bigots who unite faith and hypocrisy.
A believer does not think in the categories of civilization.
This is the thinking of British Foreign Office official Toynbee, a believer is ashamed to think like this.
But there is a place of prayer for believers everywhere.
And always.
A believer does not pray just where he is asked to leave - he goes elsewhere and prays there.
He is a believer, not a defender.
We are kolobok, not sullen stones.

Russian series actor responds to accusations of "promoting LGBT and feminism"
The actor of the Russian series "Chiki," whose creators were accused of "promoting LGBT and feminism," responded to the claims against the film.
The authors "understood the sharpness of the topics raised and did not want to offend anyone," said American Stephen Thomas Oxner in an interview with the publication "Rise."
"It seems to me that this is a story about the strength and general aspects of human life.
It has nothing to do with LGBT and feminism, "said the actor, who played the boy's father, who changed into women's clothing.
He stressed that he is "proud of the work" and does not consider it propaganda.
At the same time, the American added, he is frightened by the reaction of some people to the plot line of the series: for example, there was a case when "a man in a deep binge shot a set and said that all this is not true."
"Then there were a couple of cases when we met dissatisfied local people who didn't understand what we were doing.
But we were open, so people who first came with claims started helping us, "he concluded.
The shooting incident, the publication explains, occurred in September 2019 in Kabardino-Balkaria: a drunk man attacked a film crew car with a weapon, after which he was detained by police officers.
Earlier it was reported that the public commissioner for family protection Olga Baranets sent a complaint to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Roskomnadzor about the more.tv service, which posted the Russian series "Chiki."
Baranets accused the creators of the series of "promoting non-traditional sexual relations and feminism," drawing attention to the fact that the main characters of the film work as prostitutes, and the series itself contains "scenes of physical and psychological violence."
The Ombudsman was also outraged by the fact that "the series pays a lot of attention to the homosexual sexual orientation" of the minor character.
The comedy drama "Chiki" tells the story of three prostitutes who started a new life and started a business on the advice of a friend.
