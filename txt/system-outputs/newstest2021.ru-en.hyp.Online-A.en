Semilarski vs prosecutor's office: cassation of former vice-mayor of Tartu to be considered on August 4
This means that a decision on it is likely to be made in early September.
The courts of the first two instances refused to consider Semilarski's claim, but in April his cassation appeal was accepted by the Supreme Court.
On 12 December 2019, the Tartu Administrative Court returned the complaint to the applicant, as its resolution was not within its competence of the Administrative Court.
The court's ruling stated that the complaint contained a claim for compensation for damage caused in the course of criminal proceedings.
"Such matters should be regulated by the prosecutor's office and the county court," Tartu Courts spokeswoman Anette Kreitsmann previously told ERR.
According to her, Valvo Semilarski appealed this decision to the district court, which on February 5 did not change the decision of the court of first instance.
Now the State Court will have to say its word.
According to Semilarski's lawyer, a sworn lawyer Oliver Nyaes, his client was unreasonably suspected of bribery for about two years.
Now he demands from the prosecutor's office to refute the incorrect allegations against him and compensate him for moral damage.
The reason for filing a complaint with the court was the statements of the Prosecutor for Special Cases of the Lüuna District Prosecutor's Office Margus Gross, made by him in October 2017, when Semilarski, together with another at that time Vice-Mayor of Tartu Artem Suvorov, was detained on suspicion of committing several crimes.
"Recall that when I was detained, the Security Police and the Prosecutor's Office immediately organized a press conference and informed the whole Republic of Estonia that the leaders of Tartu - one of the most influential local government bodies - are corrupt.
These public suspicions hanging in the air accompanied me for about two years.
And now that these allegations and suspicions have turned out to be false, the prosecutor's office does not want to say anything about it," Semilarsky commented in early August 2019.
According to Oliver Nyaes, at the press conference, the prosecutor went beyond the legal framework in which the prosecutor's office should operate.
"The allegation of bribery and venality has proven to be false, but that's not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly stressed in its rulings on Russia as well as lithuania that during the investigation phase, state representatives must be careful when choosing words so that suspects are not presented as criminals before sentencing.
The prosecutor's office is also bound by the presumption of innocence, which, unfortunately, was not observed in this case against Valvo Semilarski," Nyaes said.
"The public representation of Semilarski as a serious offender and bribe-taker in circumstances where the facts underlying the suspicion of bribery are still being clarified is unacceptable, which is contrary to the presumption of innocence and unfair to the applicant," the lawyer added.
As rus.err.ee wrote, the former vice-mayor of Tartu, Valvo Semilarski, will not be prosecuted on charges of bribery - the criminal case opened against him in July was partially closed.
At the same time, the former official is being tried on charges of deliberate violation of anti-corruption legislation when conducting transactions on an especially large scale.
According to the indictment, between 2015 and 2017, the former Deputy Mayor of Tartu participated in city council meetings more than thirty times in making decisions related to companies operating in Tartu, with whose owners or managers Semilarski actively communicated on a personal level outside of working hours.
According to Gross, in all these cases, Semilarski had personal interests, and therefore he had to withdraw from participation in decision-making.
Earlier, as rus.err.ee wrote, the prosecutor's office presented Semilarski with suspicions of taking a bribe and violating anti-corruption legislation when conducting transactions on an especially large scale.
This happened in October 2016, when he was detained along with another deputy mayor, Artem Suvorov (Centre Party).
At that time, the prosecutor's office and the Security Police said that there was strong evidence against both vice-mayors.
After that, both officials resigned.
Suvorov's case later reached the court, which fully acquitted the politician.
The judicial investigation into the case of Valvo Semilarski is still ongoing.

How will the central bank's decision to reduce the key rate affect the economy?
The Bank of Russia is expected to again reduce the key rate.
It fell another 0.25 percentage points, to 4.25% per annum - formally another historical low.
Judging by the return of a short step of rate cuts, as well as the tone of the Central Bank's statements and updated forecasts for the Russian economy, the regulator looks at the economic prospects more optimistically than before.
This means that the current cycle of monetary easing may soon stop.
"We continued to ease monetary policy, primarily given that there are still risks of inflation deviation down from 4% in 2021," said the head of the Bank of Russia Elvira Nabiullina.
They are associated with a significant decline in economic activity, a drop in domestic and external demand.
Economic recovery, according to Nabiullina, will take more than a year and a half.
At the same time, she noted that after the lifting of restrictions due to the pandemic, economic processes revived: energy consumption, consumer and investment demand were restored, construction and production of consumer goods expanded, the annual rate of decline in transport turnover and industrial production slowed down.
According to the updated forecast of the Central Bank, in 2020 the contraction of the economy will be 4.5-5.5% (before that 4-6% was expected), and the recovery growth of the economy in 2021 will be 3.5-4.5%, in 2022 - 2.5-3.5%.
In addition, the Bank of Russia revised its forecast for annual oil prices to $ 38 and $ 40 per barrel of Urals in 2020 and 2021, respectively.
Earlier, the Central Bank expected 27 and 35 dollars per barrel.
Finally, the Bank of Russia's inflation forecast for 2020 was 3.7-4.2% against the previously expected 3.8-4.8%.
The Bank of Russia's view of the situation in the economy is becoming more optimistic, which brings us closer to the end of the easing cycle, according to Renaissance Capital economists for Russia and the CIS Sofia Donets and Andrey Melaschenko.
Thus, the Bank of Russia has been consistently reducing the key rate for more than a year, since the beginning of last summer it has already fallen by 3.5 percentage points.
And at the last meeting in June, the Central Bank lowered it by one percentage point at once due to low inflation rates due to suppressed demand and the need to stimulate the economy that has slowed down due to the pandemic and related restrictions.
The chances of adjusting monetary policy remain (at the next meeting on September 18 and until the end of the year), but the limit is already near, agrees the chief analyst of Rosbank Evgeny Koshelev.
The combination of pro-inflation risks also points to the proximity of a pause in interest rate policy easing — disrupted supply chains, possible cost increases due to epidemic prevention measures and a faster (compared to expectations) recovery in demand, he says.
To top it off, the subsequent actions of the Bank of Russia will require more attention to inflationary processes during the harvest season, as well as external volatility increased against the background of geopolitical conflicts, Koshelev points out.
One way or another, a reduction in the key rate will lead to a further reduction in rates for the most reliable borrowers, as well as, possibly, on mortgages, says Maxim Petronevich, senior economist at the analytical department of Otkritie Bank.

Rates on consumer loans may fall by another 0.3-0.6 percentage points during the second half of the year, mortgage rates can end the year in the range of 6.2-7%, does not exclude the economist of "BCS Premier" Anton Pokatovich.

Poll: The ruling Union of Peasants and Greens of Lithuania again topped the rating of parties
The Union of Peasants and Greens of Lithuania, which heads the ruling coalition of the Seimas, topped the rating of the parties.
This was shown by a survey conducted by the sociological research company Vilmorus and ordered the newspaper Lietuvos rytas.
After winning the parliamentary elections in 2016, the "peasants" lost first place and for a long time the main critic of Russia in Lithuania, the opposition "Union of the Fatherland - Christian Democrats (Conservatives), was in the lead.
However, recently, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda, assessing the electoral capabilities of the parties, said that the Union of Peasants and Greens after this year's parliamentary elections is likely to be able to form a coalition again.
This statement caused indignation of conservatives.
The latest poll showed that if parliamentary elections were held today, 17.6 percent of voters would vote for the peasants, and 17.2 percent for the conservatives.
According to Vilmorus director Vladas Gaidis, the gap is within the margin of error, and yet the ruling ones have ceased to lag behind the conservatives.
According to Gaidis, the sociological success of the "peasants" was facilitated by the news that their electoral list will be headed by Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis.
This politician was the first in the list of "peasants" in the elections of 2016.
In third place is the Social Democratic Party, for which 7.1 percent of respondents are now ready to vote.
She unexpectedly lost 2 percent.
The fourth is the Labor Party, headed by Russian-born businessman Viktor Uspasskikh (6.2 percent).
The rest of the political organizations, judging by the poll, will not yet be able to overcome the 5% electoral barrier.

Unnecessary requirements for applications for public procurement will be excluded by law
The legislation may establish exhaustive requirements for applications for participation in procurement.
In the autumn session, at the plenary session of the State Duma, it is planned to consider in the second reading a bill establishing requirements for the content and composition of the application for participation in the procurement, the participants of which can only be small and medium-sized businesses.
Amendments are made by the government to the law "On procurement of goods, works, services by certain types of legal entities".
The bill was developed in pursuance of the roadmap for the implementation of the Strategy for the Development of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises in the Russian Federation until 2030, approved by the government.
It provides for the preparation of a draft law on an exhaustive list of documents that customers have the right to require as part of an application from procurement participants - small and medium-sized businesses.
And also - about the list of requirements for these documents.
To date, the law "On procurement of goods, works, services by certain types of legal entities" framework regulates the procurement activities of certain types of legal entities.
Requirements for the content, form, design and composition of the application for participation in the procurement are established by customers independently in the procurement documentation.
"As a result, customers establish excessive requirements for the content, execution of the application, the mandatory presence in its composition of certificates, certificates, extracts, the period for obtaining which in the authorized bodies is comparable to the deadline for submitting applications, which leads to the impossibility of participating in such a purchase and reducing the number of procurement participants," the explanatory note to the bill says.
The new draft law provides for the establishment of an exhaustive list of documents that customers have the right to require as part of the application from procurement participants who are small and medium-sized businesses.
"The adoption of the document will eliminate the arbitrary establishment by customers of requirements for the composition and content of applications of participants who are small and medium-sized businesses," the explanatory note says.

The head of the region Igor Kobzev met with the mayors of the Ust-Ordyn Buryat district
During the working meeting, which took place today, July 24, the government of the Irkutsk region discussed the main directions of development of remote agricultural territories.
During working trips to the districts of the Ust-Ordyn Buryat District, the head of the region gave a number of instructions.
Today, the mayors reported on their implementation.
First of all, the construction of the House of Sports in Ust-Orda was resumed.
The instruction on this object was given by the President of the Russian Federation fourteen years ago.
But only now the situation has been moved from the dead point.
866 million rubles will be spent on construction.
The deadline for the construction is 2022.
And this year a school in the village of Bayandai should be put into operation.
At the moment, the decoration of the premises has been completed.
Of the remaining works - landscaping.
In general, the program for the construction of preschool and secondary education facilities is of particular importance for the region.
For your county, especially.
The demographic situation here is the best in the region.
And we are obliged to create all conditions for the education and leisure of children of all ages, - said the Acting Governor of the Irkutsk region Igor Kobzev.
At the meeting, the head of the region instructed all mayors to actively engage in the development of general plans for settlements.
This is one of the main conditions for the integrated development of the district.
All settlements should have established boundaries and a master plan.
This is necessary for the development of the territory, for the construction of socially significant facilities, as well as infrastructure and cultural heritage, the head of the region emphasized.
Also during the conversation, a problematic issue was raised with a reduction in milk intake from cooperatives by 30%.
This was due to the redistribution by the processing enterprise of the purchase of milk in favor of peasant farms.
Because of this, the share of product intake from cooperatives has decreased.
The head of the region instructed the acting Minister of Agriculture to go to the site, study the structure of milk sales, analyze the experience of other territories and determine options for solving the problem.

The authorities of the Moscow region told about the fate of closed landfills
In the suburbs continue to close landfills of solid domestic waste.
This year, the authorities promise to eliminate the latter.
Some of the 39 landfills that existed in the region are being upgraded into modern waste processing complexes.
But this option is not possible for every landfill - many of them are overgrown with dense residential development.
After the landfill is closed, it stands up for reclamation - the body of the landfill is sprinkled with soils, degassing and infiltrate drainage systems are installed.
This allows you to stop the chemical processes inside the landfill, so that it does not ignite, does not eude a stench, does not poison the soil and groundwater.
And then the former dump is left to rise in a useless pile among the residential buildings surrounding it.
Why not make something useful out of it?
For example, in Ruza, where the reclamation of the Annino landfill was completed just the other day, the authorities are considering the option of making a ski slope out of a heap.
This landfill, operated from 1976 to 2016, has grown so that it has gone beyond the boundaries of the land allocated for it.
Therefore, during reclamation, it was necessary to buy out neighboring plots, de facto long ago clogged with garbage to the eyeballs.
"Some time will pass, the polygon will "sit down", the fortress will be recruited, and we will think what can be done so that it begins to bring benefit.
Right in the eye catches - a ski resort," - told reporters the head of the Ruza district Nikolai Parfenov.
Two landfills will become sites for the extraction of renewable energy sources
The Torbeevo landfills in Lyubertsy and Timokhovo in the Bogorodsky District will become sites for the extraction of renewable energy sources from landfill and biological gases.
By the end of the year, a gas piston power plant will be launched on the territory of Torbeev, capable of generating up to 8 million kilowatt-hours of electricity and about 0.95 gigacalories of thermal energy per year, which will provide the landfill's own needs - heat supply to administrative and industrial premises.
Timokhovo will produce 72.5 million kilowatt-hours and will continue to operate as a waste processing complex.
And at the Balashikha training ground "Kuchino", which was closed after complaints from residents about the "Direct Line" with the president of the country, a museum can be created.
"There was such an idea - to create a museum of reclamation of landfills of the Moscow region," said Deputy Chairman of the government - Minister of Ecology and Nature Management of the region Dmitry Kurakin.

Beautiful high minarets only decorated Hagia Sophia
Once again about Hagia Sophia - I came across the text of Fr. Vladimir Zelinsky, that, they say, it is necessary to protest.
First, there was free admission - hooray!
I have not been to Istanbul, but it is better to have free admission to the House of God than a paid one.
Secondly, the Muslims conquered this land as honestly as the Orthodox conquered the Volga-Oka interfluve, the Muslim Caucasus (and put a church in Grozny) and planted apple trees on Mars.
God help!
The Jews conquered the Holy Land.
The Americans conquered Americana.
Are we going to give everything back to everyone?
Do you think there will be no pagans who will demand the return of their temple, on the site of which the Church of the Tithes?
Thirdly, the Muslims have improved this building and invested in it.
That is, they, just like the factories and estates that the Leninists took from the bourgeois in their property, belong to the Leninists - Putin and other nomenclature.
They have improved everything from the Kremlin to the Angara, so it's all of them by the right of progressors.
Beautiful high minarets very decorated Hagia Sophia, very.
There was a stupid inkwell, there was a stupid inkwell with beautiful minarets.
Fourth, there are no "Islamic" and "Orthodox" civilizations.
There are believers, there are hypocrites, there are hypocrites who combine faith and hypocrisy.
The believer in the categories of civilization does not think.
This is the mindset of the British Foreign Secretary Toynbee, a believer is ashamed to think like that.
And the believer everywhere places prayer.
And always.
The believer does not pray only where he is asked to leave - he withdraws to another place and prays there.
He's a believer, not a champion.
We're koloboks, not sullen rocks.
