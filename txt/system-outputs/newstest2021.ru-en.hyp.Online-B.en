Hurricane Hannah Raises Alert in Two Mexican States
The Mexican National Civil Defense Administration has announced an "orange" (high) alert in the two eastern states of Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon due to the approaching Hurricane Hannah, TASS reported.
The hurricane will bring heavy rainfall to Mexico, with some areas forecasting 150 to 250 liters of precipitation per square meter.
The authorities have prepared about 800 shelters for the population.
10 thousand people will provide assistance to people, including rescuers, National Guard soldiers and the military.
At the moment, the hurricane has reached the coast of the American state of Texas with a wind speed of 150 km / h.

Semilarski against the prosecutor's office: the appeal of the former vice-mayor of Tartu will be considered on 4 August
This means that the decision on it, most likely, will be made in early September.
The courts of the first two instances refused to consider Semilarsky's claim, but in April the Supreme Court accepted his cassation appeal.
The Tartu Administrative Court returned the complaint to the applicant on 12 December 2019, since its resolution is not within the jurisdiction of the Administrative Court.
The court ruling stated that the complaint contained a claim for compensation for damage caused in the course of criminal proceedings.
"Such issues should be regulated by the prosecutor's office and the county court," Anette Kreitsmann, spokeswoman for the Tartu courts, told ERR earlier.
According to her, Valvo Semilarski appealed against this decision in the district court, which on February 5 did not change the decision of the court of first instance.
Now the State Court will have to say.
According to Semilarski's defense attorney, attorney at law Oliver Nääs, his client had been unreasonably suspected of bribery for about two years.
Now he demands from the prosecutor's office to refute the false statements in his address and to compensate him for moral damage.
The reason for filing a complaint with the court was the statements of the prosecutor for special cases of the Lyuna District Prosecutor's Office Margus Gross, made by him in October 2017, when Semilarski, along with another then Vice-Mayor of Tartu Artem Suvorov, was detained on suspicion of several crimes.
“As a reminder, when I was detained, the Security Police and the Prosecutor's Office immediately organized a press conference and informed the entire Republic of Estonia that the leaders of Tartu, one of the most influential local government bodies, are corrupt.
These public suspicions that were in the air accompanied me for about two years.
And now, when these allegations and suspicions have turned out to be false, the prosecutor's office does not want to say anything about it, "commented Semilarski in early August 2019.
According to Oliver Nääs, at the press conference, the prosecutor went beyond the legal framework within which the prosecutor's office should operate.
“The allegation of bribery and venality turned out to be false, but this is not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly emphasized in its judgments on Russia as well as on Lithuania that during the investigation stage, representatives of the state must be careful in their choice of words so that suspects are not presented as criminals before sentencing.
The prosecutor's office is also obliged to this by the presumption of innocence, which, unfortunately, was not observed in this case against Valvo Semilarski, "Nääs said.
“The public presentation of Semilarski as a serious offender and bribe-taker in circumstances where the facts underlying the suspicion of bribery are still being clarified is unacceptable, contrary to the presumption of innocence and unfair to the applicant,” the lawyer added.
As rus.err.ee wrote, the former vice-mayor of Tartu Valvo Semilarski will not be prosecuted on charges of bribery - the criminal case against him was partially closed in July.
At the same time, the former official is being tried on charges of knowingly violating anti-corruption laws when conducting transactions on an especially large scale.
According to the indictment, between 2015 and 2017, the former Deputy Mayor of Tartu participated more than thirty times in the City Government's meetings when making decisions related to companies operating in Tartu, with whose owners or managers Semilarski actively communicated on a personal level outside of working hours.
According to Gross, in all these cases, Semilarski had personal interests, and therefore he had to withdraw from participation in decision-making.
Earlier, as rus.err.ee wrote, the prosecutor's office presented Semilarski with suspicions of accepting a bribe and violating anti-corruption laws when conducting transactions on an especially large scale.
This happened in October 2016, when he was detained along with another deputy mayor, Artem Suvorov (Center Party).
Then the prosecutor's office and the Security Police said that there was strong evidence against both vice-mayors.
After that, both officials resigned.
Suvorov's case later reached the court, which fully justified the politician.
The trial in the Valvo Semilarski case is still ongoing.

In 2020, the parade was first held in Kaspiysk, where the base of the Caspian fleet was redeployed from Astrakhan.

How will the Central Bank's decision to cut the key rate affect the economy?
The Bank of Russia, as expected, lowered its key rate again.
It dropped by another 0.25 percentage points, to 4.25% per annum - formally another historical minimum.
Judging by the return of a short step in the rate cut, as well as the tone of the Central Bank's statements and updated forecasts for the Russian economy, the regulator looks at the economic outlook more optimistically than before.
This means that the current monetary easing cycle may soon stop.
“We continued to ease our monetary policy, primarily considering that there are still risks of inflation deviating from 4% in 2021,” said the head of the Bank of Russia Elvira Nabiullina.
They are associated with a significant decline in economic activity, a drop in domestic and foreign demand.
The economic recovery, according to Nabiullina, will take more than a year and a half.
At the same time, she noted that after the restrictions were lifted due to the pandemic, economic processes revived: energy consumption, consumer and investment demand were restored, construction and production of consumer goods expanded, the annual rate of decline in transport and industrial production slowed down.
According to the revised forecast of the Central Bank, in 2020 the economy will contract 4.5-5.5% (before that it was expected 4-6%), and the recovery growth of the economy in 2021 will be 3.5-4.5%, in 2022 - 2.5-3.5%.
In addition, the Bank of Russia revised its forecast for annual oil prices to $ 38 and $ 40 per barrel of Urals in 2020 and 2021, respectively.
Earlier, the Central Bank expected $ 27 and $ 35 per barrel.
Finally, the Bank of Russia's inflation forecast for 2020 was 3.7-4.2% against the previously expected 3.8-4.8%.
The Bank of Russia's view of the situation in the economy is becoming more optimistic, which brings us closer to the end of the easing cycle, according to economists for Russia and the CIS at Renaissance Capital Sofia Donets and Andrey Melashchenko.
Thus, the Bank of Russia has been consistently reducing the key rate for more than a year; since the beginning of last summer, it has already dropped by 3.5 percentage points.
And at the last meeting in June, the Central Bank lowered it immediately by one percentage point due to low inflation rates due to suppressed demand and the need to stimulate the economy that has slowed down due to the pandemic and related restrictions.
Chances for adjusting monetary policy remain (at the next meeting on September 18 and until the end of the year), but the limit is already close, agrees Rosbank chief analyst Yevgeny Koshelev.
The combination of pro-inflationary risks also points to a close pause in interest rate easing - disrupted supply chains, a possible rise in costs due to measures to prevent the epidemic and a faster (compared to expectations) recovery in demand, he says.
To top it off, subsequent actions by the Bank of Russia will require more attention to inflationary processes during the harvest season, as well as external volatility, which has increased against the backdrop of geopolitical conflicts, Koshelev points out.
One way or another, a decrease in the key rate will lead to a further decrease in rates for the most reliable borrowers, as well as, possibly, on mortgages, says Maxim Petronevich, senior economist at the analytical department of Otkritie Bank.
The rate adjustment will be less pronounced than the key rate cut, he said.
Rates on consumer loans may fall by another 0.3-0.6 percentage points during the second half of the year, mortgage rates may end the year in the range of 6.2-7%, the economist of BCS Premier Anton Pokatovich does not exclude.
Average rates on deposits, in his opinion, will also fall - in the coming months they may drop to 4.2-4.5% (now just above 4.5%).
Further, they may drop to 4% if the Central Bank cuts the key rate in the fall, Pokatovich said.

Poll: Ruling Union of Peasants and Greens of Lithuania tops the rating of parties again
The Union of Peasants and Greens of Lithuania, which heads the ruling coalition of the Diet, topped the rating of the parties.
This was shown by a poll conducted by the sociological research company Vilmorus for the time being ordered by the newspaper Lietuvos rytas.
After winning the 2016 parliamentary elections, the "peasants" lost first place and for a long time was led by the main critic of Russia in Lithuania, the opposition Union of the Fatherland - Christian Democrats (Conservatives).
Nevertheless, recently, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda, assessing the electoral possibilities of the parties, said that the Union of Peasants and Greens after the parliamentary elections this year will probably be able to form a coalition again.
This announcement sparked the outrage of conservatives.
The latest poll showed that if parliamentary elections were held today, 17.6 percent of voters would vote for peasants, and 17.2 percent for conservatives.
According to the director of Vilmorus, Vladas Gaidis, the gap is within the margin of error, and nevertheless, the ruling ceased to lag behind the conservatives.
According to Gaidis, the news that their electoral list will be headed by Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis contributed to the sociological success of the "peasants".
This politician was the first in the list of "peasants" in the 2016 elections.
In third place is the Social Democratic Party, for which 7.1 percent of respondents are now ready to vote.
In a month, she unexpectedly lost 2 percent.
The fourth is the Labor Party, headed by Viktor Uspaskikh, a businessman of Russian origin (6.2 percent).
The rest of the political organizations, judging by the poll, will not be able to overcome the 5% electoral threshold yet.

Excessive requirements for public procurement applications will be excluded by law
The legislation may establish comprehensive requirements for applications for participation in procurement.
In the autumn session, at the plenary session of the State Duma, it is planned to consider in the second reading a draft law establishing the requirements for the content and composition of the application for participation in the procurement, participants of which can only be small and medium-sized businesses.
Amendments are made by the government to the law "On the procurement of goods, works, services by certain types of legal entities."
The bill was developed in pursuance of the roadmap for the implementation of the Strategy for the Development of Small and Medium-Sized Businesses in the Russian Federation until 2030, approved by the government.
It provides for the preparation of a draft law on an exhaustive list of documents that customers have the right to require as part of an application from procurement participants - small and medium-sized businesses.
And also - about the list of requirements for these documents.
Today, the law "On the procurement of goods, works, services by certain types of legal entities" regulates the procurement activities of certain types of legal entities.
Requirements for the content, form, design and composition of the application for participation in the procurement are established by the customers independently in the procurement documentation.
"As a result, the customers establish excessive requirements for the content, execution of the application, the mandatory presence in its composition of references, certificates, extracts, the time of receipt of which in the authorized bodies is comparable to the deadline for submitting applications, which leads to the impossibility of participating in such a procurement and a reduction in the number of procurement participants" , - says the explanation to the bill.
The new bill provides for the establishment of an exhaustive list of documents that customers have the right to require as part of an application from procurement participants who are small and medium-sized businesses.
"The adoption of the document will allow to exclude the arbitrary establishment by customers of requirements for the composition and content of applications of participants who are small and medium-sized businesses," the explanatory note says.

The head of the region Igor Kobzev met with the mayors of the Ust-Orda Buryat District
During the working meeting, which took place today, on July 24, the government of the Irkutsk region discussed the main directions for the development of remote agrarian territories.
During his working trips to the districts of the Ust-Orda Buryat District, the head of the region gave a number of instructions.
Mayors reported on their implementation today.
First of all, the construction of the Sports House in Ust-Orda has been resumed.
The order for this facility was given by the President of the Russian Federation fourteen years ago.
But only now the situation has been moved off the ground.
The construction will cost 866 million rubles.
Completion date of the facility is 2022.
And already this year, a school in the village of Bayandai should be commissioned.
At the moment, the finishing of the premises has been completed.
The remaining work is the improvement of the territory.
In general, the program for the construction of preschool and secondary education facilities is of particular importance for the region.
Especially for your district.
The demographic situation here is the best in the region.
And we are obliged to create all conditions for education and leisure for children of all ages, - said the Acting Governor of the Irkutsk Region Igor Kobzev.
At the meeting, the head of the region instructed all mayors to actively participate in the development of general plans for settlements.
This is one of the main conditions for the integrated development of the district.
All settlements must have established boundaries and a master plan.
This is necessary for the development of the territory, for the construction of socially significant objects, as well as infrastructure and cultural heritage, - said the head of the region.
Also during the conversation, a problematic issue was raised with a 30% reduction in milk intake from cooperatives.
This happened due to the redistribution of milk purchases by the processing enterprise in favor of peasant farms.
Because of this, the share of receiving products from cooperatives has decreased.
The head of the region instructed the acting minister of agriculture to go to the site, study the structure of milk sales, analyze the experience of other territories and identify options for solving the problem.

Moscow region authorities told about the fate of closed landfills
In the Moscow region, solid waste landfills continue to be closed.
This year, the authorities promise to eliminate the latter.
Some of the 39 existing landfills in the region are being modernized into modern waste processing facilities.
But this option is not possible for every landfill - many of them are overgrown with dense residential buildings.
After the landfill is closed, it gets up for reclamation - the body of the landfill is covered with soils, degassing and drainage systems are installed.
This allows you to stop the chemical processes inside the landfill so that it does not ignite, does not exude stench, and does not poison the soil and groundwater.
And then the former dump is left to rise as a useless heap among the surrounding residential development.
Why not make something useful out of it?
For example, in Ruza, where the reclamation of the "Annino" landfill was completed just a few days ago, the authorities are considering an option to make a ski slope out of a heap.
This landfill, which was operated from 1976 to 2016, has grown so much that it has gone beyond the boundaries of the land allocated for it.
Therefore, during the reclamation, it was necessary to buy out the neighboring plots, de facto, which had long been clogged with garbage to the eyeballs.
"Some time will pass, the test site will" settle down ", the fortresses will accumulate, and we will think what can be done to make it start to be useful.
A ski resort strikes the eye directly, "Nikolai Parfenov, head of the Ruzsky district, told reporters.
Two landfills will become sites for the extraction of renewable energy sources
The Torbeevo landfills in Lyubertsy and the Timokhovo landfills in the Bogorodsky District will become sites for the extraction of renewable energy sources from landfill and biological gases.
By the end of the year, a gas piston power plant will be launched on the Torbeev territory, capable of generating up to 8 million kilowatt-hours of electricity and about 0.95 gigacalories of thermal energy per year, which will meet the landfill's own needs - heat supply for administrative and industrial premises.
Timokhovo will produce 72.5 million kilowatt-hours and will continue to operate as a waste processing complex.
A museum may be set up at the Kuchino training ground in Balashikha, which was closed after residents complained about the Direct Line with the President of the country.
“There was such an idea - to create a museum for reclamation of landfills in the Moscow region,” said Dmitry Kurakin, Deputy Prime Minister - Minister of Ecology and Nature Management of the Region.

Beautiful tall minarets only adorned Hagia Sophia
Once again about Hagia Sophia - I came across the text of Father Vladimir Zelinsky, saying that one should protest.
Firstly, there is now free admission - hurray!
I haven’t been to Istanbul, but free admission is better than paid admission to the House of God.
Secondly, Muslims just as honestly conquered this land as the Orthodox conquered the Volga-Oka interfluve, the Muslim Caucasus (and erected a church in Grozny) and planted apple trees on Mars.
God help you!
The Jews conquered the Holy Land.
The Americans conquered America.
Are we going to return everything to everyone?
Do you think there are no pagans who will demand the return of their temple, in the place of which the Church of the Tithes?
Thirdly, the Muslims have improved this building and invested in it.
That is, it is theirs, just like the factories and estates that the Leninists took away from the bourgeoisie as their property, belong to the Leninists - Putin and other nomenclature.
They have improved everything - from the Kremlin to the Angara, so this is all theirs by the right of progressors.
The beautiful tall minarets adorned Hagia Sophia very much, very much.
There was a stupid inkwell, now a stupid inkwell with beautiful minarets.
Fourth, there are no "Islamic" and "Orthodox" civilizations.
There are believers, there are hypocrites, there are bigots who unite faith and hypocrisy.
A believer does not think in terms of civilization.
This is the thinking of the British Foreign Office official Toynbee, a believer is ashamed to think so.
And for the believer, the place of prayer is everywhere.
And always.
The believer does not pray only where he is asked to leave - he retires to another place and prays there.
He is a believer, not a defender.
We are koloboks, not gloomy stones.

Russian TV series actor responded to accusations of "propaganda of LGBT and feminism"
The actor of the Russian TV series "Chiki", whose creators were accused of "propaganda of LGBT and feminism," responded to the claims about the film.
The authors "understood the severity of the topics raised and did not want to offend anyone," said American Stephen Thomas Ochsner in an interview with the Rise.
“It seems to me that this is a story about the strength and general aspects of human life.
It has nothing to do with LGBT and feminism, "said the actor, who played the boy's father, who dressed in women's clothes.
He stressed that he is "proud of the work" and does not consider it propaganda.
At the same time, the American added, he is frightened by the reaction of some people to the plot line of the series: for example, there was a case when "a man in a deep drunkenness shot the set and said that all this was not true."
“Then there were a couple of cases when we met disgruntled locals who did not understand what we were doing.
But we were open, so people who first came with complaints began to help us, "he summed up.

Also, the Ombudsman was outraged by the fact that "the series paid a lot of attention to the homosexual sexual orientation" of the minor character.
