The hurricane will bring heavy downpours to Mexico, with 150 to 250 liters of precipitation per square meter predicted in some areas.
The authorities have prepared about 800 shelters for the population.
10 thousand people, including rescuers, soldiers of the National Guard and the military, will provide assistance to people.

Semilarski v. Prosecutor's office: the appeal of the former vice-mayor of Tartu will be considered on August 4
This means that a decision on it is likely to be made in early September.
The courts of the first two instances refused to consider Semilarski's claim, but in April his appeal was accepted by the State Court.
On 12 December 2019, the Tartu Administrative Court returned the complaint to the applicant, as its resolution is not within the competence of the administrative court.
The court's decision stated that the complaint contains a claim for compensation for damage caused in the course of criminal proceedings.
"It is up to the Prosecutor's Office and the county Court to regulate such matters," Anette Kreitsmann, a spokeswoman for the Tartu Courts, told ERR earlier.
According to her, Valvo Semilarski appealed this decision to the district court, which on February 5 did not change the decision of the court of first instance.
Now the State Court will have to say its word.
According to Semilarski's defense lawyer, juror Oliver Nyas, his client was unreasonably under suspicion of bribery for about two years.
Now he demands from the prosecutor's office to refute the incorrect statements in his address and compensate him for moral damage.
The reason for filing a complaint to the court was the statements of the Prosecutor for Special Cases of the District Prosecutor's Office of Liuna, Margus Gross, made by him in October 2017, when Semilarski, along with another Vice-mayor of Tartu at that time, Artem Suvorov, was detained on suspicion of committing several crimes.
"We remind you that when I was detained, the Security Police and the Prosecutor's Office immediately organized a press conference and informed the entire Republic of Estonia that the leaders of Tartu - one of the most influential local government bodies - are corrupt.
These public suspicions that hung in the air accompanied me for about two years.
And now that these allegations and suspicions have turned out to be false, the prosecutor's office does not want to say anything about it, " Semilarski commented in early August 2019.
According to Oliver Nyas, at the press conference, the prosecutor went beyond the legal framework in which the prosecutor's office should act.
"The allegation of bribery and corruption turned out to be false, but this is not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly stressed in its rulings on Russia, as well as on Lithuania, that at the stage of the investigation, state representatives should be careful when choosing words, so that suspects would not be presented as criminals before sentencing.
The prosecutor's office is also obliged by the presumption of innocence, which, unfortunately, was not observed in this case against Valvo Semilarski," said the Nnec.
"The public presentation of Semilarski as a serious offender and a bribe taker in circumstances where the facts underlying the suspicion of bribery are still being investigated is unacceptable, which contradicts the presumption of innocence and is unfair to the applicant," the lawyer added.
As I wrote rus.err.ee the former vice-mayor of Tartu, Valvo Semilarski, will not be prosecuted on charges of bribery - the criminal case against him was partially closed in July.
At the same time, the former official is being tried on charges of knowingly violating anti-corruption legislation when conducting transactions on a particularly large scale.
According to the indictment, between 2015 and 2017, the former Deputy Mayor of Tartu participated more than thirty times in city council meetings when making decisions related to companies operating in Tartu, with the owners or managers of which Semilarski actively communicated on a personal level during non-working hours.
According to Gross, in all these cases Semilarski had personal interests, and therefore he had to withdraw from participation in decision-making.
Previously, as I wrote rus.err.ee the prosecutor's office charged Semilarski with receiving a bribe and violating anti-corruption legislation when conducting transactions on a particularly large scale.
This happened in October 2016, when he was detained along with another deputy mayor, Artem Suvorov (Centrist Party).
Then the Prosecutor's Office and the Security Police said that there is strong evidence against both vice-mayors.
After that, both officials resigned.
Suvorov's case later reached the court, which fully acquitted the politician.
The judicial investigation in the case of Valvo Semilarski is still ongoing.

How will the Central Bank's decision to cut the key rate affect the economy
The Bank of Russia is expected to cut its key rate again.
It fell by another 0.25 percentage points, to 4.25% per annum-formally another historical low.
Judging by the return of the short rate cut, as well as the tone of the Central Bank's statements and updated forecasts for the Russian economy, the regulator is more optimistic about the economic outlook than before.
This means that the current cycle of monetary easing may soon come to a halt.
"We have continued to ease monetary policy, primarily given that there are still risks of deflection of inflation down from 4% in 2021," -said the head of the Bank of Russia Elvira Nabiullina.
They are associated with a significant decline in economic activity, a drop in domestic and foreign demand.
The economic recovery, according to Nabiullina, will take more than a year and a half.
At the same time, she noted that after the lifting of restrictions due to the pandemic, economic processes have revived: energy consumption, consumer and investment demand were restored, construction and production of consumer goods were expanded, and the annual rate of decline in the turnover of transport and industrial production slowed down.
According to the updated forecast of the Central Bank, in 2020, the economy will shrink by 4.5-5.5% (before that, 4-6% was expected), and the recovery growth of the economy in 2021 will be 3.5-4.5%, in 2022 - 2.5-3.5%.
In addition, the Bank of Russia revised the forecast for annual oil prices to $ 38 and $ 40 per barrel of Urals in 2020 and 2021, respectively.
Earlier, the Central Bank expected $ 27 and $ 35 per barrel.
Finally, the Bank of Russia's forecast for inflation for 2020 was 3.7-4.2% against the previously expected 3.8-4.8%.
The Bank of Russia's view of the economy is becoming more optimistic, which brings us closer to the end of the easing cycle, according to Sofya Donets and Andrey Melashchenko, economists for Russia and the CIS at Renaissance Capital.
So, the Bank of Russia has been consistently reducing the key rate for more than a year, since the beginning of last summer it has already fallen by 3.5 percentage points.
And at the last meeting in June, the Central Bank lowered it immediately by one percentage point due to low inflation rates due to subdued demand and the need to stimulate the economy, which has slowed down due to the pandemic and related restrictions.
The chances of further adjustment of monetary policy remain (at the next meeting on September 18 and until the end of the year), but the limit is already close, agrees Rosbank chief analyst Evgeny Koshelev.
The combination of pro-inflationary risks also points to the proximity of a pause in interest rate policy easing - disrupted supply chains, possible cost increases due to epidemic prevention measures, and a faster (than expected) recovery in demand, he says.
To top it off, the Bank of Russia's subsequent actions will require more attention to inflationary processes during the harvest season, as well as external volatility, which has increased against the background of geopolitical conflicts, Koshelev points out.
One way or another, a reduction in the key rate will lead to a further reduction in rates for the most reliable borrowers, as well as, possibly, for mortgages, says Maxim Petronevich, senior economist at the analytical department of Otkritie Bank.
The rate correction will be less pronounced than the reduction in the key rate, he says.
Rates on consumer loans may fall by another 0.3-0.6 percentage points during the second half of the year, mortgage rates may end the year in the range of 6.2-7%, does not exclude economist "BCS Premier" Anton Pokatovich.
Average deposit rates, in his opinion, will also fall - in the coming months they may fall to 4.2-4.5% (now barely above 4.5%).
Further, they can fall to 4% if the Central Bank cuts the key rate in the fall, Pokatovich believes.

Poll: The ruling Union of Peasants and Greens of Lithuania again topped the rating of parties
The Union of Peasants and "Greens" of Lithuania, which heads the ruling coalition of the Seimas, topped the rating of the parties.
This was shown by a survey conducted by the social research company Vilmorus, commissioned by the newspaper Lietuvos rytas.
After winning the 2016 parliamentary elections, the Peasants lost first place and for a long time the main critic of Russia in Lithuania, the opposition Union of the Fatherland - Christian Democrats (Conservatives), was in the lead.
However, recently Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda, assessing the electoral possibilities of the parties, said that the Union of Peasants and "greens" after the parliamentary elections of this year, will probably be able to form a coalition again.
This statement aroused the indignation of the conservatives.
The latest poll showed that if the parliamentary elections were held today, 17.6 percent of voters would vote for the peasants, and 17.2 percent for the conservatives.
According to the director of Vilmorus Vladas Gaidis, the gap is within the margin of error, and yet the ruling party has stopped lagging behind the conservatives.
According to Gaidis, the sociological success of the" peasants " was promoted by the news that their electoral list will be headed by Prime Minister Saulius Skvernialis.
This politician was the first in the list of "peasants" and in the 2016 elections.
In third place is the Social Democratic Party, for which 7.1 percent of respondents are now ready to vote.
For a month, it unexpectedly lost 2 percent.
The fourth is the Labor Party, led by Russian-born businessman Viktor Uspasskikh (6.2 percent).
The rest of the political organizations, judging by the survey, will not be able to overcome the 5-percent electoral barrier yet.

"As a result, customers set excessive requirements for the content, registration of the application, the mandatory presence in its composition of certificates, certificates, extracts, the period of receipt of which in the authorized bodies is comparable to the deadline for submitting applications, which leads to the inability to participate in such a purchase and a reduction in the number of participants in the purchase," the explanation to the bill says.

The material with their opinion was published by CNN on July 23.

The authorities of the Moscow region told about the fate of closed landfills
In the Moscow region, landfills of solid household waste continue to be closed.
This year, the authorities promise to eliminate the latter.
Some of the 39 existing landfills in the region are being upgraded into modern waste processing complexes.
But this option is not possible for every landfill - many of them are overgrown with dense residential buildings.
After the landfill is closed, it gets up for reclamation - the body of the landfill is poured with soil, systems of degassing and removal of infiltrate are installed.
This allows you to stop the chemical processes inside the landfill, so that it does not ignite, does not exude a stench, does not poison the soil and groundwater.
And then the former landfill remains a towering useless pile in the midst of the surrounding residential development.
Why not make something useful out of it?
For example, in Ruza, where the reclamation of the Annino landfill was completed just a few days ago, the authorities are considering making a ski slope out of the pile.
This landfill, which was operated from 1976 to 2016, has grown so much that it has gone beyond the boundaries of the land allocated for it.
Therefore, during the reclamation, it was necessary to buy out the neighboring plots, de facto long ago clogged with garbage to the brim.
"Some time will pass, the landfill will "settle down", gain strength, and we will think about what can be done to make it useful.
Right in the eye catches - a ski resort, " - told reporters the head of the Ruz district Nikolai Parfenov.
Two landfills will become sites for the production of renewable energy sources
The Torbeevo landfills in Lyubertsy and Timokhovo landfills in Bogorodsky District will become sites for the production of renewable energy sources from landfill and biological gases.
By the end of the year, a gas-piston power plant will be launched on the territory of Torbeyev, capable of generating up to 8 million kilowatt - hours of electricity per year and about 0.95 gigacalories of thermal energy, which will provide the landfill's own needs-heat supply to administrative and industrial premises.
Timokhovo will produce 72.5 million kilowatt-hours and will continue to operate as a waste processing complex.
And a museum can be created at the Kuchino training ground in Balashikha, which was closed after complaints from residents about the "Direct Line" with the president of the country.
"There was such an idea - to create a museum of recultivation of landfills in the Moscow region," said Dmitry Kurakin, Deputy Chairman of the government - Minister of Ecology and Nature Management of the region.

Beautiful high minarets only decorated Hagia Sophia
Once again about Hagia Sophia-I came across the text of fr.Vladimir Zelinsky, that, they say, it is necessary to protest.
First, there was a free entrance-hooray!
I have not been to Istanbul, but the House of God is better to have free entrance than paid.
Secondly, the Muslims just as honestly conquered this land as the Orthodox conquered the Volga-Oka interfluve, the Muslim Caucasus (and set up a church in Grozny) and planted apple trees on Mars.
God help you!
The Jews conquered the Holy Land.
The Americans have conquered America.
Are we going to give everything back to everyone?
Do you think there are no pagans who will demand the return of their temple, on the site of which there is a Tithe Church?
Third, the Muslims have improved this building and invested in it.
That is, it belongs to them, just like the factories and estates that the Leninists took from the bourgeoisie as their property, belong to the Leninists - Putin and other nomenclature.
They've improved everything from the Kremlin to the Hangar, so it's all their rightful progressors.
Beautiful high minarets very decorated Hagia Sophia, very much.
There was a stupid inkwell, there was a stupid inkwell with beautiful minarets.
Fourth, there are no "Islamic" or "Orthodox" civilizations.
There are believers, there are hypocrites, there are hypocrites who combine faith and hypocrisy.
The believer does not think in terms of civilization.
This is the thinking of the official of the British Foreign Ministry Toynbee, a believer is ashamed to think so.
And the believer has a place of prayer everywhere.
And always.
The believer does not pray only where he is asked to leave - he goes to another place and prays there.
He's a believer, not a champion.
We are koloboks, not moody stones.

Kobe, well scored, great pass!

We had a good conversation with Kobi, "Vechernyaya Moskva quotes Kirilenko as saying.
He also talked about his first game against Jordan.

Soon I got away from the excitement, covered his throws a couple of times...
In that game, my team won, and Jordan still scored 44 points, " the head of the RFB added.
