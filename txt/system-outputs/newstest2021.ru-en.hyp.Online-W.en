Semilarski v. Prosecutor's Office: former Tartu vice mayor's appeal will be heard on August 4
This means that it is likely to be decided in early September.
The courts of the first two instances refused to consider Semilarski suit, but in April his appeal was taken into consideration by the Supreme Court.
On December 12, 2019, the Tartu Administrative Court returned the complaint to the complainant because its resolution was not within the jurisdiction of its administrative court.
The court's ruling stated that the complaint contained a claim for damages caused in criminal proceedings.
"It is up to the prosecutor's office and the county court to regulate such matters," Anette Kreitsmann, spokeswoman for the Tartu courts, previously explained to ERR.
According to her, Valvo Semilarski appealed this decision to the district court, which on February 5 did not change the decision of the court of first instance.
Now the State Court will have to say its word.
According to Semilarski's defense attorney, sworn lawyer Oliver Nääs, his client was unreasonably suspected of bribery for about two years.
He now demands that the prosecutor's office refute the false allegations against him and compensate him for moral damages.
The reason for filing the complaint with the court were statements made by Margus Gross, special cases prosecutor of the Lyuna District Prosecutor's Office, in October 2017, when Semilarski, together with Artem Suvorov, another vice mayor of Tartu at the time, was detained on suspicion of committing several crimes.
"Recall that when I was detained, the Security Police and Prosecutor's Office immediately organized a press conference and informed the entire Republic of Estonia that the leaders of Tartu, one of the most influential local governments, were corrupt.
These public suspicions hung in the air for about two years.
And now that these allegations and suspicions have turned out to be false, the prosecutor's office does not want to say anything about it," Semilarski commented in early August 2019.
According to Oliver Nääs, at the press conference, the prosecutor went beyond the legal framework in which prosecutors should operate.
"The allegation of bribery and venality turned out to be false, but that's not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly stressed in its rulings on Russia, as well as on Lithuania, that at the investigative stage state representatives must be careful in their choice of words so that suspects are not presented as criminals before conviction.
The prosecutor's office is also obliged to this by the presumption of innocence, which, unfortunately, was not observed in this case against Valvo Semilarski," Nääs said.
"Publicly presenting Semilarski as a serious offender and briber in circumstances where the facts underlying the suspicion of bribery are still being clarified is unacceptable, contrary to the presumption of innocence and unfair to the applicant," added the lawyer.
As rus.err.ee wrote, former vice-mayor of Tartu Valvo Semilarski will not be prosecuted on charges of bribery - a criminal case against him was partially closed in July.
At the same time the former official is being tried on charges of deliberate violation of anti-corruption laws in large-scale transactions.
According to the indictment, between 2015 and 2017 the former deputy mayor of Tartu participated more than thirty times in meetings of the city government when making decisions related to companies operating in Tartu, with the owners or managers of which Semilarski actively communicated on a personal level outside of working hours.
According to Gross, Semilarski had personal interests in all these cases and therefore he had to step out of the decision-making process.
Earlier, as rus.err.ee wrote, the prosecutor's office charged Semilarski with taking bribes and violating anti-corruption laws in large-scale transactions.
This happened in October 2016, when he was detained together with another deputy mayor Artem Suvorov (Centrist Party).
At that time, the Prosecutor's Office and the Security Police stated that there was strong evidence against both deputy mayors.
After that both officials resigned.
The Suvorov case later reached the court, which acquitted the politician completely.
The judicial investigation into Valvo Semilarski's case is still ongoing.

U.S. urged Qatar and its neighbors to end the dispute
Trust and unity must be restored between Qatar and other states, said U.S. Special Representative for Iran Brian Hook.
He said the conflict between the emirate and other countries in the region has lasted too long and is damaging to regional interests in stability, prosperity and security.

The emirate is third in natural gas reserves, sixth in natural gas exports and a major exporter of oil and petroleum products.

How the decision of the Central Bank to lower the key rate will affect the economy
The Bank of Russia has lowered its key rate in response to expectations.
It has fallen by another 0.25 percentage points, to 4.25% per annum - formally another historic low.
Judging by the return of the short rate cut, as well as the tone of the Central Bank's statements and the updated forecasts for the Russian economy, the regulator looks at the economic outlook more optimistically than before.
This means that the current cycle of monetary policy easing may soon come to a halt.
"We have continued monetary policy easing, primarily given that there are still risks of inflation deviating downward from 4% in 2021," Bank of Russia Governor Elvira Nabiullina said.
They are associated with a significant decline in economic activity, falling domestic and external demand.
Economic recovery, according to Nabiullina, will take more than a year and a half.
At the same time, she noted that after the removal of the restrictions due to the pandemic, the economic processes have revived: the energy consumption, consumer and investment demand have recovered, the construction and production of consumer goods have expanded, the annual rate of decline of freight transport and industrial production has slowed down.
According to the updated forecast of the Central Bank, in 2020 the reduction of the economy will be 4.5-5.5% (previously it was expected 4-6%), and the recovery growth of the economy in 2021 will be 3.5-4.5%, and in 2022 - 2.5-3.5%.
In addition, the Bank of Russia has revised its forecast for annual oil prices to $38 and $40 per barrel Urals in 2020 and 2021, respectively.
The Central Bank had previously expected $27 and $35 a barrel.
Finally, the Bank of Russia's inflation forecast for 2020 was 3.7-4.2% vs. the previously expected 3.8-4.8%.
The Bank of Russia's view of the economic situation is becoming more optimistic, which brings us closer to the end of the easing cycle, according to Renaissance Capital's Russia and CIS economists Sofia Donets and Andrey Melashchenko.
Thus, the Bank of Russia has been consistently reducing the key rate for more than a year, since the beginning of last summer it has already dropped by 3.5 percentage points.
And at the last meeting in June, the Central Bank lowered it by one percentage point at once due to the low rate of inflation in connection with the suppressed demand and the need to stimulate the economy, slowed by the pandemic and the restrictions associated with it.
Chances of monetary policy fine-tuning remain (at the next meeting on September 18 and before the end of the year), but the limit is close, agrees Rosbank chief analyst Evgeny Koshelev.
The combination of pro-inflation risks also points to the proximity of a pause in easing of the interest rate policy - disrupted supply chains, possible growth of costs due to measures to prevent the epidemic and faster (than expected) recovery of demand, he says.
On top of that, subsequent actions by the Bank of Russia will require more attention to inflationary processes during the harvest season, as well as external volatility, increased against the background of geopolitical conflicts, Koshelev points out.
One way or another key rate reduction will lead to further reduction in interest rates for the most reliable borrowers, and possibly on mortgages, says Maxim Petronevich, senior economist of the analytical department of the bank "Otkritie".
Rate correction will be less pronounced than the reduction of the key rate, he specifies.
Rates on consumer loans may fall another 0.3-0.6 percentage points during the second half of the year, mortgage rates could end the year in the range of 6.2-7%, assumes economist Anton Pokatovich BCS Premier.
Average rates on deposits, in his opinion, will also fall - in the next few months they could fall to 4.2-4.5% (now barely above 4.5%).
Further, they could fall to 4% if the Central Bank lowers the key rate in the fall, according to Pokatovich.
The Center Party promises to pay off all of its debts by the end of the year
Mikhail Korb, general secretary of the Center Party, told this in an interview with ERR.

Poll: Lithuania's ruling Union of Farmers and Greens tops the party ranking again
The Lithuanian Peasants' and Greens' Union, which heads the governing coalition of the Seimas, has topped the party rating.
This showed a survey conducted by Vilmorus sociological research company commissioned by the newspaper Lietuvos rytas.
After winning the 2016 parliamentary elections, the "peasants" lost first place, and for a long time the main critic of Russia in Lithuania, the opposition Fatherland Union - Christian Democrats (Conservatives), was in the lead.
Nevertheless, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausseda, recently assessing the electoral capabilities of the parties, said that the Union of Peasants and Greens would probably be able to form a coalition again after this year's parliamentary elections.
This statement angered conservatives.
The latest poll shows that if parliamentary elections were held today, 17.6 percent of voters would vote for the peasants and 17.2 percent for the conservatives.
According to Vilmorus director Vladas Gaidis, the gap is within the margin of error, and yet the ruling party has stopped lagging behind the conservatives.
According to Gaidis, the news that Prime Minister Saulius Skvernyalis would head their electoral list contributed to the sociological success of the "peasants.
This politician was at the top of the "peasants'" list in the 2016 elections as well.
In third place is the Social Democratic Party, for which 7.1 percent of respondents are now willing to vote.
It unexpectedly lost 2 percent over the month.
Fourth is the Labor Party, headed by businessman of Russian origin Viktor Uspaskikh (6.2 percent).
The rest of the political organizations, according to the poll, have so far failed to pass the 5 percent electoral threshold.

In the autumn session at the plenary session of the State Duma plan to consider the second reading of the bill establishing the requirements for the content and composition of the application for participation in the procurement, participants in which may only be small and medium businesses.
Amendments are being made by the government to the law "On the procurement of goods, works and services by certain types of legal entities".
The bill is developed in execution of the road map of the Strategy of development of small and medium business in the Russian Federation until 2030 approved by the government.
It provides for the preparation of a draft law on an exhaustive list of documents that customers are entitled to require as part of an application from participants in procurement - small and medium businesses.
As well as a list of requirements for these documents.
To date, the law "On the procurement of goods, works and services by individual types of legal entities" framework regulates the procurement activities of certain types of legal entities.
Requirements to the content, form, design and composition of the application for participation in the procurement are set by customers themselves in the documentation of the procurement.
"As a result, customers set excessive requirements for the content, design of the application, the mandatory presence in its composition of certificates, certificates, extracts, the term for obtaining which in the authorized bodies is comparable to the time of filing, which leads to the inability to participate in such a procurement and reduce the number of participants in the procurement, "- said in an explanation of the bill.
The new bill provides an exhaustive list of documents that customers have the right to require as part of the application from participants in the procurement, which are small and medium-sized businesses.
"Adoption of the document will allow to exclude arbitrary establishment by customers of requirements to the composition and contents of applications of participants which are small and medium enterprises", - is said in the explanatory note.

International affairs experts Aaron David Miller and Richard Sokolsky have called Mike Pompeo the worst secretary of state in United States history.
A piece with their opinion was published July 23 by CNN.
"In just two short years, Mike Pompeo - with his sights set on becoming president in 2024 and supporting President Donald Trump - has become not only the worst secretary of state in U.S. history, but also the most politically biased," the text reads.

According to them, the secretary of state, in particular, is covering up "Trump's blackmail of Ukraine" and is willing to frame U.S. foreign policy officials for their cooperation with Congress on the case.

Because of this, the share of production intake from cooperatives declined.
The head of the region ordered the Acting Minister of Agriculture to go on site, to study the structure of milk sales, to analyze the experience of other territories and identify options to solve the problem.

Moscow region authorities told about the fate of the closed dumps
Moscow Region keeps closing landfills for solid domestic waste.
This year the authorities promise to liquidate the last ones.
Some of the 39 existing landfills in the region are being upgraded into modern waste processing complexes.
But this option is not possible for every landfill - many of them are overgrown with dense residential buildings.
After a landfill is closed, it is placed on recultivation - the body of the landfill is covered with soils, and degassing and infiltration drainage systems are installed.
This allows to stop chemical processes inside the landfill, so it does not ignite, does not emit stench, and does not poison the soil and groundwater.
And then the former landfill remains towering as a useless heap among the surrounding housing development.
Why not make something useful out of it?
For example, in Ruza, where the reclamation of the Annino landfill was recently completed, the authorities are considering turning the pile into a ski slope.
This landfill, operated from 1976 to 2016, has grown so that it went beyond the boundaries of the land allocated to it.
So the reclamation effort had to buy out neighboring lots that had long been de-facto littered with trash to the ground.
"Some time will pass, the landfill will "sit up", will gain strength, and we will think about what we can do to make it begin to be useful.
Right in the eye - a ski resort", - told reporters the head of the Ruzsky district, Nikolai Parfenov.
Two landfills will become sites for the production of renewable energy sources
Landfills "Torbeyevo" in Lyubertsy and "Timokhovo" in Bogorodsk district will be sites for production of renewable energy from landfill and biological gases.
By the end of the year on the territory of "Torbeyevo" a gas piston power station will be put into operation that is able to produce up to 8 million kilowatt-hours of electricity and about 0.95 gigacalories of heat energy per year, which will cover the landfill own needs - heat for the administrative and industrial premises.
"Timokhovo" will produce 72.5 million kilowatt-hours and will continue to operate as a waste processing complex.
And on Balashikha landfill "Kuchino", which was closed after complaints of residents on the "Direct line" with the President of the country, a museum can be created.
"There was such an idea - to create a museum of landfill reclamation near Moscow," said Dmitry Kurakin, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Ecology and Nature Management of the region.

According to Degtyarev, Khabarovsk Territory now can not remain without a leader, so he was appointed head of the region by decree of President Vladimir Putin, so that "a wonderful building (the government of the region) functioned, everything worked and the budget was spent on social needs."
The acting governor explained that he had not gone out to the protesters before because he could not communicate with thousands of demonstrators.
That is why he broadcasts on social networks and reads all the comments on them.
On July 25, there were two consecutive protests in Khabarovsk.
Rallies in support of the former governor have been held in the region since 11 July.
On the eve of another rally, Mikhail Degtyarev announced that he would leave the city on the day of the rally.
His motorcade was stopped by protesters who called on him to speak out about the fate of the arrested ex-governor, Furgal.
Degtyarev had previously refused to come out to the protesters.

Beautiful high minarets only decorated Ayia Sofia
Once again about the Ayia-Sofia - I came across a text by Father Vladimir Zelinsky that they should protest.
First of all the admission is free there - hurray!
I have not been to Istanbul, but it is better to enter the House of God for free than for a fee.
Secondly, Muslims conquered this land just as honestly as Orthodox conquered the Volga-Oka interfluves, the Muslim Caucasus (and put a church in Grozny) and planted apple trees on Mars.
Godspeed!
The Jews conquered the Holy Land.
The Americans conquered Americas.
Are we going to give it all back to everyone?
Do you think there won't be pagans who will demand the return of their capitol, which is the site of the Church of the Tithe?
Thirdly, the Muslims have improved this building, invested in it.
That is, it belongs to them, just like the factories and estates that the Leninists took away from the bourgeoisie as their property, belong to the Leninists - Putin and the rest of the nomenklatura.
They improved everything from the Kremlin to the Angara, so it's all theirs by right of progressors.
The beautiful high minarets really decorated the Ayia Sofia, a lot.
There was a silly inkpot, became a silly inkpot with beautiful minarets.
Fourth, there are no "Islamic" or "Orthodox" civilizations.
There are believers, there are hypocrites, and there are prudes who conflate faith and hypocrisy.
The believer does not think in terms of civilization.
This is the thinking of the British Foreign Office official Toynbee, the believer is ashamed to think that way.
And the believer has a place of prayer everywhere.
And always.
The believer does not pray only where he is asked to remove himself from - he removes to another place and prays there.
He is a believer, not a defender.
We're knuckle-draggers, not sullen rocks.

A Rwandan national has confessed that he set fire to a cathedral in Nantes.
A Rwandan national who voluntarily worked at Saints Peter and Paul's church in Nantes, France, has admitted to setting the cathedral on fire a week after it burst into flames.
This was reported on Sunday by the France 3 television channel.
According to its data, the man, who had already been detained on July 19, the day after the fire, was detained again the day before.
On Saturday night he appeared before an investigating judge.
After being charged with willful damage to property, the man confessed to setting the fires in three locations - under a large organ, under a small organ and at an electrical panel.
He now faces up to 10 years in prison and a 150,000 euro fine.
Motives of the 39-year-old native of Rwanda are not reported yet.
We only know that he volunteered to help in the cathedral and had to close its doors on the day of the fire.
However, according to CCTV footage, he left the religious institution 15 minutes after receiving calls about a fire in the building.
The fire at Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral broke out on July 18.
More than 200 firefighters fought the Gothic architectural monument for several hours.
Nevertheless they could not save the stained-glass windows of the time of Louis XII and the unique baroque organ.
They managed to take the situation under control only three hours after the beginning of the fire.
As a result of the incident no one was injured.
This is not the first fire during the existence of the temple.
In 1972, the fire destroyed the roof of the temple.
It took 13 years to eliminate the consequences of that fire.
For parishioners the cathedral was reopened only in 1985.

Andrei Kirilenko, head of Russian Basketball Federation (RFB), shared his memories of playing against the legendary Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan in National Basketball Association (NBA) games.
I knew that Bryant's ego shouldn't be hurt by any kind of thrash talk, lest it stimulate his athletic anger.
Kobe had a killer instinct, so I tried to talk him down on the court so he wouldn't take the game in an aggressive way.
On the court, I gave him compliments: "О!
Kobe, good scoring, good pass!
When he listened to me cheer, he almost forgot about the extra point he had to make to get his hands on the ball and score another 3 or 4 points.
We communicated well with Kobe," "Vechernyaya Moskva" quotes Kirilenko.
He also talked about his first game against Jordan.
"I was guarding him.
For the first three minutes of the game, I was running around in utter delight that there was a legend next to me that I had only seen on TV.
While my breath caught in my throat with joy, Michael scored a lot of points.
Soon I came away from the excitement, hitting a few of his shots...
My team won that game, but Jordan still had 44 points," added the head of RFB.
Kirilenko spent 12 seasons in the NBA.
He was selected by the Utah Jazz in the 1999 draft with the 24th overall pick.

Acting Governor of Khabarovsk region Mikhail Degtyarev on Sunday, July 26, during a meeting with residents of Sovetskaya Gavan was surprised that the region buys Sakhalin gas produced by U.S. company Exxon Neftegas for dollars.

Degtyarev noted that the issue was discussed with Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak during his visit to Khabarovsk on July 24.
The Acting Governor also stressed that by 2025 Gazprom will switch to supplying Russian thermal power plants and facilities, which means that Russian gas purchased in rubles "at normal prices" will be used.
The Sakhalin-1 project is being realized by means of a production sharing agreement where Exxon Neftegas Ltd. is the project operator with a 30% share, Rosneft has another 20%, Sodeco of Japan has 30% and ONGC of India has 20%.

Russian TV series actor responded to accusations of "propaganda of LGBT and feminism
An actor in the Russian TV series "Chiki," whose creators were accused of "propaganda of LGBT and feminism," responded to the claims about the film.
The authors "understood the poignancy of the topics raised and did not want to offend anyone," said American Stephen Thomas Ochsner in a conversation with Lift Up.
"It seems to me to be a story about strength and the general aspects of human life.
It has nothing to do with LGBT or feminism," said the actor, who played the father of a boy who changed into women's clothes.
He stressed that he was "proud of the work" and did not consider it propaganda.
At the same time, the American added, he is frightened by the reaction of some people to the storyline of the series: for example, there was a case where "a man in a deep binge shot the set and said that all this is not true."
"Then there were a couple of instances where we met disgruntled locals who didn't understand what we were doing.
But we were open, so people who initially came in with complaints started helping us," he concluded.
The shooting incident, the publication explains, occurred in September 2019 in Kabardino-Balkaria: a drunken man attacked the car of a film crew with a gun, after which he was detained by police officers.
Earlier it was reported that Olga Baranets, public commissioner for family protection, sent a complaint to the Interior Ministry and Roskomnadzor against the service more.tv, which posted the Russian TV series "Chiki".
Baranets accused the show's creators of "propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships and feminism," pointing out that the film's main characters work as prostitutes, and the show itself contains "scenes of physical and psychological violence.
The ombudsman was also outraged by the fact that "in the series a lot of attention is paid to the homosexual sexual orientation" of the underage character.
The comedy drama "Chicks" is about three prostitutes who start a new life and start a business on the advice of a friend.
