Semilarski v. Prosecutor's Office: Former Vice Mayor of Tartu's cassation to be considered on August 4
That means a ruling on it is likely to be handed down in early September.
The two first courts to hear Semilarski's claim refused, but in April, his cassation complaint was taken into action by the State Court.
The Tartu Administrative Court returned the complaint to the complainant on December 12, 2019, because its permission was not within its jurisdiction of the administrative court.
The court order stated that the complaint included a claim for damages caused in criminal proceedings.
“The prosecutor's office and county court should regulate such matters,” Anette Creutsmann, a spokeswoman for the Tartu courts, previously explained to ERR.
She said Valvo Semilarski appealed the ruling to the District Court, which on February 5 did not change the trial court's decision.
The State Court will now have to say its word.
His client had been unreasonably under suspicion of bribery for about two years, according to Semilarski's defense attorney, sworn attorney Oliver Näes.
He now requires the prosecutor's office to refute incorrect allegations against its own and pay him for moral damages.
The reason for filing the complaint to the court was the statements made by the Liuna District Prosecutor's Office of Special Cases, Margus Gross, made by him in October 2017, when Semilarski along with another at that time Tartu Vice Mayor Artem Suvorov was detained on suspicion of several crimes.
“When I was detained, the Security Police and the Prosecutor's Office immediately organized a press conference and informed the entire Republic of Estonia that the leaders of Tartu are one of the most influential local governments - are saleable.
These hung public suspicions in the air accompanied me for about two years.
And now that these allegations and suspicions have been proven to be false, the prosecutor's office doesn't want to say anything about it,” Semilarski commented in early August 2019.
At a news conference, the prosecutor went beyond the legal framework in which the prosecutor's office should operate, Oliver Näes said.
'The claim of bribes and sales has been proven false, but that's not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly stressed in its rulings on Russia as well as Lithuania that during the investigation phase, state representatives must be careful when choosing words so that suspects would not be represented in the role of criminals before sentencing.
To this, the prosecutor's office also obliges the presumption of innocence, which unfortunately was not observed in this case against Valvo Semilarski,” Näes said.
“The public representation of Semilarski as a serious offender and briber in circumstances where the facts behind the suspicion of bribery are still being elucidated is unacceptable, which is contrary to the presumption of innocence and unfair to the complainant,” the lawyer added.
As rus.err.ee wrote, former Tartu Vice Mayor Valvo Semilarski will not be prosecuted on bribery charges - the criminal case against him in July was partially closed.
At the same time, the former official is being tried on charges of knowingly violating anti-corruption laws while carrying out transactions in particularly large amounts.
According to the indictment, between 2015 and 2017, the former deputy mayor of Tartu attended city department meetings more than thirty times in making decisions related to incumbents in Tartu companies whose owners or executives Semilarski actively communicated on a personal level during after-hours hours.
According to Gross, in all of these cases, Semilarski had personal interests, and therefore he had to be suspended from taking part in decision-making.
Earlier, rus.err.ee wrote, the prosecutor's office had raised Semilarski suspicions of taking a bribe and violating anti-corruption laws in particularly large transactions.
This happened in October 2016, when he was detained along with another deputy mayor, Artem Suvorov (Centrist Party).
The prosecutor's office and Security Police then said there was strong evidence against both vice mayors.
Both officials then resigned.
Suvorov's case later reached the court, which fully vindicated the politician.
The trial investigation of Valvo Semilarski is still ongoing.
Ex-Hands Up Soloist Visits Tver Region
Ex-Hands Up soloist and now solo performer, businessman and actor Sergei Zhukov posted a photo from Kalyazin in the Tver region on his official Instagram account.
Photo posted a day ago, Saturday, July 25.

Write in the comments, what's the weather in your city?
We have no rain today, but above +20 is not rising yet”..., Zhukov writes on social media.
Probably the singer is vacationing in the beautiful city of Tver region with his family.
Residents of the region have already thanked the performer for the visit, and expressed hope for a meeting and personal communication.
The new “Crumb” referred to in the post is probably due to the new version of an old song that Zhukov has now recorded with blogger and musician David Manukian (DAVA M).
Most fans stay BEHIND the old version: “Sergey, the old version of the song is clearly 1,000,000 times better!
Support me dedicated “Hands Up"” fans, “Don't We Need a “New Crumb"”.
Most write directly that the original, which was a hit at one time, they like it better.

US calls on Qatar and its neighbors to end dispute
Trust and unity between Qatar and other states must be restored, according to the US Special Representative for Iran, Brian Hook.
He said the conflict between the emirate and other countries in the region had lasted too long and was damaging regional interests in stability, prosperity and security.
So far, the U.S. has tried unsuccessfully to mediate a settlement of the dispute, which Washington sees as a “threat to efforts to contain Iran.”
Diplomatic relations with Qatar broke the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Bahrain three years ago.
They set up a transport blockade, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorism.
In response, Doha said neighbours were simply jealous of Qatar's economic successes - according to the IMF, Qatar has been leading by a large margin in GDP per capita for several years.
The Emirate is the third largest natural gas reserves, the sixth exporter of natural gas and a major exporter of oil and petroleum products.

How Central Bank's decision to cut key rate will affect the economy
The Bank of Russia expected to cut its key rate again.
It dipped another 0.25 percentage point, to 4.25% APR - formally another historic low.
Judging by the return of the short step of the rate cut, as well as the tone of the Central Bank's statements and updated forecasts on the Russian economy, the regulator is looking more optimistic than before.
That means the current monetary easing cycle may soon stop.
“We continued monetary easing, primarily considering that there are still risks of deflecting inflation down from 4% in 2021,” Bank of Russia governor Elvira Nabiullina said.
They are associated with significant declines in economic activity, falling domestic and external demand.
Recovering the economy, Nabiullina said, will take more than a year and a half.
At the same time, she noted that economic processes had been revived since the removal of restrictions due to the pandemic: energy consumption, consumer and investment demand were restored, construction and consumer goods output, slowed the annual rate of decline in transport and industrial production.
According to the Central Bank's clarified forecast, the economy will shrink 4.5-5.5 per cent in 2020 (up to 4 per cent expected) and recovery growth of 3.5-4.5 per cent in 2021, and 2.5-3.5% in 2022.
In addition, the Bank of Russia revised its forecast for annual oil prices to $38 and $40 per barrel Urals in 2020 and 2021 respectively.
The central bank had previously expected $27 and $35 a barrel.
Finally, the Bank of Russia's 2020 inflation forecast was 3.7-4.2% against the previously expected 3.8-4.8%.
The Bank of Russia's view of the economy is becoming more optimistic, bringing us closer to the end of the easing cycle, according to Russian and Renaissance Capital CIS economists Sofia Donets and Andrei Melashchenko.
For example, the Bank of Russia has consistently cut its key rate for more than a year, since the beginning of last summer it has already fallen by 3.5 percentage points.
At its last meeting in June, the Central Bank downgraded it by one percentage point due to low inflation due to depressed demand and the need to stimulate a stalled pandemic and related with it constraints the economy.
The chances of pre-tuning monetary policy remain (at the next meeting on September 18 and before the end of the year), but the limit is close, agrees Rosbank's chief analyst Yevgeny Koshelev.
The combination of pro-inflation risks also indicates the proximity of a pause in interest policy easing - broken supply chains, possible cost increases due to epidemic prevention measures, and faster ( compared to expectations) a recovery in demand, he says.
In addition, the Bank of Russia's subsequent actions will require greater attention to inflationary processes during the harvest season, as well as external volatility that has increased amid geopolitical conflicts, Koshelev indicates.
One way or another a key rate cut will further cut rates for the most reliable borrowers, as well as possibly on mortgages, says a senior economist at the bank's analytical office” Opening” Maxim Petronevich.
The rate correction will be less pronounced than a key rate cut, he elaborates.
Consumption rates could fall another 0.3-0.6 percentage point during the second half, mortgage rates could end the year in the range of 6.2-7 per cent, BCS Premier economist Anton does not rule out Pocatovich.
Average deposit rates, he believes, will fall too - they could dip towards 4.2-4.5 per cent in the coming months (now barely above 4.5%).
Next, they could drop as much as 4% if the Central Bank cuts its key rate in the autumn, according to Pocatovic.
Centrist party vows to pay all its debts by the end of the year
Mikhail Korb, Secretary General of the Centrist Party, spoke about this in an interview with ERR.
He said the total amount of payments the party is to make is about 300,000 euros.
“On today's financial forecasts, the Centrist Party will reckon with its current debts and liabilities by the end of this year,” Korb said.
Earlier, it was revealed that the prime minister's party had returned 110,100 euros to the state, which was deemed a prohibited donation.

They maintain friendships, they have a child in common, but he still can't come to his senses.
His destructive behavior is a cry of despair, trying to either get killed, or get her attention.

Poll: Lithuania's ruling Union of Peasants and Greens tops party ratings again
The Union of Peasants and Greens of Lithuania, which leads the ruling coalition of the Sejm, topped the parties' rankings.

In third place is the Social Democratic Party, with 7.1 per cent of respondents now willing to vote for.

The commission for this facility was given by the President of the Russian Federation fourteen years ago.
But it's only now that the situation has managed to shift from a dead point.

Moscow region authorities tell of the fate of closed landfills
Solid waste landfills continue to be closed in Moscow.
This year, authorities are promising to eliminate the latter.
Some of the 39 landfills that existed in the field are being upgraded into modern garbage processing complexes.
But this option is not possible for every landfill site - many of them have grown with dense residential development.
Once the landfill is closed, it is reclaimed - the polygon's body is filled with soil, degassing and infiltrate diversion systems are mounted.
This allows chemical processes inside the landfill to stop so that it does not ignite, exude stench, and poisons soil and groundwater.
And then the former dump is left to be towered by a useless pile among its residential developments.
Why not make something useful out of her?
For example, in Ruse, where the reclamation of the Annino range finished just the other day, authorities are considering the option of making a ski slope out of the pile.
This landfill, which operated from 1976 to 2016, has grown so far beyond the boundaries of the land allocated to it.
Therefore, in reclamation, it was necessary to buy back adjacent sites, de facto long already littered with litter.
“Some time will pass, the range will “fit,” the fortress will be set up, and we will think what can be done to make it a good start.
The ski resort is thrown right in the eye,” Nikolay Parfenov, the head of the Ruz district, told reporters.
Two landfills to be renewable energy production sites
The Torbeevo landfills in Lyubertsy and Timokhovo in Bogorodorod Okrug will be sites for the extraction of renewable energy from landfill and biological gases.
Torbeev will launch a gas piston power plant by the end of the year, capable of generating up to 8 million kilowatt hours of electricity and about 0.95 gigacalories of thermal energy per year, which will provide the landfill's own needs - the heating supply of administrative and production facilities.
Timokhovo will produce 72.5 million kilowatt-hours and will continue to operate as a waste processing complex.
And a museum could be set up at the Kucino Balashikha training ground, which was closed after complaints from residents about a “Straight Line” with the country's president.
“This idea was to create a museum for the reclamation of landfills in Moscow,” said Dmitry Kurakin, Deputy Chief Minister of Ecology and Environmental Management of the region.

Beautiful high minarets only decorated Ayia Sofia
Once again about Ayia Sophia, the text of Vladimir Zelinsky was caught up, which, maul, should be protested.
First, there became free admission - hooray!
I haven't been to Istanbul, but the House of God is better free admission than paid.
Second, Muslims conquered this land as honestly as the Orthodox conquered the Volga-Oksk interregnum, the Muslim Caucasus (and put the church in Grozny) and planted apple trees on Mars.
God in aid!
Jews conquered the Holy Land.
The Americans conquered America.
Are we going to give everything back to everyone?
Do you think there will be no heathens who will demand the return of their capital, where the Tithe Church is in place?
Third, Muslims have improved this building, invested in it.
That is, they are the same as the factories and estates that the Leninists took from the bourgeois in their ownership, belong to the Leninists - Putin and other nomenclature.
They've improved everything - from the Kremlin to Angara, so it's all their rightfully progressors.
Beautiful high minarets very decorated Ayia Sofia, very much.
There was a stupid inkwell, became a stupid inkwell with beautiful minarets.
Fourth, there are no “Islamic” and “orthodox” civilizations.
There are believers, there are hypocrites, there are hanzhi combining faith and hypocrisy.
A believer in the categories of civilization does not think.
This is the thinking of British MiD official Toynbee, a believer ashamed to think so.
There's a place of prayer to the faithful everywhere.
And always.
The believer does not pray only where he is asked to remove from - removed elsewhere and prays there.
He's a believer, not an advocate.
We are cologs, not grub-stones.

I knew Bryant's smugness couldn't be caught up with any thrash current to discourage his athletic rant.
Kobe had a killer instinct, so on court I tried to talk him in a way that he didn't take the game in an aggressive way.
On set, I gave him compliments: “Oh!
Kobe, well scored, great pass!
Listening to my enthusiastic responses, he was a little oblivious to the fact that he had to take his hands on the ball again and score 3 - 4 more points.
We communicated well with Kobi,” Kirilenko quoted Vespers Moskva as saying.
He also talked about his first game against Jordan.
“I took care of him.
For the first three minutes of the match I was running in full admiration from being next to me a legend seen only on TV.
While I got joyfully in the gob-breathing, Michael scored a lot of points.
I soon moved away from raptures, covered his throws a couple of times...
In that game, my team won and Jordan still scored 44 points,” the RFB chief added.

Russian TV series actor responds to accusations of 'promoting LGBT and feminism'
The actor of the Russian TV series “Chiki,” whose creators have been accused of “promoting LGBT and feminism,” responded to claims about the film.
The authors “understood the poignancy of the topics raised and did not want to offend anyone,” American Stephen Thomas Oxner said in a conversation with Rise.
“It seems to me that this is a story about the power and the general aspects of human life.
It has nothing to do with LGBT and feminism,” said the actor, who played the father of a boy who changed into women's clothing.
He stressed that he was “proud of the work” and did not consider it propaganda.
At the same time, the American added, he was frightening by some people's reaction to the series' storyline: for example, there was a case where “a man in deep constipation shot the set and said it was all not true.”
'Then a couple of occasions were when we met disgruntled local people who didn't understand what we were doing.
But we were open, so the people who first came in with claims were starting to help us,” he summed up.
The case of the shooting, the publication explains, took place in September 2019 in Kabardino-Balkaria: a drunk man attacked a camera crew's car with a weapon, and then he was detained by police officers.
Earlier, it was reported that Olga Baranets, the public commissioner for family protection, sent a complaint to the Interior Ministry and Roskomnadzor against more.tv, which hosted the Russian TV series “Chiki”.

In the Belgorod region, a woman confessed to killing her own husband, whom she dumped in a hole of waste and poured concrete, according to the website of the Russian Federation Regional Office.
It is noted that the suspect had been married to the murdered man since 1999.
In recent years, the husband began to abuse alcohol and after another altercation, the woman decided to kill.
“When the spouse fell asleep, the suspect tied his hands and legs, put a plastic bag over his head and pressed him with a pillow.
When the spouse stopped giving signs of life, wrapped her body in a carpet, carried to the yard and covered in a cesspool.
The next day called a concrete mixer and poured the pit with concrete,” the management said.
The woman later reported the spouse missing.
Relatives of the deceased contacted police, who uncovered the pit and retrieved the body.
The inquiry intends to ask the court to arrest the suspect.
The investigation of the criminal case is currently ongoing.
