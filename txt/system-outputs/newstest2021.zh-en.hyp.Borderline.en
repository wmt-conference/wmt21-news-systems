Talents are the key to rural revitalization.
Where to find talent?
Outstanding returning migrant workers are an indispensable new force.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 26th. Title: Turning outstanding returning migrant workers into a new force for rural revitalization
Zhang Xiong, 34, lives in Guoyuan Village, Meishan City, Sichuan. In 2010, he quit his job in Beijing with a monthly salary of tens of thousands and returned home to start a business.
After several years of hard work, the annual income of the grape-growing family farm he runs now exceeds one million yuan, and he has become a well-known leader in getting rich. He has also been selected into the village's " two committees " team.
In recent years, inspired by a series of policies to support agriculture and benefit agriculture, such as national poverty alleviation and rural revitalization, more and more outstanding migrant workers like Zhang Xiong have chosen to return home to start their own businesses, activating a pool of spring water in the countryside.
Sichuan, a province with a large population in western China and a large labor export province, has implemented the " Outstanding Migrant Workers Return Training Project " according to the situation. In 2019 alone, more than 8,000 village party branch secretaries will be generated from the outstanding migrant workers, 61,000 village reserve forces will be cultivated, and more than 20,000 party members will be developed, providing a strong guarantee for winning the fight against poverty and implementing the rural revitalization strategy.
To achieve initial prosperity in the countryside, it is essential to raise rural living standards and particularly those of impoverished villagers.
Since the reform and opening up, a large number of young and middle-aged laborers in rural China have gone out to work to increase their income, and some have established their own enterprises through hard work.
However, objectively, it has also led to the emergence of " hollowing " to varying degrees in rural areas, especially the weakening of rural grass-roots organizations. Village party branch secretaries and party members all show the characteristics of " one old and one low" , that is, aging, low academic qualifications, weak leaders of village party organizations, and outstanding problems.
If rural talents and other factors have been flowing unidirectionally to the cities, and the countryside has been in a state of " blood loss " and " anemia " for a long time, revitalization is empty talk.
Attract those migrant workers who are capable, conscious and interested in serving their hometowns, guide them to return home to start businesses and become rich leaders, train them to become party members and rural cadres on the basis of merit, and enrich the ranks of grass-roots cadres. This is the fundamental solution to the problem that rural party members and grass-roots party organizations are not connected with each other.
Excellent migrant workers can be attracted back, but they must be kept and done well.
In recent years, Sichuan has started by paying close attention to the party building of migrant workers. On the basis of strict selection criteria, it has established institutional mechanisms such as directional referral, service guarantee, training and promotion, selection and use of outstanding migrant workers, so that they can improve their abilities, have security in their work, have hope in their lives, truly take root in rural areas, and have a sense of accomplishment in starting a business.
This year is the end of the decisive battle against poverty. Talents are the key factor in the connection between poverty alleviation and rural revitalization.
Party committees and governments at all levels should attach great importance to the group of outstanding returning migrant workers, and through comprehensive measures, turn them into a task force and a new force that can stay, fight and cannot be taken away, so as to provide strong organizational guarantee and talent support for rural poverty alleviation, well-off development and revitalization.
Because of the epidemic, this year's college graduates are very special. On the evening of July 11, the bilibili summer graduation song will bring a special live online performance for the graduates. Musicians such as Lao Lang, Pu Shu, Li Yuchun and Mao buyi send songs and blessings to the fresh graduates.
Well-known up host SealWu Wu Yifan also brought a song " Wild Grass" , which is a rap song based on Lu Xun's prose poems of the same name, which is extremely popular among young people.
Due to the epidemic situation, many graduates failed to experience the ritual sense of setting ears and awarding degree certificates on the spot, so they transferred the ritual sense to the online.
Data show that the peak live broadcast popularity of this 2.5-hour song will exceed 35 million.
" Follow your own heart, seize the opportunity, regardless of the consequences, sometimes there will be unexpected gains. "
Although it is a graduation song party, many songs also move non-fresh graduates.
" I really want to cry after watching the whole show. Everyone's youth is full of beauty and regret, but it is worth remembering and going on bravely. "
Beijing's natural ecology continues to improve, attracting more than 500 species of wild animals to " settle " in the city-chinanews.com

The natural ecology of the capital continues to improve, attracting wildlife cities to " settle down "
More than 500 species of wild animals in Beijing
(Reporter Wang Bin) A reporter from Beijing Youth Daily learned from the Municipal Bureau of Landscaping and Greening that in recent years, with the continuous improvement of the capital's natural ecological environment, the types and numbers of wild animals have also continued to increase.
At present, the number of terrestrial vertebrate wild animals inhabiting Beijing has increased to more than 500 species, including national first-class protected animals such as brown pheasant and black stork, as well as national second-class protected animals such as goral, swan, gray crane and mandarin duck.
Whether planted into urban forests everywhere in the Second Ring Road or embedded in small and micro wetlands between buildings, it not only brings the wildness of nature to the citizens of the capital, but also attracts wild animals to " settle " in the city.
In midsummer, Songshan National Nature Reserve, located in the Yanshan Mountains in the northwest of Yanqing District, is full of vitality.
A raccoon was playing leisurely by the mountain stream, while two badgers were fighting with each other.
Looking back, a wild boar couldn't help scratching and rubbing against the bark. Hu Qiaoli, director of the Songshan National Nature Reserve Management Office, said that by the end of 2019, there were 178 species of wild animals living in this green sea with a total area of more than 6,200 hectares, including the national first-class protected animal golden eagle and the national second-class protected animal spoon chicken and impala. Nearly one third of the city's wild animal species can be found here.
" In Songshan, wild animals are the real' masters', and our staff can only be regarded as the' bodyguards' of others at best. "
Hu Qiaoli said that in order to understand the situation of wildlife in the reserve on the spot, there are more than 30 professional patrol members every day to patrol along 16 carefully formulated protection routes, and there will be a " big circle " every month, spending a whole day almost all over the reserve.
" During inspections, we should not only check and record biodiversity, but also check and install artificial bird nests, rescue injured wild animals, install field infrared cameras and so on. "
More than 200 infrared cameras have been installed in Songshan National Nature Reserve to record the living conditions of wild animals in the forest.
Hu Qiaoli said that with the continuous enrichment of biodiversity in the reserve in recent years, more and more wild animals have appeared in the camera, leopard cats, raccoon dogs and pig badgers have become " resident guests" , and the " appearance rate " of the national second-class protected animal impala is also getting higher and higher.
Zhang Zhiming, director of the Wildlife and Wetland Protection Division of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Landscaping and Greening, said that the number of terrestrial vertebrate wild animals in Beijing has increased from 461 in 1994 to more than 500 now, and the species and number of wild animals in Beijing have continued to increase in recent years.
Wild animals are becoming more and more common in cities, which is closely related to the continuous upgrading of greening in the capital city in recent years.
In particular, the new round of afforestation and greening construction of one million mu, which began in 2018, proposes to reshape the urban ecological environment, enhance the ecological function of woodland and green space, and highlight the concept of " near nature. "
The planning strives to achieve interconnection and interaction with the surrounding green space, so as to facilitate wild animals to " visit relatives and friends" , and the trees planted are also honey and food plants that animals love.
Black land " grows " agricultural modernization-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 26. Title: Black land " grows " agricultural modernization
In midsummer, two spraying planes passed by the 10,000-mu high-yield demonstration field in the second operation station of the fifth management area of Youyi Farm, forming two white lines. The words " the first field in the world " planted with black rice seedlings in the green fields were particularly eye-catching.
Kong Lingqiang, the head of the operation station, said that this kind of aircraft can spray chemicals on more than 6,000 acres of cultivated land a day, and the efficiency is about 8 times that of drones and hundreds of times that of humans.
This farm is located in Youyi County, Heilongjiang Province, China's largest grain-producing province. From the sound of rice cutting in the past to the sound of " rumbling " today, traditional Chinese farming and farms have transformed in this black soil belt.
In addition to airplanes, satellites are also used in the modern agricultural production of Friendship Farm.
Kong Lingqiang introduced that on the one hand, they use satellite remote sensing technology to achieve accurate fertilization, reduce agricultural input and reduce pollution; on the other hand, satellite navigation technology can improve the standardized operation level of agricultural machinery in the field.
In the process of rice production this year, the farm expanded the operating area of satellite navigation unmanned transplanting technology from 3,000 mu last year to 30,000 mu.
This technology makes seedling planting more uniform, maximizes the utilization of sunlight and cultivated land resources, and saves 16 yuan in labor costs per mu.
The farm tried new technologies such as informatization and intelligence in agricultural production, and formed the largest agricultural machinery group in China from the ground to the sky.
According to statistics, the total number of farm machinery is 49,000 units (pieces), and the comprehensive mechanization rate in the field is 99.8%.
Agricultural machinery operations achieve 100% GPS satellite navigation, 100% precision seeding in dry fields, and 100% high-horsepower locomotive operations in dry fields.
" Green agriculture, smart agriculture and digital agriculture are the exploration directions of agricultural modernization. "
Liu Hualian, director of Friendship Farm, said.
The key to agricultural modernization lies in scientific and technological progress.
Heilongjiang Agricultural Reclamation, represented by farms, has played a demonstration and leading role in modern large-scale agriculture in recent years, and has initially established a modern agricultural industrial system dominated by large-scale planting, standardized production and industrial management.
On the outskirts of Youyi County, there is an Agricultural Machinery Expo Park covering an area of 350,000 square meters.
More than 140 sets (pieces) of agricultural machinery introduced and used by Heilongjiang Agricultural Reclamation over the years are displayed here.
These agricultural machinery and farms have witnessed the development of China's agricultural modernization.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, July 26. Title: Give up a small family for everyone-Anhui Hefei Jiangkouhe Lianwei mass transfer direct attack
Xinhua News Agency reporters Chen Shangying, Wang Liwu and Liu Xiacun
At 4 o'clock in the afternoon on July 25, Fu Kunbao wore mud-covered rubber shoes. From the front room to the back room, he and his wife Zhou Yan were busy packing things back and forth.
" After receiving a call from the village cadre to transfer, I was still weeding in the field. "
Fu Kunbao said that he has transferred more than 60 acres of land and planted rice, and is now growing well. " I took the medicine yesterday, and I haven't cleaned up all the tools. "
Fu Kunbao pointed to the pesticide sprayer placed in the corner. " No one wants their home to be flooded. Give up a small home for everyone. "
In response to the continued high water level pressure and possible heavy rainfall in Chaohu Lake, Hefei City, Anhui Province is preparing to open flood diversion and storage in Jiangkouhe Lianwei, where Fu Kunbao's family is located, on the 26th.
Jiangkouhe Lianwei is located in Feixi County, next to Chaohu Dike.
There are thousands of villagers involved in Yandian Township and Sanhe Town who need to be transferred.
As of 16: 00 on the 25th, the water level of Chaohu Lake, China's fifth largest freshwater lake, remained at a high level of 13.2 meters, 0.7 meters above the guaranteed water level.
Fu Kunbao's kitchen is clean, with a pot of pumpkin head vegetables on the table, eggs and some stewed vegetables in the refrigerator.
" I didn't expect to move. The water in Jiangkou River looks good at present. "
Zhou Yan said that the family is a bungalow, and some large objects have not yet been decided where to put them.
" Pack up your valuables first. Large items such as refrigerators and TV sets can be temporarily placed in neighbors or relatives on high ground. "
Wang Liwen, a village cadre, gave Fu Kunbao advice.
Wang Liwen was responsible for the transfer and resettlement of 13 villagers, and notified each household to confirm each person's resettlement plan.
The nearest settlement to Fu Kunbao's home is Su Xiaoxiao School in Yandian Township, about 2 kilometers away.
In addition to the big items, the more than 1,000 catties of grain and some newly bought furniture were also a headache for Fu Kunbao and his wife.
" The food is going to be dragged to relatives' homes, and the furniture can't be moved. "
After a discussion, the couple put a stool under the newly bought bed and raised the bed by about half a meter.
At 6 o'clock in the afternoon, Fu Kunbao began to transport things to relatives' homes by tricycle, and Zhou Yan continued to clean up at home.
At 11 o'clock in the evening, the couple looked back and forth at home, turned on the switch, and prepared to go to the resettlement site.
" I hope the water will return soon. "
Fu Kunbao said.
At 9: 30 a.m. on July 26, the reporter saw at the scene of Jiangkouhe Lianwei that the local area had made various preparations before flood diversion.
Zhang Jikelin Xiaozhai team up to support muscular teenagers-Xinhuanet
Sports Youth Hot-blooded Sports Show " Sports Bar Youth " officially landed on Hunan Satellite TV on July 11.
Sports leader Zhang Jike and sports assistant Lin Xiaozhai cross-border on the same stage. Lin Dan and Fu Yuanhui commented on their respective styles, and the hard core of the " giant " -like power pulling device came on stage, which made the program " burning. "
In the first episode, 11 sports teenagers appeared on the power track, and their appearance surprised the audience. At the same time, the " strong conflict" , " strong confrontation " and " strong heart " on the competition stage also attracted attention.
Among them, the " strong conflict " comes from Super A sports student Qiao Wenyi. Before the race, he openly provoked Xu Zhibin, who is known as the " beautiful man " on the track, choking that Xu Zhibin's appearance conditions should go to sing and dance programs, and even released the cruel words of " Don't cry your makeup if you lose. "
Some remarks made the teenagers and sports leaders on the field take a breath.
The " strong confrontation " is more like an immortal fight. Sun Jianqi, known as the " Great Demon King" , met the equally powerful Zhang Xindong and staged a strong confrontation.
And their identities are unexpected. Sun Jianqi is an actor who loves fitness, and Zhang Xindong is a retired special forces member and three-time Warrior Medal winner.
At the beginning of the game, the two teenagers tried their best to pull out the small pole quickly. The lasting confrontation on the big pole made the audience sweat for them.
Under the tense competition conditions, Zhang Jike, as one of the sports leaders of " Sports Bar Youth" , also watched the game carefully.
In the comment section, he was also very careful, patiently encouraging the teenagers who lost the game, and helping every mistake in the process of resuming the game.
Lin Xiaozhai, a sports assistant, is a fancy assist, and she makes no secret of her appreciation for the teenagers who are online.
When learning about the overloaded daily training of sports teenagers, they are even more admired.
Lin Dan and Fu Yuanhui, who are also sports leaders, have their own styles. One is a calm " prophet " and the other is a " wild girl " who dispels tension with a smile.
In addition, Jike Junyi and Liu Ye, as sports assistants, also created a lot of funny topics around sports teenagers.
Church fire in Nantes, France: Diocese volunteers admit arson is usually kind and reticent-chinanews.com
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) According to foreign media reports, on July 18, the famous Cathedral of St. Peter and St. Paul in Nantes, France, was seriously damaged in a fire, and the large pipe organ was completely destroyed.
On the 26th local time, the Nantes prosecutor announced that a parish volunteer in charge of security in the cathedral had been charged with " arson and destruction. "
He has admitted that he was lighting the fire in the church.
According to the report, local prosecutor Senas said that the 39-year-old parish volunteer from Rwanda admitted that he set fire to three places in the cathedral at night.
The person's lawyer said that the arsonist now regrets doing such a thing.
This person entered France through asylum a few years ago, was sheltered in the parish where the fire occurred, and was taken in in the church.
The prosecution pointed out that recently, he tried to renew his visa and was in dialogue with the police station.
However, the church said it still couldn't believe that this usually very kind, smiling, but not very talkative believer would destroy the church he loved so much.
On the day the fire broke out on July 18, the volunteer had already been questioned and investigated by the police because of illogical problems in the narrative, but he was later released.
The picture shows firefighters carrying out rescue at the scene.
On the evening of the 25th, because professional engineers from the laboratory of the Paris Central Police Department obtained new evidence, this person was summoned again.
This time, the man admitted to his arson.
According to reports, if convicted of intentional arson and destruction, the suspect could face 10 years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros.
According to the report, the fire caused serious losses to St. Pierre and St. Paul's Cathedral. The pipe organ in the church was completely burned and the stained glass window behind the pipe organ was also seriously damaged.
Brunet, the chief architect of French historic buildings, believes that it is conservatively estimated that the restoration of Nantes Cathedral will take at least three years.
Comprehensive news: US unilateralism undermines relations between the two countries International public opinion supports China's countermeasures against the United States-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26: On the morning of July 24, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the US Embassy in China that China had decided to revoke the license for the establishment and operation of the US Consulate General in Chengdu, and put forward specific requirements for the Consulate General to stop all business and activities.
International public opinion believes that the unilateral measures taken by the United States have caused serious troubles to Sino-US relations, and it is legitimate and necessary for China to respond to the unreasonable provocation of the United States and take countermeasures.
Andrés Bolks, director of the China Studies Center of the Institute of International Studies of the University of Chile, said that the unilateral measures of the United States have destroyed the bridge of understanding between the peoples of China and the United States and caused a crisis in the relationship between the two major powers.
China's notification to the United States to close its Consulate General in Chengdu is a countermeasure to the unilateral measures taken by the United States and conforms to diplomatic practice.
Patricio Giusto, a professor at the Catholic University of Argentina and director of the Arab-Chinese Research Center, believes that China's above decision is a legitimate and necessary countermeasure to the previous provocation of the United States, not against ordinary Americans.
The United States tried to divert the attention of the American people by pressuring China to cover up its ineffective response to the COVID-19 epidemic.
Bambang Suryono, chairman of the Asian Innovation Research Center, an Indonesian think tank, said that the provocative diplomatic posture adopted by the United States has caused serious troubles to Sino-US relations, and bilateral relations are facing severe challenges.
China's notification to the United States to close its Consulate General in Chengdu is a normal countermeasure and conforms to diplomatic practice. It not only reflects China's principled position of resolutely safeguarding its own interests, but also reflects the rationality, benefits and discipline of China's diplomacy.
Francis Semwenza, a current affairs commentator in Tanzania, said that China's above decision is a legitimate and necessary response to the provocation of the United States.
For Sino-US relations to return to normal, the US should take the initiative to improve relations with China and stop interfering in China's internal affairs.
The United States should focus on how to achieve win-win results with China economically and politically, and how to benefit the two peoples and the entire international community.
Ali Yusuf, executive director of the Sudan-based Federation of Arab-Chinese Friendship Associations, said that the countermeasures China was forced to take were a legitimate and necessary response to the unreasonable actions of the United States, in line with international law and the basic norms of international relations, as well as diplomatic practices.
Earlier, the US request to close the Chinese Consulate General in Houston seriously violated international law and the basic norms of international relations.
It is hoped that the US side will rescind its previous relevant decisions and create necessary conditions for bilateral relations to return to normal.
Singapore's " Lianhe Zaobao " published an editorial saying that the greater strategic intention of the United States is to contain China and prevent China from continuing to rise.
In the face of US pressure, although China is very reluctant to see Sino-US relations continue to deteriorate, it has to take countermeasures.

Hurricane " Hannah " makes landfall in the United States or causes river surges and flash floods-chinanews.com
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) According to comprehensive foreign media reports, Hurricane " Hannah " landed in Texas at 5: 00 p.m. local time on the 25th, which will bring strong winds and heavy rains to Texas, soaring rivers, and may also cause life-threatening flash floods.
The National Hurricane Center said Hurricane Hannah is expected to carry heavy rain across parts of southern and northeastern Texas, which may cause some streams to surge and life-threatening flash floods.
According to the report, the area south of Corpus Christi to the mouth of the Rio Grande River is the most seriously affected by Hurricane Hannah, and a large-scale flash flood may break out in the Rio Grande Valley.
Texas Governor Abbott said on the 25th: " Any hurricane is a huge challenge. "
Thirty-two counties in the state entered a disaster emergency due to the hurricane.
Corpus Christi, a city with a population of over 320,000, has closed libraries and museums, and residents are waiting.
Abbott also said that at a time when Texas is being hit hard by the COVID-19 epidemic, the hurricane can no longer bring more casualties to Texas.
According to reports, precipitation in southern Texas is expected to reach 6 to 12 inches on the night of the 26th, and 3 to 5 inches of rainfall will also occur in northern Texas and coastal areas of Louisiana.
Due to global warming and other factors, " Hannah " formed earlier than the previous Atlantic hurricane season.
Under normal circumstances, the first hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean usually does not form until mid-August.
Poland to withdraw from European treaty to prevent violence against women
Poland will take steps next week to withdraw from the European Treaty on the Prevention of Violence against Women, the Polish Ministry of Justice said Saturday.
Poland's right-wing government cabinet said the treaty required schools to teach students about gender issues, trampling on the rights of students' parents.
Polish Justice Minister Giobro held a press conference and said that his Ministry of Justice will submit a request to the Ministry of Labor and Family to begin withdrawing from the treaty on Monday.
That treaty is also known as the Istanbul Convention.
Giobro said, " The treaty contains some elements that we consider to be harmful. "
Poland's ruling Law and Justice Party and its ruling coalition partners have a close alliance with the Roman Catholic Church and promote a conservative social agenda.
Polish President Duda made hostility to gay rights one of the main issues during his successful re-election campaign this month.
On Friday, thousands of Poles, most of them women, protested against withdrawal from the Convention in Warsaw and other cities.
Lempat, one of the organizers of the protest, said in a protest march in Warsaw that " the purpose of withdrawing from the treaty is to legalize domestic violence. "
Some protesters held up banners that read " Law and Justice Party is a hell for women. "
The Law and Justice Party has long complained about the Istanbul Convention.
Poland's previous centrist government ratified the convention in 2015.
The Law and Justice Party government said the treaty did not respect religion and required liberal social policies to be taught in schools.
However, up to now, the party has not decided to withdraw from the convention.

Its national testing and improvement work will be completed before October 2022.
According to Russian experts who understand the above-mentioned upgrade work, Wuzhika-52, the " predecessor " of " Super Alligator" , was officially installed in November 2011. Some weaknesses were exposed in the use of this model. This transformation and upgrade is just to " complement each other. "
The report said that compared with the Ka-52, the Ka-52M will partially adopt new protective materials that will not increase weight, and its pilot cockpit will be reinforced and equipped with new equipment to resist missile attacks, thus increasing the probability of battlefield survival; assemble more powerful generators to power more complex airborne electronic equipment; upgrade the photoelectric system to be able to detect and identify battlefield targets farther apart; The new light multi-purpose missile equipped with armored fighting vehicles and reinforced concrete fortifications has a range of 20 kilometers, which is about double the range of similar missiles used by Russia's active military forces; its defense weapons and communication equipment will be used to the maximum extent with Mi-28NM helicopter gunships that can attack air targets, thus making related maintenance simple and economical.
In addition, the Ka-52M will have more advanced electronic guidance systems, weapon targeting systems and navigation equipment.
Russian experts also said that it is worth noting that Ka-52M will be equipped with communication equipment to communicate with drones, so as to obtain real-time information transmitted by nearby drones in the air, such as displaying images taken by drones on the cockpit screen of the helicopter.
According to the plan, the pilots of the Ka-52M can directly control the drones they cooperate with, thus improving the pilots' grasp of the battlefield situation and the guidance of long-range missiles.
According to Russian media reports, Russian Deputy Defense Minister Krivoruchko said in December last year that the Russian Defense Ministry plans to purchase more than 110 Wuzhika-52Ms by 2027.

Engine may stall FAA urgently orders to check 2,000 Boeing airliners-Xinhuanet
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an emergency airworthiness directive on the 24th, requiring an emergency inspection of about 2,000 Boeing 737NG and 737Classic airliners registered in the United States, because the corrosion of the air check valves of the airliners may cause the engines to stop in the air.
The FAA said that so far, it has received 4 reports of 737NG and 737Classic aircraft engine parking in the air, so it has made an emergency inspection request. The inspection objects are passenger aircraft that have been parked continuously for 7 days or more and passenger aircraft that have flown less than 11 times so far after re-entering the flight.
The FAA warned that if the stage 5 check valves of all two engines of the airliner are corroded, they may get stuck in the open position, causing the airliner to completely lose power and unable to restart the engine.
The aviation regulatory agency ordered that once the check valve is found to be corroded, the airline operator must replace this key component before the passenger plane is put into service again.
Boeing responded later that day that the COVID-19 outbreak had reduced travel demand, and many passenger planes had been sealed or used less, and " check valves were more likely to be corroded. "
Boeing also said that it has advised air operators to inspect the passenger aircraft involved in the order. If problems are found, Boeing will provide assistance in repairing and replacing check valves.
The Associated Press reported that passenger planes owned by major US airline operators usually fly multiple times a day, but after the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic, a large number of passenger planes were grounded; With the recent slow growth of passenger travel demand, some passenger planes have been put into operation again.
The FAA did not release the details of the four air parking reports.
Alaska Airlines disclosed one of the incidents later on the 24th.
The airline said in a statement that one of its passenger planes was en route from Seattle, Washington to Austin, Texas on July 15 when an engine suddenly stalled, and the passenger plane finally made an emergency landing at Austin Airport.
Alaska Airlines said it had replaced the passenger plane's engine and had inspected the engines of six passenger planes in accordance with FAA instructions.
American Airlines, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines said on the 24th that there was no engine stalling associated with the air check valve on their airliners.
Four American Airlines airliners will be inspected, and 28 United Airlines airliners will be inspected.
Delta Air Lines said it would inspect its 20 passenger planes, but did not say whether there had been engine failure.
According to many media reports, the FAA's emergency airworthiness directive is another impact on Boeing.
A Boeing 737MAX passenger plane of Indonesian Lion Airlines and Ethiopian Airlines crashed in October 2018 and March 2019 respectively, killing a total of 346 people.
This series of passenger planes were subsequently grounded worldwide, stopped production in January this year, and resumed production in May.
FAA Director Steve Dixon admitted in June that the FAA " made a mistake " in supervising Boeing with regard to the 737MAX passenger plane.

Chief Secretary for Administration of the HKSAR Government: All-out efforts to combat epidemic at critical juncture - chinanews.com
Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, July 26 - Chief Secretary for Administration of the HKSAR Government, Matthew Cheung Kin-chung, said on July 26 that the COVID-19 epidemic in Hong Kong has remained severe. Should the situation change for the worse, the HKSAR Government will not hesitate but take tougher measures to further restrict the operation of premises and outdoor activities.
However, the Government has no intention of imposing a lockdown or issuing stay-at-home orders as a containment measure at this stage.
On the same day, Matthew Cheung Kin-chung released a blog entitled "All-out efforts to combat epidemic at critical juncture"
He said that the current wave of the outbreak is the most serious one over the past six months. The coming fortnight will be crucial in our fight against further spreading of the coronavirus in the community.
While the Government will take all necessary measures in this battle, it is equally important for the public to exercise self-discipline and co-operate.
He earnestly urged members of the public to stay home as far as possible, minimise social contacts and refrain from dining out.
In compliance with the compulsory measure, they should wear a face mask to protect themselves and others while observing personal and environmental hygiene and washing their hands frequently. They should also suspend non-essential social or meal gatherings and reduce their visits to markets.
He said that the Central Authorities have all along taken heed of the changes in Hong Kong’s epidemic situation and staunchly supported the anti-epidemic work of the HKSAR Government. In response to the recent request of the Chief Executive, the Central Authorities have offered timely assistance in enhancing our virus testing capacity and retrofitting AWE into a makeshift facility similar to the “mobile cabin hospital” on the Mainland.
Mr Cheung said that the Government’s initiative to provide free COVID-19 testing for designated high-risk groups is running at full steam. This will cover some 400000 persons including staff of residential care homes for the elderly (RCHEs), residential care homes for persons with disabilities as well as nursing homes, restaurant workers, taxi drivers and property management staff.
He is very concerned about the recent emergence of local infection cases in residential care homes for the elderly (RCHEs) and the Government has arranged to set up designated temporary quarantine centres for  for the elderly.
He said that the HKSAR Government was building quarantine facilities near the Penny's Bay Quarantine Centre on Lantau Island in the New Territories, and 700 additional units are expected to be available by the end of September.
The Chief Executive also announced last Sunday that the Government would build an additional 2000 units at Penny’s Bay and strive for their completion by the end of this year.
Together with the 800 units already in operation, the total number of quarantine units provided at Penny's Bay Quarantine Center will then add up to 3500 by the end of the year.
There are currently four quarantine centers in operation in Hong Kong, providing about a total of 2,600 units.
In addition, on the 24th, the HKSAR Government re-opened the Lei Yue Mun Park and Holiday Village on Hong Kong Island as a community isolation facility for COVID-19 patients under the age of 50 with self-care capabilities.
The " Nutrient " of Party History and New China History-chinanews.com
2020-07-26 17: 37: 29 Source: People's Forum Author: Zhu Yanjing Editor: Zhu Yanjing
Recently, General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed when visiting the Siping Battle Memorial Hall: " Let 1.4 billion people and more than 90 million party members, especially leading cadres at all levels, learn the history of the Communist Party of China and the history of New China well. "
Studying the history of the Party and the history of New China conscientiously is a compulsory course for party members and cadres not to forget their original aspiration and keep in mind their mission. They should draw rich nourishment from it, cultivate the feelings of home and country, and take the long march of the new era.
A magnificent history of the Party and the history of New China records the hard work and glorious course of the Communist Party of China since its birth, and demonstrates the faith and loyalty that the Communists have forged with their lives and blood, and the original intention and mission that they will always adhere to.
History is the best textbook. For party members and cadres, party history and the history of New China are the brightest chapters in this textbook.
Every party member and cadre must constantly strengthen the historical thinking of taking history as a lesson and moving towards the future, base on the new journey and new mission, take the " baton " of the times, and walk the long march of the present generation.
Cast the soul with history and stick to the original mission in the study of party history and the history of New China.
Turning over the history of the Party and the history of New China is full of the eternal original mission and rock-solid belief of the Chinese Communists, which shows the simple feelings of the Communists to be with the people forever.
To understand important events, important meetings and important figures in the history of the Party and New China up close is not only an intuitive spiritual shock and ideological baptism, but also a deep understanding of the connotation of the original belief and the weight of the mission.
For party members and cadres, if they want to constantly sharpen their original mission and always maintain their advanced nature, they must find our starting point and fulcrum from the history of the party and the history of New China, maintain a clear understanding and firm stand, stir up the power to fight bravely for the country and the people, and ensure that the red mountains and rivers laid by the revolutionary ancestors with their blood and lives are passed on from generation to generation.
It is wise to study history and inherit the lofty spirit in the study of party history and the history of New China.
Since the founding of the Communist Party of China, it has successively shaped a series of great spirits such as the Red Boat Spirit, Jinggangshan Spirit, Long March Spirit, Yan'an Spirit, Anti-Japanese War Spirit, Xibaipo Spirit, " Two Bombs and One Star " Spirit, and Aerospace Spirit.
These great spirits precipitated by history have provided a strong spiritual incentive for our party to overcome various risks and challenges on the way forward. They are precious spiritual wealth that cannot be defeated, washed away or robbed.
The process of studying party history and Chinese history is a process of reviewing these spirits and shaping one's own spirit. We must consciously take the lofty spirit of the revolutionary ancestors as a mirror, stick to the spiritual home of the Communists, build a solid spiritual foundation for advancing the great cause and realizing the great dream, inherit and carry forward these spirits, and radiate the light of the new era.
Read history for self-examination, and constantly preserve righteousness and dispel evil in the study of party history and the history of New China.
For party members and cadres, there has never been any history that can bring more profound warning, enlightenment and reference than the history of the party and the history of New China.
In the history of the Party and the history of New China, we cannot only see the great deeds of the older generation of revolutionaries who are determined to devote themselves to their beliefs and persevere in striving to achieve the set goals, but also see the profound lessons of certain figures who have shaken their ideals and beliefs and walked to the opposite side of the revolution, enlightening and warning us to never stagnate or slacken with firm determination and will, always maintain a full and tenacious fighting spirit, and constantly purify the party spirit and cultivate self-discipline.
If you want to truly become a firm believer and faithful practitioner of the lofty ideal of communism, you need to brush off the ideological " dust " and strictly prevent " dirt " from dyeing your body. The history of the party and the history of New China should be the basis for every party member and cadre to examine and warn themselves.
Knowledge of history is inspiring, and bravely shoulder the important tasks of the times in the study of party history and the history of New China.
General Secretary Xi Jinping once pointed out: " Studying party history and national history is a compulsory course for upholding and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics and pushing forward the various undertakings of the party and the country. "
Looking back at history and asking about the original heart, in order to continue to be glorious and move towards the future.
Every party member and cadre should take the study of party history and New China history as a lifelong pursuit, constantly set the course of life in the study, and bravely shoulder the historical mission, dare to take responsibility and take the initiative in their respective jobs.
Adhere to the reference and guidance of the advanced deeds of the older generation of revolutionaries, constantly polish the political qualities of the Communists, maintain the attitude of striving for success and the spirit of struggle that is more difficult and dangerous, and write their own brilliant stroke in the vast journey of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
Pursuing the Poetic " Yellow River Dream " -chinanews.com
(China's Poverty Reduction Story) Pursuing the Poetic " Yellow River Dream "
China News Service, Yinchuan, July 26 (Yang Di) " Jiuqu Yellow River thousands of miles of sand, waves and winds from the end of the world. "
The Yellow River, which aroused the pride of countless literati, gave birth to the beautiful and rich Ningxia Plain. Nowadays, Ningxia, which has the reputation of " blocking the south of the Yangtze River" , is adhering to the concept of " ecological priority and green development " and pursuing the poetic " Yellow River Dream. "
The beautiful " Bibo Dream " of the river
" The Yellow River in the world is rich in Ningxia. " The Yellow River flows through Ningxia for 397 kilometers and is the " mother river " for raising a party.
However, with the rapid advancement of industrialization and urbanization, the development, utilization, management and protection of rivers and lakes are out of balance, and chaos such as excessive sewage discharge, reclamation of lakes and encroachment on water areas are highlighted, resulting in black and smelly water bodies, excessive water quality, dirty environment and ecological degradation.
Now, Ningxia is promoting the diverse restoration of water ecology and striving to make the Yellow River beautiful and clear.
Water control should start from the source.
In Yinchuan, Ningxia, the local government adopted the method of " standard raising + pollution control + strict management" , all sewage in industrial parks was treated centrally, all urban sewage treatment plants were discharged according to Class A standard, and the black and odorous water bodies in urban built-up areas were basically eliminated, and the third batch of China's black and odorous water demonstration cities were successfully declared.
In addition, Ningxia fully implemented the river and lake chief system in 2017, and now it has achieved full coverage of the five-level river and lake chief responsibility system in districts, cities, counties and villages, and long patrolling of rivers and lakes has become the norm.
Gu Jincheng, 64, lives in a village by the Yellow River. He witnessed the changes in the Yellow River: " The water used to smell, but the smell disappeared after rectification. "
Gu Jincheng said that the ecological environment has improved and his life has become more comfortable. Now he often goes for a walk along the Yellow River with his family to feel the clear water and blue sky.
Sha Ouxiangji's " Wetland Dream "
Birds, green trees, plank roads, clear water... The beauty of Fan Zhongyan's " Sand Gulls Xiangji " has become a reality in the Yellow River Wetland Park in Yinchuan, Ningxia.
The Yellow River flows through Ningxia, forming river wetlands, lake wetlands, marsh wetlands and other wetlands along the way, which plays an important role in promoting the rational use of water resources and water ecological balance, and has also become an important international bird migration channel.
Since 2009, relevant departments in Ningxia have invested about 3.45 billion yuan in wetland protection projects. At present, Yinchuan wetland covers an area of 19,200 hectares, with a wetland protection rate of 78.5%. There are nearly 200 natural lakes and marsh wetlands, with 5 national wetland parks, 1 national urban wetland park, 6 autonomous region-level wetland parks and 8 municipal parks.
Lu Jinhu, deputy director of Yinchuan Wetland Protection Center, told reporters that wetland protection has increased biodiversity, especially in birds. " The gull is an endangered bird, with only more than 20,000 in the world, of which more than 2,000 live in Yinchuan Wetland. "
At the same time, Ningxia has delineated a 500-meter red line for the wetland protection areas on both sides of the Yinchuan section of the Yellow River in accordance with the law, stipulating that except for public welfare projects, no unit or individual may carry out development, construction and business activities within the scope of protection.
Zhao Shaoyong, deputy director of Yinchuan Water Conservancy Service Center, said that through pollution source control, comprehensive improvement of river and lake ecology and terminal wetland construction, the water quality of nine main drainage ditches in Ningxia has reached Class IV standards 100%. " Now the water is clear, the fish are swimming and the flowers are blooming. "
The " Drinking Water Dream " of Pu Huimin's Life
Yinchuan City, Ningxia, once had an " embarrassing " title: the only city along the Yellow River that " guarded the Yellow River and lacked water to drink. "
Since 2010, Yinchuan City has been facing the problem of persistent water shortage at the peak of summer. The " pain of water shortage " in the past ten years has become a painful summer experience for many high-rise residents. However, under the current situation that the major water sources are at the limit of overmining and a large area of groundwater overmining funnel area has been formed underground in the city, water shortage has become a difficult problem perplexing Yinchuan City.
Thanks to the improvement of the water quality of the Yellow River, drinking purified Yellow River water has become a good way to solve the drinking water problems of local residents.
Ding Ming, deputy director of Yinchuan Water Affairs Bureau, said that in order to improve the living and production water demand of urban and rural residents in Yinchuan, Ningxia started the water supply project on the western line of urban and rural areas in Yinchuan metropolitan area in due course, replacing the original underground water source with high-quality Yellow River water.
" On December 29, 2019, the water supply project officially provided water to the three districts of Yinchuan City. In 2020, residents of Minning Town and Helan County also drank the Yellow River. "
Ding Ming said that the Yinchuan water conservancy department will consider the transformation of the integration of regional rural drinking water and urban water supply. " In the next step, we will integrate all the scattered water supply points in rural areas into the western line water supply project. It is expected that the integrated urban and rural water supply in Yinchuan area will be basically realized by the end of this year. "
Compaction responsibility departments strengthen flood control and disaster relief work-chinanews.com
Compaction responsibility departments strengthen flood control and disaster relief work
CCTV news (news broadcast): News from the Ministry of Water Resources, at 12 o'clock today (July 25), the super-warning water level in the section below Wangjiaba in the main stream of the Huaihe River was 0.64 ~ 3.31 meters, and the super-warning water level in the section below Shashi and the two lakes in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River was 0.05 ~ 2.02 meters.
Taihu Lake has lasted for 28 days since it exceeded the warning water level on June 28.
At 12 o'clock today, the average water level of Taihu Lake was 4.67 meters, exceeding the guaranteed water level by 0.02 meters.
Today, the National Defense Economics Council discussed and judged, and decided to continue to maintain the level II response of flood control in the Yangtze River and Huaihe River, requiring all localities to consolidate their responsibilities and further implement flood control and disaster relief work.

The United States launches countervailing investigation against China for the first time with " undervalued RMB exchange rate "
In response to the recent announcement by the US Department of Commerce, it decided to launch an anti-dumping and countervailing investigation on tie-in (tie-in) products originating in China, and to launch an investigation on the " undervalued RMB exchange rate " project.
China's Ministry of Commerce pointed out that this is the first time that the United States has filed an investigation into the so-called " undervalued RMB exchange rate " project in a countervailing case, which China firmly opposes.
China's Ministry of Commerce issued a special press release on the evening of the 23rd, saying that China implements a managed floating exchange rate system based on market supply and demand, adjusted with reference to a basket of currencies, and the market plays a decisive role in the formation of the exchange rate.
The press release stressed that on the whole, the RMB exchange rate is at a reasonable equilibrium level and has not been undervalued.
Since 2005, the RMB has appreciated by more than 17% against the US dollar.
According to data released by the Bank for International Settlements, from the beginning of 2005 to May 2020, the nominal effective exchange rate of the RMB appreciated by 38% and the real effective exchange rate by 49%, making it the strongest currency in the G20 economies and one of the currencies with the largest appreciation in the world.
The Ministry of Commerce pointed out that the exchange rate issue is beyond the competence of members to conduct countervailing investigations in accordance with WTO rules.
The United States amended its regulations in February this year to conduct countervailing investigations on the exchange rates of other countries. It has been suspected of violating WTO rules and has been opposed by many parties.
The press release stated that even in accordance with U.S. regulations, the applicant's complaint contained a large number of errors and did not possess the necessary countervailing elements such as financial assistance, granting of benefits and specificity.
China urges the US to abide by existing international rules and stop conducting countervailing investigations into the so-called " undervalued RMB exchange rate. "
Affected by the further rise in tensions between China and the United States, the offshore and onshore RMB exchange rates against the US dollar fell sharply on the 22nd, and both fell below the 7.0 yuan mark against the US dollar.
Whether the US Department of Commerce's move is intended to force up the RMB deserves attention.
The spot exchange rate of RMB against the US dollar rose above the 7.0 mark on the 23rd to close at 6.9961.
The central parity rate of the RMB against the US dollar, which is officially regulated, was lowered by 17 basis points to 6.9938 on the 24th.
As the epidemic situation gradually improves, the film and television industry, which has been silent for nearly half a year, has gradually returned to normal.
A few days ago, the Organizing Committee of the 26th Shanghai TV Festival announced the shortlist of this Magnolia Award.

"
The " Best Actor and Actress " award has always been one of the focuses of attention from the outside world. This year's competition is also extremely fierce. The shortlisted actors and actresses are all powerful actors. Chen Baoguo, Huang Lei, Lei Jiayin, Sun Honglei and Zhang Ruoyun will compete for " Best Actor. "
Chen Baoguo, Huang Lei and Sun Honglei are all Mesozoic actors with profound qualifications. Lei Jiayin, 37, is also a powerful actor, and Zhang Ruoyun, 32, is the youngest finalist.
In 2016, 34-year-old Hu Ge won the Magnolia Award for Best Actor for " Langya List" , becoming the youngest Shidi in the award. If Zhang Ruoyun can beat several other predecessors this year, he will set this record.
The competition for the best actress was finally fixed among the mainstay actresses in the film and television industry such as Haiqing, Ma Yili, Qin Hailu, Sun Li and Yan Ni, and none of them were shortlisted.
It is worth mentioning that Sun Li was shortlisted for her role as Fang Sijin in " An Jia. " This is the sixth time she has been nominated for this award. In 2014 and 2016, she won " Best Actress " twice for " The True Story of Hot Mom " and " The Story of Miyue " respectively.

Venezuelan Foreign Minister accuses the United States of fabricating lies to attack China for no reason-Xinhuanet
Arreaza said that the US government has recently put constant pressure on China in politics, diplomacy, economy and public opinion, which is an unfounded attack on a sovereign country.
Arreaza forwarded the tweet posted on his personal account by Chinese Ambassador to Venezuela Li Baorong earlier in the day and made the above comments.
Li Baorong said in his tweet that China strongly condemns the US for forcibly entering the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, which seriously violates the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and the Sino-US Consular Treaty, and China will make a legitimate and necessary response to this.
Venezuelan Vice President Rodriguez, Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos Long and other government officials, social celebrities and mainstream media journalists also reposted Li Baorong's tweets, condemning the serious violation of international law by the United States.
On the 26th, the day before Philippine President Duterte delivered his fifth State of the Union address (SONA) during his term of office, more than 80,000 cases of new coronary pneumonia were confirmed in the Philippines, of which the number of confirmed cases by the staff of the Presidential Information Department (PCOO) and its directly affiliated institutions increased to 25.
To this end, PCOO has specially prepared a working group that has not contacted the confirmed staff to cooperate with President Duterte's press release of SONA.
PCOO Minister Martin Andanal said in an interview with DZBB Radio on the 26th that he had prepared two plans for President Duterte to publish SONA.
According to plan A, Duterte will deliver SONA at the Philippine Congress (Batasang Pambansa) building in Quezon City on the afternoon of the 27th.
Due to the epidemic, only 50 seats were arranged for some government cabinet members and legislators at the scene, and a special video conference room was set up for other cabinet members and local government officials to watch.
All participants can enter the parliament building only after passing the rapid test on the same day.
Once one of the participants tested positive, Plan B was launched, that is, President Duterte delivered SONA at Maracanan Palace, the presidential palace, and fewer seats were arranged for the audience.
As usual, SONA will broadcast live to the Philippines in real time.
As of press time, the Philippine presidential palace has not confirmed whether Duterte's family will attend SONA.
Andanal said that President Duterte's SONA will focus on how the government will lead the Philippines to deal with the COVID-19 pneumonia epidemic and restore social and economic life; it will also mention his commitments when he took office, namely, anti-government corruption, fighting illegal drugs and reducing poverty.
Duterte will also explain other plans of the current administration, including creating more jobs, revitalizing the economy, promoting education, and helping overseas Filipino workers suffering from the epidemic.

The Yangtze River's No. 3 flood in 2020 formed the Ministry of Water Resources detailed and actual response measures-chinanews.com
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26 (Reporter Hu Lu) On the 26th, the No. 3 flood of 2020 on the Yangtze River formed.
When presiding over the meeting on the 26th, E Jingping, Minister of Water Resources, requested that the Three Gorges Reservoir be carefully dispatched, that the incoming water from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and Dongting Lake be considered as a whole, that peak scheduling be implemented, that sufficient storage capacity be reserved to prepare for possible major floods, and that the flood control safety of the main stream of the middle and lower reaches and the important dikes of Dongting Lake be ensured.
It is predicted that in the next three days, there will be heavy rain in the eastern southwest, southern Jianghuai, northern and western Jiangnan, eastern and southern Hubei, and central Guangxi, among which there will be heavy rain in northern Hunan and southwestern Jiangsu; there will be moderate to heavy rain in central and western North China, among which there will be heavy rain in central Hebei.
The Ministry of Water Resources predicts that, affected by this, the inflow of the Three Gorges Reservoir on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River may reach about 60,000 cubic meters per second around the 28th, and the water level of the Lianhuatang River and Dongting Lake in the middle reaches of the main stream will rise again and exceed the level of about 0.20 meters; the water level of the main stream of the Huaihe River will generally slow down, and the water level of Hongze Lake will continue to rise slowly; the Haihe River Daqing River system, Yongding River and other rivers will experience a process of rising water.
E Jingping proposed that the Huaihe River Basin should further increase flood discharge, reduce the water level of Hongze Lake as soon as possible, and prepare for the possible flood.
It is necessary to do a good job in dealing with rainstorms and floods in the Yishui system.
He said that the Taihu Lake Basin should continue to increase flood discharge, reduce the water level of Taihu Lake and the surrounding river network as soon as possible, and reduce the high water level of Taihu Lake and the risk of typhoons.
In addition, he stressed that floods in northern regions such as Inner Mongolia and Hebei rise and fall sharply, and the warning time is short, which is easy to cause mountain torrents and mudslides, making defense difficult; there are many small and medium-sized reservoirs and silt dams, which have hidden dangers.
58 apps infringing on users' rights and interests were exposed, involving more than a dozen listed companies-chinanews.com
The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology reported that in accordance with laws and regulations such as the Cyber Security Law, Telecommunications Regulations, and Regulations on the Protection of Personal Information of Telecommunications and Internet Users, recently organized third-party testing agencies to inspect mobile phone application software and urge enterprises with problems to make rectification.
The problems of these 58 apps include private collection of personal information, collection of personal information beyond the scope, frequent application for permissions, excessive request for permissions, difficulty in account cancellation, private sharing with third parties, and denial of permissions for use.
The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology requires that the rectification and implementation of 58 APPs should be completed before July 30. If the rectification is not completed within the time limit, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology will organize and carry out relevant disposal work in accordance with laws and regulations.
Zhongxin Jingwei reporters combed and found that behind the 58 apps notified, more than a dozen U.S., Hong Kong and A-share listed companies were involved.
For example, " Fangduoduo " is a product of Fangduoduo, a US stock-listed company, and there are five major problems: private collection of personal information, collection of personal information beyond the scope, private sharing with third parties, forcing users to use targeted push functions, and frequent application for permissions.
According to public information, Fangduoduo landed on Nasdaq in November 2019 and is " the first domestic real estate intermediary company in the SaaS (software service) model of the industrial Internet" , providing online solutions for many intermediary merchants.

It can also be found from the notification that the violation of privacy by APP has attracted more and more attention.
On July 24, on the day of the notification of 58 apps infringing on user rights and interests, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said that it had issued a notice a few days ago to deploy and carry out a special rectification action to promote APP infringement on user rights and interests.
The special rectification will strengthen supervision and inspection in accordance with laws and regulations, urge relevant enterprises to strengthen APP personal information protection, timely rectify and eliminate outstanding problems such as illegal collection, use of users' personal information, harassment of users, deception and misleading users, and inadequate implementation of application distribution platform management responsibilities, and purify APP application space.
Lewis family: John Lewis is a fighter " fighting for the weakest "
John Lewis, a US congressman and civil rights fighter, was remembered as a fighter " fighting for the weakest " at a memorial service held for him on Saturday (July 25).
Lewis' public memorial service has been held in Alabama since Saturday.
There were two memorial services on the first day.
At a public memorial service at the University of Troy in Alabama on Saturday, Lewis's five brothers and sisters and a nephew and grandson spoke of him as a loving, fearless and family-oriented man.
Henry " Grant " Lewis, Lewis's youngest brother, said at the meeting: " He devoted his life to helping others. "
Samuel Lewis said his mother had warned John " Don't make trouble, don't make trouble. "
He added that John did not heed his mother's warning. He said: " We all know that John is always in trouble, always in trouble, but that's because he insists on the right thing, which is a good trouble. "
Lewis's brothers and sisters reminded people at the memorial service that John's most famous argument was to create " good trouble" , that is, to stir up trouble as long as it is for the sake of justice.
John applied to Troy University in Troy, Alabama, where he was born, but Troy University, which was all white at the time, rejected his application.
John Lewis, who preached the gospel to chickens on his farm as a child, eventually earned a degree in religion and philosophy from Fisk University.
Years later, the University of Troy awarded Lewis an honorary doctorate.
Senator Doug Jones of Alabama said the current protesters are " protesting peacefully and non-violently" , just as Lewis did in the civil rights movement.
Jones said: " Even if President Trump overturned a boat of people and described all the protesters as thugs, he was wrong.
The protesters are patriots who want the United States to move towards a more equal country. "
A six-day series of events in memory of Lewis will culminate this week at a funeral in Georgia.
On Saturday, Lewis's coffin was parked at a public memorial service at the University of Troy, and people came to pay tribute to the pioneer of the civil rights movement.
Later on Saturday, a private ceremony paid tribute to him in a chapel in Selma, Alabama, followed by a public memorial service.
On Sunday, Lewis's body will pass the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma.
In 1965, he and the demonstrators demanding black voting rights were severely beaten by Alabama police in front of this bridge, and the police also fired tear gas at the demonstrators.
Lewis was nearly killed.
This day will be known as " Bloody Sunday. "
Lewis's body will be transported to Montgomery, the capital of Alabama.
Mayor Steven Reed encouraged people to line up on the sidewalk to complete the final journey with Lewis.
At the same time, officials require the public to wear masks and maintain social distance when participating in activities.
Alabama Governor Kay Ivey ordered flags to be flown at half-mast on Saturday and Sunday in memory of Lewis.
During the nearly week-long commemorative event, Lewis's body will be placed briefly in the Alabama State Capitol in Montgomery, the Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta, and the U.S. Capitol in Washington for the public to express their condolences.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced last week that people can come to the U.S. Capitol on Monday and Tuesday to pay tribute to Lewis.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, public events in memory of Lewis will be held outdoors.

Adhering to the guidance of party building and implementing the party's leadership in all fields and links of grass-roots governance is the directional and fundamental requirement for doing a good job of grass-roots governance.
To improve the level of grass-roots governance, we must adhere to the leadership of party building, promote the transformation of the party's political advantages, organizational advantages and mass work advantages into governance advantages by strengthening political leadership, building battle fortresses, and gathering red forces, and transmit the party's strength and propositions to the " nerve endings " and the " last kilometer. "
Pay attention to calcium supplementation and soul-building, and strengthen political leadership.
To strengthen the political leadership of grassroots governance, we must implement the " Calcium Supplementation and Soul Creation " project well.
It is necessary to study and thoroughly understand Xi Jinping's thought of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era as the primary task, take " not forgetting the original intention and keeping in mind the mission " as the eternal topic of party building and the lifelong topic of party members and cadres, strengthen reading the original text and understanding the principles, and continue to promote the party's innovative theory through special training, batch training, seminars and exchanges, and holding lecture halls, and promote party members and cadres to further enhance the " four consciousness" , strengthen the " four self-confidence" , achieve the " two maintenance" , and better perform their duties.
Through the combination of online and offline learning methods, broaden the channels of learning and education, and guide grass-roots party organizations and party members and cadres to truly integrate learning and education into daily life.
Pay attention to practical training, in the process of resolving key and difficult problems in the field of grass-roots governance, solve the troubles and troubles that the masses are concerned about, and hone the party spirit and ability.
We will improve standards and build battle fortresses.
Grass-roots party organizations are not only an important part of the grass-roots governance system, but also an important carrier of governance ability.
To promote the standardization construction of grass-roots party organizations, we must start with grasping the working regulations of party branches, focus on the weakening and falsification of party organization leadership, and strengthen the foundation, complement each other and promote development by establishing a linkage mechanism between the upper and lower levels, innovating the form of branch setting, normalizing and rectifying weakness and laxity, establishing and improving the decision-making and discussion mechanism, and serving the masses mechanism.
In rural areas, strengthen the standardization construction of village-level party organizations, standardize organizational forms, learning activities, and management mechanisms according to the standardization construction standards of party branches, and earnestly promote the detailed implementation of the " three meetings and one lesson " and thematic party day activities.
In cities, pay attention to street communities, explore innovative branch setting forms, focus on weak areas, " blocking points " and " pain points" , and actively build urban party building alliances to achieve effective coverage of party work.
At the same time, we should establish and improve the grass-roots governance system and mechanism, improve the decision-making and discussion mechanism led by grass-roots party organizations, discuss major issues together, handle practical matters together, decide important matters together, discuss urgent matters together, solve difficult matters together, and improve the mechanism for party members and cadres to contact and serve the masses, gather the hearts and minds of the people in serving the people, enhance the sense of gain, happiness, honor and pride of party members and the masses, and make grass-roots governance more warm.
Play a pioneering role and gather red power.
Grass-roots party members and cadres are the cornerstone of grass-roots governance.
To improve the governance ability of grassroots party members and cadres, we should pay attention to the demonstration and leading role of " red cells " in grassroots governance, and gather red forces at the forefront of contacting and serving the masses.
It is necessary to take the improvement of governance ability as a compulsory course for grassroots party members and cadres, continuously strengthen ideological refinement, professional training and practical training, carry forward the spirit of responsibility in their posts and in urgent, difficult and dangerous tasks, and lay a solid foundation and contribute to the modernization of the national governance system and governance ability.
It is necessary to widely carry out the activities of " community whistle blowing and party members reporting for duty" , and participate in community construction, management and service by participating in thematic party day activities, contacting people in need, determining service projects, claiming micro wishes, and putting forward reasonable suggestions, so that party members can play a role in community governance.
It is necessary to give full play to the role of unemployed party members in rural areas, and guide the majority of grassroots party members to actively participate in poverty alleviation, ecological construction, letters and visits to maintain stability, straw burning ban and other work by setting up vanguard posts for unemployed party members and forming task forces for unemployed party members, so as to better integrate red forces and serve the people.
A solid foundation makes a building strong.
Grass-roots party organizations are the foundation of the ruling building.
Only by adhering to the focus on strengthening the relationship between the party and the masses, increasing the well-being of the people, and taking the leadership of party building as the fundamental way to promote the innovative development of grass-roots governance, can we build a solid foundation so that grass-roots party organizations can pull out and stand up, grass-roots party members and cadres can catch up and rush up, and promote grass-roots governance to be " soul" , orderly, powerful and effective.

Hoh Xil Tibetan antelope enters migration season-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, July 25 (Reporter Wang Jinjin) The reporter learned from the Wudaoliang Protection Station of Hoh Xil Management Office in the Yangtze River Source Park of the Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration that monitoring showed that Tibetan antelopes who had migrated to the Zhuonai Lake area in the hinterland of Hoh Xil to give birth were gradually ending their births and began to return to their original habitat with their cubs.
Monitoring images near Wudaoliang Protection Station show that on July 25, about 40 female Tibetan antelopes led 3 Tibetan antelope cubs through 3002 kilometers of Qinghai-Tibet Highway and Wudaoliang North Bridge on Qinghai-Tibet Railway. Tibetan antelopes have begun to move back.
According to expert analysis, in recent years, the number of Tibetan antelope cubs in the relocating sheep accounts for one quarter to one fifth of the total number of Tibetan antelope herds.
Lian Xinming, an associate researcher at the Northwest Plateau Institute of Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, said: " In the early stage of migration, Tibetan antelopes face a higher risk of predation, so the number of cubs in the flock will be relatively small, and there may even be no cubs. "
According to the statistics of Hoh Xil Management Office of Yangtze River Source Park of Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration, the number of Tibetan antelopes returning has been increasing year by year. In 2019, the number of Tibetan antelopes returning was 4860, an increase of 338 over 2018.
Lian Xinming said: " It is expected that the migration of Tibetan antelopes this year will end in early September, and the number of relocated Tibetan antelopes is expected to continue to increase. "
Tibetan antelope is a national-level protected animal.
At the end of May every year, Tibetan antelopes from the Sanjiangyuan of Qinghai, Qiangtang of Tibet, Aljinshan of Xinjiang and other places go to Zhuonai Lake in the hinterland of Hoh Xil to give birth.
Wu Xiaomin, an expert on Tibetan antelope protection in China and a researcher at Shaanxi Institute of Zoology (Northwest Institute of Endangered Animals), said: " Tibetan antelope migration is a process in which female Tibetan antelopes return to their habitat with their cubs after giving birth. At first, the relocation group leaving the litter site is relatively large, but then the Tibetan antelopes will return to their respective habitats along different paths according to different geographical populations. "
In order to ensure the safe relocation of Tibetan antelope herds, the reporter learned that the Hoh Xil Management Office of the Yangtze River Source Park of the Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration has arranged staff to continue to carry out video monitoring and patrols in the main relocation areas.
If Tibetan antelopes are found trying to cross the highway, the mountain patrol team will carry out temporary traffic control at the first time to let the sheep safely pass through the wildlife passage and ensure that they are as little disturbed by humans as possible on the way back.
So, how to relieve heat in daily life?
Experts suggest that when going out in summer, try to avoid the high temperature period, and it is best not to walk or work in the hot sun around noon, because the sun is the strongest during this period, and the possibility of heat stroke is higher.
If you have to go out at this time, you must do a good job of protection, such as playing a parasol, wearing a sun hat, and wearing sunglasses. If possible, it is best to apply sunscreen to prevent injuries.
Clothes try to choose light-colored, breathable cotton, hemp, silk texture, wear less chemical fiber clothing, so as not to lose heat in time when sweating a lot, causing heatstroke.
In hot and sultry weather, you should prepare enough water to drink in time. Don't wait for thirst to drink water, because once you feel thirsty, your body is already short of water. Drink 150 ml to 200 ml of water each time. Drink warm boiled water, not ice water.
According to the temperature, ordinary people drink 1.5 to 2 liters of water a day, and high-temperature workers drink 3 to 5 liters of water a day.
When you sweat more, you can appropriately supplement some salt water to make up for the salt lost by the human body due to sweating.
In addition, the human body is prone to lack of potassium in summer, which makes people feel tired and tired. Potassium-containing tea is an excellent summer drink.
In summer, eat more fruits and vegetables with high water content, such as lettuce, cucumber, tomato, etc.; Fresh fruits, such as peaches, apricots, watermelons, melons, etc., with a water content of 80% to 90%, can be used to supplement water; Dairy products cannot only replenish water, but also meet the nutritional needs of the body.
In addition, people working in high temperature environment should appropriately supplement drinks containing potassium, magnesium and other elements.
In summer, the days are long and nights are short, the temperature is high, the metabolism of the human body is strong, the consumption is also large, and it is easy to feel tired.
Adequate sleep can relax all systems of the brain and body, which is not only conducive to work and study, but also a measure to prevent heatstroke.
Experts say that the best bedtime is from 22: 00 to 23: 00, and the best time to wake up is from 5: 30 to 6: 30.
Be careful not to lie under the air-conditioning vents and electric fans during sleep to avoid air-conditioning diseases and hot colds.
Experts suggest that people who are outdoors or doing high-temperature work can carry ten drops of water, Rendan, Patchouli Zhengqi Water or Patchouli Zhengqi Pills and other heatstroke prevention drugs with them, or place them in the nearest workplace and use them at any time to prevent heatstroke.

Under the epidemic situation, the significance of this exhibition is particularly special.
Ge Ping, head of Meichen in Chaoyang Joy City, said: " We have chosen to bring the graduation exhibition to the' cloud' back to the offline space again.

"
Among the few graduates who personally arranged the exhibition was Li Jingyin from the Sculpture Department of Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts.
" I came to Beijing on July 7. At that time, I was actually a little worried about the epidemic. I also did nucleic acid testing three days in advance. I came to the exhibition with alcohol cotton and test reports. "

At the same time, he also undertakes the task of helping his classmates repair damaged works.
" The exhibition was set up until 4: 30 in the morning, and then it was repaired. The time was very tight. I forgot to take a photo with the work, which is a bit regrettable. "

Reward 50,000 yuan Hubei Enshi praised the " first person in early warning " of Shaziba landslide-chinanews.com
Hubei Daily News (Reporter Lin Jing) On July 26, Enshi City announced that it praised Chen Guangming, a geological disaster site monitor who had made important contributions to the early warning of Shaziba landslides, and sent him a bonus of 50,000 yuan.
At the same time, party members and cadres in the city are called upon to learn from his spirit of conscientiousness, courage to take responsibility, initiative and dedication.
On July 21, a landslide occurred in the sand dam of Mazhe Village, Tunpu Township, Enshi City, resulting in the formation of a barrier lake in the main stream of Qingjiang River. Chen Guangming, 58, was the first person to warn of the landslide.
On the afternoon of July 17, Chen Guangming learned that the walls of the villagers' homes were cracked and immediately went to the scene to check.
As soon as he walked five or six hundred meters from his home, he saw the village road split four to five centimeters, extending along the road to the cornfield, about 50 meters long.
Chen Guangming was suddenly alert and immediately sent photos of the road cracking to the " geological disaster monitor contact group " of the township.
After on-site inspection and judgment by the relevant person in charge of Tunpu Township Natural Planning Institute, the possibility of landslide was very high, and the decision to evacuate the masses was made immediately.

New drug developed by Australian University is expected to be used to treat blood vessel blockage caused by COVID-19-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Sydney, July 26 (Reporter Chen Yu) Researchers at Monash University in Australia are developing a new drug that helps prevent heart disease and stroke, and hope that this drug can be used to treat blood vessel blockage caused by the COVID-19 virus.
Researchers have found that before a heart attack or stroke, an enzyme in platelets accelerates platelet clotting.
Therefore, they developed a drug that can temporarily inhibit platelet clotting, thereby avoiding blood vessel blockage and preventing heart disease and stroke.
Researchers say the drug will only inhibit the clotting effect of platelets when there are signs of heart disease or stroke.
Since studies have shown that similar blood vessel blockage is one of the main causes of death in severe COVID-19 patients, researchers hope that this drug can be used in the treatment of such severe patients in the future.
At present, the drug has achieved good results in animal model experiments, and researchers are preparing for the next stage of human clinical trials.
The research results have been published in the American journal Science Translational Medicine.
He became the first spectator to enter the CBA league after allowing spectators to watch the match live.
On the same day, in the second stage (Laoshan Division) of the 2019-2020 Chinese Men's Basketball Professional League (CBA) rematch held in Qingdao, Shandong Province, medical staff, teachers and public security front personnel completed the relevant processes including nucleic acid testing through the official ticket purchase platform and then entered the field to watch the match between Shanghai Jiushi Team and Shandong West King Team.
During the watching period, spectators must wear masks all the way, take seats in pairs, and strictly maintain a one-meter interval between seats.
When leaving the venue, the audience must keep the " one-meter line " social distance in an orderly manner in the order from back to front, first on both sides and then in the middle.
Xinjiang deeply cultivates " sunflower fields " and makes good use of clean energy-chinanews.com

China News Service, Hami, Xinjiang, July 26. Title: Xinjiang deeply cultivates " sunflower fields " and makes good use of clean energy
More than 6,000 pentagonal heliostats, each 48 square meters, are neatly arranged in circles, such as a silver " sunflower field" , which rotates with the sun and reflects sunlight to a heat absorption tower more than 200 meters high in the center to realize power generation.
The reporter saw this scene on the 25th at the Hami Molten Salt Tower Solar Thermal Power Plant of CLP Engineering in Dumaohu Town, Yiwu County, Hami City, Xinjiang.
" The so-called molten salt tower solar thermal power generation is to reflect sunlight through the mirror to the heat absorption tower to form heat energy, and then convert the heat energy into electric energy through traditional power generation technology. "
Zhang Yong, deputy general manager of CLP Hami Solar Thermal Power Generation Co., Ltd., said that its design principle is similar to that of solar cookers used in rural areas in northwest China, which must gather sunlight.
The power plant started construction in October 2017 and was connected to the grid at the end of last year. It covers an area of 6,600 mu and plans to install 14,500 heliostats.
" Compared with traditional solar power generation technology, its biggest advantage is that it can store the accumulated heat energy and generate electricity at night. "
Zhang Yong said that the 13-hour heat storage system configured in the project can keep the generator set in continuous and stable operation without being affected by light changes; it can also quickly participate in power grid peak regulation according to the peak and valley demand of power grid load.
After the project is fully completed, it can achieve an annual power generation of 198 million kWh, save more than 60,000 tons of standard coal each year, reduce more than 60 tons of sulfur dioxide, more than 60 tons of nitrogen oxides, about 20 tons of soot and more than 150,000 tons of carbon dioxide, and provide a steady stream of clean energy for the local area.
In addition, there is another silver " sunflower field " in the Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park in Hami City.
Hami Fuguang Solar Photovoltaic Power Station covers an area of more than 2,300 mu, and 714 power generation equipment have been built to follow the sun, always keeping the sunlight at a 90-degree right angle to the surface of the concentrating panel.
" We use dual-axis tracking concentrating power generation technology. Through unified integrated control, all power generation equipment will adjust the angle according to the height of the sun to maintain power generation efficiency. "
Duan Mengqi, the head of the power station, said that in good weather conditions, the power generation technology can improve the efficiency of traditional photovoltaic power generation by about 20%.
In the first half of this year, the power station has generated more than 7 million kWh of electricity, supplementing local demand for electricity.
Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park is currently a photovoltaic industry demonstration park with the largest monomer scale and the most complete types of photovoltaic modules in Xinjiang, with 38 photovoltaic power generation projects and a total installed capacity of 820,000 kilowatts.
In the first half of this year, the power generation exceeded 110 million kWh, an increase of 6% over the same period in 2019.
Hami is one of the regions with the best solar energy resources in China.
The annual average total solar radiation is more than 6,200 megajoules per square meter, and the annual sunshine hours are about 3,200 hours.
In recent years, the city has vigorously developed the photovoltaic industry and planted " sunflower fields. "
A solar power generation scale with an installed capacity of more than 2.5 million kilowatts has been built. In the first half of this year, the city's photovoltaic power generation capacity exceeded 1.4 billion kWh, a year-on-year increase of about 14%.
At present, there are more than 330 grid-connected photovoltaic power stations in Xinjiang, with an installed capacity of over 10 million kilowatts.
It is estimated that photovoltaic power generation will reach 15 billion kWh this year, which can replace more than 6 million tons of standard coal.
Police report details of " female college students lost in Qinghai tourism " search and rescue work continues-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, July 26 (Reporter Wang Jinjin and Zhou Zhe) Recently, " a female college student lost contact after traveling to Golmud, Qinghai " has attracted the attention of netizens.
The Public Security Bureau of Golmud City, Haixi Mongolian and Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province reported on the 26th that Huang Moumou, a student from a university in Nanjing, is still out of contact, and police in many places are going deep along the route where Huang Moumou lost contact and actively carrying out search work.
On July 10, 2020, the Public Security Detachment of Golmud City Public Security Bureau in Haixi Prefecture received a notice from its superiors that Huang Moumou, a student from a university in Nanjing, took the Z164 train from Nanjing to Golmud on July 5, and turned off his mobile phone and lost contact at the southwest area of Qingshui River at Sonandajie Protection Station, Qumalai County, Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province on July 9, asking for assistance in finding it.
According to the investigation of Golmud Public Security Bureau, Huang entered Qinghai Province at 19: 54 on July 6 and arrived in Golmud at 4: 00 on July 7.
At 8: 00 on the same day, Huang Moumou, a missing person, took a taxi from the Yellow River Hotel in Golmud City to G109 National Road, and arrived at the Sonandajie Protection Station in Hoh Xil at 12: 00. The taxi driver returned alone. Huang Moumou arrived at the Qingshui River area near the Sonandajie Protection Station at 15: 00 on the 7th and shut down in the area until 18: 00 on the 9th.
In further investigation, the police found that Huang had passed the Naijigou checkpoint at 17: 07 on July 13.
Naijigou checkpoint is a checkpoint set up by Naqu City, Tibet Autonomous Region at Nanshankou, Golmud City. Because there is no video surveillance at the checkpoint, it is impossible to determine the information of the person and the vehicle. The police can only drive along the way to search and coordinate with the checkpoints along Tibet. If Huang is found, immediately contact the Golmud Public Security Bureau.
According to the latest situation, at 1: 00 a.m. on July 26, Golmud Public Security Bureau organized rescue forces to carry rescue equipment to search for the unfrozen spring protection station and Sonandajie protection station along the Qinghai-Tibet Highway, and actively contacted Sichuan police, Tibet police and Nanjing police to carry out joint work. At present, the search and rescue work is still continuing.
The local police hope that the majority of netizens and all sectors of society will provide relevant clues to Golmud police and Nanjing Jiangning police in time, so as to find the missing person Huang Moumou as soon as possible.
At the same time, relevant experts reminded that tourists should be standardized, rational and civilized in outdoor activities, always pay attention to roadside warning signs, do not risk entering no man's land, and call the police in time for emergencies.
US media uncovered the truth that the US unjustifiably asked China to close its Consulate General in Houston-chinanews.com

US media uncovered the truth that the US unjustifiably asked China to close its Consulate General in Houston
On the 24th, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the US Embassy in China that China had decided to revoke the license for the establishment and operation of the US Consulate General in Chengdu, and put forward specific requirements for the Consulate General to stop all business and activities, as a countermeasure to the US sudden request on the 21st that China close the Consulate General in Houston.
This behavior of the US government has attracted much attention, and its political motives have been questioned by foreign media and scholars.
Why do you ask China to close the Consulate General?
Many foreign media said that it was not clear why the United States chose the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, but as to the purpose of this move, the foreign media bluntly stated: for the general election.
CNN reported on the 23rd that the US request for China to close the Consulate General in Houston has raised questions about its political motives.
The article said that the disastrous response of the US government to the COVID-19 epidemic caused President Trump's poll support before the election to be relatively low.
White House officials said privately that the tough strategy against China was to save Trump's approval rating and to shift the responsibility for the White House's failure to respond to the epidemic.
The article believes that the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is a " politically driven and very cautious " target chosen by the United States, and the US government chose it " to create a tough attitude while avoiding the risk of major conflicts. "
The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) also believes that when the US election season is approaching and the US economy is severely hit by the epidemic, Trump believes that " playing the' China card' has a political advantage. "
The current situation is " a spiral, tit-for-tat struggle" , which is promoted by the US government from the perspective of domestic considerations to a certain extent, and will only worsen the tension between China and the United States.
CBS reported that Trump's re-election prospects are under pressure due to the outbreak, and he has repeatedly blamed China for the epidemic.
Almost every day, the United States takes new actions against Trump's absurd argument that " China exploits the United States. "
" The Consulate General of Houston is very important in establishing ties between the two countries "
The Associated Press commented that the United States' request for China to close its consulate in Houston has exacerbated tensions between the world's two largest economies.
If the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is closed, in addition to diplomatic influence, Chinese citizens in the southern United States will face difficulties in obtaining consular services, as will American citizens seeking visas and other services.
A Houston business group expressed regret over the US request for China to close its Consulate General in Houston, saying that the Consulate General has played an important role in establishing trade, investment and cultural ties between the two countries.
The Associated Press believes that this reflects the importance of China's economy.
The website of the US Foreign Policy magazine believes that the US move " is part of a series of provocative measures that will only worsen US-China relations. "
Reuters quoted Jonathan Pollack, an expert on East Asia issues at the Brookings Institution, a US think tank, as saying that since the establishment of full diplomatic relations between the United States and China in 1979, he could not think of any move comparable to the US action against the Chinese Consulate General in Houston.
Hong Kong's South China Morning Post reported that the US move was unprecedented in more than 40 years of diplomatic relations between China and the United States.
Analysts believe that this move may cause lasting damage.
Established in 1979, the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is the first Chinese Consulate General in the United States.
At present, China has one embassy and five consulates general in the United States.

In 1696, Tsar Peter the Great set out to form a maritime fleet, creating the history of the Russian navy.
The last Sunday in July every year is the Russian Navy Day.
In response to the new changes in the epidemic prevention and control work, since July 17, trade unions at all levels in Xinjiang have responded to the call of the Autonomous Region Federation of Trade Unions and actively participated in the epidemic prevention and control work.

Spokesperson of the Embassy in the UK: The Chinese government is a staunch defender of cyber security-chinanews.com
chinanews.com, July 26 (Xinhua) According to the website of the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom, on the 25th, the spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom answered a question on the wrong remarks about cyber attacks.
The spokesman stressed that the Chinese government is a staunch defender of cyber security and has always resolutely opposed and combated any form of cyber attacks and cyber crimes.
A reporter asked: According to the media, hacker organizations related to China have interfered with the network system of a British company, launched attacks on British and American technology companies with patent data, and invaded the government networks of EU countries.
The spokesman said that the Chinese government is a staunch defender of cyber security and has always resolutely opposed and combated any form of cyber attacks and cyber crimes.
Cyberspace is highly virtual, difficult to trace, and diverse actors. When investigating and characterizing network events, sufficient evidence should be produced, and no unreasonable speculation should be made.
The spokesman said that a series of incidents such as " Prism Gate " in the past proved that the United States has been conducting the world's largest cyber theft operation.
Maintaining peace and stability in cyberspace is in the common interest of all countries.
The spokesman pointed out that China's achievements in scientific and technological innovation were not stolen or robbed, but obtained through self-reliance and hard work.
In 2019, China submitted about 59,000 patent applications through the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), with an annual growth rate of 10.6%, making it the country with the largest number of international patent applications.
China has become a big country in innovation and intellectual property rights.
According to data from the Urumqi Central Sub-branch of the People's Bank of China, in the first half of the year, new loans for agriculture-related and small and micro enterprises in Xinjiang exceeded the annual increase in 2019.
In the first half of this year, the Urumqi Central Sub-branch of the People's Bank of China used a variety of monetary policy tools to guide the banking industry to continuously increase loan investment, providing sufficient financial guarantee for epidemic prevention and control and resumption of work and production.
Most areas of free nucleic acid testing in Urumqi have basically completed secondary testing in high-risk areas-chinanews.com
China News Service, Urumqi, July 26 (Reporter Sun Tingwen and Zhao Yamin) Zhang Wei, director of the Urumqi Health Commission, reported the latest epidemic situation and nucleic acid testing in Urumqi on the 26th, saying that at present, most areas of free nucleic acid testing in Urumqi have been basically completed.
The expert group of the State Council and experts from the autonomous region and Urumqi are further evaluating the development of the epidemic based on the results of nucleic acid testing and epidemiological investigations.
The Press Office of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region held a press conference on the 26th to report on the epidemic situation and prevention and control in Xinjiang.
According to him, from 0: 00 to 24: 00 on July 25, there were 22 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 pneumonia in Urumqi (including 5 cases of asymptomatic infection) and 38 new asymptomatic infections.
As of 24: 00 on July 25, there were 135 confirmed cases and 147 asymptomatic infections in Urumqi.
The new asymptomatic infections on the 25th were basically screened through the city's free nucleic acid testing.
Zhang Wei, director of the Urumqi Municipal Health Commission, said on the 26th that most districts in Urumqi have basically completed free nucleic acid testing.
He also said that from the experience of other regions in the country, there are many factors that affect the nucleic acid test results, such as the sensitivity of the test reagent, the infection time and detoxification time of the tested personnel, the cooperation of the tested personnel when the specimen is taken (poor cooperation may lead to the specimen not being taken in place), the testing environment, the operation proficiency of the inspectors, etc.
For various reasons, false negative results will also appear in nucleic acid testing.
The so-called false negative means that the tested person is indeed infected, but the nucleic acid test result is negative.
In addition, people who have had close contact with confirmed or suspected cases usually need two nucleic acid tests to be excluded.
For people who have been to high-risk areas in the epidemic, if fever and respiratory symptoms occur, a negative nucleic acid test may be false negative, so two nucleic acid tests are needed to rule out.
He said that in view of the above situation, for the health of the people of all ethnic groups in the city, starting from today, Urumqi will conduct a second free nucleic acid test in key areas such as Tianshan District and Shayibak District, and carry out " checking for omissions " at the same time.
It is reported that Tianshan District and Shayibak District are high-risk areas for the epidemic.

This year is even more so.
In order to cherish the hard-won epidemic prevention and control situation, the Shanghai International Film Festival, on the one hand, strictly abides by the epidemic prevention requirements and implements the epidemic prevention and control measures in detail; on the other hand, with the vision of gathering wisdom for Chinese film creation and meeting the needs of movie fans, it opens a multi-plate activity both online and offline.
On the first day of the opening ceremony, relevant epidemic prevention policies were strictly implemented in the relevant activities of the film festival, from offline viewing to industry forums.
The forum activities are controlled within 50 people, and the attendance rate is strictly controlled within 30% for each movie viewing.
As the organizing committee of the film festival upholds, in any case, " putting people's life safety and health first " is a major premise.

White House epidemic expert Forge: cautiously optimistic about the development of a vaccine in early 2021
On the 25th, he made the above remarks at an online video conference hosted by the International Leadership Foundation.
He reminded that it is not clear how the COVID-19 epidemic will develop in autumn and winter, nor what the ultimate impact of the epidemic will be. " The only way to end all this is for each of us to choose to be part of the solution. "

Representatives of the US-China Trade Talks met in August
Hong Kong's South China Morning Post quoted an anonymous person familiar with the matter as reporting on the 25th that Liu He, head of China's trade negotiation team and Vice Premier of the State Council, and Lai Haizhe, co-leader of the US team and trade representative, are expected to hold formal talks in August to assess the implementation of the first phase of the China-US trade agreement.
The report said that although China has significantly increased its purchases of American agricultural products in the past few months, due to the COVID-19 virus epidemic and other factors, China's purchases are still some distance from the amount promised in the trade agreement.
Analysts say that the recent closure of each other's consulates by the United States and China, together with other disputes, may undermine any progress in trade between the two sides.
The first phase of the Sino-US trade agreement came into effect one month after it was signed on January 15. The agreement stipulates that the trade framework group composed of high-level officials from both sides should hold talks every six months.
According to people familiar with the matter, the meeting will be " an important turning point " for both parties to assess the progress of the agreement.
However, this person also said that if the tension between the United States and China leads to a low willingness to talk at this time, the two sides may agree that the conference call between Lai Haizhe and Liu He on May 8 has met the terms of the semi-annual talks in the trade agreement.
Since the beginning of this year, Sino-US relations have deteriorated rapidly. Disputes between the two sides include a series of issues such as the origin of the COVID-19 virus, trade, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, the South China Sea and ideology.
Although US President Trump boasted about his achievements in the first phase of the agreement at the beginning of the year, his attitude has changed recently.
He said at a White House press conference on the 23rd that although China has recently purchased a record amount of US corn in a single day and bought a lot of soybeans, " this trade agreement is not as meaningful to me as it was when it was reached. "
An anonymous Beijing government consultant also believes that due to poor US-China relations, a new round of trade negotiations is unlikely to take place, and " trade issues have lost weight in Sino-US relations. "
However, he revealed that China's economic and trade related units still met on the 23rd to discuss a series of issues, including how to increase imports from the United States. " We have tried our best to buy, so any additional purchases will be difficult. "
Peng Jiening, vice president of the US-China Trade National Committee, said that it is " more important than ever " to maintain the momentum of the first-stage agreement, and pointed out that China has made progress in further opening up its financial markets to US companies this year.
An analyst at Plenum, an independent research firm, said: " It is better to talk than not to talk, although it may only be regarded as routine. "
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26 (Reporter Wei Yukun) The reporter learned from the Emergency Management Department on the 26th that the National Defense Office and the Emergency Management Department, together with the State Grain and Material Reserve Bureau, once again urgently transported 1.35 million woven bags, 1.2 million square meters of woven fabrics, 130,000 square meters of geotextiles and other six types of central reserve flood control materials to Anhui to support Anhui's flood fighting and rescue work.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Emergency Management Department, at present, the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the Huaihe River basin maintain high water level fluctuations, and the " No. 3 flood of the Yangtze River in 2020 " formed in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River on the 26th, increasing risks in some areas.
The meteorological department predicts that there will be heavy rainfall in Chongqing, Guizhou and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in the next three days, and the flood control situation is still severe and complex.
According to reports, since the flood season, the Emergency Management Department has deployed national comprehensive fire and rescue teams to pre-set professional rescue forces in key flood control areas, participated in 10,364 flood fighting and rescue cases, dispatched more than 130,000 commanders and fighters, 17,778 fire trucks and 11,887 boats, rescued 37,777 people trapped in distress, and evacuated and transferred more than 107,000 people trapped.
Hao Yusheng, Chief Representative of Nasdaq China: Now is the best time for Chinese companies to go to the United States for IPO-Economic Observer-Professional Financial News Website
Economic Observer Network reporter Zhang Bin Because of the Luckin Coffee fraud incident, the US market has implemented stricter supervision on Chinese stocks. Combined with the long-term pressure on valuation, Chinese stocks listed in the United States are under pressure. Netease, JD.com and other Chinese stocks have recently started their journey back to Hong Kong for listing.
Recently, Shell, Ideal Automobile and other companies have been enthusiastic about listing in the United States.
Under the epidemic situation and the crisis of Chinese stocks, is now the best time for Chinese companies to go public in the United States?
" As far as the recent IPO cases and the companies that will go public in the United States are concerned, the IPO in the United States has not been affected in essence. On the contrary, the market is very good now. Even now is the best time for Chinese companies to go to the United States for IPO in the past 10 years. "
Hao Yusheng, chief representative of Nasdaq Stock Exchange in China, said at the " 2020 Listed Company Leaders Summit China Stocks Branch " hosted by Snowball.
In April this year, the US Securities Regulatory Commission (SEC) and the US Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) issued the Statement on Audit Quality and the Important Role of Regulatory Access to Audit and Other International Information-Discussion on the Current Challenges of Information Access for US Listed Companies with Large Businesses in China.
The statement stated that although international cooperation and coordination have increased significantly in recent years, the problems of US regulators in obtaining information still exist, and the SEC and PCAOB still face legal and practical challenges; Corresponding to this document, the PCAOB website lists in detail the list of listed companies that have encountered audit obstacles and their audit institutions, and a large number of Chinese stock companies are listed.
In addition, in May this year, the US Senate passed the Foreign Company Accountability Act, which puts forward additional information disclosure requirements for foreign companies to list in the United States.
In Hao Yusheng's view, the crisis of Chinese stocks has not affected investors' appetite.
" When this news first came out, it caused everyone's panic. Everyone was asking if they could go public in the United States in the future, but later we found that these problems were not a problem for investors. Investors may ask these questions during the recent IPO roadshow in the United States, or even become standardized questions, but this has not been regarded by investors as an important factor in investing in a Chinese company.
It is recommended that everyone treat the current situation with a normal heart as much as possible.
Of course, this may seem to be the most serious situation in the past two years, but as far as investors' appetite is concerned, it has not been affected in any way.
So from now until the end of this year or before the US election, the upsurge of IPO in the United States will continue. "
On May 9 this year, Jinshan Cloud was officially listed on Nasdaq in the United States, becoming the first Chinese company to go to the United States for IPO after the epidemic.
" The listing of Jinshan Cloud gives great confidence to Chinese companies preparing for IPO. "
Hao Yusheng said.
According to the data report on Chinese stocks in the first half of 2020 released by Snowball, in the first half of this year, a total of 20 Chinese companies went to the United States for IPOs, an increase of 17.6% over the same period last year; In terms of total initial fund-raising, 20 companies raised a total of 2.725 billion yuan, up more than 52.4% compared with the same period last year; In terms of industry distribution, the number of IPOs in the health care industry in the first half of this year was outstanding, up 100% over the same period last year.
According to Hao Yusheng, the Chinese companies that went to the United States for IPO in the first half of this year are of high quality, and high-quality companies with excellent fundamentals and growth will be more favored by investors.
In the short, medium and long term, Hao Yusheng continues to be optimistic about the IPO of Ming Chinese companies in the United States.
" In the short term, the upsurge of IPO in the United States continues; in the medium term, Chinese companies have more choices, A shares, Hong Kong stocks, and US stocks. Everyone will consider the US election and Sino-US relations as market choices and time choices; In the long run, everything will return to normal, market fluctuations are cycles, both political and economic cycles, and will eventually return to the normal stage. The stock market has always been volatile. "
Hao Yusheng also said, " There are many uncertain factors this year, but for high-quality companies, no matter whether the market is good or bad, as long as they are solid and have growth that investors can see, other factors are relatively secondary. Investors need to invest in excellent Chinese companies. "

Commentator of People's Daily: Concentrate on doing your own affairs well and create new advantages for future development-On the study and implementation of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech at the Entrepreneurs Symposium-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 25-People's Daily, July 26 commentator's article: Concentrate on doing your own affairs well and create new advantages for future development
At present, the global epidemic situation and the world economic situation are still severe and complex, and the challenges facing China's development are unprecedented.
Maintaining strategic determination, enhancing confidence in victory, and concentrating on our own affairs are the keys for us to cope with various risks and challenges.
At the recent Entrepreneur Symposium, General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed that under the current external environment of rising protectionism, the downturn in the world economy and the shrinking global market, we must concentrate our efforts on doing our own things well, give full play to the advantages of the domestic super-large-scale market, gradually form a new development pattern with the domestic big cycle as the main body and the domestic and international double cycles promoting each other, raise the modernization level of the industrial chain and supply chain, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation, speed up key core technology research, and create new advantages for future development.
He who observes the situation is wise, and he who controls the situation wins.
In the external environment of the in-depth development of economic globalization, the market and resources have played an important role in China's rapid development.
Now, the world under the impact of the epidemic is undergoing profound changes, facing more unstable and uncertain factors, and economic globalization is encountering headwinds and waves.
An extremely important aspect is to take expanding and meeting domestic demand as the strategic basis for development, give full play to its own advantages, and add impetus to China's economic development by prospering the domestic economy and smoothing the domestic cycle.
We should deeply realize that building a complete domestic demand system is related to China's long-term development and long-term stability.
The Party Central Committee reviewed the situation and clearly stated that it is necessary to resolutely implement the strategy of expanding domestic demand. This is the need to cope with the impact of the epidemic, to maintain the long-term sustained and healthy development of China's economy, and to meet the growing needs of the people for a better life.
The advantage of a large country's economy is that it is internally recyclable.
China has the most complete and largest industrial system in the world, strong production capacity and perfect supporting capabilities. It has more than 100 million market players and more than 170 million talents with higher education or various professional skills. There is also a super-large domestic demand market formed by 1.4 billion people, including more than 400 million middle-income groups. It is in the stage of rapid development of new industrialization, informatization, urbanization and agricultural modernization, with huge potential for investment demand.
Public ownership is the main body, multiple ownership economies develop together, distribution according to work is the main body, and multiple distribution methods coexist. Socialist basic economic systems such as socialist market economic system cannot only stimulate the vitality of various market entities, liberate and develop social productive forces, but also promote the organic unity of efficiency and fairness, and continuously realize common prosperity.
We must firmly grasp the strategic basis of expanding domestic demand, make production, distribution and circulation rely more on the domestic market to achieve a virtuous circle, clarify the strategic direction of supply-side structural reform, and promote the dynamic balance between total supply and total demand at a higher level.
It is necessary to accelerate the construction of a complete domestic demand system, vigorously promote technological innovation and other innovations, accelerate the promotion of strategic emerging industries such as digital economy, intelligent manufacturing, life and health, and new materials, form more new growth points and growth poles, and gradually form a new development pattern with the domestic big cycle as the main body and the domestic and international double cycles promoting each other.
Openness brings progress, while closure inevitably lags behind.
General Secretary Xi Jinping has repeatedly stressed that China's opening door will not be closed, but will only open wider and wider.
Taking the domestic cycle as the main body, it is by no means a closed door to operate, but by leveraging the potential of domestic demand to better connect the domestic market and the international market, and make better use of the two international and domestic markets and two resources to achieve stronger and more sustainable development.
At the same time, there is no contradiction between expanding domestic demand and opening up. The smoother the domestic circulation, the more conducive it is to building a new pattern of opening up and forming new advantages in participating in international cooperation and competition.
Although protectionism is on the rise in the world, we must stand on the right side of history, persist in deepening reform, opening up, strengthen open cooperation in the field of science and technology, promote the building of an open world economy, and promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.

Yu'ebao earnings decline " post-90s " but " retaliatory " to save money?
With the decline in Yu'e Bao's earnings, the " post-90s " not only did not escape Yu'e Bao, but began to save money in a " retaliatory " manner?
The " Yu'ebao Post-90s Savings Report " (2020 version) recently released by the China New Economic Research Institute and Alipay shows that in the first half of the year, the " post-90s " are more likely to save money: the amount of money saved per capita increased by nearly 40% compared with 2019.
Interestingly, " post-90s " tend to save from a small sum of money, with 60% saving less than 20 yuan on average...
Saving money with Yu'e Bao has also become the saving habit of " post-90s. "
Data shows that among the 700 million Yu'e Bao users, 134 million are " post-90s. "
There are 174 million " post-90s " in China, that is to say, about 3 out of 4 " post-90s " in the country are saving money with Yu'e Bao.
At present, the 7-day annualized rate of return of monetary funds such as Yu'ebao has fallen to about 1.5% from a level higher than 2% at the beginning of the year.
Even so, it did not affect the pace of " post-90s " saving money.
Under the background of the improvement of Yu'e Bao's " money saving effect" , many young people who are used to using Yu'e Bao have directly transformed into " basic people. "
According to Alipay data, as of July 13, the number of new " basic people " on Alipay has more than doubled year-on-year in the past month, and more and more young people have achieved " advanced " financial management on Alipay.
Some analysts believe that the inflow of funds from Yu'ebao into the stock market is also an important reason for the clear decline in the share of monetary funds in June.
The report also shows that " post-90s " girls are more likely to save more money, with an average of 20% higher than that of boys. Among the users who hold funds on Alipay platform, 60% are men, and women tend to choose more robust financial management methods than men.
After saving money, what are the plans of the " post-90s "?
Alipay data shows that the " post-90s " have the habit of saving money for their goals, and the largest number of users take travel as their saving goal.
Affected by the epidemic, many " post-90s " save money to prepare for travel after the epidemic; the reopening of cinemas also provides a new way to switch from saving money to consumption.

Due to contact with an infected PCOO employee, Andanar and 49 PCOO employees were tested for COVID-19 pneumonia on the 24th.
The report released on the 25th showed that 10 of the employees tested positive.
PCOO Deputy Minister of Administration and Legal Affairs Marvin Gatpayat said that the Ministry's new administrative office building in the presidential palace was originally scheduled to resume on the 27th, the day President Duterte delivered his fifth State of the Union address.
On the same day, Martin Andanal assured the public that PCOO continued to perform its duties to the Filipino people, ensuring that important information was provided to the public in a timely manner, and strengthening contact tracing and testing to avoid further spread of the COVID-19 pneumonia virus among PCOO staff.

France increases space military investment-Xinhuanet
French Defense Minister Florence Parley said on the 24th that France will add hundreds of millions of euros to its space defense budget to develop space military forces to prevent " unfriendly actions " that other countries may make in outer space.
Paley told Provence on the same day that between 2019 and 2025, the expenditure budget of French space military projects will increase from the previously proposed 3.6 billion euros (about 4.2 billion US dollars) to 4.3 billion euros (5 billion US dollars).
According to the French Military Planning Act from 2019 to 2025 approved by the French Parliament in 2018, France is expected to update its existing observation satellites and communication satellites in the future, launch three electromagnetic listening satellites, and improve the modernization level of space surveillance radar.
French President Emmanuel Macron announced in July last year that a space military command and an " aviation and space force " would be established within the French air force.
Parley said that she will officially announce the establishment of the space force when she visits a military academy in Salon, Provence.
Parley said that this space force belongs to the Air Force and will have 500 personnel by 2025.
She said: " In the past, people thought that space served the common interests of science, but this idea is gone forever. Now space is a place where countries compete for global hegemony. "
Paley reiterated Macron's previous statement that France has no intention of provoking an arms race.
" We are by no means engaged in an arms race. But it is my responsibility to thoroughly recognize the threats we may face. "
Paley recalled the surveillance of a military satellite shared by France and Italy in 2017.
She said that what was " peeping " was a Russian satellite.
Russia denies this statement.
Parley said that France " soon " will have a small patrol satellite capable of detecting and targeting " the black hands behind those unfriendly actions. "
French media believe that the reason why France seeks to establish a space force is that US President Donald Trump asked the US Department of Defense to draft a bill to establish a space force in February last year.
Trump signed the National Defense Authorization Act in December last year, approving the establishment of the Pacific Air Force, the sixth largest military service in the United States.
Some experts worry that these US measures have accelerated the pace of militarization of US space and may trigger a new round of space arms race.

The report says the shared accommodation market has picked up since March-chinanews.com
(Reporter Yang Zhaokui) The " China Shared Accommodation Development Report 2020 " (hereinafter referred to as the " Report ") recently released by the Sharing Economy Research Center of the National Information Center shows that due to the impact of the epidemic, the transaction volume of China's shared accommodation market decreased by 72.1% year-on-year in the first five months of 2020.
However, the shared accommodation market began to pick up in March, and the market transaction volume, order volume and reception number gradually recovered.
The " Report " shows that the transaction volume of the shared accommodation market has declined significantly. On the one hand, due to the sharp decline in the demand for travel accommodation under the prevention and control of the epidemic, the order volume has decreased sharply. The total order volume in the first five months has decreased by 65% year-on-year, and the number of receptions has decreased by 63% year-on-year. On the other hand, the weak demand has also led to a relatively obvious decline in overnight prices, with the average overnight price in the first five months falling by 16% year-on-year.
However, the market transaction volume in March, April and May increased by 78%, 199% and 35% respectively; the number of orders increased by 141%, 152% and 50% respectively; and the number of receptions increased by 81%, 112% and 28% respectively.

In this regard, Yu Fengxia, deputy director of the Sharing Economy Research Center of the National Information Center, told the Workers' Daily reporter that the development of shared accommodation needs stronger policy support. On the one hand, it is necessary to implement the policies already issued in the early stage, further strengthen policy publicity and focus on creating a better business environment; on the other hand, it is necessary to further strengthen policy guidance and support from stimulating consumer demand, enriching the supply of tourism accommodation services, innovating service methods and strengthening cooperation between the government and platform enterprises.

chinanews.com, Xiamen, July 26 (Yang Fushan, Zhang Shushan, Xu Jingyi) The Department of Vascular Surgery, Shanghai Changhai Hospital, Naval Military Medical University, China's famous vascular surgery center, signed a contract with the Department of Vascular Surgery, Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University on the 25th to jointly set up a collaboration center to promote exchanges and cooperation between the two sides in the field of vascular surgery, especially in the field of acute and severe aortic disease.
Zhongshan Hospital affiliated to Xiamen University said that after the vascular surgery of the two hospitals formally form a cooperative unit, they will carry out remote consultation, formulate treatment plans with Changhai Hospital in real-time online consultation, select and send talents for further training, and jointly carry out surgical technical exchanges and teaching visits every week; For complex cases, Changhai experts can be invited to the hospital to perform operations according to the needs of patients, so that patients in southwestern Fujian can enjoy the top medical resources in China without leaving the province.
The two hospitals will also work together to carry out surgical innovation and scientific research, aortic disease popularization and early screening, etc.
A special seminar on aorta sponsored by Beijing Health Promotion Association and hosted by Zhongshan Hospital affiliated to Xiamen University was held in Xiamen on the same day.
At the same time, the two well-known hospitals in Shanghai and Xiamen held a signing ceremony for the Vascular Surgery Collaboration Center and announced the formation of a cooperative unit to jointly improve the treatment level of vascular surgery-related diseases in southwest Fujian.
The Department of Vascular Surgery of Shanghai Changhai Hospital is the only institute of vascular surgery in the army and the only clinical medical center of vascular system diseases in Shanghai. It is also the first national key discipline of vascular surgery. It has led the establishment of the Endovascular Professional Committee of the Chinese Medical Association and is a top team with deep accumulation in the industry.
Professor Huang Xiaojin, Director of Vascular Surgery, Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University, was interviewed by the media.
The Department of Vascular Surgery, Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University, is the first independent discipline of vascular surgery in Fujian Province. It has long been committed to the diagnosis and treatment of aortic and peripheral vascular diseases. In 2018, it was approved to build a provincial key clinical specialty.
In the treatment of aortic diseases, in addition to the treatment of dissecting aneurysms and aortic aneurysms, he has extensive experience in emergency ruptured aortic aneurysms.
" The Department of Vascular Surgery of Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University is very outstanding in this region in terms of the history of development, the breadth, difficulty and complexity of the operation, so this time we set up a collaboration center. In addition to the aorta, we can also carry out all-round in-depth cooperation in medicine, teaching and scientific research in the diagnosis and treatment of lower limb arteries, carotid arteries and other diseases. "
Professor Feng Rui, deputy director of vascular surgery at Shanghai Changhai Hospital, said.
Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University and Shanghai Changhai Hospital signed a contract to establish the " Li Zhaoshen Famous Doctor Studio " in the Department of Gastroenterology in 2018.
Professor Huang Xiaojin, director of vascular surgery of the hospital, said in an interview with chinanews.com that the vascular surgery of the hospital has also had a long history of exchanges with Changhai Hospital. This time, the two hospitals formally formed a cooperative unit, bringing cooperation and exchanges between the two sides to a new level.
He said that the hospital will regularly invite Shanghai experts to Xiamen to carry out surgical technical exchanges, teaching visits, difficult case discussions, etc., and further carry out remote consultations. Currently, it plans to conduct remote consultations once a week; In addition, the department will also select and send personnel for further training and exchanges to strengthen the training and development of subject talents.
The reporter learned at the meeting that vascular disease is the leading cause of death in China. As the main artery of various organs of the human body, the aorta flows from the heart to the whole body and plays an important role.
The occurrence of aortic disease is often accompanied by high risk, high mortality and high difficulty of treatment. The thickest section of the aorta is up to 4cm in diameter. Once hemangioma is formed, rupture occurs, or vascular intima rupture produces dissection, it will cause massive hemorrhage, which is very dangerous.
In recent years, with the change of people's lifestyle and the acceleration of the pace of life, China has become the world's largest country with hypertension, and aortic diseases have also increased. Nowadays, with the development of surgical technology and industrial materials, the treatment of aortic diseases continues to develop in a minimally invasive, rapid and efficient direction.
Doctors can puncture from the thigh and place stents in the aorta to properly " divert " the blood flow, so as to avoid the impact on aneurysms or ruptured dissections, and achieve good therapeutic results. Some operations even require local anesthesia.
This academic seminar invited more than ten domestic experts to discuss the new progress in the treatment of aortic diseases, and carried out cutting-edge technical training and difficult case discussions in the form of a conference salon.
The reporter learned at the meeting that with the development of surgical technology and industrial materials, the current treatment of aortic diseases continues to develop in a minimally invasive, rapid and efficient direction.

China News Service, Chongqing, July 26 (Reporter Han Lu) The reporter learned from the China Railway Chengdu Bureau Group Co., Ltd. on the 26th that the Zhengwan High-speed Railway Small Three Gorges Tunnel, with a total length of about 18.9 kilometers, was completed on the same day.
It is understood that the Small Three Gorges Tunnel is not only the longest high-speed railway tunnel in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, but also the longest single-hole double-track high-speed railway tunnel with a design speed of 350 km / h among the projects currently under construction in China.
Zhengzhou-Wanzhou high-speed railway is located in the three provinces and cities of Henan, Hubei and Chongqing, connecting Beijing-Guangzhou and Xulan high-speed railway in the north of Zhengzhou, and connecting Yu-Wanzhou high-speed railway to Chongqing in the south of Wanzhou. It is an important part of China's " eight vertical and eight horizontal " high-speed railway network.
The Zhengwan High-speed Railway Small Three Gorges Tunnel was completed on the 26th.
The picture shows through the scene.
The Zhengzhou-Wanzhou high-speed railway starts in Zhengzhou City, Henan Province, and runs southwest through Pingdingshan City, Nanyang City, and Xiangyang City in Hubei Province to Wanzhou District of Chongqing City. The new line is about 818 kilometers long, with a design speed of 350 kilometers per hour, and about 184 kilometers in Chongqing.
Among them, the Zhengzhou-Xiangyang section has been opened for operation in advance on December 1, 2019, and the Chongqing section is stepping up its construction.
The Small Three Gorges Tunnel, which runs through the whole line on the 26th, is a full-line control project of Zhengwan High-speed Railway. The project is located at the junction of Fengjie County and Wushan County in Chongqing City, with a total length of about 18.9 kilometers and a maximum buried depth of 890 meters.
Construction of the tunnel began in February 2017 and was completed on July 26, 2020.
According to Wang Guojun, head of Zhengwan high-speed railway tunnel design at China Railway Second Academy Engineering Group Co., Ltd., the survey and design party, the small Three Gorges Tunnel is located in very complex topographic and geological conditions, facing risks such as karst, mud gushing and large deformation of soft rock. It is a Class I high-risk tunnel, and its design and construction are extremely difficult.
" During the construction of the project, we used geological survey method, geophysical exploration method and advanced drilling method to advance geological prediction, and adopted special design plans for more than 30 karst caves of various types. For example, a bridge with a length of 24 meters was designed and built to span a large karst cave with a longitudinal length of more than 10 meters and a depth of more than 55 meters in the tunnel to avoid tunnel settlement. " Wang Guojun said.
According to the introduction of the China Railway Tunnel Bureau, during the construction of the tunnel, the combination of drainage and blocking was adopted. Through the construction of horizontal tunnels, grouting to block water, strengthening the structural support of the tunnel and building a sewage treatment station, the orderly progress of the project was ensured, and the damage of construction drainage to the water body of the Small Three Gorges Scenic Area was avoided. At the same time, the construction problems such as bad geology such as large deformation of soft rock with a length of 7 kilometers and multiple mud gushing with a maximum daily water inflow of 157,000 cubic meters were successfully overcome.
After the Zhengzhou-Wanzhou high-speed railway is completed and opened to traffic, it will become a new convenient and fast passenger passage from southwest China to the Central Plains, North China and Northeast China. It is of great significance to improve the capacity and quality of the northeast railway passage in southwest China, improve the layout of the regional road network, speed up the development of tourism resources and urbanization along the route, promote regional coordinated development, and promote the implementation of the western development strategy.
Experts say it is unconstitutional to collect immigration data through the U.S. Census for seat allocation in the House of Representatives
Some civil rights organizations and several American cities and counties have sued the US federal government, saying that the Trump presidential palace's attempt to exclude undocumented immigrants from the US census is unworkable and unconstitutional.
The U.S. Census will determine the distribution of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.
" It won't work" , Sarah Brannon, an executive attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, told VOA.
She went on to say that Trump's request to determine the citizenship of the people surveyed in the census is difficult to do and " not very reliable. "
Another civil liberties group, Common Cause, filed a lawsuit Thursday challenging Trump's executive order.
Some cities in New Jersey and Georgia joined the lawsuit.
Arlington County, Virginia, joined the lawsuit Friday.
Arlington County Board of Management Chairman Garvey said, " The U.S. Constitution requires an accurate count of our population every 10 years. We must accurately count everyone living in Arlington County and cannot let this illegal attempt scare people away and reduce the number of our immigrant communities succeed. "
Other organizations and individuals praised President Trump's executive order.
Alabama Attorney General Marshall called the executive order a " victory " for the state.
He said, " The allocation of seats in the House of Representatives and electoral college seats in each state must be based on the number of residents living in each state, and the number of residents living legally. "
The US Supreme Court last year prevented the Trump administration from including citizenship issues in the 2020 census form.
President Trump signed an executive order earlier this week instructing Commerce Secretary Ross, who oversees the U.S. Census Bureau, to submit data on undocumented people from the census so that the administration can exclude these undocumented people from the census figures of each state and determine whether each state increases, decreases or maintains seats in the House of Representatives.
The United States redistributes seats in the House of Representatives every 10 years according to demographic changes.

Move in response to the situation and promote the construction of industrial projects-Viewpoint headlines-Hunan Daily Network-Huasheng Online
In Hunan in midsummer, the heat wave hits the face.
The enthusiasm released by the on-site observation meeting to promote the construction of industrial projects in the province has overshadowed the heat of the three-volt day, and the clear orientation of " comparing strength with industry and discussing heroes with projects " has encouraged the three Hunan and four rivers.
The development of Hunan always depends on building projects and cultivating industries.
Facing the extremely unusual first half of the year, under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, the whole province adhered to a game of chess, went all out to fight the two tough battles of epidemic prevention and flood control, and took industrial projects as the " first move " to implement the " six stability " and " six stability. "
From 1.9% year-on-year decline in GDP in the first quarter to 1.3% year-on-year growth in the first half of the year, it is self-evident that the period was difficult and the effort was enormous.
In this precious report card, the construction of industrial projects is the key support for Hunan's accelerated economic recovery and stable development.
The potential is smooth and irreversible.
The construction of industrial projects should be put into the overall situation. They should not only be good at accumulating, accumulating and seeking potential, but also be good at recognizing, seeking and adapting to changes.
Under the complex and severe background of the current international situation, in addition to painstaking efforts to attract investment, it is necessary to calm down to study the new characteristics of the current new situation, grasp the rules more scientifically and accurately, and better integrate into the new development pattern with the domestic big cycle as the main body and the domestic and international double cycles promoting each other.
Pay more attention to improving the basic capabilities of the industry.
In the first half of the year, not only did a large number of heavyweight investment projects in emerging industries break ground and sow hope in our province, but also enterprises in traditional advantageous industries accelerated their deployment in digital, intelligent, and green industrial transformation.
The Yiyang Aoshikang Third Science Park project transforms the existing production line, and the intelligent production line of high-end printed circuit boards takes the lead; the new plant of Hunan Zhongyan Changde Cigarette Factory is committed to the process of intelligent transformation and construction of a modern factory, which is also a vivid portrayal of " old trees sprout... " Focusing on the major national strategy and " two new and one heavy" , efforts should be made to consolidate and upgrade advantageous industries, actively cultivate and develop emerging industries, and comprehensively increase scientific and technological innovation and localization substitution, so as to continuously consolidate the basic conditions and accumulate transformation momentum.
Pay more attention to the cultivation and development of new economy, new business forms and new models.
The sudden COVID-19 epidemic has brought the popularity of the " cloud economy" , stimulated the potential of the digital economy, and provided new opportunities for industrial transformation: in the first half of the year, the computer and office equipment manufacturing industry and the electronic and communication equipment manufacturing industry in our province grew by 12.6%, the online retail sales of wholesale and retail enterprises above the quota increased by 32.2% year-on-year, and the online meal fee income of catering enterprises increased by 35.6% year-on-year.
It is the general trend to cultivate new opportunities in the crisis, open a new situation in the changing situation, actively promote digital industrialization and industrial digitization, and guide the integrated development of digital economy and real economy.
Pay more attention to optimizing and stabilizing the industrial chain supply chain.
Construction machinery is the main force of Hunan industry, but two-thirds of the supporting enterprises are outside the province, and there is still space and potential in the supporting chain.
To strengthen the thinking of the industrial chain and grasp the project, it is necessary not only to have the continuous accumulation of leading enterprises and achieve technological breakthroughs in key links of the industrial chain; it is also necessary for all regions to devote themselves to cultivation, to stimulate the " chain " lock response by strengthening the chain to supplement the chain and extend the chain, to promote the coordinated layout of relevant supporting industries, and to speed up the construction of an independent, controllable, safe and reliable industrial chain supply chain.
To overcome difficulties and support enterprises, Hunan is still a hot and happy land with a good business environment and emerging market opportunities.
All parts of the province frequently make moves, make new moves, and make practical moves, thinking that the " burden reduction " of enterprise bail-out will lead to the " acceleration " of high-quality development; Shaoyang implements " shareholder-style " service, which does not shirk responsibility for enterprises, does not discount policies, and does not solve problems overnight... In the process of recovering the losses caused by the epidemic, all kinds of " do everything possible " to identify short-board pain points and achieve vivid stories of turning crises into opportunities.
Focusing on researching, cultivating and developing industries and optimizing the business environment will surely win the favor of more investors.
The wind and waves are still ahead, but the state of riding the wind and waves has become the norm for the whole province to focus on the construction of industrial projects and promote high-quality development.
During this critical period, we must learn and implement the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's series of important instructions, effectively deal with external uncertainties with the certainty of our own work, persevere in promoting the construction of industrial projects, share enthusiasm and sweat to ensure the successful conclusion of the 13th Five-Year Plan and building a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way.

Employment and prices are generally stable, showing that the economy has " temperature " -chinanews.com

The overall stability of employment and prices shows that the economy has " temperature "
Economic Daily · China Economic Net reporter Lin Huocan
In the first half of this year, in the face of the impact of the COVID-19 pneumonia epidemic, my country made overall plans to promote epidemic prevention and control and economic and social development. The situation of epidemic prevention and control continued to improve, the steady economic recovery was obvious, the employment and price performance closely related to people's livelihood were generally stable, and the Chinese economy handed over a report card of economic operation with temperature.
In the first two months of this year, the surveyed unemployment rate rose.
Especially in February, the production and operation activities of many enterprises were basically in a state of shutdown, the employment demand of enterprises decreased, recruitment was delayed or cancelled, and the surveyed unemployment rate in cities and towns increased.
With the gradual improvement of the epidemic prevention and control situation, the production and living order of the whole society has been continuously restored.
The Party Central Committee adheres to the general tone of seeking progress while maintaining stability, further strengthens macro-policy hedging, comprehensively strengthens the employment priority policy, and actively promotes the work of assisting and stabilizing posts and expanding employment.
China has increased its policy of hedging and stabilizing jobs, played a combination of " reduction, reduction, slow return and compensation " policies, phased reduction and reduction of three social insurance unit contributions, allowed deferred payment of social insurance premiums, expanded the benefits of the policy of post return of unemployment insurance for small and medium-sized enterprises, and provided absorption subsidies and internship subsidies for enterprises to absorb the employment of key groups.
With the implementation of various policies to stabilize employment, the employment demand of enterprises has steadily picked up, the employment situation has gradually improved, and the surveyed unemployment rate in cities and towns has gradually decreased. In June, the surveyed unemployment rate was 5.7%.
Zhang Yi, director of the Population and Employment Statistics Department of the National Bureau of Statistics, said that in the second quarter, various employment policies continued to be effective, and the labor force that withdrew due to the impact of the epidemic returned one after another. The urban labor participation rate in June increased by about 10 percentage points compared with February, which was close to the level of the same period last year.
Data show that the total urban employment in June increased by more than 19% compared with February, and most industries reached the pre-epidemic level; the average weekly working hours of enterprise employees reached 46.8 hours, 6.6 hours higher than in February and 0.1 hours higher than in January.
Prices are also related to thousands of households.
In January this year, CPI rose by 5.4% year-on-year, setting a new high for many years.
Entering February, although the year-on-year increase of CPI fell slightly, it was still in the " 5 range. "
The year-on-year growth rate of CPI is at a high level, which is not only driven by consumer demand before the Spring Festival, but also by the wrong month of the Spring Festival and a low year-on-year base.
However, the impact of the COVID-19 pneumonia epidemic on prices is particularly obvious.
Affected by the prevention and control of the epidemic, logistics delays, untimely material supply, and increased material transportation costs occurred all over the country in January and February. In addition, some citizens hoarded and snapped up, and the prices of some daily necessities increased significantly.
In response to the disturbance brought by the epidemic prevention and control to the price situation, relevant departments have included important living materials in the scope of emergency transportation guarantee to ensure smooth transportation of materials.
Under the action of a series of policy measures, the market supply of vegetables and fruits has been strongly guaranteed.
In response to the rapid rise in pork prices at the beginning of this year, after the central government issued the policy of ensuring supply and stabilizing prices, all regions and departments quickly implemented it. The supply of pork reserves has improved significantly, pig production capacity has been restored in an orderly manner, and the production and marketing order has gradually become normal.
Since March, pork prices have declined continuously, driving the year-on-year increase in food prices back to 10.6% in May; In June, pork prices rose slightly month-on-month due to factors such as the slowdown in pig production, the decrease in import volume and the rebound in group consumption demand.
The seasonal variation of fresh vegetable prices is obvious, with an average increase of 3.4% in the first half of the year.
Affected by the high comparison base in the same period last year, the price of fresh fruit continued to decline year-on-year, with an average decrease of 13.3% in the first half of the year.
The basic livelihood of the people has been effectively guaranteed, and the overall economic and social situation has remained stable and orderly.
With the gradual recovery of transportation and logistics, various regions have increased their efforts to ensure supply, and the market supply and demand situation has improved.
Since March, the CPI has declined for four consecutive months, and the year-on-year increase has also fallen from 4.3% in March to 2.5% in June. The overall price level has returned to stability.
In the second half of the year, China's prices will continue to maintain a moderate level, and the overall inflationary pressure will not be large. However, it is still necessary to promote the restoration of production and living order under the premise of normalizing epidemic prevention and control.
Effectively respond to natural disasters such as floods and droughts in major agricultural production areas such as grains, fruits and vegetables, strengthen market supervision, and resolutely crack down on hoarding, price hikes and other behaviors that disrupt market order.

After the two officially stepped down as senior members of the royal family in March, they are currently living in Los Angeles with their son Archie to pursue a new career.
Harry and Megan got married in May 2018.
At that time, this marriage was regarded as injecting Hollywood's brilliance and new era atmosphere into the British royal family, and the two became one of the most watched celebrity couples in the world.

chinanews.com, Qinghai, Hainan, July 26. Title: " Flower Sea Live Room " by Qinghai Lake: " Sweet " Brings Goods to Help Farmers Increase Income
Author Hu Guilong Pan Yujie
" In midsummer, Qinghai Lake is full of golden flowers and thousands of bees flying. Here, the altitude is higher, the temperature difference between day and night is large, and the air pollution is less. The strong light breeds the most tenacious and generous bee colony, creating Qinghai royal jelly with high activity, high protein, rich nutritional value, low sugar and low fat characteristics. "
On the 26th, Zhang Jianxun, deputy director of the Industry and Information Administration of Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, said.
On the same day, the live broadcast of bee products was held on Qinghai Lake. The China Bee Products Association, representatives of entrepreneurs, bee farmers and other parties gathered to jointly promote Qinghai characteristic bee products. A total of nearly 10,000 bottles of Qinghai Plateau royal jelly were sold online and offline, with a total amount of nearly 3.8 million yuan.
The picture shows beekeepers showing bee products on the spot.
It is reported that this live broadcast activity uses Beijing Houdeli Bee Industry Chain Store Network, Qianhe, Taobao and other well-known domestic bee product retail enterprises, live broadcast, and e-commerce platforms to promote the exchange and cooperation of " enterprises + beekeepers + growers" , and continues to issue " Qinghai Plateau Spring Pulp Consumption Coupons " to consumers through online and offline channels. It is estimated that the total annual profit of enterprises will be nearly 5.28 million yuan.
In this regard, Wu Na, president of Beijing Houdeli Bee Industry Co., Ltd., thinks it is " very worthwhile ": " This move can expand the popularity of Qinghai bee products, attract more consumers to understand and like pure natural bee products without adding, and drive bee farmers to increase their income. "
At present, the company has signed production cooperation strategic agreements with Qinghai Cloud Bee Industry Co., Ltd. and Qinghai Huabao Bee Industry Co., Ltd., hoping to jointly promote the rapid development of Qinghai's local bee industry.
The picture shows the sea of rape flowers by Qinghai Lake.
This spring, due to the need to set up road barriers for epidemic prevention and control, the way of beekeepers " chasing flowers and honey " was blocked. Many bees died due to missed flowering and lack of food, and the income of beekeepers was seriously affected.
" Throughout the year, beekeepers follow the flowering period and travel long distances from Yunnan and Sichuan all the way north to the northwest. They live in the open and have no fixed place to live, which is very hard.
As a business, we have a responsibility to help them. "
Wu Na said.
" Little bees are' environmental scouts', and bees cannot survive in heavily polluted areas. " Zhao Xiaochuan, executive vice president of China Bee Products Association, introduced that bee pollination is an important link in the ecological chain and plays an irreplaceable role in protecting plant diversity and improving the ecological environment.
At the same time, bee pollination can increase the yield and quality of crops, especially in areas with wide planting and poor management conditions, pollination is of greater significance.
Research data show that pollination can increase rape yield by about 15% -30%.
The picture shows Zhao Xiaochuan (right), executive vice president of China Bee Products Association, promoting Qinghai bee products.
" The economic, ecological and social benefits created by bee pollination are far greater than the value of bee products themselves. The bee industry has great potential in human health, crop production, vegetation reproduction and ecological protection, but people have always known little about it. "
Zhao Xiaochuan said.
Nowadays, the number of beekeepers is decreasing. In addition to beekeepers who travel all the year round, there are still many poor households with mobility difficulties who choose to use beehives to invest in cooperatives.
" The state has financial support. We contact technical personnel for help and guidance. Beekeepers lack understanding and judgment of the market environment. To open a market, they also need the help and coordination of the government, enterprises, and industry associations. "
Zhao Xiaochuan said.
" I hope everyone will pay more attention to and help beekeepers in the future" , Wu Na said. " Our bee products are also screened and controlled in strict accordance with national standards to ensure quality and protect consumer rights while helping beekeepers. "

" Winning " is adapted from historical facts, and the material is taken from the dusty Soviet military archives for many years.
During the defense of Moscow, the Far East elite of the Soviet Red Army rushed west to assist. At this time, the " northward faction " of the Kwantung Army of Japan thought there was an opportunity and wanted to send troops.
In order to solve the danger of the enemy, the intelligence personnel of the Communist Party of China and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union jointly implemented the " Mudanula " plan.

Liu Yunlong served as both producer and actor in " Odds " this time.
In the play, Tang Fei, who he plays, is the Chief of the Criminal Section of Linhe Police Department. He is a stuttering policeman who is quite happy and even a little ruffian. His real identity is an underground member of the CCP.
The heroine Cai Meng, who plays opposite her, is the head of the Linhe Security Bureau. She is deeply appreciated by the Japanese boss Fukuhara. There is a subtle and ambiguous relationship with Tang Fei.
Su Qing has tried many different types of roles in recent years, from Lu Ruowen in " Those Years We Are Young " to Er Qing in " Yanxi Strategy" , all of which have impressed the audience and their acting skills have been recognized.
This time, Su Qing and Liu Yunlong are partners for the first time. The setting of stuttering sheriff and charming policewoman is quite interesting and innovative.
In addition to the two protagonists, there are many powerful actors such as Liang Guanhua, Li Liqun, Qian Bo, Lei Han and Shen Junyi in " Winning" , and the old drama Bone Racing is also one of the highlights of the show.
It is understood that the production of " Odds " is also very sophisticated, with the crew shooting nearly 2,000 kilometers across Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Liaoning provinces.
In order to restore the bizarre urban features during the Japanese occupation period in Northeast China, the art and props team of the crew rushed to work day and night, carefully polishing every detail of the scene construction and props, making the scenes in the play exquisite and rich in historical texture.

Greenland opens a new round of mixed reform Shanghai state-owned assets to transfer 17.5% of shares-Economic Observer Network-Professional financial news website
Economic Observer Network reporter Rao Xianjun On July 26, Greenland Holdings (600606.SH) issued the " Prompt Notice on State-owned Shareholders' Proposed Transfer of Part of the Company's Shares and Resumption of Trading through Public Solicitation of Transferees. "
The content of the announcement shows that in order to further deepen the reform of state-owned assets and state-owned enterprises, optimize the structural adjustment of state-owned assets layout, and improve the equity structure of Greenland, Shanghai Real Estate (Group) Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as " Shanghai Real Estate ") and Shanghai Urban Investment (Group) Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as " Shanghai Urban Investment ") intend to transfer part of the company's shares held by agreement through public solicitation of transferees, and the total proportion of shares to be transferred shall not exceed 17.5% of the total share capital of Greenland.
The price of the shares to be transferred this time shall not be lower than the higher of the following two: the arithmetic average of the daily weighted average price of the 30 trading days before the indicative announcement date (July 27, 2020); the audited net asset value per share of the company in the most recent fiscal year.
At present, there is still no conclusion on the new strategic investor in Greenland. According to the public announcement information, it is estimated that the new strategic investor will need to pay about 14 billion yuan to acquire the 17.5% equity transferred in the mixed reform of Greenland.
It is worth noting that after the completion of this share transfer, Greenland is still expected to have no controlling shareholders and actual controllers, but the control structure may undergo major changes.
Since its establishment, Greenland Holdings has carried out many institutional reforms: from 1992 to 1997, it operated in accordance with market-oriented rules under a purely state-owned system; from 1997 to 2013, it established and continuously improved the state-owned holding and employee-owned shareholding system; from 2013 to 2015, it introduced strategic investors to form a mixed ownership system of cross-shareholding and mutual integration of state-owned and non-public capital; since 2015, it has been listed as a public company.
Greenland's current mixed reform plan is similar to Gree. In December 2019, high-tech capital led Zhuhai Mingjun to take over 15% of Gree Electric Appliance (000651.SZ) with 41.662 billion yuan, and Gree Group retired as a minority shareholder. After completing the mixed reform, Gree Electric Appliance implemented modern corporate management methods such as executive incentive plan and no actual controller structure.
Shanghai Real Estate and Shanghai Urban Investment are state-owned enterprise groups wholly owned by the Shanghai SASAC. Zhang Yuliang, chairman and president of Greenland Holdings, said that Greenland's move is an important measure for Shanghai to promote the comprehensive reform of state-owned enterprises and accelerate the reform of state-owned enterprises in the new stage in accordance with the requirements of the Party Central Committee. It fully demonstrates the new reform idea of adapting to local conditions and tailoring clothes. By introducing new excellent strategic shareholders to listed companies, it supports enterprises to further improve the degree of marketization, enhance the freedom of operation and management, and accelerate the full release of reform vitality.

It is understood that in September last year, Lanxi City and Shanghai Railway International Tourism (Group) Co., Ltd. signed a strategic cooperation agreement on the project of " Traveling Lanxi by High-speed Railway" , planning to open 12 high-speed railway tourism trains from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai and Anhui to Lanxi within one year.

White House advisers " bite back " states to return to work too early
On July 23, local time, the number of confirmed cases of new coronary pneumonia in the United States exceeded 4 million, accounting for 30% of global cases.
Over the past few months, US President Trump has repeatedly asked all states across the country to return to work and school. It was only recently that he changed his attitude and took the initiative to wear masks in public. His advisers even " bite back " and said that some state governments returned to work too early.
On the 22nd, White House presidential adviser Kellyanne Conway said at a press conference that some state governments did not abide by the standards for returning to work and restarted places such as bars prematurely.
Conway also mentioned that the previous statement that the president has the " absolute power " to decide the resumption of work in each state is a false rumor.
" The president is a federalist. He believes that each state has autonomy. "
She defended Trump.
However, the " rumor " in Conway's mouth was personally spoken by Trump at the White House epidemic briefing on April 13.
This self-beating operation was ridiculed by netizens as " rewriting history. "
Kellyanne Conway wants to rewrite history. She's a liar.
Trump called Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer a dictator because she followed medical guidelines and insisted on stopping work.
Trump wants to push for a return to work so he can hold a rally.
This is not the first time Kellyanne Conway has caused controversy.
In an interview with Fox News on April 15, Conway blurted out: " This is COVID-19, not COVID-1, friends! "
She seemed to understand " 19 " as a version number, and was frantically ridiculed by netizens: read the newspaper without common sense!
Is it reasonable for a 3-year-old child to sue the school after being smashed in the college playground?
2020-07-26 05: 01: 11 Source: Legal Daily Author: Wang Sishuo Editor: Wang Sishuo
The playground was smashed, and the child was compensated before suing the school
□ Correspondent Zhao Yifan
3-year-old Xiaowen was accidentally hit in the head by Chen of the softball team while playing on the playground of a university.
After Chen made compensation, Xiaowen's father, Mr. Wen, as Xiaowen's legal representative, sued the school to the court, demanding an apology from the school where the playground occurred, and paying a total of 20,000 yuan for medical expenses and mental damage.
Recently, after hearing the case, the Haidian District People's Court of Beijing held that the school had set up a protective net on the playground at the time of the incident, and had fulfilled its appropriate security obligations, and Chen had made compensation. Based on this judgment, the plaintiff's claim was rejected.
Mr. Wen claimed that he took Xiaowen to play on the school playground during the summer vacation of 2019, when the softball team was training on the playground.
In order to avoid the risks, Xiaowen, Mr. Wen and many other children and parents move in the safe area designated by the softball team.
However, Chen Mou, a member of the softball team, lost his hand while pitching, causing the softball to fly over the protective net to the above-mentioned safe area and hit the back of Xiaowen's head.
Mr. Wen immediately took Xiaowen to the hospital for treatment and was diagnosed with head trauma.
Mr. Wen believes that the facilities of the school stadium do not meet the relevant safety regulations and do not effectively manage the team and related facilities.
The school's fault led to the above-mentioned events, which caused Xiaowen to suffer great physical and mental pain, and also brought great pain to his family, for which the school should bear legal responsibility.
In response, the school argued that the school had set up a protective net on the playground, posted management regulations and training notices, informed that entering the playground must maintain a safe distance from the training site and reminded people to pay attention to their own safety. The plaintiff could not prove that the school " failed to fulfill its security obligations" , so he did not agree to compensation.
After hearing the case, the court held that the site of the incident was a site open to the public free of charge by the university involved. Although the school has a security obligation for the management of the playground, this security obligation only needs to meet the general duty of care.
At the time of the incident, the school set up a protective net on the playground, which has fulfilled its appropriate security obligations, and Chen also compensated Xiaowen for medical expenses, transportation expenses and other losses of more than 2,000 yuan in accordance with the compensation agreement reached before. Both parties agreed to resolve the dispute at one time.
Later, Xiaowen's parents once again claimed compensation from the school, which was unfounded in law, and the court ruled to reject all the plaintiff's claims.
After the verdict was pronounced, neither party appealed, and the verdict has now entered into force.
According to Article 37 of China's Tort Liability Law, schools, as managers of public places, have the obligation of security; in the case of damage caused by the behavior of a third party, the third party shall bear tort liability, while the public place manager who fails to fulfill the obligation of security shall bear corresponding supplementary liability.
The judge stated that as a manager of a public place, he is most likely to understand the actual situation of the whole place and foresee possible dangers and damage, so he is most likely to take necessary measures to prevent the occurrence of losses or reduce the extent of damage, and the cost of avoiding and reducing damage is the lowest, so the law stipulates that it shall bear the corresponding guarantee obligations for engaging in social activities.
In this case, for unspecified people entering the playground open to the public free of charge, the school's safety guarantee obligations should be compatible with its social activities. Specifically, it should mainly take basic safety measures and have the obligation to inform hidden dangers.
In judicial practice, it is not appropriate to impose excessive security obligations on managers of public places.
If the school has set up a protective net and fulfilled its obligation to inform, it can be determined that the school is not at fault and should not bear legal responsibility.
In addition, for third-party infringement, even if the managers of public places such as schools fail to fulfill their security obligations, their liability is also a supplement to damages. According to the newly promulgated Civil Code, after the managers assume supplementary liability, they can also recover compensation from the third party.
Therefore, in such accidents, the victims should not expand the scope of claims after they have received compensation from the direct infringer.
Under the normalization of epidemic prevention and control, people's enthusiasm for sports and fitness is high.
With the gradual liberalization of inter-provincial tourism business, the tourism market is also about to usher in a recovery.
Fujian Province resumed its inter-provincial tourism business from July 21. Xiamen, a popular tourist destination, ushered in a peak of passenger flow in the first weekend after opening.
As a popular tourist destination city, many tourists arrive in Xiamen on weekends.
Xiamen Railway Station is expected to send 3.7 million passengers during the summer vacation, while the passenger flow at the airport is mainly students, tourists and visiting relatives.
The tourism market is gradually picking up. In July, Xiamen Airport operated an average of 440 flights per day, and domestic flights have recovered to 80% of the pre-epidemic level.
Airlines have encrypted the air express lines from Xiamen to Shanghai, Beijing, Kunming, Xi'an and other major cities to seize the recovered tourism market.
At present, many travel agencies in Xiamen have successively launched a number of summer domestic inter-provincial travel products, and the group itinerary is mainly outdoor scenic spots.
In response to the summer passenger transport peak in railway stations and airports, relevant units have deployed additional manpower in areas where people are easy to gather, such as check-in counters and security check channels. Fujian has also optimized and upgraded the " Ba Min Health Code " to realize the sharing and mutual recognition of health data with 31 provinces, and promote the orderly recovery of the tourism market.
Can Andy Lau and Liu Qingyun " dismantle " new sparks-Xinhuanet
" Bomb Disposal Expert 2 " recently announced that it will be released on December 24, becoming the first scheduled film for the New Year.
The second part is still directed by Qiu Litao, supervised and starring Andy Lau, and unfolds with a brand-new story.
It is reported that the addition of the " nuclear bomb " element in the second part also makes the challenge faced by the bomb disposal experts more difficult. The few stunning shots in the trailer have made people hang on the line. The mushroom cloud of the big explosion and the airport engulfed by fire are quite shocking.
Three years ago, " Bomb Disposal Expert " produced by the original team won the May Day box office champion of that year, and won seven nominations at the Hong Kong Film Awards. Qiu Litao × Andy Lau also became the gold medal partner in the eyes of the audience.
This time, " Bomb Disposal Expert 2 " also makes people look forward to whether this pair of ace combinations can spark new sparks.
" Bomb Disposal Expert 2 " tells a brand-new story: former bomb disposal expert Pan Chengfeng (Andy Lau) fainted at the scene of the explosion and was listed as a suspect by the police.
In order to find the truth, he had to ask his good friend Dong Zhuowen (Liu Qingyun), who is also a bomb disposal expert, for help.
Pang Ling (Ni Ni), a female inspector eager to solve the case and Pan Chengfeng's ex-girlfriend, was also involved.
He is still a bomb disposal expert, but from the preview of the file, you can feel the complexity of Andy Lau's new role: he broke a leg, put on a prosthetic limb, and was chased by Liu Qingyun, who is also a bomb disposal expert, while being directed by his ex-girlfriend Ni Ni.
What is the relationship between the three people, what exactly did Andy Lau do at the Xiangdao Hotel, what kind of cases he was involved in, and what twists and turns he experienced in his career as a bomb disposal expert. All kinds of mysteries make people curious.
It is understood that the highlight of the film is the on-site shooting of Hong Kong's world landmarks, coupled with the top special effects production team, which brings shocking and realistic visual impact.

chinanews.com, Chongqing, July 26 (Reporter Liu Xian) The Chongqing Development and Reform Commission announced on the 26th that the city has so far returned 4,404 fishermen, accounting for 42.54% of all fishermen involved.
Li Daiguo, 53, said in an interview with chinanews.com that his grandfathers have been fishing in Longxi River. Since the age of 11, he has been fishing with his father, shaking his boat, walking along Longxi River, up to Liangping, Chongqing, and down to longevity. Every time he leaves home, it is ten and a half months, and he depends on fishing to support his family.
However, since 1997, with the gradual influx of rural population into the town, there are more and more residents in Gaoanchang town, resulting in more and more serious environmental pollution.
Paper mills, chemical plants and farms have been built along the Longxi River, which also pollutes the river.
By 2007 and 2008, Longxi River had become a stinking ditch.
" The scales of the fish caught are all black, and the inside is also black after being cut open. "
Li Daiguo said that fishing is becoming more and more difficult after the river is polluted.
The local government began to make great efforts to control the pollution of Longxi River, including clearing the river, patrolling the river, and managing and protecting aquatic resources.
Li Daiguo also retired from fishermen and became a member of the river patrol team to manage and protect aquatic resources.
From January 1, 2020, Chongqing Aquatic Life Reserve and related waters in the main urban area have implemented a comprehensive ban on fishing.
According to the data of Chongqing Development and Reform Commission, so far, Chongqing has withdrawn 3,403 fishing vessels and signed 4,643 fishing vessels, accounting for 63.3% and 86.3% of the total three-year tasks respectively.
4,404 fishermen have been retired, accounting for 42.54% of all fishermen involved.
Of the 4,404 people who have retired, 4,267 have achieved employment, accounting for 96.89% of the fishermen who have retired.
Old-age insurance covers 2,691 people, accounting for 61.10% of the fishermen who have retired.
In the next step, Chongqing will carry out in-depth special rectification actions, accelerate the clean-up and rectification of shoreline utilization projects in the main stream of the Yangtze River, complete a new round of census of sewage outlets entering the Yangtze River and carry out corresponding rectification actions, basically complete the rectification task of " three phosphorus " (referring to phosphate ore, phosphorus chemical industry and phosphogypsum reservoir), clean-up and rectification of small hydropower, promote the special action of afforestation and greening on both sides of the Yangtze River, strengthen the construction of green mines, consolidate the special rectification results of illegal docks and illegal sand mining in the main stream of the Yangtze River, and further promote the work of banning and returning fishing in the Yangtze River Basin.
Israel strengthens repeated prevention and control of the epidemic-chinanews.com

Israel strengthens repeated prevention and control of the epidemic
At the beginning of the COVID-19 pneumonia outbreak, Israel's prevention and control measures were effective.
However, with the gradual lifting of the ban on prevention and control measures, the number of confirmed cases of new coronary pneumonia in Israel has recently increased significantly. The Israeli government has repeatedly taken emergency measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic.
On February 28, the first case of new coronary pneumonia was confirmed in Israel, so it quickly took measures to close all entry and exit ports, suspend non-essential industries, change schools to online teaching, restrict public transportation and non-essential social activities, block cities with serious epidemics, and the military and police jointly maintain prevention and control measures.
This series of measures quickly achieved positive results. By mid-May, the number of new confirmed cases of new coronary pneumonia in Israel in a single day had dropped to single digits.
With the epidemic under control, Israel's various prevention and control measures have been fully unblocked. Since June, the number of newly diagnosed COVID-19 pneumonia has gradually rebounded.
Especially after entering July, the spread of the epidemic has continued to accelerate.
In recent days, there have been more than 1,500 new cases in Israel every day for eight days. As of July 25, there were 916 new cases on that day.
As of July 25, Israel has 59,745 confirmed cases and 448 deaths.
Faced with the rapid rebound of the epidemic, the Israeli government has repeatedly taken emergency measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic.
On July 6, after the number of confirmed cases exceeded 30,000, the Israeli government closed gyms, swimming pools, bars, nightclubs and other public entertainment venues, and introduced a policy of restricting public transportation, stipulating that the maximum number of passengers per bus should not exceed 20.
On the 17th, the Israeli government announced a series of new restrictive measures, including the implementation of " economic reform " on weekends, stipulating that " economic reform " will be implemented from 17: 00 every Friday to 5: 00 every Sunday.
During this period, people can go out, but shops, shopping centers, barber shops, beauty salons, libraries, zoos, museums, exhibition halls, swimming pools and tourist attractions will be closed, while supermarkets, pharmacies and other basic services will remain open.
At the same time, on all dates and time periods, gatherings of more than 10 people are prohibited, gyms, studios and other places will be closed, restaurants and cafes are prohibited from dining in, and only take-out services are allowed.
At the same time, the Israeli people did not pay enough attention to the severity of the epidemic and failed to form a joint force with the government in fighting the epidemic.
After repeated outbreaks in Israel, many people took to the streets to protest and march because the government's prevention and control measures affected their own economic interests.
On July 11, tens of thousands of people held a demonstration in Tel Aviv, believing that the anti-epidemic policy affected the economy.
On the evening of the 21st, thousands of protesters gathered in front of Prime Minister Netanyahu's residence in Jerusalem to protest against Prime Minister Netanyahu's promulgation of prevention and control measures such as banning restaurants and cafes without giving corresponding compensation.
In addition, many people do not abide by the regulations on wearing masks and maintaining a safe social distance of two meters during outdoor activities. In order to avoid being fined by the police for not wearing masks, many people only wear masks on their chins or wrists.
During the recurrence of the epidemic, the school was the hardest hit area for the spread of the COVID-19 virus. According to a reporter's recent visit to this kindergarten, it was found that the teachers and students in the kindergarten did not wear masks as required by the government, nor did they maintain a safe social distance of two meters from each other, laying hidden dangers for a large number of teachers and students to be infected with the virus.
Professor Elie Waxman, a member of the Israeli National Security Council's expert advisory group to combat the epidemic, believes that Israel is moving towards a " dangerous situation " and pointed out that Israel's current epidemic prevention and control measures are not enough, and all leisure and entertainment venues and summer schools should be closed to control the further spread of the epidemic.
Waxman said that Israel lacks an overall plan to fight the epidemic, and the parliament and government departments should abandon their respective interests as soon as possible, reach an agreement on fighting the epidemic, and formulate clear steps that include relevant restrictions on different departments.
Tel Aviv, July 25, our Tel Aviv correspondent Wang Jiong
Wu Fengfang, a farmer in Guyuan, Ningxia, but his wife Dai Tianfu, rushed to Liangyun Cultural Compound from his home 20 miles away in a car.
Despite the inconvenience of legs and feet in the past two years, 77-year-old Dai Tianfu is still counting on " coming here every now and then to have a trick addiction. "
This is an inconspicuous courtyard in Yuanzhou District, Guyuan City. Unlike ordinary farmhouses, melodious Qin opera is often heard in the courtyard, as well as wonderful shadow puppets, embroidery works, traditional Qin opera, eyebrow Hu opera, etc.
The owner of the compound is Liang Yun, who used to be a carpenter.
More than 10 years ago, he loves shadow puppets and sings operas and began planning to build a cultural compound.
With Liangyun Cultural Compound, the cultural life of the villagers has become rich and colorful.
Before the reporter entered the Liangyun Cultural Compound, the tune of Qin Opera had already spread out.
Bai Lixiang, a villager from a neighboring village, is singing excerpts from Qin Opera for the villagers.
She has loved Qinqiang since she was a child, and now she is well-known in the local area. As long as she has free time, she will come to the cultural compound to perform for the villagers.
Recently, Bai Lixiang also played a live webcast.
Bai Lixiang said: " It is a very happy thing to have a stage for more people to see themselves perform. "
On the stage, the singers looked at each other and the players played one tune at a time. Although they were amateurs, their enthusiasm did not diminish at all.
Just like the rustic style of the farmyard, outside the Qin Opera, the " grassroots " art and intangible cultural heritage in the Liangyun Cultural Courtyard come to the face.
The compound also has a collection of more than 300 agricultural utensils of different ages, traditional and hand-made tiles, paper-cuts, embroidery, shadow puppets and other objects.
Liang Yun led the reporter into the exhibition hall in the courtyard, which showed his collection of old objects, old wine jugs, three strings, spinning wheels, etc.
Why does an ordinary farmer build a cultural compound?
" Shadow puppetry is my family craft. I have been learning this craft since I was 15 years old. "
Established in 2012, Liangyun Cultural Compound has become the first rural " intangible cultural heritage exhibition hall " in Ningxia and a demonstration compound for intangible cultural heritage protection in Guyuan City.
In addition to Liangyun Cultural Compound, more than 120 cultural compounds and 79 folk performance groups have emerged in Yuanzhou District of Guyuan City. Among them, there are more than 50 cultural compounds of a certain scale, such as Shenjiahe Cultural Compound, Wang Yonghong Cultural Compound and Yanglang Cultural Compound, covering all towns and streets in Yuanzhou District, with more than 5,000 participants.
These grassroots artists are active in the fields, enriching the cultural life of the masses and meeting their spiritual needs.
" As life gets better and better, traditional culture can't just be left behind. "
" Liu's spy war drama " is back again " odds " to see Liu Yunlong Li Liqun's opponent " racing drama " -Xinhuanet
The 40-episode spy war drama " Odds " will land on Beijing Satellite TV from July 16.
" Winning Chance " is adapted from real historical facts and is based on the Soviet military archives that have been sealed for many years and first appeared.
Actor Liu Yunlong, who is well known to the audience in the " spy war drama" , broke through the image in the play and challenged a happy " stuttering agent. "
In recent years, the popularity of dramas such as " Pretender" , " Mask " and " Kite " has proved that spy war dramas have exuberant vitality.
Different from previous spy war works, " Winning " looks at the world and extends the background of the story to the Soviet Far East battlefield.
Taking the final stage of the Anti-Japanese War in 1944 as the background, it tells the story of Tang Fei (Liu Yunlong), a secret intelligence worker of the Communist Party of China, under the leadership of the secretary of the Linhe Provincial Committee of the Chinese underground party and the director of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Agency, who carried out the " Mudanula " strategic action of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Agency.
In many spy war dramas, the hero, as a senior spy, has a perfect image of handsome, high IQ and maturity.
However, in Liu Yunlong's view, such a person is not suitable to be a spy. " A spy should be the kind of person who can't be found in a pile of people. If he appears, he is the kind of handsome image. I wish everyone would pay attention to you. Can he still lurk? There is a line in " Kite" ,' If you don't come to catch me, I forget that I am a Kuomintang', and the spy is going to be elitist. "
Therefore, in " Odds" , Liu Yunlong ingeniously designed his hero Tang Fei as a " stuttering agent " with a sense of joy.
The other camp in " Winning " is supported by Japanese Fukuhara, played by Liang Guanhua, and Fang Shibao, director of the Police Agency, played by Li Liqun.
The two powerful actors, one south and one north, add a lot of highlights to the whole play.
Director Yin Fei used the term " racing drama " to describe the opposite play between Li Liqun and Liu Yunlong in the play. " It is definitely racing drama. The two of them have a special tacit understanding. The tacit understanding between them has a great impact on me. Many times their plays are' hanging now'. For example, we only wrote half a page long. If I don't stop when shooting, they can go on. "
The masters do not rob each other of the play, and the director does not disturb the play. When the actors are in the role and ensure their character status, they cannot only shape the role from the perspective of the characters, but also bring more viewing possibilities to the audience. Yin Fei said that such a play is brilliant enough.
In the play, you can also see many familiar faces from " Liu's spy drama. " The famous and majestic " Mountain City F4 " in " Kite " also gathered three people in " Odds. "
Hou Yu and Liu Mingyang, who played Song Xiaoan and Zhao Jianzhi, once again played Tang Fei's right arm.
Director Yin Fei said, " There is no inferiority in these two people. They just drifted with the tide in that era and environment. "
Liu Yunlong also offered, " We must have a human touch. This human touch means that there must be good and bad people around me. Bad people are enemies, but we must develop them and our team must also grow. "
The ending of the two people in the play was also carefully designed by Liu Yunlong, and he believes that he will give the audience a satisfactory answer.

Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, July 25-Xu Zhengyu, Secretary for Financial Affairs and the Treasury of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, said that Hong Kong's financial market remains active and orderly.
He expressed optimism about Hong Kong's financial stability and economy.
Xu Zhengyu said at an online seminar co-organized by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Toronto and the Hong Kong-Canada Chamber of Commerce (Canada) on the 24th (Toronto time) that Hong Kong is experiencing difficult conditions due to the " storm of legislative amendments " and the COVID-19 pneumonia epidemic.
The exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar is stable and biased towards the strong exchange guarantee level.
There is no obvious sign of capital outflow from the banking system. On the contrary, more than $11 billion has flowed in since June.
The total amount of bank deposits has also continued to increase in the past few months. There has been a series of public offerings in the stock market, and market transactions have repeatedly increased.
Xu Zhengyu said that the COVID-19 pneumonia epidemic has put pressure on the global economy and financial markets, but Hong Kong's basic advantages remain unchanged.
Hong Kong has many advantages, including geography, rule of law, high-speed communication, free flow of information and capital, and simple and low tax system, which make Hong Kong a leading international financial center.
Xu Zhengyu pointed out that the SAR Government has set aside HK $6 billion in the " Epidemic Prevention and Anti-epidemic Fund " to create about 30,000 time-limited jobs in the public and private sectors in the next two years, covering people with different skills and academic qualifications.
To support the development of financial technology, the SAR Government has also launched the " Thousand Talents Plan " to subsidize local financial technology companies, start-ups and other enterprises with financial technology-related businesses, so as to create 1,000 new jobs, hire local talents and enrich Hong Kong's financial technology talent pool.
Looking ahead, Xu Zhengyu expressed optimism about Hong Kong's financial stability and economy.
He encouraged Canadian companies to make good use of Hong Kong's advantages and its status as an international financial center, an international asset and wealth management center, and a global offshore RMB business hub to develop and invest in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and nearby areas.
The Lancet published an article praising China's anti-epidemic efforts and encouraging countries to learn from experience-chinanews.com
The Lancet magazine published an article on the 25th that China, as a country with a population of 1.4 billion and a scale similar to that of Europe or the United States, has effectively controlled the COVID-19 epidemic at this stage, and there has been no large-scale spread, which has largely controlled the domestic epidemic.
The article said that in the past ten years, China has made a lot of investment in domestic research and public health construction, which makes China's preparation for the COVID-19 much better than that for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).
The author said that when SARS broke out in 2002, China was not prepared enough at first, especially the pathogen could not be identified.
When COVID-19 was discovered in December 2019, Chinese scientists were soon able to identify the type of virus and shared genome sequencing data with the international community on January 11, 2020.
By the end of January, doctors from mainland China and Hong Kong had clarified the clinical characteristics of the virus and warned the world of the threat of the COVID-19 virus through research papers published in The Lancet.
China has also been at the forefront of vaccine research. When the country declares a state of emergency, through close domestic cooperation, such research has been carried out very quickly and strictly. In May and July, the results of the progress made in the early trials of the COVID-19 vaccine developed by China were published in The Lancet respectively.
China's experience shows that it is very important to invest in the national health and research system to effectively improve laboratory capacity.
This is the basis for the country to respond quickly and effectively to health emergencies and global health security.
Other countries, especially low- and middle-income countries, are worth learning from.
In addition, China's experience has proved that on the basis of strong research, there must be a strong high-level decisive reliance on scientific basis to make correct decisions, so that the COVID-19 epidemic can be effectively controlled.
The article emphasizes that the government and its leaders must respect science, understand the value of science, and act on it in the most beneficial way to society.
At the beginning of the outbreak, China's National Health and Construction Commission sent three groups of infectious disease experts to Wuhan to investigate the risk and spread of the COVID-19 virus. Their suggestions provided the basis for Wuhan's decision to " close the city " on January 23; When experts put forward the necessity and urgency of building a cabin hospital, the government quickly made a decision and implemented it quickly; At the same time, the extensive participation of the community and the masses also made the epidemic quickly and effectively controlled.
Finally, the article emphasizes that in response to global health emergencies, countries need to strengthen global cooperation and joint response.

Director Dapeng's " Auspicious Ruyi " shortlisted for the Golden Goblet Award-Xinhuanet
On July 18, the 23rd Shanghai International Film Festival announced the official list of films selected for the Golden Goblet Award.
Director Dapeng's first realistic film " Auspicious Ruyi " was successfully shortlisted for the Golden Goblet Award at the Shanghai Film Festival. At the same time, the film officially released its first poster.
Poster side for photos
The film " Auspicious Ruyi " is director Dapeng's first realistic work, and it is also his second bond with the Golden Goblet Award.
The film tells the story of a comedy director who returned to his hometown in the northeast countryside on a whim, hoping to make a literary film for his family during the New Year, but encountered a series of accidents.
The family members gathered for making the film completed the final gathering.
In the movie poster released today, Wang Jixiang, a member of the family, sits in the middle of the screen smoking a cigarette. The background is the black land of Northeast China dressed in silver, and the foreground is the red lanterns that Chinese people must hang on holidays.
The red lanterns, which symbolize joy and reunion, form a huge contrast with the lonely Wang Jixiang, which seems to reveal the complexity and entanglement of this big family relationship.
It is reported that in the film, except for the daughter of " third uncle " Wang Jixiang, which is played by actor Liu Lu, the rest of the scenes are completed by the real director's family. The experimental audio-visual style of the film breaks the boundary between drama and reality, and brings the audience a brand-new immersive viewing experience.
According to director Dapeng, the creation of " Good Luck " originated from " a providence. " A series of sudden changes in the family during the filming forced the original filming plan to be changed. Life without a script was finally recorded as a movie, but the tension beyond design was released.
How does director Dapeng face this " providence " and how should he continue to meet the changes brought about by this providence?
There is no doubt that " Auspicious Ruyi " is full of experiments. The lineup of almost all people and innovative audio-visual style turn life in front of the camera into a movie. Under the package of real images, the audience will also find the shadow of themselves and their families from the family presented in the film. With the end of the family gathering in the film, a series of thoughts will be evoked.

At the Banong Zhuokang sentry post, platoon leader Yu Wang and a soldier stood guard on duty.
In this place where the annual average temperature is more than ten degrees below zero, a row of simple barracks stands on the mountain pass. Not far from the barracks, a national flag is fluttering in the wind. The soldiers are on duty in the wind every day and need to regularly patrol higher altitudes.
The soldiers had to use both hands and feet to climb the steep slope of the rubble.
It was late July, when flowers and plants flourished in low-altitude areas, and in Banong Zhuokang, only the ravine behind the barracks had relatively dense green.
Gao Peng, a soldier who has been stationed at the outpost for six years, pointed to the ravine and said that this is their back garden. The grass can only be seen growing slowly in July and August every year. Soon after, it all turns yellow and is covered with snow.
Patrol on foot may take about 9 hours.
Under the harsh plateau environment, the soldiers stationed here are accompanied by snow-capped mountains and glaciers all year round, and they also regularly patrol the higher mountain passes.
A few days ago, a patrol composed of eight soldiers, led by instructor Liang Yixin, once again embarked on the patrol road.
Each soldier carried a weight of about 30 jin and headed for the target point early in the morning.
On the way, a soldier fought against Gao, and his comrades gave emergency rescue.
In addition to patrol tasks, the soldiers at the Banong Zhuokang sentry post have to conduct tactical and physical training every day.
As time passed, the altitude continued to rise, the oxygen content became lower and lower, and the physical strength continued to be overdrawn. These factors tested the will of the patrol members.
They gritted their teeth and insisted, crossing several landslide points and dangerous beaches one after another.
At about 16 o'clock, it was lunch time for the patrol members. They took out their own dry food and sat on the spot at an altitude of more than 5,700 meters, accompanied by sleet, to supplement their physical strength with food.
The soldiers at the Banong Chokang sentry post conducted tactical and physical training.
During the break, they will play cards together, and the loser will do push-ups, which cannot only entertain but also exercise physical fitness.
After a short rest in the cold wind, they climbed to the target point of the patrol, took out the national flag on the mountain pass and solemnly swore.
Behind them are snow-capped mountains, and in front of them are dozens of kilometers of no man's land. They are the safest guardians of the country.
Beijing consumption season restarts-Xinhuanet
Beijing restarted the activities of the Beijing consumption season in accordance with the principle of " comprehensive restart, key planning, orderly promotion and strict organization. "
On July 26, 1.5 million government and enterprise consumption coupons were issued, including 1 million offline catering and shopping coupons and 500,000 smart product coupons, which consumers can collect at JD.com APP.
Liu Meiying, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Commerce, introduced at the media briefing held on the 25th that the consumption season after the restart will further reduce the allocation of capital by enterprises on the basis of maintaining the existing preferential subsidies for consumer coupons, cards and packages.
Since the beginning of August, the current 1: 1 allocation of government and enterprise contributions has been adjusted to 2: 1. For example, if consumers receive a card package and go to the store for consumption, they can enjoy a discount of 120 yuan, of which the government subsidizes 60 yuan and the enterprise gives 60 yuan; after the adjustment, the government subsidizes 80 yuan and the enterprise gives 40 yuan.
During the consumption season, the three major operators will subsidize traffic and terminals around 5G consumption to further promote Beijing's new 5G infrastructure and new 5G consumption.

" Chinese Doctors " prepares to pay tribute to anti-epidemic heroes-Xinhuanet
Recently, with the respect of Chinese filmmakers' heroes fighting the epidemic, Yu Dong, chairman of Bona Pictures Group, and Liu Weiqiang, director (left), held a discussion and exchange with Academician Zhong Nanshan in Guangzhou on the production of the anti-epidemic film " Chinese Doctors ".
Bona Pictures hopes to use " Chinese Doctors " to pay tribute to all medical and epidemic prevention workers fighting in the front line of epidemic prevention and control!
In 2021, the film will be released nationwide as a tribute film to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China.
At present, Bona Pictures is organizing the original crew of the film " The Captain " to make the film " Chinese Doctors " under the arrangement and deployment of the Central Propaganda Department and the National Film Bureau, and with the support of the Guangdong Film Bureau and the Hubei Film Bureau. This is a film that reflects the unity of the people of the whole country to fight the COVID-19 pneumonia epidemic under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee.
The film focuses on the front line of fighting the epidemic in Wuhan. It will take Wuhan medical staff and provincial and municipal medical teams as the background. From the perspective of human nature, it uses unique narrative and powerful lens language to show the touching story of Chinese medical staff full of dedication and sacrifice on the front line of fighting the epidemic.
It is understood that as soon as Wuhan was unsealed, Bona overcame many difficulties and sent a shooting team to go deep into the front line of the epidemic to exchange understanding and collect information with hundreds of medical workers face-to-face. So far, it has interviewed white angels at the forefront of the anti-epidemic front, including Academician Zhong Nanshan himself, Guangzhou's first aid to Wuhan, Guangdong's medical team, as well as Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan Union Hospital, Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan Central Hospital, etc., and photographed a large number of precious first-hand video materials.
Academician Zhong Nanshan also raised expectations and hopes for the filming of the film in this symposium: " I look forward to it. I hope you will not only visit some experts who have made more public appearances, but also interview more medical staff who are working hard on the front line. They are the majority. "
He said that he had seen " Me and My Motherland " and " The Captain " before and thought it was a good way to tell the story of the big pattern from the perspective of ordinary people.
" Now some foreign friends still have some misunderstandings about China. "
When talking about the dissemination of the film, Academician Zhong Nanshan said that at present, some people abroad like to label the virus as politicized. He hopes that the film can impress the audience from the perspective of human nature: " In addition to being shown in China, it is best for this film to be shown abroad. It is necessary to impress the audience with the true humanistic spirit in a way that domestic and foreign audiences can understand. "
Academician Zhong Nanshan also fondly recalled the film " People at Their Middle Ages " in the 1980s, " After so many years, what impressed me most about the film after the reform and opening up was " People at Their Middle Ages ". At that time, my doctor friends abroad were all crying. If " Chinese Doctors " can play such a role, it would be great. "
Academician Zhong Nanshan said that if " Chinese Doctors " can resonate with foreign audiences, it will be very successful.
During the discussion and exchange, Academician Zhong Nanshan also shared his opinions and suggestions on the current international epidemic prevention and control, " I believe that people are always smarter than viruses. "
Academician Zhong Nanshan said that although the virus is difficult to predict, since the primitive society, mankind has survived thousands of difficulties and dangers. Nowadays, modern society has advanced medical technology and social management measures. In addition, medical staff and even ordinary people all over the world have a basic understanding of the scientific response to the COVID-19 pneumonia epidemic. People will no longer be as passive as before. " Next, we must pay attention to two aspects of work, one is to study how the world can strengthen cooperation, and the other is to pay attention to soothing people's hearts. "

Hunan Daily · New Hunan Client Reporter Jiang Rui Correspondent Xiao Yan
Jiaxing Red Boat Mould, Shaoshan Mao Zedong Bronze Statue, Yan'an Budui Flower Crafts, Xiangxi Yongshun Bacon... On July 25, the 2020 Hunan Red Tourism Culture Festival opened in Shaoshan.
As one of the main activities, the first Xiangtan Red Cultural Industry Expo was held in Shaoshan Global Tourism Consulting and Distribution Center.
Red cultural and creative products in the exhibition area and local products in the old revolutionary area are dazzling, attracting tourists from all over the world to buy them.
" This Red Expo is not only a demonstration of the achievements of the national red cultural industry, but also an important platform for exhibitors and enterprises to exchange experiences and explore development paths. "
According to the relevant person in charge of the Executive Committee of the first Xiangtan Red Expo, the theme of this Red Expo is " Promoting Red Culture and Boosting Cultural Tourism" , with a total exhibition area of nearly 3,000 square meters, with an atmosphere creation area, a scenic spot display area and an online shopping experience area for red cultural tourism online games.

More than 30,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Japan-Xinhuanet
According to statistics, there were 239 new confirmed cases in Tokyo on the 26th, and more than 200 new cases were added in a single day for 6 consecutive days, with a total of 11,214 cases.
In addition, there were 141 new confirmed cases in Osaka Prefecture, 90 new cases in Fukuoka Prefecture and 80 new cases in Aichi Prefecture.
Telecom network fraud crimes rose by 70% in the first half of the year - chinanews.com
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) According to the website of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, in the first half of this year, procuratorial organs across the country prosecuted 58,101 people for fraud, an increase of 35% year on year.
In particular, among the crimes impeding epidemic prevention and control, fraud crimes occur frequently, and the number of fraud crimes prosecuted by procuratorial organs accounts for 43.4% of the total number of crimes impeding epidemic prevention and control.
The Supreme People's Procuratorate has carried out targeted guidance. Among the ten batches of typical cases involving epidemic prevention and control that have been released so far, there are 9 cases involving fraud.
Judging from the handling of cases by procuratorial organs in the first half of the year, there are many names involved in fraud crimes, ranging from national macro policies to people's food, clothing, housing, including epidemic fraud, " medical care " fraud" , health care products " fraud" , enrollment intermediary " fraud" , routine loan " fraud, fraud of obtaining state subsidies, fraud of unfreezing national assets, etc., constantly " innovating, " covering education, medical care, employment, pension, social security, land acquisition and demolition, precise poverty alleviation, financial credit and other fields, which not only cause economic losses to the victims, but also seriously affect economic and social development.
In particular, some telecommunication network frauds break through the restrictions of national boundaries, regions and personnel, and have the characteristics of stakeholder, cross-border, remote and electronic payment. There are many unspecified victim groups and great harm.
For example, some set up specialized companies, rent high-end office buildings, set up multiple departments or positions, use legal network platforms to promote and recruit, train and assess recruiters, adopt enterprise operation mode management, and wear " legal cloak" , which is more confusing.
Punishing and preventing crimes in accordance with the law, and promptly issuing early warnings to the public and relevant departments are the unshirkable responsibilities of procuratorial organs.
In judicial cases, procuratorial organs conscientiously perform their duties, not only insisting on maintaining a high-pressure situation against fraud crimes, but also refining various law enforcement measures in a targeted manner, and promoting social governance by issuing procuratorial suggestions.
The procuratorial organs strictly control the facts, evidence, procedures and application of the law in the arrest and prosecution of fraud cases, based on the facts and the law as the criterion, so as to be impartial.
Especially for telecommunications network fraud crimes, we should pay attention to the central role of electronic data in fact determination, and strive to build an evidence chain of mutual confirmation between electronic data, verbal evidence and documentary evidence.
For example, in a certain epidemic-related fraud case handled by the Yinzhou District Procuratorate of Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province, the procuratorate intervened in advance at the first time, and it only took 5 days from the occurrence of the case to the completion of the case, which reflects the attitude and determination to handle it quickly and strictly and maintain the stability of the overall social situation.
In the process of reviewing arrest and prosecution, we should pay attention to the prosecution of missing offenders in cases, correct the omission of 733 arrests by public security organs, and correct the omission of 1113 accomplices by public security organs.
In the first half of the year, procuratorial organs across the country issued 298 procuratorial recommendations for fraud crimes, promoting joint efforts to prevent fraud crimes and promoting in-depth governance.
For example, in response to the loopholes found in the supervision of telecommunications networks by communication enterprises, banks, and intermediary organizations, the Guangzhou Procuratorate of Guangdong Province and the Dongguan Procuratorate promptly put forward procuratorial suggestions, urging relevant units to strengthen supervision, improve mechanisms, and promote the construction of long-term systems.
Fourth, make every effort to recover stolen goods and restore losses.
Local procuratorial organs seize important links such as intervening in investigations, guiding evidence collection, reviewing and prosecuting, urge investigative organs to actively recover stolen money, cooperate with relevant departments to do a good job in recovering stolen goods and losses, and strive to minimize the economic losses caused by fraud crimes to the people.
For example, the Beijing Municipal Procuratorate handled the Lin Moumou routine loan case, which involved 22 properties waiting to be sealed up. Under the circumstances that the property may be dealt with in advance by other cases, it was the first to issue a " Letter of Suspension of Execution " and send it to the relevant courts in a timely manner. It is recommended that the court suspend the execution of the property involved in the case after the previous closure, and deal with it uniformly after the criminal facts are ascertained, so as to make the best efforts to recover the property involved and recover the losses of the victims.
The prosecutor reminded everyone to be very vigilant against fraud crimes, not to expect " pie in the sky" , not to be credulous because it is cheap, and to keep their " money bag. "
Yina Town, Weining County, Guizhou Province: Shorter apple trees and wider road to poverty alleviation-chinanews.com
2020-07-26 11: 42: 58 Source: China Economic Net Author: Zhu Yanjing Editor: Zhu Yanjing
In the scorching heat, a reporter from Economic Daily-China Economic Net walked into Zhonghai Village, Yina Town, Weining County, Guizhou Province.
Under the scorching sun, villager Li Yuanzhong was weeding in the base. Although his face was flushed with sun, he hummed a few small songs from time to time.
Weining County, where Yina Town is located, has a certain popularity in the surrounding areas because of its low latitude, high altitude, sufficient light and large temperature difference between day and night. However, because of its small size and many spots, it has not been able to sell at a good price and form an industrial scale.
Yina Town used to be a poor township that " packed the valley with potato to spend the spring and autumn. " Ten years ago, the local poverty incidence rate was as high as 25.8%.
In the critical period of poverty alleviation entering a decisive battle, it is urgent to change traditional planting habits, adjust the industrial structure and increase farmers' income.
After many visits, Chen Chao, secretary of the Party Committee of Yina Town, and a group of people in the town believed that industrial development could no longer follow the old path.
To this end, Yina Town introduced leading enterprises to grow apples in a modern way.
Hou Jianwen, deputy general manager of Weining Chaoyue Agriculture Co., Ltd., came to Yina Town from Shaanxi in 2015 for research. He saw the local planting conditions at a glance and began to plant apple trees in the local area in 2016.
At first, the village mobilized Li Yuanzhong to transfer the land to plant apple trees, and the Li Yuanzhong and his wife murmured in their hearts: " After so many years of apples, they have never seen anyone in the village who has grown apples and made a fortune. "
" The apples planted are dwarf apples, which will not make the apple trees grow too tall. "
To Li Yuanzhong's surprise, a new method was adopted for apple planting this time. Irrigation pipes were laid under each apple tree, and water and fertilizer were poured to the roots. When the fruit was harvested in autumn, the tractor drove directly into the orchard and could pick the fruit standing.
At present, the Apple base has gradually entered a high-yield period, and the market is as expected by Hou Jianwen. Apples are not worried about selling and are deeply loved by consumers in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and other cities.
The growing apple industry has brought new changes to Li Yuanzhong's life. Although he is still farming, he has a new source of income.
Li Yuanzhong's family has more than 9 acres of land transferred to the apple base. Every year, in addition to the guaranteed land transfer fee, there is a profit dividend after hanging the fruit. The couple usually work in the base. " One person can get 80 yuan a day and have work all the year round. "
Li Yuanzhong told reporters that last year's profit dividend received more than 2,800 yuan, plus land transfer fees and the couple's labor income, and the family's income was more than 80,000 yuan. " You don't have to worry about food and clothing, and a well-off life has already passed. "
" At present, initial results have been achieved. The annual output value of 1 mu of apples exceeds 15,000 yuan, which is about 10 times that of corn. "
Chen Chao told reporters that 20,000 mu of apples have been planted in the whole town of Yina, 6,000 mu in Zhonghai Village alone, covering 4,056 households and 17,200 people, including 656 households and 2,952 poor households. The annual salary is more than 6 million yuan, which really realizes that the base is built at home and there is no need to go out to work.
Li Yuanzhong, whose pockets are bulging day by day, also began to realize his " wish. "
During the Lunar New Year this year, Li Yuanzhong bought an off-road vehicle and now drives to and from work every day. " There are still more than ten acres of land at home. When the next step is to expand the scale of the Apple base, all of it will be transferred to them, and the income will be even more. "

The " greenhouse effect " is a major environmental problem perplexing human development, and carbon dioxide emissions are the culprit responsible for the " greenhouse effect. "
How to efficiently capture and utilize the carbon dioxide emitted by humans is the focus of attention of scientists.
" Membrane separation method " is an emerging carbon dioxide capture technology. It separates carbon dioxide gas with the help of membrane materials, which has the characteristics of high efficiency, energy saving and simple operation.
How to make the membrane material " breathe deeply " and improve the efficiency of gas separation is the bottleneck and difficulty in capturing carbon dioxide by membrane separation method.
The scientific research team of Tianjin University innovated ideas and explored the influence of different solvents on membrane gas separation performance through repeated experiments.
The experimental results show that with N-methylpyrrolidone as the preparation solvent, the distribution of carbon nanotubes in the membrane material is more uniform and " more breathable" , which effectively improves the gas separation efficiency and rate of the membrane material.
The carbon dioxide separation performance of the mixed matrix membrane prepared by this new technology is close to the theoretical separation upper limit of this kind of membrane material.
" The new technology provides a new idea for capturing carbon dioxide by membrane separation. "
Li Run, a member of the atmospheric environment and bioenergy team of Tianjin University, said: " We hope that this technology can provide strong support for future coal-fired power plants and chemical enterprises to deal with flue gas and play an important role in controlling greenhouse gas emissions.

Understand what is the professional grade difference before volunteering to fill in the report-chinanews.com

Understand what is a professional grade difference before volunteering to fill in the report
Every year, there are students or parents who do not understand the terms involved in the voluntary application, which affects the voluntary application.
This year, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing University of Science and Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing Forestry University, and Beijing University of Chemical Technology jointly issued the 2020 enrollment policy to cancel the professional grade difference.
What is the meaning of professional grade difference and what is its significance in voluntary reporting?
There are three ways of professional allocation rules
Experts remind that before filling in the application, you must carefully read the " Admissions Regulations " of your favorite school to understand the admission rules of colleges and universities, including the proportion of file transfer, professional allocation rules, etc.
Professional allocation rules refer to three ways of professional admission: professional priority, score priority, and professional grade difference after colleges and universities are transferred.
The specific method used by colleges and universities will be specified in the " Admissions Regulations. "
However, the admission principle of some colleges and universities is that the total score is first, and there is no grade difference between majors.
That is to say, candidates in the admission range will be queued up according to the total score. When the score does not reach the first professional voluntary admission score line, it will be seen whether it has reached the second professional voluntary admission score line, and so on until the last professional volunteer is admitted. There is no level difference between the professional volunteers.
The so-called " professional level difference " means that when colleges and universities arrange candidates' majors, they determine the admission majors of volunteer candidates of different majors according to one or several score values announced in the enrollment regulations. This score value is the " professional level difference. "
That is, the score difference between the first professional volunteer and the non-first professional volunteer in the college, and the grade difference score between the professional volunteers, such as 3 points, 2 points, 1 point, etc.
For example.
Suppose student Xiaoming applied for college A and scored 560 points. His professional volunteers are: computer, international trade, automation, mechanical engineering, and e-commerce. The professional admission of college A adopts the method of professional grade difference, which is divided into 2 points, 1 point, 1 point, and 0 point.
In the professional allocation, if Xiaoming's first professional volunteer meets the professional admission requirements and the major has a planned balance, then Xiaoming is admitted to the " computer " major; if the computer is not admitted, his score will be subtracted by 2 points, and the score of 558 points will be sorted with the candidates who volunteer to apply for " international trade " in the first major to determine whether they meet the professional admission conditions; if it is still not satisfied, the score will be subtracted by 1 point (that is, 557 points) for the " automatic " admission of the third professional volunteer; if it is still not satisfied, the score will be subtracted by 1 point (that is, 556 points) for admission to the fourth major. If the follow-up major still cannot meet its professional wishes, the points will not be reduced, and so on.
Different universities have different professional grade differences
With the popularization of parallel volunteering, many colleges and universities have cancelled the professional level difference, but some colleges and universities still retain this method this year. According to the " Admissions Regulations " published by each school, more than 20 universities have set up professional level differences this year.
For example, Sichuan Agricultural University, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Heilongjiang University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Jiangxi Normal University, Chengdu Medical University, Northeast Dianli University, Jimei University, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing University of Technology, Ningxia University, Shandong University of Technology, China Civil Aviation Flight College, etc.
In these colleges and universities, each university has different professional grades.
Some colleges and universities have a grade difference in each major, such as Ningxia University. Candidates whose files have been submitted to the school will be admitted according to the order in which the candidates fill in their professional volunteers.
And some universities have set up different professional level differences between different majors.
For example, Jimei University, the total score of professional volunteer difference is 4 points, that is, the difference between the first professional volunteer and other professional volunteers is 3 points, there is no difference between other professional volunteers, which is regarded as parallel volunteer, and the difference between other professional volunteers and transfer professional volunteers is 1 point.
When filling in their volunteers, candidates and parents must carefully read the admission policy of the reported school to see if there is a professional grade difference and what is the form of the grade difference. While fully considering the scores, they should also reasonably analyze the school and major to be selected. If the college clearly adopts the grade difference method for admission in the admissions charter, candidates should pay attention to the gradient between the majors when choosing a major to improve the admission probability.

Chengdu people gather to watch the US consulate police stop people from " looking too happy "
In response to the US closure of the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, China announced the closure of the US Consulate General in Chengdu on Friday.
On Saturday, the badge of the US consulate was removed, and on Sunday, a dark glass car left the consulate amid boos from passers-by.
On Sunday, many Chengdu people gathered in front of the US Consulate to take pictures, and those who had not been here were also driven by curiosity about current events to take a look.
A reporter from Agence France-Presse Chengdu Station also went to observe near the US Consulate in Chengdu. The news came back that there was an endless stream of curious people, and many parents took their children for a walk to watch the consulate, take pictures of buildings, or take selfies.
The consulate was surrounded by guards, and the police " corrected " people's behavior from time to time. They did not seem to allow any out-of-line behavior: a woman was stopped when she was about to sing a red song, and another guard confiscated a banner.
However, residents of a nearby residential building successfully pulled up a giant Chinese flag on their balcony and shouted slogans of support for China.
The US Consulate in Chengdu opened in 1985 and covers all consular-related affairs of the United States in southwestern China, especially the Tibet Autonomous Region.
A reporter from Agence France-Presse Chengdu Station said that the Chinese government's response to the United States was relatively restrained: Many Chinese asked the government to close the US consulate in Hong Kong online, but the official only said that " closing the US consulate in Chengdu is a necessary and legal response to the unreasonable behavior of the United States. "

Large-scale financial media action " Going to the Village Live to Watch Poverty Alleviation " -Today's News-Hunan Daily Network-Huasheng Online
Hunan Daily · New Hunan Client, July 25 (This reporter) On July 25, the large-scale financial media operation " Going to the Village Live to Watch Poverty Alleviation " hosted by the Financial Program Center of the Central Radio and Television General Station set out from Xuzhou, Jiangsu. Two caravans carrying 5G new media mobile cloud production and broadcasting system slowly drove out of the scene under the eyes of the guests at the scene.
General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out, " 2020 is a milestone year. We will build a moderately prosperous society in all respects and achieve the first centennial goal. 2020 is also the year of decisive victory in the decisive battle against poverty. "
The large-scale financial media action " Going to the Village Live to Watch Poverty Alleviation " is an important measure taken by the Financial Program Center of the Central Radio and Television General Station to cooperate with this major theme and do a good job in poverty alleviation propaganda.
The action will go into poverty alleviation villages in more than 20 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities across the country, dig fresh poverty alleviation stories, directly attack the great changes in the appearance of villages, and show how villagers break through the dilemma of survival and development and move towards the road of becoming rich.
The operation will last for more than three months.
The reporter started from Xuzhou and divided into two roads, all the way to the southwest line, passing through Anhui, Hubei, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangxi, Guizhou, Sichuan, Chongqing, Yunnan, Tibet and other places; the other way to the northwest line, passing through Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Hebei and other places, the journey exceeds 10,000 kilometers.
In terms of reporting format, " Going to the Village Live to Watch Poverty Alleviation " boldly integrated.
The economic development of the villages visited by the caravan will be broadcast through CCTV Financial Channel, CCTV Economic Voice, China Traffic Radio, and CCTV Financial New Media.
Among them, the live TV broadcast will be mainly completed in the noon news program " World Finance " of CCTV Financial Channel (premiere time: 12: 00-13: 00 from Monday to Sunday), and the prime news column " Economic Information Network " of CCTV Financial Channel will set up a poverty alleviation report column (premiere time: 20: 30-21: 30 from Monday to Sunday).
At the same time, the caravan will broadcast each village live on the CCTV Finance client for up to one hour. The audience can watch the live broadcast and participate in the lottery by downloading the CCTV Finance APP.
In terms of technology application and studio design, " Going to the Village Live to Watch Poverty Alleviation " has the courage to make breakthroughs and pioneered the " Outfield New Media Caravan. "
The car is equipped with a 5G new media mobile cloud production and broadcasting system, and uses 5G + 4K / 8K + AI technology to achieve an organic combination of online and offline, large and small screens, and TV broadcasting.
Equipped with Sanxun studio area, the studio area is converted from a container, 12 meters long, 2.55 meters wide and 3.98 meters high. The box adopts hydraulic automatic expansion structure, which can turn up to 120 degrees.
The studio area can also be expanded automatically, with an external expansion platform, covering an area of more than 50 square meters, which can meet the scene requirements of most programs.
At present, Dongchuan District of Kunming City is already hot in summer, and what is hotter than the weather is the poverty alleviation workshop next to the relocation site.
Lu Ling, an employee of Kunming Aisford Electronic Technology Company, said, " Now, as soon as you leave your home, you enter the factory to make money and take care of your family, thanks to the free vocational skills training of the trade union. "
Walking into the poverty alleviation workshop of electronic components processing in Tongdu Street, Dongchuan District, a busy picture came into view.
Lu Ling, who is in her 40s, is a single mother who takes care of her children alone and also takes care of elderly parents.
In her most difficult time, Dongchuan District Federation of Trade Unions helped to come up with ideas and find ways to " send charcoal in the snow " after running.
Since 2018, Lv Ling has enjoyed housing, school, social security, employment and other assistance policies and assistance funds issued by trade unions at all levels.
This year, her child has successfully graduated and found employment. She herself has a job and income after participating in skills training, and got out of trouble at the end of April.
It is reported that the special skills training project organized by Dongchuan District is part of the skills training work of Yunnan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions.
Based on the characteristics of the employees in difficulty in the relocation sites for poverty alleviation and resettlement in the district, the district will conduct in-depth investigations to understand the training needs and determine the types of training jobs. In the near future, it plans to train 450 electricians, welders, and pastry chefs.
Recently, Li Yi, an employee of the Agricultural Bank of Yunnan Menglian County Sub-branch, wrote a sincere thank-you letter to the County Federation of Trade Unions.
In her letter, she sincerely thanked the trade union for giving her a golden autumn grant from August 2013 to January 2017 to help her complete her studies.
In 2004, Li Yi's father died in a car accident, and her mother was included in the files of employees in difficulty. Since then, she has always enjoyed the care of the filing policy.
With the help of the local labor union, Li Yi successfully completed her studies.
Since 2016, 3,809 households have been lifted out of difficulties through institutional guarantees and precise assistance.
The successful relief of Lv Ling's family and Li Yi is a microcosm of the work of Yunnan trade unions to promote the relief of needy workers.
According to Duan Kaiyuan, a staff member of the Legal and Rights Protection Work Department of the Yunnan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the provincial general manager has strengthened the dynamic management of the files of employees in difficulty, promoted the normalization of filing work, and timely incorporated the difficult employees who meet the filing conditions into the assistance system; broaden the application channels for employees in difficulty, and use WeChat to open an online filing service platform for employees in difficulty to facilitate employees in difficulty to declare in a timely manner.
During the epidemic period, it was difficult to go out to work. In order to help the employees with difficulties in filing relieve the pressure of life, Yunnan Province has arranged a total of more than 13 million yuan to send warm funds. According to the standard of 2,000 yuan per household for employees with difficulties in filing at the national level and 1,500 yuan per household for employees with difficulties in filing at the provincial level, more than 6,000 households with difficulties in filing at the national level and more than 1,000 households with difficulties at the provincial level have implemented special warm condolence activities.
At the same time, the provincial general manager connects with various Internet recruitment platforms such as social security departments and Zhilian recruitment, pushes recruitment information to employees in difficulty, and provides employment consulting, employment guidance and other services.
