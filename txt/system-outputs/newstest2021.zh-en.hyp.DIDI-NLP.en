Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 26. Title: Turn outstanding returning migrant workers into a new force for rural revitalization
Zhang Xiong, 34, lives in Guoyuan Village, Meishan City, Sichuan Province. In 2010, he quit his job in Beijing with a monthly salary of tens of thousands and returned to his hometown to start a business.
After several years of hard work, the annual income of the grape-growing family farm he manages now exceeds one million yuan, and he has become a well-known leader in getting rich. He has also been selected into the village’s “two committees” team.
In recent years, inspired by a series of policies to support agriculture and benefit agriculture, such as national poverty alleviation and rural revitalization, more and more outstanding migrant workers like Zhang Xiong have chosen to return to their hometowns to start their own businesses, which has activated a pool of spring water in the countryside.
Sichuan, a province with a large population in western my country and a large labor exporting province, has implemented the “Excellent Migrant Workers Recruitment Training Project” in accordance with the situation. In 2019 alone, more than 8,000 village party branch secretaries were generated from the outstanding migrant workers to cultivate village reserve forces. There are 61,000 members and more than 20,000 party members have been recruited to provide a strong guarantee for winning the fight against poverty and implementing the strategy of rural revitalization.
Whether a well-off society or not a well-off society depends on the villagers.
Since the reform and opening up, a large number of young and middle-aged laborers in rural my country have gone out to work to increase their income.
However, objectively, it also led to the emergence of “hollowing” to varying degrees in rural areas, especially the weakening of rural grassroots organizations. The village party branch secretaries and party members all showed the characteristics of “one old and one low”, that is, aging, low education, and the village party The team leader is not strong, and the problem of non-compliance is prominent.
If rural talents and other factors have been flowing to the cities one-way, and the rural areas have been in a state of “blood loss” and “anemia” for a long time, revitalization is empty talk.
To attract back those migrant workers who are capable, conscious, and aspiring to serve their hometowns, and guide them to return to their hometowns to start businesses and become wealthy leaders. From among them, they can become party members and rural cadres and enrich the grassroots cadre team. This is to solve the problem of rural party members. A permanent solution that is not in contact with the grassroots party organizations.
Excellent migrant workers can be attracted back, but they must be retained and done well.
In recent years, Sichuan has begun to pay close attention to the party building of migrant workers. On the basis of strict selection criteria, it has established systems and mechanisms for outstanding migrant workers’ directional referral, service guarantee, training and promotion, and selection and use, so that they can improve their abilities and work. There is a guarantee of security, hope in life, truly taking root in the countryside, and a sense of accomplishment in starting a business.
This year is the final year of the decisive battle against poverty. To do a good job of linking poverty alleviation with rural revitalization, talents are the key factor.
Party committees and governments at all levels must attach great importance to the group of outstanding migrant workers who have returned to their hometowns, and through comprehensive measures, they will be transformed into a team and a new force that can be retained, fight, and cannot be taken away, so as to provide support for poverty alleviation and development in rural areas Strong organizational guarantee and talent support.

The capital’s natural ecology continues to improve, attracting wild animals to “settle” in the city
More than 500 species of wild animals in Beijing
News from our newspaper (Reporter Wang Bin) A reporter from the Beijing Youth Daily learned from the Municipal Landscaping Bureau that in recent years, as the capital’s natural ecological environment continues to improve, the types and numbers of wild animals have also continued to increase.
At present, the number of terrestrial spine wild animals inhabiting Beijing has increased to more than 500 species, including national first-class protected animals such as brown horse chicken and black stork, as well as national second-class protected animals such as goral, whooper swan, gray crane and mandarin duck.
Whether it is planted into the urban forests in the second ring road or the small wetlands embedded in the buildings, it not only brings the wildness of nature to the citizens of the capital, but also attracts wild animals to “settle” in the city.
In midsummer, the Songshan National Nature Reserve, located in the Yanshan Mountains in the northwest of Yanqing District, is full of vitality.
A raccoon was playing leisurely by the mountain stream, and two dog badgers were fighting with each other on the side.
Looking back, a wild boar couldn’t help the “thorn scratch” on its body, and was rubbing hard against the bark. According to Hu Qiaoli, Director of the Management Office of Songshan National Nature Reserve, as of the end of 2019, in this green sea with a total area of more than 6,200 hectares, there are living in this green sea, including the national first-class protected animal golden eagle and the national second-class protected animal spoon chicken and goral. Of the 178 species of wild animals in the city, nearly one-third of the city’s wild animal species can be seen here.
“In Songshan, wild animals are the real ‘owners’, and our staff can only be regarded as people’s ‘bodyguards’ at best.”
Hu Qiaoli said that in order to understand the situation of wildlife in the reserve, there are more than 30 professional patrol team members every day to patrol along 16 carefully formulated protection routes, and there will be a “turning circle” every month. I walked almost the entire reserve in a whole day.
“During inspections, not only check and record the status of biodiversity, but also check the installation of artificial bird nests, rescue injured wild animals, install field infrared cameras and so on.”
More than 200 infrared cameras have been installed in Songshan National Nature Reserve to record the living conditions of wild animals in the forest.
Hu Qiaoli introduced that with the continuous enrichment of biodiversity in the reserve in the past few years, more and more wild animals have appeared in the lens. Ocelots, raccoon and pig badgers have become “resident guests” and the national second-level protected animals goral. The “appearance rate” is also getting higher and higher.
Zhang Zhiming, director of the Wildlife and Wetland Protection Division of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Landscaping, introduced that the number of terrestrial spinal wild animals in Beijing has increased from 461 species in 1994 to more than 500 now. The types and numbers of wild animals in Beijing have continued to increase in recent years. .
The appearance of wild animals in cities is becoming more common, which is closely related to the continuous upgrade of the capital city’s greenery in recent years.
In particular, the new round of afforestation and greening of one million acres started in 2018, which proposes to reshape the urban ecological environment, enhance the ecological function of forest land and green space, and highlight the concept of “near nature”.
In the planning, we strive to achieve interconnection and interaction with the surrounding green areas, so that wild animals can “visit relatives and friends”. The trees planted are also honey and food plants that animals love.
Black soil “plants” agricultural modernization-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 26, report title: Black soil “plants” agricultural modernization
In midsummer, two spraying planes passed by the 10,000 mu high-yield demonstration field in the second operation station of the fifth management zone of Youyi Farm, forming two white lines. The green field was planted with black rice seedlings as the “first in the world” A few big characters are particularly eye-catching.
The station chief Kong Lingqiang said that this kind of aircraft can spray chemicals on more than 6,000 acres of cultivated land a day, and the efficiency is about 8 times that of drones and hundreds of times that of labor.
This farm is located in Youyi County, Heilongjiang Province, my country’s largest grain-producing province. From the sound of rice cutting in the past to the sound of rumbling motors in the past, traditional Chinese farming and farms have undergone transformation on this black soil belt.
In addition to airplanes, satellites are also used in the modern agricultural production of Youyi Farm.
Kong Lingqiang introduced that on the one hand, they use satellite remote sensing technology to achieve precise fertilization, reduce agricultural input and reduce pollution; on the other hand, satellite navigation technology can improve the level of standardized farm machinery field operations.
During this year’s rice production process, the farm expanded the operating area of the satellite-navigation unmanned rice transplanting technology from 3,000 acres last year to 30,000 acres.
This technology makes the planting of seedlings more uniform, maximizes the use of sunlight and arable land resources, and saves 16 yuan in labor costs per mu.
The farm tried new technologies such as informatization and intelligence in agricultural production, and formed the largest agricultural machinery group in my country from the ground to the sky.
According to statistics, the total number of agricultural machinery on the farm is 49,000 units (pieces), and the comprehensive field mechanization rate reaches 99.8%.
Agricultural machinery operations achieve 100% GPS satellite navigation, 100% precision seeding in dry fields, and 100% high-horsepower locomotive operations in dry fields.
“Green agriculture, smart agriculture, and digital agriculture are the path-finding directions for agricultural modernization.”
Said Liu Hualian, director of the Youyi Farm.
The key to agricultural modernization lies in scientific and technological progress.
In recent years, Heilongjiang Agricultural Reclamation, represented by farms, has played a leading role in the demonstration and leadership of modern large-scale agriculture “aircraft carrier”, and has initially established a modern agricultural industrial system dominated by large-scale planting, standardized production, and industrialized management.
In the suburbs of Youyi County, there is an Agricultural Machinery Expo Park covering an area of 350,000 square meters.
More than 140 agricultural machinery and tools introduced and used by Heilongjiang Agricultural Reclamation over the years are exhibited here.
These agricultural machinery and farms have witnessed the development of my country’s agricultural modernization.

At around 4 pm on July 25, Fu Kunbao wore muddy rubber shoes and went from the front room to the back room, busy packing things back and forth with his wife Zhou Yan.
“After receiving a call from the village cadre to transfer, I was still stalking the grass in the field.”
Fu Kunbao said that he has transferred more than 60 acres of land and planted rice, and he is now growing well. “I took the medicine yesterday, and I haven’t cleaned all the tools.”
Fu Kunbao pointed to the pesticide sprayer placed in the corner, “No one wants their home to be flooded, let’s leave a small home for everyone.”
In order to cope with the continued high water pressure and possible heavy rainfall in Chaohu Lake, Hefei City in Anhui Province is preparing to use the Jiangkouhe Lake United polder flood diversion storage facility where Fu Kunbao’s home is located on the 26th.
Jiangkouhe Lake United polder is located in Feixi County, next to the Chaohu Dike.
There are thousands of villagers involved in Yandian Township and Sanhe Township who need to be transferred.
As of 16:00 on the 25th, the water level of Chaohu Lake, my country’s fifth largest freshwater lake, remained at a high level of 13.2 meters, 0.7 meters above the guaranteed water level.
Fu Kunbao’s kitchen was clean and tidy. There was a pot of pumpkin head vegetables on the table, and there were eggs and some stewed vegetables in the refrigerator.
“I didn’t expect to move, the water in Jiangkou River looks good at the moment.”
Zhou Yan said that the house is a bungalow, and some large objects have not yet been decided where to put them.
“Clean up your valuables first. Large items such as refrigerators and TV sets can be temporarily placed at neighbors or relatives on high ground.”
Village leader Wang Liwen gave Fu Kunbao an idea.
Wang Liwen was responsible for the transfer and resettlement of 13 villagers, and notified each household to confirm the resettlement plan for each.
The nearest resettlement site to Fu Kunbao’s home is Su Xiao Primary School in Yandian Township, about 2 kilometers away.
In addition to the big items, the more than 1,000 catties of food and some newly bought furniture were also a headache for Fu Kunbao and his wife.
“The food is going to be dragged to the relative’s house, and the furniture can’t be moved.”
The couple negotiated, put a stool under the newly bought bed, and raised the bed by about half a meter.
At 6 o’clock in the afternoon, Fu Kunbao began to use a tricycle to transport things to his relatives’ home, and Zhou Yan continued to clean up at home.
After 11 o’clock in the evening, the couple looked around at home, turned on the switch, and prepared to go to the resettlement site.
“I hope the water will withdraw soon.”
Fu Kunbao said.
At 9:30 a.m. on July 26, the reporter saw at the Jiangkouhe Lake United polder site that the local area had made various preparations before flood diversion.
Zhang Jike and Lin Xiaozhai team up to support muscular teenagers-Xinhuanet
Sports youth hot-blooded competition show “Sports Boys” officially landed on Hunan Satellite TV on July 11.
Sports leader Zhang Jike and sports assistant Lin Xiaozhai cross-border on the same stage. Lin Dan and Fu Yuanhui commented on their own styles, and the hard core of the “colossal” force pulling device made the show more “burning”.

Among them, the “strong conflict” comes from Super A sports student Qiao Wenyi. He openly provoke Xu Zhibin, who is known as the “Beautiful Man” on the track before the game. He choked that Xu Zhibin’s appearance conditions should be sung and danced, and even released “lost, don’t cry your makeup”.
The remarks made the teenagers and sports leaders on the field take a breath.
The “strong confrontation” is more like a fight between the gods. Sun Jianqi, known as the “big devil”, meets the equally powerful Zhang Xindong and staged a strong confrontation.
And their identities are unexpected. Sun Jianqi is an actor who loves fitness, and Zhang Xindong is a retired special forces member and three-time Warrior Medal winner.
At the beginning of the game, the two teenagers tried their best to quickly pull out the small pole. The long-lasting confrontation on the big pole made the audience sweat for them.
In the tense situation, Zhang Jike, as one of the sports leaders of “Sports Boy”, also watched the game seriously.
In the comment section, he was also very careful, patiently encouraged the teenager who lost the game, and helped every mistake in the process of resuming the game.
Sports assistant Lin Xiaozhai is a fancy assist. She makes no secret of her appreciation for the youths who are online.
When I learned about the daily training of sports teenagers who are overloaded, I admire them even more.
Lin Dan and Fu Yuanhui, who are also the sports leaders, have their own styles. One is a “prophet” of the calm and relaxed school, and the other is a “preliminary girl” who uses a smile to dispel the tension.
In addition, Jike Junyi and Liu Ye, as sports assistants, also created a lot of hilarious topics around sports teenagers.

General news: U.S. unilateralism undermines relations between the two countries, international public opinion supports China’s counter-control against the US-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26. Xinhua News Agency’s foreign correspondents report: On the morning of July 24, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs notified the U.S. Embassy in China that China had decided to withdraw its approval for the establishment and operation of the US Consulate General in Chengdu. The consulate ceased all business and activities to make specific requirements.
International public opinion believes that the unilateral measures taken by the United States have caused serious problems in Sino-US relations. China has responded to the unreasonable provocations by the US and it is legitimate and necessary to take countermeasures.
Andrés Borks, director of the China Studies Center of the Institute of International Studies at the University of Chile, said that the unilateral measures of the United States have destroyed the bridge of understanding between the people of China and the United States, and caused a crisis in the relationship between the two major powers.
China’s notification to the United States to close its consulate in Chengdu is a countermeasure to the unilateral measures of the United States and conforms to diplomatic practice.
Patricio Giusto, a professor at the Catholic University of Argentina and director of the Argentina-China Research Center, believes that the above-mentioned Chinese decision is a legitimate and necessary countermeasure against the previous provocation of the United States, and is not aimed at ordinary Americans.
The United States tried to use pressure on China to cover up its ineffective response to the COVID-19 and divert the attention of the American people.
Banbang Suryono, chairman of the Asian Innovation Research Center, an Indonesian think tank, said that the United States has adopted a provocative diplomatic stance, which has caused serious problems in Sino-US relations, and the relations between the two countries are facing severe challenges.
China’s notification of the United States to close its consulate in Chengdu is a normal countermeasure and conforms to diplomatic practice. It not only reflects China’s principled position of resolutely safeguarding its own interests, but also reflects the rationality and integrity of China’s diplomacy.
Francis Semwenza, a current affairs commentator in Tanzania, said that China’s above decision is a legitimate and necessary response to the provocation of the United States.
If Sino-US relations are to return to normal, the US should take the initiative to improve relations with China and stop interfering in China’s internal affairs.
The United States should focus on how to achieve economic and political win-win with China, and how to benefit the two peoples and the entire international community.
Ali Youssef, executive director of the Arab-Chinese Youyi Association Federation based in Sudan, said that the countermeasures China was forced to take were a legitimate and necessary response to the unreasonable actions of the United States, and conformed to the basic norms of international law and international relations, as well as diplomacy. Convention.
Previously, the US request to close the Chinese Consulate General in Houston seriously violated international law and the basic norms of international relations.
It is hoped that the US will revoke the previous relevant decisions and create necessary conditions for the return of bilateral relations to normal.
Singapore’s “Lianhe Zaobao” published an editorial saying that the greater strategic intention of the United States is to contain China and prevent China from continuing to rise.
In the face of the United States’ pressing steadily, although China is very unwilling to see Sino-US relations continue to deteriorate, it has to take countermeasures.

The Far East Helicopter Manufacturing Plant of Progressive Aerospace Corporation has undergone transformation and refurbishment, and its national-level testing and improvement work will be completed before October 2022.
According to Russian experts who understand the above-mentioned upgrade work, the “predecessor” of the “Super Alligator”-Wuzhi ka-52 was officially installed in November 2011. This model has exposed some weaknesses in use. It is to “make up for the shortcomings.”
According to the report, compared with the Ka-52, the Ka-52M will partially adopt new protective materials that will not increase the weight. Its pilot cockpit will be reinforced and equipped with new equipment to resist missile attacks, thereby increasing the probability of survival on the battlefield; the assembly power is greater. In order to power more complex airborne electronic equipment; the photoelectric system has been upgraded to detect and identify targets on the battlefield that are farther apart; the new light multi-purpose missile, which is equipped with main attack armored combat vehicles and reinforced concrete fortifications, has a range Up to 20 kilometers, the range of similar missiles used by Russia’s active military helicopters is approximately doubled; its defensive weapons and communication equipment will be as common as the Mi-28NM armed helicopters that can attack air targets, making related maintenance simple and economical.
In addition, Ka-52M will have more advanced electronic guidance systems, weapon targeting systems and navigation equipment.
Russian experts also said that it is worth noting that Ka-52M will be equipped with communication equipment to communicate with drones, so as to obtain real-time information transmitted by nearby drones in the air, such as displaying drone footage on the cockpit screen of the helicopter. image.
According to the plan, the pilots of the Ka-52M can directly control the drones that cooperate with them, thereby improving the pilot’s grasp of the battlefield situation and the guidance of long-range missiles.
According to Russian media reports, Russian Deputy Defense Minister Krivoruchko stated in December last year that the Russian Defense Ministry plans to purchase more than 110 WuzhiKa-52Ms by 2027.

Recently, General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized when visiting the Siping Battle Memorial Hall: “It is necessary for 1.4 billion people and more than 90 million party members, especially leading cadres at all levels, to learn the history of the Communist Party of China and the history of New China.”
Studying the history of the party and the history of New China is a compulsory course for party members and cadres to keep in mind their original aspirations and keep their mission in mind. They must draw rich nourishment from them, cultivate a strong sense of family and country, and walk the long march of the new era.
A magnificent history of the Party and New China records the hard work and glorious course of the Communist Party of China since its birth, and demonstrates the faith and loyalty that the Communists have forged with their lives and blood, and the original intention and mission that they will always adhere to.
History is the best textbook. For party members and cadres, party history and New China history are the brightest chapters in this textbook.

These great spirits precipitated by history have provided our party with a powerful spiritual incentive to overcome various risks and challenges on the way forward. It is a precious spiritual wealth that cannot be defeated, washed away, or taken away.
The process of studying party history and Chinese history is a process of reviewing these spirits and shaping one’s own spirit. We must consciously take the lofty spirit of the revolutionary ancestors as the mirror, stick to the spiritual home of the Communists, and build a firm foundation for advancing the great cause and realizing the great dream.

“The Oasis Beyond the Great Wall” to pursue the poetic “Yellow River Dream” - chinanews.com
(China’s Poverty Reduction Story) “The Oasis Beyond the Great Wall” Pursuing the Poetic “Yellow River Dream”
China News Service, Yinchuan, July 26 (Yang Di) “The Nine Curves of the Yellow River are tens of thousands of li sands, and the waves and wind rush from the end of the world.”
The Yellow River, which aroused countless literati’s lofty passions, gave birth to the beautiful and fertile Ningxia Plain. Today, Ningxia, which has the reputation of “Stopping the Yangtze River”, is adhering to the concept of “ecology first, green development” and pursuing the poetic “Yellow River Dream”.
The “Bibo Dream” of River’s Clear Water
“The Yellow River in the world enriches Ningxia”, the Yellow River flows through Ningxia for 397 kilometers and is the “mother river” for nurturing a party.
However, with the rapid advancement of industrialization and urbanization, the development and utilization of rivers and lakes are unbalanced with management and protection, and chaos such as excessive sewage discharge, lake reclamation, and infringement of waters have emerged, resulting in black and odorous water, excessive water quality, dirty environment, and ecological degradation.
Now, Ningxia is promoting the restoration of diverse water ecology and working hard to make the Yellow River beautiful and clear.
Water control must start from the source.
In Yinchuan, Ningxia, the local government adopted the method of “standard improvement + pollution control + strict management”. All sewage in the industrial parks were treated in a centralized manner. The urban sewage treatment plants all achieved Class A discharge standards. The black and odorous water bodies in the urban built-up areas were basically eliminated, and the application was successfully declared. The third batch of China’s black and smelly water demonstration cities.
In addition, Ningxia fully implemented the river and lake chief system in 2017, and now it has achieved full coverage of the five-level river and lake chief responsibility system for districts, cities, counties and villages, and long patrolling of rivers and lakes has become the norm.
64-year-old Gu Jincheng lives in a village by the Yellow River. He has witnessed the changes in the Yellow River: “The previous water smelled like a smell, but after the rectification, the smell disappeared.”
Gu Jincheng said that the ecological environment has improved and his life has become more comfortable. Now he often walks by the Yellow River with his family and feels the blue water and blue sky.
The “Wetland Dream” of sand gulls flying and gathering
Birds, green trees, plank roads, clear water... The beauty of Fan Zhongyan’s “Sand Gulls flying and gathering” has become a reality in the Yellow River Wetland Park in Yinchuan, Ningxia.
The Yellow River flows through Ningxia, forming river wetlands, lake wetlands, marsh wetlands and other wetlands along the way, which play an important role in promoting the rational use of water resources and the water ecological balance. It has also become an important international bird migration channel.
Since 2009, relevant departments of Ningxia have invested about 3.45 billion yuan in wetland protection projects. At present, Yinchuan wetland covers an area of 19,200 hectares, with a wetland protection rate of 78.5%. There are nearly 200 natural lakes and marsh wetlands. There are 5 national wetland parks, 1 national urban wetland park, 6 autonomous region-level wetland parks, and 8 municipal-level parks.
Lu Jinhu, deputy director of the Yinchuan Wetland Conservation Center, told reporters that wetland protection has increased biodiversity, which is particularly evident in birds. “The relict gull is an endangered bird and there are only more than 20,000 in the world. Among them, the Yinchuan Wetland There are more than 2,000 inhabitants.”
At the same time, Ningxia has delineated a 500-meter red line for wetland protection areas on both sides of the Yinchuan section of the Yellow River in accordance with the law, stipulating that except for public welfare projects, no unit or individual may conduct development, construction and business activities within the protected area.
Zhao Shaoyong, deputy director of Yinchuan Water Conservancy Service Center, introduced that through pollution source treatment, comprehensive improvement of river and lake ecology, and terminal wetland construction, 100% of the water quality of Ningxia’s nine main drainage ditches into the Yellow River has reached Class IV standards. “Now the water is clear. The fish swam and the flowers bloomed.”
“Drinking Water Dream” for Inclusive People’s Livelihood
Yinchuan City in Ningxia used to have the title of “embarrassing”: the only city along the Yellow River that “guarded the water shortage of the Yellow River”.
Since 2010, Yinchuan City has been facing the problem of continuous water shortage during the peak summer period. The pain of water shortage in the past ten years has become a painful summer experience for many high-floor residents. Under the current situation that a large area of groundwater over-exploitation funnel area has formed under the limit of mining and urban underground, water shortage has become a problem that plagues Yinchuan.
Thanks to the improvement of the water quality of the Yellow River, drinking purified water from the Yellow River has become a good way to solve the drinking water problems of local residents.
Ding Ming, deputy director of Yinchuan Water Affairs Bureau, introduced that in order to improve the water demand of urban and rural residents in Yinchuan, Ningxia started the water supply project of the West Line of Yinchuan Metropolitan Area at an appropriate time to replace the original underground water source with high-quality Yellow River water.
“On December 29, 2019, the water supply project officially supplied water to the three districts of Yinchuan City. In 2020, residents of Minning Town and Helan County will also drink water from the Yellow River.”
Ding Ming said that the Yinchuan Water Conservancy Department will take overall consideration of the transformation of the integration of regional rural drinking water and urban water supply. “In the next step, we will integrate all the scattered water supply points in rural areas and connect them to the west line water supply project. Integrated urban and rural water supply.”

The U.S. launches an anti-subsidy investigation against China for the first time with the “undervaluation of the renminbi exchange rate”
In response to the recent announcement of the US Department of Commerce, it decided to initiate an anti-dumping and countervailing investigation against cable ties (cable ties) products originating in China, and to initiate an investigation on the “RMB exchange rate undervaluation” project.
The Ministry of Commerce of China pointed out that this is the first time that the United States has initiated an investigation into the so-called “RMB undervaluation” project in an anti-subsidy case. China firmly opposes this.
China’s Ministry of Commerce issued a press release on the evening of the 23rd, stating that China implements a managed floating exchange rate system based on market supply and demand, with reference to a basket of currencies, and that the market plays a decisive role in the formation of the exchange rate.
The press release emphasizes that overall, the RMB exchange rate is at a reasonable equilibrium level and has not been undervalued.
Since 2005, the renminbi has appreciated against the US dollar by more than 17%.
According to data released by the Bank for International Settlements, from the beginning of 2005 to May 2020, the nominal effective exchange rate of the renminbi appreciated by 38%, and the real effective exchange rate appreciated by 49%. It is the strongest currency in the G20 economy and the largest appreciation in the world. One of the currencies.
The Ministry of Commerce pointed out that the exchange rate issue is beyond the competence of members to conduct countervailing investigations in accordance with the rules of the World Trade Organization.
The United States revised its regulations in February this year to conduct anti-subsidy investigations on the exchange rates of other countries. It has been suspected of violating WTO rules and has been opposed by many quarters.
According to the press release, even in accordance with US regulations, the content of the applicant’s complaint contains a large number of errors and does not possess the necessary elements for countervailing such as financial assistance, benefit granting, and specificity.
China urges the US to abide by existing international rules and stop countervailing investigations into the so-called “undervaluation of the RMB exchange rate.”
Affected by the increased tension in Sino-US relations, the offshore and onshore RMB exchange rates against the US dollar fell sharply on the 22nd, and both fell below the US$1 to RMB 7.0 mark.
Whether the US Department of Commerce’s move is intended to force the renminbi to rise is worthy of attention.
The spot exchange rate of the RMB against the US dollar rose above the 7.0 mark on the 23rd to close at 6.9961.
The central parity of the renminbi against the US dollar under official regulation was lowered by 17 basis points to 6.9938 on the 24th.

Lewis family: John Lewis is a fighter “fighting for the weakest”
The US Congressman, civil rights fighter John Lewis (John Lewis) was remembered as a fighter “fighting for the weakest” at a memorial service held for him on Saturday (July 25).
Lewis’ public memorial service has been held in Alabama since Saturday.
There were two memorial services on the first day.
At a public memorial service at Troy University in Alabama on Saturday, Lewis’ five siblings and a grandson talked about him as a caring, fearless, family-oriented man.
Henry “Grant” Lewis, Lewis’s youngest brother, said at the meeting: “He has devoted his life to helping others.”
Samuel Lewis said his mother had warned John “Don’t make trouble, don’t make trouble.”
He added that John didn’t heed his mother’s warning. He said: “We all know that John always gets into trouble, always makes trouble, but that’s because he insists on the right thing. That’s a good trouble.”
Lewis’ brothers and sisters reminded the people at the memorial service that John’s most famous argument was to create “good troubles”, that is, as long as it was for justice, he would not shy away from provoking trouble.
John once applied to Troy University in Troy, Alabama, where he was born, but Troy University, an all-white school at the time, rejected his application.
John Lewis, who preached the gospel to chickens on his farm as a child, eventually earned a degree in religion and philosophy from Fisk University.
Many years later, the University of Troy awarded Lewis an honorary doctorate.
Senator Doug Jones from Alabama said that the current protesters are “protesting peacefully and non-violently,” just like Lewis did in the civil rights movement.
Jones said: “Even if President Trump overturned a boat and described all protesters as thugs, he was wrong.
The protesters are patriots, and they want the United States to move towards a more equal country. “
A series of six-day events to commemorate Lewis will culminate at the funeral in Georgia this week.
On Saturday, Lewis’s coffin was parked at a public memorial service at Troy University. People came to pay their respects to the pioneer of the civil rights movement.
Later on Saturday, a private ceremony paid tribute to him in a small church in Selma, Alabama, followed by a public memorial service.
On Sunday, Lewis’ body will pass the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma.
In 1965, he and the demonstrators demanding the right to vote for blacks were beaten up by the Alabama police in front of this bridge, and the police also released tear gas on the demonstrators.
Lewis was almost killed at the time.
This day will be called “Bloody Sunday” in the future.
Lewis’ remains will be transported to Montgomery, the capital of Alabama.
Mayor Steven Reed encouraged people to line up on the sidewalk to complete the final journey with Lewis.
At the same time, officials require the public to wear masks and maintain social distancing when participating in activities.
Alabama Governor Kay Ivey ordered that the flag be lowered at half-mast on Saturday and Sunday to commemorate Lewis.
During the nearly week-long commemorative event, Lewis’s body will be placed briefly in the Alabama State Capitol in Montgomery, the Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta, and the US Capitol in Washington for the public to express their condolences.
Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced last week that people can go to the US Capitol on Monday and Tuesday to pay tribute to Lewis.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, public events commemorating Lewis will be held outdoors.

Hoh Xil Tibetan antelope enters migration season-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, July 25 (Reporter Wang Jinjin) The reporter learned from the Wudaoliang Protection Station, Hoh Xil Management Office, Yangtze Source Park, Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration, that monitoring showed that Tibetan antelopes had migrated to the Zhuonai Lake area in the hinterland of Hoh Xil to give birth. The littering is gradually ending, and the cubs are beginning to return to their original habitat.
Monitoring pictures near the Wudaoliang Conservation Station showed that on July 25, about 40 female Tibetan antelopes led 3 Tibetan antelope cubs through 3002 kilometers of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway and the Wudaoliang North Bridge on the Qinghai-Tibet Railway. The Tibetan antelopes have begun to relocate. .
Experts have analyzed that in recent years, the number of Tibetan antelope cubs in the relocating sheep herd accounts for one-quarter to one-fifth of the total number of Tibetan antelope flocks.
Lian Xinming, an associate researcher at the Northwest Plateau Institute of Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, said: “In the early stage of the migration, Tibetan antelopes face a higher risk of predation, so the number of cubs in the flock will be relatively small, and there may even be no cubs.”
According to the statistics of the Kekexili Management Office of the Yangtze River Source Park of the Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration, the number of Tibetan antelopes returning is generally increasing year by year. In 2019, the number of Tibetan antelopes returning was 4860, an increase of 338 from 2018.
Lian Xinming said: “It is expected that the relocation of Tibetan antelopes this year will end in early September, and the number of relocated Tibetan antelopes is expected to continue to increase.”
Tibetan antelope is a national first-class protected animal.
At the end of May every year, Tibetan antelopes from Qinghai Sanjiangyuan, Qiangtang in Tibet, Altun Mountain in Xinjiang and other places go to Zhuonai Lake in the hinterland of Hoh Xil to give birth.
Wu Xiaomin, a Tibetan antelope conservation expert in my country and a researcher at the Shanxi Institute of Zoology (Northwest Institute of Endangered Animals), said: “Tibetan antelope migration is a process in which the female Tibetan antelope returns to the habitat with the cubs one after another after the female Tibetan antelope has finished giving birth. The relocation groups of the larvae are relatively large, but then the Tibetan antelopes will return to their respective habitats according to different geographic populations and along different paths.”
In order to ensure the safe relocation of the Tibetan antelope herd, the reporter learned that the Kekexili Management Office of the Yangtze River Source Park of the Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration has arranged staff to continue to carry out video surveillance and patrols in the main relocation area.
If a flock of Tibetan antelopes is found trying to cross the highway, the mountain patrol team will conduct temporary traffic control as soon as possible to allow the flock to safely pass through the wildlife passage and ensure that it is as little as possible to be disturbed by humans on the way back.

In addition, people who work in a high-temperature environment should appropriately supplement drinks containing potassium, magnesium and other elements.
In summer, the days are long and the nights are short, the temperature is high, the body’s metabolism is strong, and the consumption is also high, and it is easy to feel tired.
Adequate sleep can relax the brain and body systems, which is not only conducive to work and study, but also a measure to prevent heat stroke.
Experts say that the best bedtime is from 22:00 to 23:00, and the best time to wake up is from 5:30 to 6:30.
Be careful not to lie under the air-conditioning vents and electric fans during sleep to avoid air-conditioning diseases and thermal colds.

University of Australia develops new drug that is expected to treat blood vessel blockage caused by COVID-19-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Sydney, July 26 (Reporter Chen Yu) Researchers at Monash University in Australia are developing a new drug that helps prevent heart disease and stroke, and hope that this drug can be used to treat blocked blood vessels caused by COVID-19.
Researchers have found that before a heart attack or stroke, an enzyme in platelets accelerates platelet clotting.
As a result, they developed a drug that can temporarily inhibit platelet clotting, thereby avoiding clogging of blood vessels and preventing heart disease and stroke.
The researchers said that this drug will only inhibit the clotting effect of platelets when there are signs of heart disease or stroke.
Since studies have shown that similar blood vessel blockage is one of the main causes of death in severely ill patients with new coronary disease, researchers hope that this drug can be used in the treatment of such severely ill patients in the future.
At present, the drug has achieved good results in animal model experiments, and researchers are preparing for the next phase of human clinical trials.
The research results have been published in the American journal Science and Translational Medicine a few days ago.
He became the first spectator to enter the CBA league after allowing spectators to watch the match live.

China News Service, Hami, Xinjiang, July 26 Title: Xinjiang is deeply plowing the “sunflower field” and making good use of clean energy
More than 6000 pentagonal heliostats, each 48 square meters, are neatly arranged in circles, like a silver “sunflower field”, which rotates with the sun and reflects the sunlight to the 200-meter-high heat-absorbing tower in the center to realize power generation .
The reporter saw this scene on the 25th at the CLP Engineering Hami molten salt tower solar thermal power plant in Naomaohu Town, Yiwu County, Hami City, Xinjiang.
“The so-called molten salt tower solar thermal power generation is to concentrate sunlight through the mirror surface to the heat absorption tower to form heat energy, and then convert the heat energy into electrical energy through traditional power generation technology.”
Zhang Yong, deputy general manager of CLP Hami Solar Thermal Power Generation Co., Ltd., said that its design principle is similar to that of solar cookers used in rural areas in Northwest China, which must gather sunlight.
The power plant started construction in October 2017 and was connected to the grid at the end of last year. It covers an area of 6,600 mu and plans to install 14,500 heliostats.
“Compared with traditional solar power generation technology, its biggest advantage is that it can store the concentrated heat energy and generate electricity at night.”
Zhang Yong said that the 13-hour heat storage system configured in the project can keep the generator set in continuous and stable operation without being affected by changes in light; it can also quickly participate in grid peak shaving according to the demand of grid load peaks and valleys.
After the project is fully completed, it can achieve an annual power generation of 198 million kWh, save more than 60,000 tons of standard coal each year, reduce more than 60 tons of sulfur dioxide, more than 60 tons of nitrogen oxides, about 20 tons of dust, and more than 150,000 tons of carbon dioxide. Provide a steady stream of clean energy for the local area.
In addition, there is another silver “sunflower field” in the Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park in Hami City.
The Hami Fuguang Solar Photovoltaic Power Station covers an area of more than 2,300 acres. The 714 power generation equipment that has been built also follow the sun and always keep the sunlight at a 90-degree right angle to the surface of the concentrating panel.
“We use dual-axis tracking concentrating power generation technology. Through unified integrated control, all power generation equipment will adjust the angle according to the sun’s height to maintain power generation efficiency.”
Duan Mengqi, the station’s head, said that in good weather conditions, the power generation technology can increase the efficiency of conventional photovoltaic power generation by about 20%.
In the first half of this year, the power station has achieved power generation of more than 7 million kWh, supplementing local electricity demand.
Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park is currently a photovoltaic industry demonstration park with the largest monomer scale and the most complete types of photovoltaic modules in Xinjiang. There are 38 photovoltaic power generation projects in total, with a total installed capacity of 820,000 kilowatts.
The power generation completed in the first half of this year exceeded 110 million kWh, an increase of 6% over the same period in 2019.
Hami is one of the regions with the best solar energy resources in China.
The annual average total solar radiation is more than 6,200 megajoules per square meter, and the annual sunshine hours are about 3,200 hours.
In recent years, the city has vigorously developed the photovoltaic industry and planted “sunflower fields.”
A solar power generation scale with installed capacity of more than 2.5 million kilowatts has been built. In the first half of this year, the city’s photovoltaic power generation capacity exceeded 1.4 billion kWh, an increase of about 14% year-on-year.
Currently, there are more than 330 grid-connected photovoltaic power stations in Xinjiang, with an installed capacity of over 10 million kilowatts.
It is estimated that this year’s photovoltaic power generation will reach 15 billion kWh, which can replace more than 6 million tons of standard coal.
Police report details of “female college students who lost contact during a trip to Qinghai”, search and rescue work continues-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, July 26 (Reporter Wang Jinjin and Zhouzhe) Recently, “a female college student lost contact after traveling to Golmud, Qinghai” has attracted the attention of netizens.
The Public Security Bureau of Golmud City, Haixi Mongolian-Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Qinghai Province reported on the 26th that Huang Moumou, a student from a certain university in Nanjing, is still out of contact. Police in many places are going deep along the route where Huang Moumou lost contact and are actively seeking work.
On July 10, 2020, the Public Security Detachment of Golmud City, Haixi Prefecture received a notice from a superior that Huang Moumou, a student from a certain university in Nanjing, took the Z164 train from Nanjing to Golmud on July 5 and was in Yushu, Qinghai Province on July 9. The mobile phone in the southwestern area of Qingshui River in the Sonangdajie Protection Station in Qumalai County of the Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture was turned off and lost connection, and asked for assistance in finding it.
According to the investigation by the Public Security Bureau of Golmud, Huang Moumou entered Qinghai Province at 1954 on July 6, and arrived in Golmud at 4 on the 7th.
At 8 o’clock on the same day, Huang Moumou, a missing person, took a taxi from the Yellow River Hotel in Golmud to G109 National Road, and arrived at the Hoh Xilison Dage Protection Station at 12 o’clock. The taxi driver returned alone. Huang Moumou returned at 15:00 on the 7th. Arrived at the Qingshuihe area near the Sonang Dje Protection Station until 18:00 on the 9th and shut down in the area.

If Huang XX is found at the checkpoint, immediately contact the Public Security Bureau of Golmud City.
According to the latest situation, at 1:00 am on July 26, the Golmud City Public Security Bureau organized rescue forces to carry rescue equipment and went to the Qinghai-Tibet Highway Non-freezing Spring Protection Station and Sonan Dage Protection Station to search, and actively cooperated with Sichuan police and Tibet police. The Nanjing police got in touch and started work together. At present, the search and rescue work is still continuing.
The local police hope that if the majority of netizens and all walks of life have relevant clues, they will provide them to the Golmud police and Nanjing Jiangning police in a timely manner, so as to find the missing person Huang Moumou as soon as possible.
At the same time, relevant experts reminded that tourists should be standardized, rational, and civilized during outdoor activities, always pay attention to roadside warning signs, do not risk entering no-man’s land, and call the police in time when encountering emergencies.
U.S. media uncovered the truth about the US unprovoked request for China to close the Consulate General in Houston - chinanews.com

The US media revealed the truth about the US unprovoked request for China to close the Consulate General in Houston
On the 24th, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs notified the U.S. Embassy in China that the Chinese side decided to revoke the establishment and operation of the U.S. Consulate General in Chengdu, and put forward specific requirements for the consulate general to suspend all business and activities, as a response to the US’s sudden request for the Chinese side to close on the 21st Countermeasures taken by the Consulate General in Houston.
This behavior of the US government has aroused many concerns, and its political motives have been questioned by foreign media and scholars.
Why is China required to close the Consulate General?
Many foreign media said that it is not clear why the United States chose the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, but for the purpose of this move, the foreign media bluntly stated: for the general election.
CNN reported on the 23rd that the US request of China to close the Consulate General in Houston has caused people to question its political motives.
The article stated that the US government’s disastrous response to the COVID-19 has caused President Trump’s pre-election poll support rate to be relatively low.
White House officials said in private that the tough strategy adopted against China was to save Trump’s approval rate and also to shift the responsibility of the White House’s failure to respond to the epidemic.
The article believes that the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is a “political-driven and very cautious” target chosen by the United States. The US government chose it “to create a tough attitude while avoiding the risk of major conflict.”
The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) also believes that when the US election season is approaching and the US economy is hit hard by the epidemic, Trump believes that “playing the’China card’ has a political advantage.”
The current situation is “a spiraling, tit-for-tat struggle”, which is promoted to a certain extent by the US government from the perspective of domestic considerations, and will only worsen the tension between China and the United States.
CBS reported that Trump’s re-election prospects are under pressure due to the outbreak, and he has repeatedly accused China of the epidemic.
Almost every day, the United States has taken new actions against Trump’s absurd thesis that “China exploits the United States”.
“The Consulate General of Houston is very important in establishing ties between the two countries”
The Associated Press commented that the United States’ request for China to close its consulate in Houston has increased tensions between the two largest economies in the world.
If the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is closed, in addition to diplomatic impact, Chinese citizens located in the southern United States will face difficulties in obtaining consular services, as will American citizens seeking visas and other services.
A Houston business group expressed regret over the US request that China close the Consulate General in Houston, saying that the Consulate General has played an important role in establishing trade , investment and cultural ties between the two countries .
The Associated Press believes that this reflects the importance of China’s economy.
The US “Foreign Policy” magazine website believes that this US move is “part of a series of provocative measures that will only worsen US-China relations”.
Reuters quoted Jonathan Pollack, an expert on East Asia issues at the Brookings Institution, a US think tank, as saying that since the establishment of comprehensive diplomatic relations between the United States and China in 1979, he could not think of any action that would be compatible with the United States’ attack on the Chinese Consulate in Houston This action comes on par.
Hong Kong’s “South China Morning Post” reported that this move by the United States was unprecedented in the diplomatic relations between China and the United States for more than 40 years.
Analysts believe that this move may cause lasting damage.
The Chinese Consulate General in Houston was established in 1979 and was the first Chinese Consulate General in the United States.
Currently, China has one embassy and five consulates-generals in the United States.

The spokesperson emphasized that the Chinese government is a staunch defender of cyber security and has always resolutely opposed and combated any form of cyber attacks and cyber crimes.
A reporter asked: According to the media, hacker organizations related to China have interfered with the network system of a British company, launched attacks on British and American technology companies that have patent data, and invaded the government networks of EU countries.
The spokesman said that the Chinese government is a staunch defender of cyber security and has always resolutely opposed and combated any form of cyber attacks and cyber crimes.
Cyberspace is highly virtual, difficult to trace, and diverse actors. Sufficient evidence should be presented when investigating and identifying cyber incidents, and no unreasonable guesses should be made.
The spokesperson said that a series of incidents such as the “Prism Gate” in the past proved that the United States has been conducting the world’s largest cyber theft.
Maintaining peace and stability in cyberspace is in the common interest of all countries.
The spokesperson pointed out that China’s achievements in technological innovation were not stolen or robbed, but were obtained through self-reliance and hard work.
In 2019, China submitted about 59,000 patent applications through the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), with an annual growth rate of 10.6%, making it the country with the largest number of international patent applications.
China has become a country of innovation and intellectual property rights.

Free COVID-19 testing in Urumqi, most districts have basically completed secondary testing in high-risk areas - chinanews.com
chinanews.com, Urumqi, July 26 (Reporter Sun Tingwen and Zhao Yamin) Zhang Wei, director of the Urumqi Health and Health Commission, said on the 26th when reporting the latest epidemic situation and COVID-19 testing in Urumqi, at present, most areas of Urumqi’s free COVID-19 testing work have been basically completed.
The expert group of the State Council and the experts of the autonomous region and Urumqi City are making further assessments of the development of the epidemic based on the results of COVID-19 testing and epidemiological investigations.
The Press Office of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region held a press conference on the 26th to report on the epidemic situation and its prevention and control in Xinjiang.
According to him, from 0:00 to 24:00 on July 25, 22 new cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in Urumqi (5 of them were asymptomatic infections transferred to confirmed cases), and 38 new cases of asymptomatic infections were added.
As of 24:00 on July 25, Urumqi City has 135 confirmed cases and 147 asymptomatic infections.
The newly-added asymptomatic infections on the 25th were basically detected through the city’s free COVID-19 test and active screening.
Zhang Wei, director of the Urumqi Municipal Health Commission, said on the 26th that most districts in Urumqi Quanquan City have basically completed free COVID-19 testing.
He also said that from the experience of other regions in the country, there are many factors that affect the results of COVID-19 testing, such as the sensitivity of the test reagent, the infection time and detoxification time of the tested person, and the cooperation of the tested person when the specimen is taken (poor cooperation may lead to the specimen Not taken in place) and the testing environment, the operating proficiency of the inspectors, etc.
For various reasons, false negative results can also occur in COVID-19 testing.
The so-called false negative means that the tested person is indeed an infected person, but the COVID-19 test result is negative.
In addition, for people who have had close contact with confirmed or suspected cases, two COVID-19 tests are usually required to exclude them.
For people who have been to high-risk areas of the epidemic, if they have fever and respiratory symptoms, a negative COVID-19 test may have a false negative, so two COVID-19 tests are needed to rule out.
He said that, in view of the above situation, for the health of the people of all ethnic groups in the city, starting today, Urumqi City will conduct a second free COVID-19 test in key areas such as Tianshan District and Shayibake District, and carry out “checking for omissions” at the same time.
It is reported that Tianshan District and Shayibak District are high-risk areas for the epidemic.

Representatives of the US-China Business Talks meet in August
Hong Kong’s “South China Morning Post” quoted an anonymous person familiar with the matter as reporting that Liu He, the head of China’s trade negotiation team and vice premier of the State Council, and Lai Haizhe, co-leader of the US team and trade representative, are expected to hold formal talks in August to assess the performance of the two parties. The situation of the first phase of the US trade agreement.
The report said that although China has substantially increased its purchases of American agricultural products in the past few months, due to factors such as the COVID-19, China’s purchases are still some distance from the amounts promised in the trade agreement.
Analysts say that the recent closure of each other’s consulates by the United States and China, together with other disputes, may undermine any progress in trade between the two sides.
The first phase of the Sino-US trade agreement will take effect one month after it was signed on January 15. The agreement stipulates that the high-level trade framework group formed by the two sides should hold talks every six months.
According to people familiar with the matter, the meeting will be “an important turning point” for both parties to assess the progress of the agreement.
But this person also said that if the tension between the United States and China leads to a low willingness to talk at this time, the two parties may agree that the May 8 conference call between Lai Haizhe and Liu He has met the terms of the trade agreement to meet every six months.
Since the beginning of this year, Sino-US relations have deteriorated rapidly. Disputes between the two sides include a series of issues such as the origin of the COVID-19 virus, trade, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, the South China Sea, and ideology.
Although US President Trump boasted about his achievements in the first phase of the agreement at the beginning of the year, his attitude has changed recently.
He said at a White House press conference on the 23rd that although China has recently purchased a record-breaking amount of US corn in a single day and has also bought a lot of soybeans, “but this trade agreement is not as meaningful to me as it was when it was reached.”
An anonymous Beijing government consultant also believes that due to poor US-China relations, a new round of trade negotiations is unlikely to take place, and “trade issues have lost weight in Sino-US relations.”
However, he revealed that Chinese economic and trade related units still met on the 23rd to discuss a series of issues, including how to increase imports from the United States. “We have tried our best to buy, so any additional purchases will be difficult.”
Peng Jiening, vice chairman of the US-China Business Council, said that maintaining the momentum of the first phase of the agreement is “more important than ever” and that China has made progress this year in further opening up its financial markets to US companies.
An analyst at Plenum, an independent research firm, said: “It is better to talk than nothing, although it may only be regarded as a routine matter.”

Maintaining strategic determination, enhancing confidence in victory, and concentrating our efforts on doing our own affairs are the keys to our response to various risks and challenges.
At the recent entrepreneurs forum, General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized that in the current external environment of rising protectionism, downturn in the world economy, and shrinking global markets, we must concentrate our efforts on our own affairs and give full play to the advantages of the domestic super-large-scale market. , Gradually form a new development pattern with the domestic cycle as the main body and the domestic and international dual cycles mutually promoting each other, improve the modernization level of the industrial chain and supply chain, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation, accelerate the research on key core technologies, and create new advantages for future development.

Public ownership is the main body, multiple ownership economies develop together, distribution according to work is the main body, and multiple distribution methods coexist. The socialist market economy system and other socialist basic economic systems can not only stimulate the vitality of various market entities, liberate and develop social productive forces, It can also promote the organic unity of efficiency and fairness, and continuously realize common prosperity.
We must firmly grasp the strategic basis of expanding domestic demand, make production, distribution, and circulation more dependent on the domestic market to achieve a virtuous circle, clarify the strategic direction of supply-side structural reforms, and promote aggregate supply and aggregate demand to a higher level. Achieve dynamic balance.
It is necessary to accelerate the construction of a complete domestic demand system, vigorously promote technological innovation and other innovations, accelerate the promotion of strategic emerging industries such as digital economy, intelligent manufacturing, life and health, and new materials, and form more new growth points and growth poles, and gradually form A new development pattern in which domestic and international cycles are the mainstay and the domestic and international dual cycles promote each other.
Openness brings progress, and closure inevitably lags behind.
General Secretary Xi Jinping has repeatedly emphasized that China’s door to opening up will not be closed, but will only open wider and wider.
With the domestic big cycle as the main body, it is by no means a closed door to operate, but by leveraging the potential of domestic demand to better connect the domestic market and the international market, and make better use of the two international and domestic markets and two resources to achieve a stronger and more Sustainable development.
At the same time, there is no contradiction between expanding domestic demand and opening up. The smoother the domestic cycle, the more conducive to building a new pattern of openness, and the more conducive to forming new advantages in participating in international cooperation and competition.
Although protectionism is now rising internationally, we must stand on the right side of history, persist in deepening reforms, expanding opening up, strengthening open cooperation in the field of science and technology, promoting an open world economy, and building a community with a shared future for mankind.
The Chinese nation has experienced many tribulations in history, but it has never been crushed. Instead, it has become more and more courageous, growing and rising from tribulations.
On the way forward, there is the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core, the significant advantages of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, strong mobilization capabilities and strong comprehensive strength, and the unity of the entire party, the entire army and the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country. Struggle, we will surely be able to overcome all difficulties and obstacles, maintain the momentum of my country’s economic and social development, build a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way, and successfully embark on a new journey of building a modern socialist country in an all-round way!
Yu’E Bao’s revenue declines, “post-90s” but “retaliation” to save money?
With the decline in Yu’E Bao’s income, the “post-90s” not only did not escape from Yu’E Bao, but began to “retaliate” to save money?
The Yu’E Bao Post-90s Post-90s Savings Report (2020 version) recently released by the China New Economic Research Institute and Alipay shows that in the first half of the year, post-90s are more likely to save money: the average amount of money saved per capita has increased by nearly 40% compared to 2019.
What’s interesting is that “post-90s” tend to start saving from a small amount of money, and 60% of the savings are less than 20 yuan per transaction...…
Saving money with Yu’E Bao has also become the habit of saving money for “post-90s”.
Data shows that among the 700 million Yu’E Bao users, 134 million are “post-90s.”
There are 174 million “post-90s” in China, that is to say, about 3 out of every 4 “post-90s” in the country are using Yu’E Bao to save money.
At present, the 7-day annualized rate of return of currency funds such as Yu’E Bao has fallen to around 1.5% from a level of higher than 2% at the beginning of the year.
Even so, it did not affect the pace of “post-90s” saving money.
In the context of the enhancement of Yu’E Bao’s “saving money effect”, many young people who are accustomed to using Yu’E Bao have directly transformed into “basic people”.
According to Alipay data, as of July 13, the number of new “basic people” on Alipay has more than doubled year-on-year in the past month, and more and more young people have achieved “advanced” financial management on Alipay.
Some analysts believe that the flow of funds from Yu’E Bao into the stock market is also an important reason for the clear decline in the share of money funds in June.
The report also shows that “post-90s” girls tend to save more, on average 20% higher than boys. Among users who hold funds on the Alipay platform, 60% are men, and women tend to choose more than men. A more robust financial management method.
After saving money, what plans does the “post-90s” have?
Alipay data shows that “post-90s” have the habit of saving money for their goals, and the most users make travel as their goal to save money.
Affected by the epidemic, many “post-90s” save money to prepare for travel after the epidemic; the reopening of movie theaters also provides a new way to switch from saving money to consumption.

France increases space military investment-Xinhuanet
French Defense Minister Florence Parley said on the 24th that France will add hundreds of millions of euros to its space defense budget to develop space military forces to prevent “unfriendly moves” that other countries may make in outer space.
Parley told the Provence newspaper that between 2019 and 2025, the French space military project expenditure budget will increase from the previously planned 3.6 billion euros (approximately 4.2 billion US dollars) to 4.3 billion euros (5 billion US dollars).
According to the French Military Planning Act from 2019 to 2025 approved by the French Parliament in 2018, France is expected to update its existing observation satellites and communication satellites in the future, launch 3 electromagnetic listening satellites, and improve the modernization level of space surveillance radars.
French President Emmanuel Macron announced in July last year that a space military command and an “Aviation and Space Force” will be established within the French Air Force.
Parley said that she will formally announce the establishment of the space force when she visits a military academy in Salon, Provence.
Parley said that this space force is affiliated to the Air Force and will have 500 personnel by 2025.
She said: “People used to think that space serves the common interests of science. This idea is gone forever. Now space is a place where countries compete for global hegemony.”
Pali reiterated Macron’s previous statement, saying that France has no intention to provoke an arms race.
“We are definitely not engaged in an arms race. But it is my responsibility to thoroughly recognize the threats we may face.”
Parley revisited the surveillance of a military satellite shared by France and Italy in 2017.
She said that the “spy” was a Russian satellite.
Russia denies this statement.
Parley said that France “soon” will have small patrol satellites capable of detecting and locking “the black hands behind those unfriendly actions.”
French media believe that the reason why France seeks to establish a space force is due to US President Donald Trump’s request in February last year that the US Department of Defense draft a bill to establish a space force.
Trump signed the National Defense Authorization Act in December last year, approving the establishment of the sixth largest service in the United States, the Space Force.
Some experts worry that these measures by the US have accelerated the pace of US space militarization and may trigger a new round of space arms race.

chinanews.com, Chongqing, July 26 (Reporter Han Lu) The reporter learned from the China Railway Chengdu Group Co., Ltd. on the 26th that the Zhengzhou-Wanzhou High-speed Railway Small Three Gorges Tunnel with a total length of about 18.9 kilometers was completed on the same day.
It is understood that the Small Three Gorges Tunnel is not only the longest high-speed rail tunnel within the Three Gorges Reservoir area, but also the longest single-hole double-track high-speed rail tunnel with a design speed of 350 km/h among the projects currently under construction in China.
Zhengzhou-Wanzhou High-speed Railway is located in Henan, Hubei, and Chongqing. It connects with Beijing-Guangzhou and Xuzhou-Lanzhou High-speed Railways in the north of Zhengzhou, and connects the Yuzhou-Wanzhou High-speed Railways to Chongqing in the south of Wanzhou. An important part of the Hunan Passage.
The Zhengzhou-Wanzhou High-speed Railway Small Three Gorges Tunnel was fully completed on the 26th.
The picture shows through the scene.
The Zhengzhou-Wanzhou High-speed Railway starts in Zhengzhou City, Henan Province, and runs southwest through Pingdingshan City, Nanyang City, and Xiangyang City in Hubei Province to Wanzhou District of Chongqing City. The new line is about 818 kilometers in length, with a design speed of 350 kilometers per hour, and about 184 kilometers in Chongqing.
Among them, the Zhengzhou-Xiangyang section has been opened for operation in advance on December 1, 2019, and the Chongqing section is stepping up its construction.
The Small Three Gorges Tunnel, which passed through on the 26th, is a full-line control project of Zhengzhou-Wanzhou High-speed Railway. The project is located at the junction of Fengjie County and Wushan County in Chongqing City. It has a total length of about 18.9 kilometers and a maximum buried depth of 890 meters.
Construction of the tunnel started in February 2017, and the tunnel will be completed on July 26, 2020.
According to Wang Guojun, head of Zhengzhou-Wanzhou High-speed Railway tunnel design of China Railway Second Engineering Group Co., Ltd., the survey and design party, the site of the Small Three Gorges Tunnel is very complex and faces risks such as karst, mud and water inrush, and large deformation of soft rock. For Class I high-risk tunnels, tunnel design and construction are extremely difficult.
“During the construction of the project, we used geological survey methods, geophysical methods and advanced drilling methods to make advance geological forecasts, and adopted special design plans for more than 30 caves of various types. For example, we designed and built a 24-meter-long bridge that spans the tunnel. Large karst caves with a longitudinal length of more than 10 meters and a depth of more than 55 meters can avoid tunnel settlement.” Wang Guojun said.
According to the construction party, China Railway Tunnel Bureau, the construction of the tunnel adopted a combination of dredging and blocking, through the construction of horizontal tunnels, grouting, water blocking, strengthening of the tunnel structure support, and construction of sewage treatment stations, which ensured the orderly progress of the project. It also avoids the damage of construction drainage to the water body of the Small Three Gorges Scenic Area. At the same time, it successfully overcomes the construction problems of 7 kilometers long soft rock large deformation and other bad geology, and daily maximum water inflow of 157,000 cubic meters. .
After the Zhengzhou-Wanzhou High-speed Railway is completed and opened to traffic, it will become a new convenient and fast passenger passage from Southwest China to the Central Plains, North China, and Northeast China. It will help improve the capacity and quality of the northeast railway passage in the Southwest, improve the regional road network layout, and speed up tourism along the route. The process of resource development and urbanization is of great significance to promote coordinated regional development and to promote the implementation of the strategy for the development of the western region.
Experts say it is unconstitutional to collect immigration data through the US Census for seat allocation in the House of Representatives
Some civil rights organizations and several US cities and counties have sued the US federal government, claiming that Trump’s Presidential Palace’s attempts to exclude undocumented immigrants from the US Census are unworkable and unconstitutional.
The US Census will determine the distribution of seats in the US House of Representatives.
Sarah Brannon, the executive attorney of the American Civil Liberties Alliance, told VOA, “This will not work.”
She went on to say that Trump’s requirement to determine the citizenship of the census in the census is difficult and “not very reliable.”
Another civil liberties organization Common Cause filed a lawsuit on Thursday to challenge Trump’s executive order.
Some cities in New Jersey and Georgia joined the lawsuit.
Arlington County, Virginia, also joined the lawsuit on Friday.
Arlington County Board of Management Chairman Garvey said, “The US Constitution requires an accurate count of our population every 10 years. We must accurately count everyone who lives in Arlington County, and we must not let this illegal attempt scare away. People and shrinking the number of our immigrant communities have succeeded.”
Other organizations and individuals praised President Trump’s executive order.
Alabama Attorney General Marshall called the executive order a “victory” for the state.
He said, “The allocation of seats in the House of Representatives and electoral college seats in each state must be based on the number of residents living in each state, and the number of residents living legally.”
The US Supreme Court last year prevented the Trump administration from including citizenship issues in the 2020 census form.
President Trump signed an executive order earlier this week instructing the Secretary of Commerce of the US Census Bureau to submit data on the undocumented population obtained from the census so that the administration can exclude these undocumented populations from the state census. In addition to the number, and use this to determine whether each state will increase or decrease or maintain the seats of the House of Representatives.
The United States redistributes seats in the House of Representatives every 10 years based on demographic changes.

Acting in response to the trend and advancing the construction of industrial projects-Viewpoint Headline-Hunan Daily-Huasheng Online
In the midsummer of Hunan, the heat wave is blowing.
The enthusiasm released by the on-site observation meeting for the promotion of industrial project construction in the province has overwhelmed the heat of the dog days, and the clear orientation of “comparing the strength of the industry and the hero of the project” agitated the three Hunan and four rivers.
The development of Hunan always depends on building projects and training industries.
Facing the extremely unusual first half of the year, under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, the whole province has adhered to a game of chess, went all out to fight the two tough battles of epidemic prevention and flood prevention, and implemented industrial projects as the implementation of “six stability”. The “first move” of “six guarantees”.
From a year-on-year decline of 1.9% in GDP in the first quarter to a year-on-year growth of 1.3% in the first half of the year, it is self-evident that the period was difficult and the effort was huge.
In this precious report card, the construction of industrial projects is the key support for Hunan’s rapid economic recovery and stable development.
The situation can be smooth and irreversible.
The construction of industrial projects must be put into the overall situation. It is not only good at accumulating, accumulating, and seeking momentum, but also good at recognizing changes, seeking changes, and adapting to changes.
Under the complex and severe background of the current international situation, in addition to the hard work of attracting investment, it is necessary to calm down to study the current new situation and new characteristics, to grasp the rules, to be more scientific and accurate, and to better integrate into the domestic and international cycle as the main body. The new development pattern of mutual promotion of dual cycles.
Pay more attention to improving the basic capabilities of the industry.
In the first half of the year, not only did a large number of heavyweight investment projects in emerging industries break ground and sow hopes in our province, but also enterprises in traditional advantageous industries accelerated their deployment in digital, intelligent, and green industrial transformation.
The Yiyang Aoshikang Third Science Park project transforms the existing production line, and the intelligent high-end printed circuit board production line takes the lead; the new plant of Hunan China Tobacco Changde Cigarette Factory is committed to the process of intelligent transformation and construction of a modern factory. Vivid portrayal of “old trees sprout”... Only by consolidating and upgrading advantageous industries, actively fostering and developing emerging industries, and comprehensively intensifying technological innovation and localization, can we continue to consolidate the basic conditions, focusing on the major national strategy and the “two new and one important” strategy. Accumulate momentum for transformation.
Pay more attention to cultivating and developing new economics, new business forms and new models.
The sudden COVID-19 has brought about the popularity of the “cloud economy”, stimulated the potential of the digital economy, and provided new opportunities for industrial transformation: In the first half of the year, the province’s computer and office equipment manufacturing, electronic and communication equipment manufacturing industries grew by 12.6 %, the online retail sales of wholesale and retail enterprises above designated size increased by 32.2% year-on-year, and the online meal fee income of catering companies increased by 35.6% year-on-year.
It is the general trend to nurture new opportunities amidst the crisis, open a new game amidst changes, actively promote digital industrialization and industrial digitization, and guide the integrated development of digital economy and real economy.
Pay more attention to optimizing and stabilizing the industrial chain supply chain.
Construction machinery is the main force in Hunan’s industry, but two-thirds of the supporting enterprises are outside the province, and there is still room and potential in the supporting chain.
Strengthening industrial chain thinking and grasping projects requires not only the continuous accumulation of leading companies and technological breakthroughs in key links of the industrial chain, but also the efforts of various regions to cultivate and stimulate the “chain” reaction by strengthening the chain to supplement the chain and promote the coordination of related supporting industries Layout, and accelerate the construction of an independent, controllable, safe and reliable industrial chain supply chain.
Overcoming difficulties and supporting enterprises, Hunan is still a hot spot and a paradise with a good business environment and market opportunities.
All parts of the province have frequently recruited, new and practical measures, in the belief that the “burden reduction” of corporate relief has led to the “acceleration” of high-quality development; Shaoyang implements “shareholder-style” services, and does not shirk any shirks and does not discount policies. , The problem is not solved overnight... In the process of restoring the losses caused by the epidemic, various “every possible methods” have been taken to identify shortcomings and pain points, and turn crises into opportunities.
Focusing on researching, cultivating, and developing industries with one mind, and steadily optimizing the business environment, will surely win the favor of more investors.
There are still wind and waves ahead, but the state of riding the wind and waves has become the norm for the province to focus on the construction of industrial projects and promote high-quality development.
At this critical time, we must learn and implement the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping’s important instructions, effectively respond to external uncertainties with the certainty of our own work, persevere in promoting the construction of industrial projects, share enthusiasm and sweat to ensure “ The 13th Five-Year Plan and the completion of a well-off society in an all-round way came to a successful conclusion.

Employment and prices are generally stable, showing that the economy has “temperature” - chinanews.com

Employment and prices are generally stable, demonstrating the “temperature” of the economy
Lin Huocan, reporter of Economic Daily and China Economic Net
In the first half of this year, facing the impact of the COVID-19, my country has coordinated efforts to promote epidemic prevention and control and economic and social development. The epidemic prevention and control situation has continued to improve, the economy has been recovering steadily, and the performance of employment and prices that are closely related to people’s livelihood have been generally stable. , China’s economy has handed over a report card of economic performance with warmth.
In the first two months of this year, the surveyed unemployment rate has risen.
Especially in February, the production and operation activities of many enterprises were basically in a state of suspension of production. The demand for employment of enterprises has decreased, recruitment has been delayed or cancelled, and the surveyed unemployment rate in cities and towns has risen.
With the gradual improvement of the epidemic prevention and control situation, the production and life order of the whole society is continuously restored.
The Party Central Committee adheres to the general tone of seeking progress while maintaining stability, further intensifies macro policy hedging, comprehensively strengthens the employment priority policy, and actively promotes the work of assisting enterprises to stabilize jobs and expand employment.
my country has stepped up policy hedging to stabilize jobs, hit the “reduction, exemption, delay, rebate” policy combination, phased reduction and exemption of three social insurance unit contributions, allowing deferred payment of social insurance premiums, and expanding the unemployment insurance for small, medium and micro enterprises to stabilize job rebates and work for workers. For the benefit of the training policy, enterprises will be given subsidies for absorbing the employment of key groups, subsidies for internships, etc.
With the implementation of various employment stabilization policies, the demand for employment by enterprises has steadily picked up, the employment situation has gradually improved, and the urban unemployment rate survey has gradually declined. In June, the survey unemployment rate was 5.7%.
Zhang Yi, director of the Population and Employment Statistics Department of the National Bureau of Statistics, said that in the second quarter, various employment policies continued to take effect. The labor force who withdrew due to the impact of the epidemic in the early stage returned one after another. The urban labor participation rate in June increased by about 10 percentage points compared with February. It was close to the same period last year.
Statistics show that the total urban employment in June increased by more than 19% compared with February, and most industries reached the pre-epidemic level; the average weekly working hours of employees in enterprises reached 46.8 hours, an increase of 6.6 hours from February and a slight increase of 0.1 hours from January.
Prices are also related to millions of households.
In January this year, the CPI rose by 5.4% year-on-year, setting a new high for many years.
Entering February, although the year-on-year increase of CPI fell slightly, it was still in the “5 range”.
The year-on-year growth rate of CPI was at a high level, due to factors driving consumer demand before the Spring Festival, as well as factors such as the wrong month of the Spring Festival and a low year-on-year base.
However, the impact of the COVID-19 on prices is particularly obvious.
Affected by the prevention and control of the epidemic, in January and February, there were delays in logistics, untimely supply of materials, and increased transportation costs of materials throughout the country. In addition, some citizens were hoarding and rushing to purchase, and the prices of some daily necessities increased significantly.
In response to the disturbances caused by the epidemic prevention and control to the price situation, relevant departments included important living materials into the scope of emergency transportation guarantee to ensure smooth transportation of materials.
Under the influence of a series of policy measures, the market supply of vegetables and fruits has been strongly guaranteed.
In response to the rapid increase in pork prices at the beginning of this year, after the central government promulgated the policy of ensuring supply and stabilizing prices, various regions and departments quickly implemented it. The supply of pork reserves has improved significantly, the production capacity of live pigs has been restored in an orderly manner, and the order of production and sales has gradually become normal.
Since March, pork prices have continued to fall. In May, the year-on-year increase in food prices fell to 10.6%. In June, affected by factors such as slowing of slaughter of pigs, reduced imports, and rebound of group consumer demand, pork prices rose slightly from the previous month.
The seasonal changes in fresh vegetable prices are obvious, with an average increase of 3.4% in the first half of the year.
Affected by the high comparison base in the same period last year, the price of fresh fruits continued to decline year-on-year, with an average drop of 13.3% in the first half of the year.
The basic lives of the people are effectively guaranteed, and the overall economic and social situation remains stable and orderly.
With the gradual recovery of transportation and logistics, various regions have increased their efforts to ensure supply, and the market supply and demand situation has improved.
Beginning in March, the CPI fell for four consecutive months, and the year-on-year increase dropped from 4.3% in March to 2.5% in June. The overall price level returned to stability.
In the second half of the year, my country’s prices will continue to remain at a moderate level, and overall inflationary pressure will not be large. However, it is still necessary to promote the restoration of production and living order under the premise of normalizing epidemic prevention and control.
Effectively respond to natural disasters such as floods and droughts in the main agricultural production areas such as food, fruits and vegetables, strengthen market supervision, and resolutely combat behaviors that disrupt market order such as hoarding and price hikes.

chinanews.com, Qinghai, Hainan, July 26th, title: “Flower Sea Live Room” by Qinghai Lake: “Sweet” Bringing Goods to Help Farmers Increase Income
Author Hu Guilong Pan Yujie
“In the midsummer Qinghai Lake, there are eyes full of golden flowers and thousands of bees flying. The altitude here is high, the temperature difference between day and night is large, and the air pollution is low. The strong light has bred the most tenacious and generous bee colony, which has created Qinghai royal jelly with high activity, high protein and richness. Contains nutritional value, low sugar and low fat characteristics.”
On the 26th, Zhang Jianxun, deputy director of the Industry and Information Administration of Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, said.
On the same day, the live broadcast of bee products in the “Working together to fight the epidemic spring pulp to help farmers” was held on the shore of Qinghai Lake. The Chinese Bee Products Association, representatives of entrepreneurs, and beekeepers gathered to promote Qinghai’s characteristic bee products, which sold nearly in total online and offline. Ten thousand bottles of Qinghai Plateau Royal Jelly, with a total of nearly 3.8 million yuan.
The picture shows beekeepers showing bee products on site.
It is reported that this live broadcast of goods with the help of Beijing Houdeli Bee Industry Chain Store Network, Kuaishou, Taobao and other well-known domestic bee product retail companies, live broadcasts, and e-commerce platforms to promote “enterprise + bee farmers + growers” exchanges and cooperation, and Through online and offline channels, the “Qinghai Plateau Spring Milk Consumption Coupons” will be continuously issued to consumers. It is estimated that the company will make a total profit of nearly 5.28 million yuan throughout the year.
In this regard, Wu Na, president of Beijing Houdeli Bee Industry Co., Ltd., believes that “it is worth it”: “This move can expand the popularity of Qinghai bee products, attract more consumers to understand and like pure and natural bee products without additives, and drive bee products. Farmers’ income increases.”
At present, the company has signed production cooperation strategic agreements with Qinghai Cloud Bee Industry Co., Ltd. and Qinghai Huabao Bee Industry Co., Ltd., hoping to jointly promote the rapid development of Qinghai’s local bee industry.
The picture shows the sea of rape blossoms by the Qinghai Lake.
This spring, because of the need to set up road access barriers for epidemic prevention and control in various places, the way of beekeepers “chasing flowers and honey” is blocked. Many bees died due to missed flowering and lack of food, and beekeepers’ income was seriously affected.
“At the end of the year, the beekeepers traveled long distances from Yunnan and Sichuan all the way north to the northwest region following the flowering period.
As a business, we have a responsibility to help them. “
Wu Na said.
“Little bees are’environmental scouts’, and bees cannot survive in heavily polluted areas.” Zhao Xiaochuan, executive vice president of the China Bee Products Association, introduced that bee pollination is an important link in the ecological chain, which is important for protecting plant diversity and improving ecology. The environment has an irreplaceable role.
At the same time, bee pollination can increase the yield and quality of crops, especially in areas with a wide variety of crops and poor management conditions, the significance of pollination is greater.
Research data shows that pollination can increase rapeseed yield by about 15%-30%.
The picture shows Zhao Xiaochuan (right), executive vice president of China Bee Products Association, promoting Qinghai bee products.
“The economic, ecological and social benefits created by bee pollination are far greater than the value of bee products themselves. The bee industry has huge potential in human health, crop production, vegetation reproduction, and ecological protection, and people have always been little aware of this.”
Zhao Xiaochuan said.
Nowadays, the number of beekeepers is decreasing. In addition to beekeepers who are always on the go, there are still many impoverished households with limited mobility who choose to use beehives to invest in cooperatives.
“The state has financial support. We contact technical personnel for help and guidance. Beekeepers lack understanding and judgment of the market environment. To open a market, they also need the help and coordination of the government, enterprises, and industry associations.”
Zhao Xiaochuan said.
“I hope everyone will pay more attention to and help beekeepers in the future,” Wu Na said. “Our bee products are also screened and controlled in strict accordance with national standards to ensure quality and protect consumer rights while helping beekeepers.”

Since its establishment, Greenland Holdings has carried out many system and mechanism reforms: from 1992 to 1997, it operated in accordance with market-oriented rules under a purely state-owned system; from 1997 to 2013, it established and continuously improved the state-owned holding and employee-owned shareholding system; 2013 From 2015 to 2015, the company introduced strategic investors to form a mixed ownership system of cross-shareholding and mutual integration of state-owned and non-public capital; since 2015, it has been listed as a whole and has become a public company.
Greenland’s current mixed reform plan is similar to Gree. In December 2019, Hillhouse Capital led Zhuhai Mingjun to take over 15% of Gree Electric (000651.SZ) with 41.662 billion yuan. Gree Group retired to a minority shareholder. After the mixed reform was completed, Gree Electric has implemented modern corporate management methods such as the executive incentive plan and no actual control structure.
Shanghai Real Estate and Shanghai Urban Investment are both state-owned enterprise groups wholly-owned by the Shanghai State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission. Zhang Yuliang, Chairman and President of Greenland Holdings, said that the move by Greenland is Shanghai in accordance with the requirements of the Party Central Committee to promote the comprehensive reform of state-owned and state-owned enterprises and accelerate the new one. The important measures taken in the reform of state-owned assets and state-owned enterprises at this stage fully demonstrate the new thinking of reform in accordance with local conditions and tailor-made. By introducing new outstanding strategic shareholders to listed companies, supporting enterprises to further increase the degree of marketization, increase the degree of freedom of operation and management, and accelerate the full release of reform vitality.

U.S. White House consultants “bite back” states to resume work too early
On July 23, local time, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the United States exceeded 4 million, accounting for 30% of global cases.
Over the past few months, US President Trump has repeatedly asked all states across the country to return to work and school. It was only recently that he changed his attitude and took the initiative to wear masks in public. His advisers even “bite back” and said that some state governments resumed work too early.
On the 22nd, White House presidential adviser Kellyanne Conway stated at a press conference that some state governments had failed to comply with resumption standards and had restarted places such as bars prematurely.
Conway also mentioned that the previous statement that the president has the “absolute power” to decide the resumption of work in each state is a misrepresentation.
“The president is a federalist, and he believes that every state has autonomy.”
She defended Trump.
However, the “rumors” in Conway’s mouth were personally spoken by Trump at the White House epidemic briefing on April 13.
This self-slapped operation was mocked by netizens as “rewriting history.”
Kylian Conway wants to rewrite history. She is a liar.
Trump called Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer a dictator because she followed medical guidelines and insisted on stopping work.
Trump wants to promote the resumption of work so that he can hold a rally.
This is not the first time Kylian Conway has caused controversy.
On April 15, when Conway was interviewed by Fox News, he blurted out: “This is COVID-19, not COVID-1, friends!”
She seemed to understand “19” as a version number, and was frantically ridiculed by netizens: read the newspaper without common sense!
Is it reasonable for a 3-year-old child to be smashed while playing in the university playground.
2020-07-26 05:01:11 Source: Legal Daily Author: Wang Sishuo Editor: Wang Sishuo
The playground was smashed, and the child was compensated before suing the school
Correspondent Zhao Yifan
The 3-year-old Xiaowen was accidentally hit in the head by Chen from the softball team while playing on the playground of a certain university.
After Chen made compensation, Xiaowen’s father, Mr. Wen, served as Xiaowen’s legal representative and sued the school to the court, demanding an apology from the school where the incident occurred, as well as payment of medical expenses and mental damage relief for a total of 20,000 yuan.
Recently, after hearing the case, the Haidian District People’s Court of Beijing held that the school had set up a protective net on the playground at the time of the incident, and that it had fulfilled its proper safety guarantee obligations, and Chen had already paid compensation. Based on this judgment, the plaintiff’s decision was rejected. Claims.
Mr. Wen alleged that he took Xiaowen to play on the school playground during the summer vacation of 2019, when the softball team was training on the playground.
In order to avoid the risks posed by this, Xiaowen, Mr. Wen and many other children and parents play in safe areas designated by the softball team.
But then the softball player Chen dropped his hand while pitching, causing the softball to fly over the guard net into the above-mentioned safe area and hit Xiaowen in the back of the head.
Mr. Wen immediately took Xiaowen to the hospital for treatment and was diagnosed with head trauma.
Mr. Wen believes that school stadium facilities do not meet the relevant safety requirements, and not on the team with customs facilities for effective management.
The school’s negligence caused the above incident to occur, which caused Xiaowen to suffer tremendous physical and mental pain, and at the same time brought greater pain to his family. The school should bear legal responsibility for this.
In this regard, the school argued that the school has set up a protective net on the playground, and posted management regulations and training notices, informing them that entering the playground must maintain a safe distance from the training site and reminding their own safety. The plaintiff could not prove that the school was “not enough.” Obligation of safety protection", so I do not agree to compensation.
After the trial, the court held that the site involved in the incident was a site open to the public for free by the university involved. Although the school has a safety guarantee obligation for the management of the playground, this safety guarantee obligation only needs to meet the general duty of care.
At the time of the incident, the school set up a protective net on the playground, and has fulfilled its proper safety guarantee obligations, and Chen also compensated Xiaowen for various losses including medical expenses and transportation expenses in accordance with the previously reached compensation agreement for more than two thousand yuan. It is agreed that this dispute will be resolved at one time.
After the incident, Xiaowen’s parents again claimed compensation from the school. There was no basis in the law, and the court ruled that all of the plaintiff’s claims were rejected.
After the verdict was pronounced, neither party appealed, and the verdict is now effective.
According to Article 37 of my country’s Tort Liability Law, schools, as managers of public places, have the obligation to guarantee safety; in the event that the actions of a third party cause damage to others, the third party bears tort liability, but the safety guarantee is not fulfilled. The responsible public place manager shall bear corresponding supplementary responsibilities.
The judge said that as the manager of a public place, he is most likely to understand the actual situation of the entire place and foresee possible dangers and damages, so that he is most likely to take necessary measures to prevent the occurrence of losses or reduce the extent of damage, and to avoid and mitigate The cost of damage is the lowest, so the law stipulates that it shall bear the corresponding guarantee obligations for engaging in social activities.
In this case, for unspecified people entering the playground that is free to the public, the school’s safety guarantee obligations should be compatible with the social activities it engages in. Specifically, it should take basic safety measures and deal with hidden dangers. Have the obligation to inform.
In judicial practice, it is not appropriate to impose excessive safety guarantee obligations on managers of public places.
If the school has adopted a protective net and fulfilled its obligation of notification, it can be determined that the school is not at fault and should not bear legal responsibility.
In addition, for third-party infringements, even if the administrators of public places such as schools fail to fulfill their obligations to ensure safety, their liability is a supplement to compensation for damages. According to the latest civil code, after the administrators assume supplementary responsibilities, You can also claim compensation from a third party.
Therefore, in such accidents, the victims should not expand the scope of compensation after they have received compensation from the direct infringer.
Under the normalization of epidemic prevention and control, people’s enthusiasm for exercise and fitness is high.
With the gradual liberalization of inter-provincial tourism business, the tourism market is also about to usher in a recovery.
Fujian Province resumed its inter-provincial tourism business from July 21. Xiamen, a popular tourist destination, ushered in a peak of passenger flow in the first weekend after opening.
As a popular tourist destination city, many tourists arrive in Xiamen on weekends.
Xiamen Railway Station expects that Shuyun will send 3.7 million passengers, while the passenger flow at the airport is dominated by students, tourists, and visiting relatives.
The tourism market is gradually picking up. In July, Xiamen Airport ran an average of 440 flights per day, and domestic flights had recovered to 80% of the pre-epidemic value.
Airlines have encrypted the air express lines from Xiamen to Shanghai, Beijing, Kunming, Xi’an and other major cities to seize the post-recovery tourism market.
At present, a number of travel agencies in Xiamen have successively launched a batch of domestic cross-provincial travel products during summer vacations, and the group itinerary is mainly based on outdoor attractions.
In response to the summer passenger traffic peaks in railway stations and airports, relevant units have deployed additional manpower in areas where people are easy to gather such as check-in counters and security check lanes. Fujian has also optimized and upgraded the “Bamin Health Code” to achieve the 31. Health data sharing and mutual recognition between the provinces have promoted the orderly recovery of the tourism market.

Israel strengthens prevention and control of repeated epidemics
In the early stage of the outbreak of the COVID-19, Israel’s prevention and control measures were effective.
However, with the gradual lifting of the ban on prevention and control measures, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Israel has recently increased significantly. The Israeli government has repeatedly taken emergency measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic.
On February 28, the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Israel. It quickly closed all entry and exit ports, suspended non-essential industries, schools changed to online teaching, restricted public transportation and non-essential social activities, and blocked cities with severe epidemics. The military and police jointly maintain prevention and control measures, etc.
This series of measures quickly achieved positive results. By mid-May, the number of new confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Israel fell back to single digits in a single day.
As the epidemic is brought under control, Israel’s various prevention and control measures have been fully unblocked. Since June, the number of newly diagnosed COVID-19 has gradually rebounded.
Especially since July, the spread of the epidemic has continued to accelerate.
In recent days, there are more than 1,500 new cases in Israel every day for 8 days. As of the time of publication on July 25, there were 916 new cases on that day.
As of July 25, there have been 59,745 confirmed cases and 448 deaths in Israel.
Facing the rapid rebound of the epidemic, the Israeli government has repeatedly taken emergency measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic.
On July 6, after the number of confirmed cases exceeded 30,000, the Israeli government closed public entertainment venues such as gymnasiums, swimming pools, bars, nightclubs, and introduced a public transportation restriction policy, stipulating that the number of passengers per bus cannot exceed 20 people. .
On the 17th, the Israeli government announced a series of new restrictive measures, including the implementation of “closure of the city” on weekends, etc., stipulating that the “closure of the city” shall be implemented from 17:00 every Friday to 5:00 every Sunday.
During this period, people can go out, but shops, shopping centers, barber shops, beauty salons, libraries, zoos, museums, exhibition halls, swimming pools and tourist attractions will be closed, while supermarkets, pharmacies and other basic services will remain open .
At the same time, on all dates and time periods, gatherings of more than 10 people are forbidden, gyms, studios and other places will be closed, restaurants and cafes are forbidden to eat in, and only takeaway services are allowed.
At the same time, the Israeli people did not pay enough attention to the severity of the epidemic and failed to form a joint force with the government in fighting the epidemic.
After the recurrence of the Israeli epidemic, many people took to the streets to protest and march because the government’s prevention and control measures affected their economic interests.
On July 11, tens of thousands of people held a demonstration in Tel Aviv, believing that the anti-epidemic policy would affect the economy.
On the evening of the 21st, thousands of protesters gathered in front of Prime Minister Netanyahu’s residence in Jerusalem to protest against Prime Minister Netanyahu’s promulgation of prevention and control measures such as the prohibition of restaurants and cafes without giving corresponding compensation.
In addition, many people fail to observe the regulations on wearing masks and maintaining a safe social distance of two meters during outdoor activities. In order to avoid being fined by the police for not wearing a mask, many people only wear the mask on their chin or on their wrists.
During the recurrence of the epidemic, the school was the hardest hit area for the spread of the COVID-19 virus. According to a reporter’s recent visit to this kindergarten, it was discovered that neither the teachers nor students in the kindergarten had worn masks as required by the government, nor had they maintained a safe social distance of two meters from each other. Infection with the virus lays down hidden dangers.
Professor Eli Waxman, a member of the Israeli National Security Council’s expert advisory group to combat the epidemic, believes that Israel is moving towards a “dangerous situation” and pointed out that Israel’s current epidemic prevention and control measures are not enough, and all leisure and entertainment venues and summer vacations should be closed. Schools to control the further spread of the epidemic.
Waxman said that Israel lacks an overall plan to fight the epidemic. The parliament and government departments should abandon their own interests as soon as possible, reach an agreement on the fight against the epidemic, and formulate clear steps that include relevant restrictions on different departments.
Tel Aviv, July 25th, by reporter Wang Jiong in Tel Aviv
Wu Fengfang, a farmer in Guyuan, Ningxia, couldn’t help but his wife Dai Tianfu. The two rushed to the Liangyun Cultural Compound from their home 20 miles away in a car.
Despite the inconvenience of legs and feet in the past two years, 77-year-old Dai Tianfu still counts on “come here every other way and get addicted to tricks.”
This is an inconspicuous courtyard in Yuanzhou District, Guyuan City. Different from ordinary farmyards, there are often melodious Qin operas, as well as wonderful shadow puppets, embroidery works, traditional Qin operas, and eyebrow operas.
The owner of the compound is called Liang Yun, who used to be a carpenter.
More than 10 years ago, he loves shadow puppets and sings operas and began planning to build a cultural compound.
With Liangyun Cultural Compound, the cultural life of the villagers has become rich and colorful.
Before the reporter entered the Liangyun Cultural Compound, the tune of Qin Opera had been spread out.
It is Bai Lixiang, a villager from the neighboring village, who is singing excerpts from Qinqiang for the folks.
She has loved Qinqiang since she was a child, and now she has a small reputation in the local area. As long as she has free time, she will come to the cultural compound to perform for the folks.
Recently, Bai Lixiang also played a webcast.
Bai Lixiang said: “It is a very happy thing to have a stage for more people to see themselves performing.”
On the stage, the singer gave a stern look, and the player tuned each tune. Although he was an amateur, his enthusiasm was undiminished.
Just like the pristine style of the farmyard, outside of Qinqiang, the “grassroots” art and intangible cultural heritage in the Liangyun Cultural Courtyard are rushing to the face.
The compound also houses more than 300 items of farming utensils from different ages, traditional and hand-made tiles, paper-cuts, embroidery, shadow puppets, etc.
Liang Yun led the reporter into the exhibition hall in the courtyard, where his collection of old objects, old hip flasks, sanxianzi, and spinning wheels were displayed.
Why does an ordinary farmer build a cultural compound?
“Shadow puppetry is my family handicraft, I have been learning this craft since I was 15 years old.”
Liangyun Cultural Compound was established in 2012 and became the first rural “intangible cultural heritage exhibition hall” in Ningxia, as well as a demonstration compound for intangible cultural heritage protection in Guyuan.
In addition to Liangyun Cultural Complex, there have also been more than 120 cultural complexes and 79 folk performance groups in Yuanzhou District of Guyuan City. Among them, there are more than 50 cultural complexes of a certain scale, such as Shenjiahe Cultural Complex and Wang Yonghong Cultural Complex. It covers all towns and streets in Yuanzhou District, with more than 5,000 participants.
These grassroots artists are active in the fields, enriching the cultural life of the masses and satisfying their spiritual needs.
“As life gets better, traditional culture can’t just be left behind.”
“Liu’s spy war drama” is back again, “Winner” to see Liu Yunlong and Li Liqun’s opponents “boom show”-Xinhuanet
The 40-episode spy war drama “Winner” will be available on Beijing Satellite TV from July 16.
“Winner” is adapted from real historical facts and is based on the Soviet military archives that have been in dust for many years and have been released for the first time.
The actor Liu Yunlong, who is well-known to the audience in the “spy war drama”, broke through the image in the play and challenged a “stuttering agent” with a sense of joy.
In recent years, the popularity of dramas such as “The Disguiser”, “Mask”, and “Kite” has all proved that the spy war genre has strong vitality.
Different from previous spy war works, “Winner” looks at the world and extends the background of the story to the Soviet Far East battlefield.
It is set against the background of the last stage of the Anti-Japanese War in 1944. It tells the story of Tang Fei (played by Liu Yunlong), a CCP’s secret intelligence worker, under the leadership of the Secretary of the Chinese Underground Party Linhe Provincial Committee and the Director of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Agency, who performed The story of “Mudan Ula” strategic action.
In many spy war dramas, the male protagonist, as a senior spy, has a perfect image of handsome, high IQ, and maturity.
But in Liu Yunlong’s view, such a person is not suitable for being a spy. “A spy should be the kind of person who can’t be found in the pile of people. If he appears on the stage, he will be a very handsome image. Pay attention to you, can you still be lurking? There is a line in “Kite”, ‘If you don’t come to catch me, I will forget that I am a Kuomintang.’ The spy is going to be elitist.”
Therefore, in “Winner”, Liu Yunlong ingeniously designed his protagonist Tang Fei as a “stuttering agent” with a sense of joy.
The other camp in “Winner” is supported by the Japanese Fukuhara played by Liang Guanhua and Fang Shibao, the Chief of the Police Department played by Li Liqun.
The two powerful actors, one south and one north, add a lot of highlights to the whole show.
Director Yin Fei used the term “Biao Opera” to describe the rivalry between Li Liqun and Liu Yunlong in the play. “It is definitely a Biao Opera. The two of them have a special understanding. The understanding between them is very impactful for me. Many times their The scenes are all “off the shelf”. For example, we only wrote half a page in length. If I didn’t call to stop during filming, the two of them could continue to perform.”
The masters do not rob each other, and the director does not disturb the play. When the actors are in the role and ensure their own character status, they can not only shape the role from the perspective of the character, but also bring more viewing to the audience. Possibility, Yin Fei said that this kind of drama is enough.
In the play, you can also see many familiar faces from the “Liu’s Spy War”. The famous and imposing “Mountain City F4” in “Kite” also gathered three people in “Winner”.
Hou Yu and Liu Mingyang, who once played Song Xiaoan and Zhao Jianzhi, once again played Tang Fei’s right arm.
Director Yin Fei said, “These two people have no roots in them. They just drifted with the crowd in that era and in that environment.”
Liu Yunlong also took the initiative to propose, “We must have a human touch. This human touch means that there must be good and bad people around me, and bad people are enemies, but we must develop them and our team must also grow.”
The ending of the two people in the play was also carefully designed by Liu Yunlong, and he believes that he will give the audience a satisfactory answer.

The Lancet published an article praising China’s efforts to fight the epidemic and encouraging countries to learn from experience
The Lancet magazine published an article on the 25th that China, as a country with a population of 1.4 billion and a scale similar to Europe or the United States, has effectively controlled the COVID-19 at this stage, and there has been no large-scale spread. China has brought the domestic epidemic under control.
The article said that in the past ten years, China has made a lot of investment in domestic research and public health construction, which makes China’s preparations for the COVID-19 much better than its preparations for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).
The author stated that when the SARS outbreak broke out in 2002, China was underprepared at first, especially the pathogen could not be identified.
When COVID-19 was discovered in December 2019, Chinese scientists were soon able to identify the type of virus and shared genome sequencing data with the international community on January 11, 2020.
By the end of January, doctors from mainland China and Hong Kong clarified the clinical characteristics of the virus and warned the world about the threat of the COVID-19 virus through research papers published in The Lancet.
China has also been at the forefront of vaccine research. When the country declares a state of emergency, through close domestic cooperation, such research has been carried out very quickly and strictly. In May and July, China announced on The Lancet respectively. Early trials of the developed COVID-19 vaccine are the result of progress.
China’s experience shows that it is very important to invest in national health and research systems to effectively improve laboratory capabilities.
This is the basis for the country to respond quickly and effectively to health emergencies and global health security.
Other countries, especially low-income and middle-income countries, are very worth learning.
In addition, China’s experience proves that on the basis of strong research, there must be a strong high-level decisive and scientific basis to make correct decisions, so that the COVID-19 can be effectively controlled.
The article emphasizes that the government and its leaders must respect science, understand the value of science, and act on it in the most beneficial way for society.
At the beginning of the outbreak, the National Health and Construction Commission of China sent three groups of infectious disease experts to Wuhan to investigate the risk and spread of the COVID-19 virus. Their suggestions provided the basis for the decision to “close the city” in Wuhan on January 23; when some experts proposed the construction method When the cabin hospital was necessary and urgent, the government quickly made a decision and implemented it quickly; at the same time, the extensive participation of the community and the masses also enabled the epidemic to be quickly and effectively controlled.
At the end of the article, it is emphasized that in response to global health emergencies, countries need to strengthen global cooperation and joint response.

Telecom network fraud crimes rose by 70% in the first half of the year - chinanews.com
chinanews.com, July 26. According to the Supreme Procuratorate website, in the first half of this year, prosecutors nationwide prosecuted 58,101 people for fraud, a year-on-year increase of 35%.
Especially in crimes that hinder the prevention and control of the epidemic, fraud crimes occur frequently, and the number of people prosecuted by the prosecutors for fraud accounted for 43.4% of all crimes that hinder the prevention and control of the epidemic.
The Supreme People’s Procuratorate has carried out targeted guidance. Among the ten batches of typical cases involving epidemic prevention and control that have been released so far, there are 9 cases involving fraud.
Judging from the case handling by the procuratorial organs in the first half of the year, there are many names involved in fraud crimes, ranging from national macro policies to people’s clothing, food, housing and transportation, including epidemic-related fraud, “medical care” fraud, “health care product” fraud, “admission agency” fraud, The “routine loan” fraud, the fraud of obtaining state subsidies, the fraud of national assets unfreezing, etc., continue to “innovate”, covering education, medical care, employment, pension, social security, land acquisition and demolition, targeted poverty alleviation, financial credit and other fields. The victims caused economic losses and also seriously affected economic and social development.
In particular, some telecommunications network frauds break through the restrictions of national boundaries, regions and personnel, and have the characteristics of stakeholder, cross-border, remote, electronic payment, etc., and there are many unspecified victim groups and great harm.
For example, some set up specialized companies, rent high-end office buildings, set up multiple departments or positions, use legal network platforms to promote and recruit, train and assess recruiters, adopt corporate operation mode management, and wear “legal cloak” to confuse Stronger sex.
Punishing and preventing crimes in accordance with the law, and promptly issuing early warnings to the public and relevant departments are the inescapable responsibilities of procuratorial organs.
In handling judicial cases, procuratorial organs conscientiously perform their duties, not only insisting on maintaining a high-pressure posture against fraud crimes, but also targeting specific law enforcement measures, and promoting social governance by issuing procuratorial recommendations.
The procuratorial organs strictly control the facts, evidence, procedures, and application of law in approving and prosecuting fraud cases, based on facts, and the law as the criterion, so as to be indulgent.
Especially for telecommunication network fraud crimes, we pay attention to the core role of electronic data in fact determination, and strive to build an evidence chain that mutually confirms electronic data, verbal evidence, and documentary evidence.
For example, the Yinzhou District Procuratorate of Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province handled a certain epidemic-related fraud case, and the prosecutors intervened as soon as possible. From the occurrence of the case to the completion of the case, it only took 5 days, which reflects that it is handled quickly and strictly, and the overall stability of the society is maintained. Attitude and determination.
In the process of reviewing arrests and reviewing prosecutions, we focused on the prosecution of missed offenders, corrected 733 people who were missed by the public security organs, and corrected the public security organs’ omission to review and prosecute 1113 accomplices.
In the first half of the year, procuratorial organs across the country issued 298 procuratorial recommendations for fraud crimes, promoting joint efforts to prevent fraud crimes and promoting in-depth governance.
For example, in response to the loopholes in the supervision of telecommunications companies, banks, and intermediary organizations found in the handling of the case, the Guangzhou Procuratorate of Guangdong Province and the Dongguan Procuratorate promptly put forward procuratorial recommendations, urging relevant units to strengthen supervision, improve mechanisms, and promote the leaders Effective system construction.
The fourth is to do a good job in recovering stolen goods and saving damage.
Local procuratorial organs seize important links such as intervening in investigations to guide evidence collection, review and prosecution, urge investigative agencies to actively recover stolen money, cooperate with relevant departments to recover stolen money, and strive to minimize the economic losses caused by fraud crimes to the people.
For example, the Lin Moumou routine loan case handled by the Beijing Municipal Procuratorate involved 22 houses waiting to be sealed up. In the case that the real estate may be dealt with in advance by other cases, the original Letter of Suspension of Execution was created and sent to the relevant court in time. It is recommended that the previous seizure of the real estate involved in the case be suspended by the court, and unified disposal after the facts of the crime are ascertained, so as to make the greatest efforts to recover the real estate involved in the case and recover the losses of the victims.
The prosecutor reminded everyone to be very vigilant against fraud and crimes. Don’t expect “pie in the sky”, and don’t be credulous when you think it’s cheap, and keep your “money bag” safe.

The apple produced has high sugar content and good taste. It has a certain reputation in the surrounding areas, but also because of its small size and many spots. Failed to sell at a good price, failed to form an industry scale.
Yina Town used to be a poor township that “wrapped the valleys and potatoes for the spring and autumn”, and the local poverty rate was as high as 25.8% 10 years ago.
As the fight against poverty has entered a critical period of decisive victory, it is urgent to change the traditional planting habits, adjust the industrial structure, and increase the income of farmers.
After many visits, Chen Chao, secretary of the Party Committee of Yinna Town, and a group of people in the town believed that industrial development should not go the same way.
To this end, Yina Town introduced leading enterprises to grow apples in a modern way.
Hou Jianwen, deputy general manager of Weining Chaoyue Agriculture Co., Ltd., came to Yina Town from Shanxi in 2015 for investigation. He saw the local planting conditions at a glance and began to plant apple trees in the local area in 2016.
At first, the village mobilized Li Yuanzhong to transfer the land to plant apple trees. The Li Yuanzhong and his wife murmured in their hearts: “After so many years of planting apples, they have never seen anyone in the village who has grown apples and made a fortune.”
“All the apples are dwarfed apples, which will not allow the apple tree to grow too high.”
What Li Yuanzhong did not expect was that the new method of apple planting was adopted this time. Irrigation pipes were laid under each apple tree. Water and fertilizer were poured to the roots of the tree. When the fruit was harvested in autumn, the tractor drove directly into the orchard and stood there. Can pick fruit.
At present, the Apple base has gradually entered a high-yield period, and the market is as expected by Hou Jianwen. Apples are not worried about selling, and they are deeply loved by consumers in cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou.
The growing apple industry has brought new changes to Li Yuanzhong’s life. Although he is still farming, he has a new source of income.
Li Yuanzhong’s family has more than 9 acres of land transferred to the apple base. In addition to the guaranteed land transfer fee, there are profit dividends after the fruit is harvested. The couple usually work in the base. “One person can get 80 yuan a day and have work all year round. “.
Li Yuanzhong told reporters that last year’s profit distribution received more than 2,800 yuan, plus land transfer fees and the couple’s labor income, and the family’s income was more than 80,000 yuan.
“At present, initial results have been achieved. The annual output value of 1 mu of apples exceeds 15,000 yuan, which is about 10 times that of corn.”
Chen Chao told reporters that the whole town of Yina currently planted 20,000 mu of apples. In Zhonghai Village alone, there are 6,000 mu, covering 4,056 households and 17,200 rural households, including 656 registered poor households with 2,952 people. The annual salary is more than 6 million yuan, and the base has been built in front of the house, so that you don’t have to go out for work.
Li Yuanzhong, whose pockets are bulging day by day, also began to realize his “wish”.
This year, during the Lunar New Year, Li Yuanzhong bought an off-road vehicle. If he drove a car to get off work today, “there is still more than ten acres of land at home. When the Apple base expands in the next step, all of it will be transferred to them and the income will be more.

Membrane separation technology helps crack the “greenhouse effect” - chinanews.com
Membrane separation technology helps crack the “greenhouse effect”
Schematic diagram of new mixed matrix membrane preparation technology
Our reporter Shang Rui reported: Recently, the Tianjin University Atmospheric Environment and Bioenergy Team has made significant progress on the “membrane separation method to capture carbon dioxide” and successfully developed a new hybrid matrix membrane preparation technology, which greatly improves the carbon dioxide capture performance of membrane materials.
Related results have been published as the cover article of the international journal “Greenhouse Gas: Science and Technology”.
The “greenhouse effect” is a major environmental problem that plagues human development, and carbon dioxide emissions are the culprit responsible for the “greenhouse effect”.
How to efficiently capture and use carbon dioxide emitted by humans is the focus of attention of scientists.
“Membrane separation method” is an emerging carbon dioxide capture technology, which separates carbon dioxide gas with the help of membrane materials, and has the characteristics of high efficiency, energy saving, and simple operation.
How to let the membrane material “breathe deeply” and improve the efficiency of gas separation is the bottleneck difficulty in the use of membrane separation to capture carbon dioxide.
The scientific research team of Tianjin University has innovated ideas and through repeated experiments, explored the influence of different solvents on the membrane gas separation performance.
The experimental results show that using N-methylpyrrolidone as the preparation solvent, the carbon nanotubes in the produced membrane material are more evenly distributed and “more air-permeable”, which effectively improves the gas separation efficiency and rate of the membrane material.
The mixed matrix membrane prepared by this new technology has a carbon dioxide separation performance close to the current theoretical separation upper limit of this type of membrane material.
“The new technology provides new ideas for the capture of carbon dioxide by membrane separation.”
Li Run, a member of the Atmospheric Environment and Bioenergy Team of Tianjin University, said: “We hope that this technology can provide strong support for the future coal-fired power plants and chemical companies to deal with flue gas, and play a major role in the control of greenhouse gas emissions and other fields.”
Understand what is a professional level difference before volunteering to fill in the report - chinanews.com

Understand what is a professional difference before volunteering
Every year when applying for the college entrance examination, there are students or parents who do not understand the terms involved in the voluntary reporting, which affects the voluntary reporting.
This year, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing University of Science and Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing Forestry University, and Beijing University of Chemical Technology jointly issued the 2020 enrollment policy to cancel the major difference.
What is the meaning of professional grade difference, and what is its significance in voluntary reporting?
There are three ways of professional assignment rules
Experts remind that before filling in the application, you must read the “Admissions Regulations” of your favorite school to understand the admission rules of the college, including the transfer ratio, professional distribution rules, etc.
The rules of major distribution refer to the three main methods of major admission, major priority, score priority, and major difference after colleges and universities are transferred.
The specific method used by colleges and universities will be specified in the “Admissions Regulations”.
However, the admission principle of some colleges and universities is to give priority to the total score, and there is no difference between majors.
That is to say, candidates in the admission range are queued according to the total score. When the score does not reach the first professional volunteer admission score, it will be determined whether they have reached the second professional volunteer admission score, and so on until the admission to the last professional volunteer, each professional volunteer There is no level difference between them.
The so-called “professional level difference” means that when the college arranges candidates for majors, it determines the admission majors of volunteer candidates from different majors according to one or several points announced in the admissions regulations. This point value is the “professional level difference”.
That is, the difference between the scores of the colleges and universities in the admission of candidates for the first professional and non-first professional volunteers, and the number of grade differences between the professional volunteers, such as 3 points, 2 points, 1 point, etc.
for example.
Suppose that student Xiao Ming applied for college A and scored 560 points. His professional volunteers are: computer, international trade, automation, mechanical engineering, and e-commerce. The professional admission of college A adopts the professional grade difference method, and the grade difference is 2 points and 1 point. , 1 point, 0 point.
When assigning a major, if Xiao Ming’s first major volunteer meets the professional admission requirements and the major has a planned balance, then Xiao Ming is admitted to the “computer” major; if the computer is not admitted, his score will be deducted by 2 points , According to the score of 558 points and the first professional volunteers to apply for “international trade” candidates to determine whether they meet the professional admission requirements; if it is still not met, the score is subtracted by 1 point (ie 557 points) for the third professional volunteer “automation” If it is still not satisfied, the score will be subtracted by 1 point (that is, 556 points) for admission to the fourth major. If the follow-up major still fails to meet the professional wishes, the points will no longer be reduced, and so on.
Different universities have different professional level differences
With the popularization of parallel volunteering, many colleges and universities have now cancelled the professional level difference, but some colleges and universities still retain this method this year. According to the “Admissions Regulations” announced by each school, there are mainly more than 20 colleges this year. The professional level is poor.
For example, Sichuan Agricultural University, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Heilongjiang University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Jiangxi Normal University, Chengdu Medical University, Northeast Dianli University, Jimei University, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing University of Technology, Ningxia University, Shandong University of Technology, China Civil Aviation Flight Academy, etc.
In these universities, the professional level difference set by each university is different.
Some colleges and universities have a grade difference in each major, such as Ningxia University. Candidates who have already submitted their files to the school will be admitted according to the order in which the candidates fill in the professional volunteers, and then they will be admitted according to the score.
And some universities have set up different professional level differences between different majors.
For example, Jimei University has a total score of 4 points for the level of professional volunteers, that is, the level difference between the first professional volunteer and other professional volunteers is 3 points. There is no level difference between other professional volunteers, which is regarded as parallel volunteers. Other professional volunteers and transfer professional volunteers are between majors. The level difference is 1 point.
When filling in their volunteers, candidates and parents must carefully read the admission policy of the school reported to see if there is a professional grade difference and what is the form of the grade difference. While fully considering the scores, they must also reasonably analyze the school and major to be selected. , If the college adopts the grade difference method for admission in the admissions charter, candidates should pay attention to the gradient between the majors when choosing a major to increase the chance of admission.
