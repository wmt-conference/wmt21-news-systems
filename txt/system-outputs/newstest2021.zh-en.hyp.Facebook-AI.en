Xinhua Commentary: Turning outstanding returning migrant workers into a new force for rural revitalization
People are the key to rural revitalization.
Where to find talent?
The excellent group of returned migrant workers is an indispensable force.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 26th: Turning outstanding returning migrant workers into a new force for rural revitalization
Zhang Xiong, 34, lives in Guoyuan Village, Meishan City, Sichuan Province. In 2010, he quit his job in Beijing with a monthly salary of tens of thousands of yuan to return home and start a business.
After several years of hard work, he now runs a grape-growing family farm with an annual income of more than one million yuan, and has become a well-known wealth leader. He has also been selected to join the "two committees" of the village.
In recent years, inspired by a series of policies to support and benefit farmers, such as the country's poverty alleviation and rural revitalization, more and more outstanding migrant workers like Zhang Xiong have chosen to return home and start their own businesses, activating a pool of spring water in the countryside.
Sichuan, a province with a large population in the west of China and a large labor export province, implemented the "Excellent Migrant Workers Recruitment and Training Project" due to snobbery. In 2019 alone, more than 8,000 village party branch secretaries were produced from the excellent migrant workers, 61,000 village reserve forces were cultivated, and more than 20,000 party members were developed.
A well-off person is not a well-off person.
Since the reform and opening up, a large number of young and middle-aged workers in China's rural areas have gone out to work to increase their income, and some have established their own enterprises through hard work.
However, objectively, it has also led to the "hollowing out" of rural areas to varying degrees, especially the weakening of rural grassroots organizations, and the village party branch secretaries and party members have shown the characteristics of "one old and one low," that is, the age is aging, the education is low, the village party organization leaders are not strong, and the green and yellow problems are prominent.
If rural talents and other elements have been flowing in one direction to the city, and the countryside has been in a state of "blood loss" and "anemia" for a long time, revitalization is an empty word.
Attracting back those migrant workers who are capable, conscious, and interested in serving their hometowns, guiding them to return to their hometowns and start businesses to become leaders in getting rich, selecting and training them to become party members and rural cadres, and enriching the ranks of grassroots cadres. This is the solution to the root cause of the shortage of rural party members and grassroots party organizations.
Excellent migrant workers should be brought back, and they should be allowed to stay and work well.
In recent years, Sichuan has begun to pay close attention to the construction of the migrant workers' party, and on the basis of strict selection criteria, has established institutional mechanisms such as targeted referral, service guarantee, training and promotion, and selection and use of outstanding migrant workers, so that they can improve their abilities, have job security, and have hope in life, and really take root in the countryside, and have a sense of achievement in entrepreneurship.
This year is the final year of the decisive battle against poverty, and talent is the key factor to make the connection between poverty alleviation and rural revitalization.
Party committees and governments at all levels should attach great importance to the group of outstanding returning migrant workers, and through comprehensive measures, build them into a working team and a new force that can be retained, can fight, and cannot be taken away, and provide strong organizational support and talent support for rural poverty alleviation and development and revitalization.
Because of the epidemic, this year's college graduates are a very special class. On the evening of July 11, the bilibili summer graduation song will bring a special online live performance for the graduates. Musicians such as Lao Wolf, Park Shu, Li Yuchun, and Mao Feiyi will sing and bless the new graduates.
The well-known up master SealWu Wu Yifan also brought a "Weeds," which is a rap-style song he created based on Lu Xun's prose poetry book of the same name, which is very popular among young people.
Due to the epidemic, many graduates have not been able to experience the ritual of picking ears and awarding degree certificates on the spot, so they have transferred the ritual to the line.
According to the data, the live broadcast of the 2.5-hour concert had a peak popularity of more than 35 million.
"Follow your own heart, seize the opportunity, regardless of the consequences, sometimes there will be unexpected gains."
Although it was a graduation concert, many songs also moved non-graduates.
"The whole scene really wants to cry, whose youth is full of beauty and regret, but it is worth remembering, and we must bravely go on."
Beijing's natural ecology continues to improve, attracting more than 500 species of wild animals to "settle" in the city

The capital's natural ecology continues to improve, attracting wildlife to "settle" in the city
Beijing has more than 500 species of wild animals
Our reporter (reporter Wang Bin) learned from the Beijing Youth Daily that in recent years, as the capital's natural ecological environment has continued to improve, the types and numbers of wild animals have also continued to increase.
At present, the terrestrial vertebrate wildlife inhabiting Beijing has increased to more than 500 species, including national first-class protected animals such as brown horse chicken and black stork, as well as national second-class protected animals such as gazelle, swan, gray crane and stork.
Whether it is an urban forest planted in the Second Ring Road or a small wetland embedded between buildings, it not only brings the wildness of nature to the citizens of the capital, but also attracts wild animals to "settle" in the city.
In midsummer, the Songshan National Nature Reserve, located in the Yanshan Mountains in the northwest of Yanqing District, is full of life.
A toad was playing leisurely by the hillside, while two dog toads were fighting with each other.
Hu Qiaoli, director of the Songshan National Nature Reserve Management Office, said that by the end of 2019, there were 178 species of wild animals living in this green sea with a total area of more than 6,200 hectares, including the national first-level protected animal golden eagle and the national second-level protected animal spoon chicken and zebra antelope. Nearly one-third of the city's wildlife species can be seen here.
"In Matsuyama, wild animals are the real 'masters', and our staff can only be regarded as 'bodyguards' at best."
Hu Qiaoli said that in order to understand the situation of wild animals and plants in the protected area on the ground, more than 30 professional patrol members patrol along 16 carefully formulated protection routes every day, and there will be a "big circle" every month, spending a whole day to walk almost the entire protected area.
"During the inspection, it is not only necessary to check the recording of biodiversity, but also to check the installation of artificial bird nests, the rescue of injured wildlife, the installation of field infrared cameras, etc."
Songshan National Nature Reserve has now installed more than 200 infrared cameras to record the living conditions of wild animals in the forest.
Hu Qiaoli introduced that as the biodiversity of the protected area has been enriched in recent years, more and more wild animals have appeared in the camera, leopard cats, baboons and piglets have become "resident guests," and the "appearance rate" of the national second-class protected animal, the impala, has become higher and higher.
Zhang Zhiming, director of the Wildlife and Wetland Protection Department of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Landscaping, said that Beijing's terrestrial vertebrate wildlife has increased from 461 species in 1994 to more than 500 species now, and the species and number of wild animals in Beijing have continued to increase in recent years.
The appearance of wild animals in the city is becoming more and more common, which is closely related to the escalating greening of the capital city in recent years.
In particular, the new round of afforestation and greening construction of one million mu, which began in 2018, proposes to reshape the urban ecological environment, enhance the ecological functions of woodland and green space, and highlight the concept of "near nature."
The plan strives to achieve interconnection and interaction with the surrounding green space, making it convenient for wild animals to "visit relatives and friends," and the trees planted are also the favorite nectar and food plants of the animals.
Black soil "seeds" agricultural modernization - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 26: Black soil "seeds" the modernization of agriculture
In midsummer, two spraying aircraft flew over the 10,000-acre high-yield demonstration field of the second operation station of the fifth management area of Friendship Farm, forming two white lines, and the words "the world's first field" planted with black rice seedlings in the green field were particularly striking.
Kong Lingqiang, director of the operation station, said that the aircraft can spray chemicals on more than 6,000 acres of cultivated land a day, which is about eight times more efficient than drones and hundreds of times more efficient than manual spraying.
This farm is located in Friendship County, Heilongjiang Province, the largest grain-producing province in China. Traditional Chinese farming and farms have been transformed in this black soil belt, from the sound of rice cutting in the past to the sound of motors today.
In addition to aircraft, satellites are also used in the modern agricultural production of Friendship Farms.
Kong Lingqiang said that on the one hand, they use satellite remote sensing technology to achieve precise fertilization, reduce agricultural input, and reduce pollution; on the other hand, satellite navigation technology can improve the level of standardized operation of agricultural machinery in the field.
In this year's rice production process, the farm expanded the operation area of satellite navigation unmanned planting technology from 3,000 mu last year to 30,000 mu.
This technology makes the planting of seedlings more uniform, maximizes the use of sunlight and cultivated land resources, and saves 16 yuan per acre in labor costs.
Farms have tried new technologies such as information and intelligence in agricultural production, forming the largest agricultural machinery group in China from the ground to the sky.
According to statistics, the total number of agricultural machinery on farms is 49,000 (pieces), and the comprehensive mechanization rate in the field is 99.8%.
Agricultural machinery operations achieve 100% of GPS satellite navigation, 100% of precision seeding in dry fields, and 100% of high-horsepower locomotive operations in dry fields.
"Green agriculture, smart agriculture and digital agriculture are the pathfinding directions for agricultural modernization."
Liu Hualian, director of the Friendship Farm, said.
The key to agricultural modernization lies in scientific and technological progress.
In recent years, Heilongjiang farmers, represented by farms, have played an exemplary and leading role in the "aircraft carrier" of modern agriculture, and initially established a modern agricultural industry system dominated by large-scale planting, standardized production, and industrialized management.
In the outskirts of Friendship County, there is an agricultural machinery exposition park covering an area of 350,000 square meters.
More than 140 (pieces) of agricultural machinery introduced and used by Heilongjiang farmers over the years are exhibited here.
These agricultural machinery and farms have witnessed the development of China's agricultural modernization.
A small house for everyone — Anhui Hefei Jiangkouhe joint mass transfer direct hit - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, July 26th, title: A small home for everyone — Anhui Hefei Jiangkouhe joint mass transfer direct hit
Xinhua reporters Chen Shangying, Wang Liwu and Liu Xiacun
At more than 4 p.m. on July 25, Fu Kunbao, wearing muddy rubber shoes, went back and forth from the front room to the back room with his wife, Zhou Yan, busy packing things.
"When I received the call from the village officials to transfer, I was still weeding in the field."
Fu Kunbao said that he has circulated more than 60 acres of land, planted rice, and is now growing well. "I also took medicine yesterday, and I haven't packed any tools yet."
Fu Kunbao pointed to the pesticide sprayer in the corner. "No one wants to be flooded at home. Let's give up our homes for everyone."
In order to cope with the continuous high water level pressure and possible heavy rainfall in Chaohu, Hefei City, Anhui Province, is preparing to open the Jiangkou River, where Fu Kunbao's home is located, to flood water storage on the 26th.
Jiangkouhe Lianyu is located in Feixi County, close to the Chaohu Dike.
Several thousand villagers in Yandian Township and Sanhe Township need to be relocated.
As of 16:00 on the 25th, the water level of Lake Chaohu, the fifth largest freshwater lake in China, remained at a high level of 13.2 meters, exceeding the guaranteed water level by 0.7 meters.
Fu Kunbao's kitchen was clean and tidy, with a pot of pumpkin soup on the table and eggs and some pickled vegetables in the refrigerator.
"I didn't expect to move, but the water in the Jiangkou River looks good at the moment."
Zhou Yan said that the home is a bungalow, and some large objects have not yet figured out where to put them.
"Pack up your valuables first. Large items such as refrigerators and televisions can be temporarily placed in the homes of neighbors or relatives on higher ground."
Wang Liwen, a village cadre, gave Fu Kunbao an idea.
Wang Lijian was responsible for the relocation and resettlement of 13 villagers, notifying each household and confirming each person's resettlement plan.
The nearest settlement to Fu Kunbao's home is Yandian Township's Su Elementary School, about 2 kilometers away.
In addition to large items, Fu Kunbao and his wife also have more than 1,000 kilograms of grain and some newly purchased furniture.
"The food is ready to be dragged to a relative's house, and the furniture cannot be moved."
The couple discussed and put a stool under the newly purchased bed and raised the bed by about half a meter.
At 6 p.m., Fu Kunbao began to use a tricycle to transport things to relatives, and Zhou Yan continued to clean up at home.
At 11 o'clock in the evening, the couple looked back and forth at home, pulled the electric gate, and prepared to go to the resettlement site.
"Let's hope the water recedes soon."
Fu Kunbao said.
At 9:30 a.m. on July 26, the reporter saw at the site of Jiangkouhe Lianyu that the local authorities had made all preparations before the flood.
Zhang Jilin's small house teamed up with a muscular teenager - Xinhua
The sports youth hot-blooded competition show "Sports Bar Youth" officially landed on Hunan TV on July 11.
Sports leader Zhang Jike and sports assistant Lin Xiaozhai crossed the same stage, Lin Dan and Fu Yuanhui commented on their own styles, and the hard core of the "giant" power pulling device came on the stage, which made the program "burn" full of power.
In the first episode, 11 sports teenagers appeared on the power track, stunning the live audience at the same time, the "strong conflict" "strong confrontation" "strong heart" on the arena also received attention.
Among them, the "strong conflict" came from super-A sports student Qiao Wenyi, who openly provoked Xu Zhibin, known as the "beautiful man" on the same track, before the race, saying that Xu Zhibin's appearance conditions should go to sing and dance programs, and even released the harsh words of "don't cry when you lose."
Some of the comments made the teenagers and sports leaders on the field take a breath.
The "strong confrontation" is more like a fairy fight. Sun Jianqi, known as the "Great Demon King," met Zhang Xindong, who is also strong, and staged a strong showdown.
Their identities are also unexpected, Sun Jianqi is an actor who loves fitness, and Zhang Xindong is a retired special forces member and three-time winner of the Warrior Medal.
At the beginning of the competition, the two teenagers tried their best to pull out the small pole quickly, and the long-lasting confrontation on the big pole made the audience sweat for them.
In the tense situation, Zhang Jike, as one of the leaders of the "Sports Bar Youth" movement, also watched the game carefully.
In the review session, he was also very careful, patiently encouraging the teenager who lost the game and helping every mistake point in the process of resumption.
The sports assistant Lin Xiaozhai is a fancy assist, and she does not hide her appreciation for the young people who value their strength online.
When learning about the overloaded daily training of sports teenagers, it is even more admirable.
Lin Dan and Fu Yuanhui, who are also sports leaders, have their own styles. One is a "prophet" who is calm and relaxed, and the other is a "wild girl" who dispels tension with a smile.
In addition, Jike and Liu, as sports assistants, also created a lot of hilarious topics around sports teenagers.
Church fire in Nantes, France: Parish volunteer admits arson
China News Service, July 26th According to foreign media reports, on July 18th, the famous St. Peter and St. Paul Cathedral, a religious and historical architectural treasure in Nantes, France, was severely damaged in a fire, and the grand organ was completely destroyed.
On the 26th local time, the Nantes prosecutor announced that a parish volunteer who was responsible for the protection work in the cathedral had been charged with "arson and destruction."
He has admitted that he lit the fire in the church.
According to the report, local prosecutor Senas said that the 39-year-old parish volunteer from Rwanda admitted that he lit three fires in the cathedral at night.
The man's lawyer said the arsonist now regrets doing it.
This person entered France a few years ago through the asylum route, was sheltered in the parish where the fire occurred, and was sheltered in the church.
The prosecution pointed out that recently, he tried to renew his visa and was communicating with the police station about it.
But the church said it still could not believe that this usually very kind, smiling, but not very talkative believer would destroy the church he loved so much.
On the day of the fire on July 18, the volunteer had already been questioned by the police because of illogical questions in the narrative, but he was later released.
The picture shows firefighters carrying out rescue at the scene.
On the evening of the 25th, due to the new evidence obtained by the professional engineers in the laboratory of the Paris Central Police Station, the person was summoned again.
This time, the man admitted to setting the fire.
According to reports, the suspect could face 10 years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros if convicted of deliberate arson and destruction.
According to the report, the fire caused serious damage to the Cathedral of St. Pierre and St. Paul. The organ in the church was completely burned, and the stained glass window behind the organ was also severely damaged.
Brunet, the chief architect of France's historic preservation architecture, believes that the restoration of Nantes Cathedral will take at least three years.
Comprehensive News: US unilateralism undermines bilateral relations International public opinion supports China's countermeasures against the US - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26 (Xinhua) -- On the morning of July 24, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the U.S. Embassy in China that China has decided to revoke the establishment and operation license of the U.S. Consulate General in Chengdu and put forward specific requirements for the Consulate General to stop all operations and activities.
International public opinion believes that the unilateral measures taken by the United States have caused serious trouble to the relations between China and the United States, and that it is legitimate and necessary for China to respond to the unreasonable provocations of the United States and take countermeasures.
Andres Borquez, director of the China Research Center of the Institute of International Studies of the University of Chile, said that the unilateral measures of the United States have destroyed the bridge of understanding between the people of China and the United States and caused a crisis in the relationship between the two major powers.
China's notice to the United States to close its Consulate General in Chengdu is a countermeasure to the US unilateral measures and is in line with diplomatic practice.
Patricio Giusto, a professor at the Catholic University of Argentina and director of the Argentina-China Research Center, believes that China's decision is a legitimate and necessary countermeasure to previous provocations by the United States, and is not aimed at ordinary Americans.
The United States is trying to divert the attention of the American people by pressuring China to cover up its inadequate response to the new coronavirus epidemic.
Bambang Suryono, chairman of the Asian Innovation Research Center, an Indonesian think tank, said that the United States has adopted a provocative diplomatic posture, which has caused serious trouble to the relations between China and the United States, and the relations between the two countries are facing serious challenges.
China's notice to the United States to close its Consulate General in Chengdu is a normal countermeasure, in line with diplomatic practice, which not only reflects China's principled position of resolutely safeguarding its own interests, but also reflects the reasonableness and advantages of China's diplomacy.
Tanzanian commentator Francis Semwinza said that China's decision was a legitimate and necessary response to US provocations.
For Sino-US relations to return to normal, the US should take the initiative to improve relations with China and stop interfering in China's internal affairs.
The United States should focus on how to achieve a win-win situation with China economically and politically, and how to benefit the people of both countries and the entire international community.
Ali Yusuf, executive director of the Sudan-based Federation of Arab-Chinese Friendship Associations, said that the countermeasures China was forced to take were a legitimate and necessary response to the unreasonable actions of the United States, in line with international law and the basic norms of international relations, as well as diplomatic practice.
Earlier, the US side demanded the closure of the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, which seriously violated international law and the basic norms of international relations.
It is hoped that the US will revoke its previous decision and create the necessary conditions for the normalization of bilateral relations.
Singapore's Lianhe Zaobao published an editorial saying that the United States' larger strategic intention is to contain China and prevent China from continuing to rise.
In the face of the United States' step-by-step pressure, although China is very reluctant to see Sino-US relations continue to deteriorate, it has to take countermeasures.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 26 (Reporter Mao Xin) The reporter learned from the Guangdong Coast Guard Bureau that recently, the Bureau, together with the Guangzhou Customs and Public Security Department, defeated a large-scale smuggling gang of refined oil products, and preliminarily verified that the gang had smuggled about 120,000 tons of refined oil products since 2019, with a value of about 800 million yuan, and evaded taxes of about 240 million yuan.
The Guangdong Coast Guard Bureau and the Customs Anti-Smuggling Department have gradually figured out the division of labor and organizational structure of the gang.
On July 8, the coast guard, customs and public security departments carried out unified net collection operations in Guangzhou, Foshan and other places as well as in the waters of the Pearl River Estuary, seizing four suspected smuggling vessels on the spot, seizing a total of 4,700 tons of refined oil products in the ships and oil depots involved, and freezing a number of financial accounts.
It is understood that the joint operation dispatched a total of eight ships and two helicopters, divided into a number of action groups to fight together, and carried out a full-chain crackdown on maritime smuggling, land-based illegal operations and other links, and all 35 major criminal suspects were arrested.
The case is currently under further investigation.
The relevant person in charge of the Guangdong Coast Guard Bureau said that in the future, it will continue to maintain a high-pressure situation, crack down on all kinds of smuggling and criminal activities at sea, and maintain good order in the waters under its jurisdiction.
Hurricane "Hannah" makes landfall in Texas, may cause river surges and flash floods - China News Service
China News Service, July 26th Comprehensive foreign media reported that at 5 p.m. local time on the 25th, Hurricane "Hannah" landed in Texas, the United States, which will bring strong storms and rain to Texas, river surges, and may also cause life-threatening flash floods.
The National Hurricane Center says Hurricane Hanna is expected to sweep through parts of southern and northeastern Texas with heavy rains that could cause some creeks to swell and life-threatening flash floods.
According to the report, the worst affected by Hurricane Hanna is the area south of Corpus Christi to the mouth of the Rio Grande River, and the Rio Grande Valley may experience widespread flash floods.
Texas Governor Abbott said on the 25th: “Any hurricane is a huge challenge.”
Thirty-two counties in the state are under a state of disaster emergency because of the hurricane.
Corpus Christi, a city of more than 320,000 people, has closed its libraries and museums as residents brace for the worst.
Abbott also said that the hurricane should not be allowed to bring more casualties to Texas at a time when the state is being hit hard by the new coronavirus epidemic.
According to reports, precipitation in southern Texas is expected to reach 6 to 12 inches overnight on the 26th, and 3 to 5 inches of rain will also fall in northern Texas and coastal Louisiana.
Due to global warming and other factors, Hanna formed earlier than previous Atlantic hurricane seasons.
Typically, the first hurricane in the Atlantic does not form until mid-August.
Poland to withdraw from European treaty on preventing violence against women
Poland will take steps next week to withdraw from a European treaty on preventing violence against women, the justice ministry said Saturday.
Poland's right-wing government cabinet said the treaty trampled on the rights of parents by requiring schools to teach students about gender issues.
Poland's Justice Minister Józef Piłsudski told a news conference that his ministry would submit a request to the Ministry of Labor and Family on Monday to begin the process of withdrawing from the treaty.
That treaty is also known as the Istanbul Convention.
"The treaty contains elements that we consider to be of a pernicious ideological nature," Joublot said.
Poland's ruling Law and Justice party and its coalition partners are closely allied with the Roman Catholic Church and promote a conservative social agenda.
Polish President Andrzej Duda made hostility to gay rights one of the main issues during his successful re-election campaign this month.
On Friday, thousands of Poles, mostly women, protested in Warsaw and other cities against withdrawing from the convention.
"The purpose of withdrawing from the treaty is to legalize domestic violence," Lempat, one of the protest organizers, said at a protest march in Warsaw.
Some protesters carried banners that read "PiS is hell for women."
Law and Justice has long complained about the Istanbul Convention.
Poland's previous centrist-led government ratified the convention in 2015.
The Law and Justice government says the treaty does not respect religion and requires liberal social policies to be taught in schools.
But so far the party has not decided to withdraw from the convention.

Jiangxi opens up a "green channel" for young people on the front line of flood control to enlist in the army - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, July 26 (Guo Dongming, Xiong Liang) The Recruitment Office of the People's Government of Jiangxi Province recently made it clear that individuals or their children who have performed outstandingly in this flood rescue and disaster relief mission, meet the requirements for recruitment, and are qualified in both medical examination and political assessment, will be given priority.
"After the registration of the conscripted youth, we will give priority to the conscription after the verification of the community where the conscripted youth is located, the street armed forces department and the recruitment office of Poyang District."
Wang Hui, vice minister of the Ministry of People's Armed Forces of Poyang District, Jiujiang City, said that due to the impact of the floods, they began on the 25th and concentrated on organizing medical examinations for young conscripts for three days.
Zhou Jingfan, a 22-year-old college graduate from Poyang District, Jiujiang City, is a conscripted youth. His mother is a community worker, and his father is a veteran of a certain department of the Air Force. For the past ten days, Zhou Jingfan's parents have been on duty on the front line of flood control.
"These days, I see in the news that the people's soldiers are defending their hometown on the front line of the flood, and I want to be like them."
Zhou Jingfan said that he had a dream of joining the military since he was a child, and his determination to join the military camp was strengthened through this flood.
Jiujiang City also regards flood control and rescue as a "living textbook" for conscription propaganda. Taking the community as a unit, they call on conscripted young people to voluntarily participate in tasks such as patrolling dikes and being on duty, so as to understand the nature and purpose of the people's army on the spot and strengthen their confidence in joining the army and serving the country.

The upgraded version of the Russian Ka-52M helicopter gunship will leave the factory for the first time at the end of the year - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 25th According to the plan of the Russian Ministry of Defense, the upgraded version of the Russian armed helicopter (hereinafter referred to as Wuzhi) Ka-52 - Ka-52M will be completed for the first time in December this year. The model will have a greater improvement in reconnaissance, communication and weapons performance.
According to a recent report by Russia's Izvestia newspaper, the Wuzhika-52M is called the "Super Alligator," and its development contract was signed by the Russian military and military-industrial units in April last year. At present, the first two of the upgraded version of the Wuzhika are undergoing transformation and refitting at the Far East Helicopter Manufacturing Plant of the Russian "Progress" Aerospace Group Company. Its national-level testing and improvement will be completed by October 2022.
According to Russian experts familiar with the above-mentioned upgrade work, the "super alligator"'s "predecessor" - the WZ-52 - was officially put into service in November 2011. The model has exposed some weaknesses in use, and this transformation and upgrade is to "make up for the shortcomings."
The report said that compared with the Ka-52, the Ka-52M will partly use new protective materials that do not add weight. Its pilot's cockpit will be reinforced and equipped with new equipment to resist missile attacks, thereby increasing the probability of battlefield survival; it will be equipped with more powerful generators to power more complex on-board electronic equipment; the optoelectronic system will be upgraded to be able to detect and identify battlefield targets at greater distances; it will be equipped with a new light multi-purpose missile that mainly attacks armored combat vehicles and reinforced concrete fortifications, with a range of 20 kilometers, which is about twice the range of similar missiles used by Russia's active armed forces; its defensive weapons and communication equipment will be maximally compatible with the Mi-28NM helicopter gunship that can attack air targets, making related maintenance easy and economical.
In addition, the Ka-52M will have more advanced electronic guidance systems, weapons targeting systems and navigation equipment.
Russian experts also said that it is noteworthy that the Ka-52M will be equipped with communication equipment to communicate with UAVs, so as to obtain real-time information transmitted by nearby UAVs in the air, such as displaying images taken by UAVs on the cockpit screen of the helicopter.
According to the plan, the pilot of the Ka-52M can directly control the UAV with which it cooperates, thereby improving the pilot's grasp of the battlefield situation and the guidance of long-range missiles.
According to Russian media reports, Russian Deputy Defense Minister Krivoruchko said in December last year that the Russian Ministry of Defense plans to buy more than 110 WZK-52Ms by 2027.
The new decree stipulates that masks must be worn in indoor public places in the Campania region from now on. Violators can be fined up to 1,000 euros.
On June 1, local time, Rome, the capital of Italy, reopened the Colosseum.
According to reports, according to the latest epidemic prevention decree issued by the regional government, people in Campania must wear masks on all public transport and indoor public places such as shops, bars, supermarkets and exhibition halls in accordance with the epidemic prevention requirements.
Violation of this provision is punishable by a fine of up to 1,000 euros.
The decree also stipulates that all passengers from non-Schengen countries entering the Campania region must be quarantined.
The regional government will authorize health agencies to coordinate the arrangement of specific hotels to quarantine positive asymptomatic people.
The decree came into effect on July 25.
In less than an hour, three customers who had entered the supermarket accepted the fine.
Hebei has replenished 1.75 billion cubic meters of ecological water in rivers and lakes so far this year
Xinhua News Agency, Shijiazhuang, July 26 (Reporter Wang Kun) The reporter learned from the Water Resources Department of Hebei Province that since the beginning of this year, Hebei Province has coordinated the use of river water and local reservoir water, and has successively implemented ecological water replenishment to 28 rivers such as the Wei River, the Tang River, the Yuma River and Baiyangdian, and has completed a total of 1.75 billion cubic meters of ecological water replenishment of rivers and lakes.
Hebei Province seized the favorable opportunity to increase the flow of water in the middle line of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project, and implemented ecological water replenishment by diverting river water to rivers such as the Tang River, the Sha River, and the Yulong River.
At the same time, nine large and medium-sized reservoirs such as West Ocean and Dongwushi and Baiyangdian were used to implement ecological water replenishment to rivers such as Poyang River and Qinglong River, resulting in a total water surface area of more than 90 square kilometers.
In order to do a good job in ecological water replenishment, the Water Resources Department of Hebei Province has actively organized and carried out the investigation of hidden dangers in water replenishment rivers, the rectification and reinforcement, and the cleaning of river channels, refined the practical measures, and strengthened the inspection and management.
Through supervision and inspection and centralized unannounced visits, various problems were solved in a timely manner, ensuring the safe and orderly replenishment of the river.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Water Resources Department of Hebei Province, the orderly implementation of the ecological replenishment of rivers and lakes has effectively restored the ecological environment of rivers and lakes in Hebei Province, promoted the replenishment and conservation of groundwater along the coast, and greatly improved the living environment and economic development environment along the route. It is of great significance to achieve the goal of river and lake management and protection of "clear water, green shore, smooth river and beautiful scenery."
(Deutsche Welle Chinese Network) In the past two weeks, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Spain has rebounded sharply, with thousands of new cases appearing on many days.
The British government temporarily decided on the evening of Saturday (July 25) to remove Spain from the safe travel list from midnight local time on the 26th, and people entering the UK from Spain must be quarantined for 14 days.
British tourists on holiday in Spain have expressed surprise, concern and even anger at the decision, which came out of the blue.
Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, is also reported to be on holiday in Spain.
The UK's quarantine measures come after Norway announced a 10-day quarantine for people returning to Norway from Spain.
France and Belgium have advised their citizens to abandon their holiday plans in Barcelona and the surrounding area.
The beaches in these areas are overcrowded and it is impossible to maintain social distance between people, and the police need to take measures to reduce the number of beach visitors.
Tourism is an important pillar industry in Spain
Spain: It's safe here
In response to the UK's decision, Spain's foreign ministry said on Sunday that the country's outbreak was under control.
Spanish Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya stressed to the media that "Spain is safe, not only for Spaniards, but also for tourists."
The Spanish government will try to persuade the British government to exclude the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands from quarantine measures.
The reason is that the infection rate in the two tourist resorts is much lower than that in mainland Britain.
In order to prevent the spread of the epidemic, Spain's Catalonia region has also restarted the "foot ban."
Tourism is an important pillar industry in Spain, and Spain is one of the most popular holiday destinations for British tourists.
The UK's decision is expected to hit Spain's tourism industry hard.

First Day of Zhongfu: Beijing Temporarily Suspends High Temperatures and Sweltering Heat, Opens Rainfall Mode - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26 (Reporter Ni Yuanjin) July 26 is the first day of "Zhongfu" this year.
In the early morning of the 26th, the wind and rain convective weather dispersed the high temperature and heat that had enveloped the Beijing area for several days, and a new round of rainy weather will continue for several days.
The Beijing Meteorological Observatory announced at 11:00 on the 26th that there were scattered showers (with weak thunder and lightning) in Beijing on the 26th, and the daily maximum temperature was only 27 °C; there was light to moderate rain (with weak thunder and lightning) at night, and the minimum temperature at night was 23 °C.
Prior to this, from the 24th to the 25th, the whole city of Beijing was in a high-temperature blue warning, and the maximum daily temperature in most areas was around 37 °C, with local high temperatures exceeding 40 °C.
Futen is the highest temperature, humid and sultry day of the year. There are "three volts" in a year, and the hottest is in the middle volt. The Chinese people say "bitter summer" is at this time.
At the time of the invasion, the family filled the barn, and the people had a saying of "one volt dumplings and two volts noodles."
According to the current forecast, it will be cloudy and rainy in Beijing for the next three days.
The meteorological department urged the public to minimize travel in mountainous areas and beware of geological disasters.
It is understood that this year's "Zhongfu" has 20 days, starting from July 26 and ending on August 14.
After entering the "middle volt," people will feel weak and lose their appetite.
On the diet, you can choose foods such as mung beans and quinoa, which have the effect of clearing heat and relieving heat, strengthening the spleen and appetizing, as well as bitter foods such as bitter vegetables and bitter melons, which can help increase appetite and remove heat.
Engine may stall, FAA orders urgent inspection of 2,000 Boeing airliners - Xinhua
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an emergency airworthiness directive on the 24th, requiring an emergency inspection of about 2,000 Boeing 737NG and 737Classic passenger aircraft registered in the United States, because the corrosion of the air check valve of the above-mentioned passenger aircraft may cause the engine to stop in the air.
The FAA said it has so far received four reports of 737NG and 737Classic engines stalling in the air, prompting it to order emergency inspections of planes that have been parked for seven days or more and those that have flown fewer than 11 times since returning to service.
The FAA warned that if the Level 5 check valves on both engines of the airliner were corroded, they could become stuck in the open position, causing the airliner to completely lose power and be unable to restart the engines.
The aviation regulator ordered that once the check valve is found to be corroded, the airline operator must replace this key component before the passenger aircraft is put into service again.
Boeing responded later in the day that the outbreak of the new crown epidemic has led to a decrease in travel demand, and many passenger aircraft have been mothballed or used less. "The check valve is more susceptible to corrosion."
Boeing also said that it has advised air operators to inspect the passenger aircraft involved in the directive, and if problems are found, Boeing will provide assistance in the repair and replacement of check valves.
The Associated Press reported that the passenger aircraft of major US airline operators usually fly many times a day, but after the outbreak of the new crown epidemic, a large number of passenger aircraft were grounded; with the recent slow growth in passenger travel demand, some passenger aircraft were put back into operation.
The FAA did not release details of the four air-stop reports.
Alaska Airlines disclosed one of the incidents later on the 24th.
The airline operator said in a statement that one of its passenger planes was flying from Seattle, Washington, to Austin, Texas, on July 15 when an engine suddenly stopped. The passenger plane eventually made a successful emergency landing at Austin Airport.
Alaska Airlines says it has replaced the plane's engine and has inspected the engines of six planes in accordance with FAA directives.
American Airlines, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines said on the 24th that their passenger aircraft did not have engine stalls associated with air check valves.
Four American Airlines planes will be inspected, and 28 United Airlines planes will be inspected.
Delta Air Lines said it would inspect 20 of its planes, but did not say whether there had been any engine shutdowns.
According to multiple media reports, the FAA's emergency airworthiness directive is another blow to Boeing.
A Boeing 737 MAX aircraft of Indonesia's Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashed in October 2018 and March 2019, respectively, killing 346 people in total.
This series of airliners was subsequently grounded worldwide, and production was suspended in January this year and resumed in May.
FAA Administrator Steve Dickson admitted in June that the FAA had "made mistakes" in its oversight of Boeing over the 737 MAX.
"Ding Dong Online! Good Teacher" will be launched next week, led by Xue Zhaofeng, "Knowledge Initiator" - Xinhua.com
There are new variety shows on the line.
The interactive knowledge-sharing program "Ding Dong Online! Good Teacher" will be broadcast on Hunan TV from July 20.
It is understood that the program will create a new all-age youth classroom, and a group of colorful and talented teachers will go into battle to challenge the export of interesting knowledge.
Unlike the previous serious impression of the teacher group in the public's mind, "Ding Dong Online! Good Teacher" gathers a group of intellectual representatives with both beauty and talent.
They are not only young intellectual role models from various disciplines, but also a group of all-rounders who can shake their burdens and are good at teaching and entertaining.
In the program, this group of outstanding young knowledge role models as "knowledge sharing officers" will challenge interesting knowledge classes.
They need to impress the audience present by showing the most interesting side of their discipline through attitudinal knowledge output.
The "Question and Answer Group" composed of viewers of all ages will ask a variety of questions on the spot, which will make it more difficult for the "Knowledge Sharing Officer" to teach, and also add a little stimulating atmosphere to the program.
It is revealed that among the "knowledge sharing officers" are outstanding young teachers such as Li Yongle, a physics teacher at a secondary school affiliated with Renmin University of China, Zhang Xuefeng, a famous teacher of the entrance examination, and Wang Lei, a history teacher with ten years of experience, who will show the "hard core" knowledge of various disciplines to the audience in an unexpected way.
In addition, the program also invited Xue Zhaofeng, a professor of economics, as the "intellectual initiator" of the program, to talk about youth with the audience and create a "public youth class for the whole people" together with Du Haitao and Zou Mengjia, the "teaching assistants."
Chief Secretary for Administration of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region: The situation is grim and we will do our best to fight the epidemic
Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, July 26 - Zhang Jianzong, Chief Secretary for Administration of the Hong Kong SAR Government, said on the 26th that the situation of the new crown pneumonia epidemic in Hong Kong continues to be grim. If the epidemic worsens, the SAR Government will resolutely take stricter control measures to further restrict the operation of business premises and reduce the space for citizens to go out.
However, at this stage, the SAR government has no intention of introducing a "stay-at-home order" or a "foot ban" to restrict citizens from going out.
Zhang Jianzong published a blog entitled "The situation is grim, fight the epidemic with all your might" on the same day.
He said that this wave of the epidemic is the most severe in six months, and the next two weeks will be very critical to try to prevent the virus from spreading further in the community.
In addition to the necessary measures taken by the SAR government, citizens' self-discipline and cooperation are also very important.
He called on the public to stay at home as much as possible and reduce social contact and dining out.
The public should cooperate with the mandatory measures of wearing masks to protect themselves and others, and pay attention to personal and environmental hygiene and frequent hand washing. In addition, non-essential gatherings of relatives and friends or meals should be suspended and reduced to street markets.
He said that the central government has always been very concerned about the changes in the epidemic situation in Hong Kong and supported the SAR government's anti-epidemic and anti-epidemic work, and actively responded to the Chief Executive's latest request to provide assistance in increasing testing capacity and converting the Asia International Expo Hall into a similar "cabin hospital."
Zhang Jianzong said that the free virus testing provided by the SAR government for specific high-risk groups, namely employees of elderly homes, disabled homes and nursing homes, restaurant employees, taxi drivers and property management employees, has been fully implemented, involving as many as 400,000 people.
He is very concerned about the cases of infection in elderly care homes, and the SAR government has arranged specific temporary quarantine centers for elderly care home residents.
He said that the SAR Government is constructing an isolation and quarantine facility near the Bamboo Bay Quarantine Centre on Lantau Island in the New Territories, which is expected to provide an additional 700 isolation rooms by the end of September.
The Chief Executive also announced on the 19th that the SAR government will build an additional 2,000 isolation rooms at the Zhuqiwan Quarantine Center, and strive to complete it by the end of this year.
In addition to the 800 isolation and quarantine centers that have already been put into use, the Zhujiwan Quarantine Center is expected to provide a total of 3,500 isolation rooms by the end of the year.
Hong Kong currently has four isolation and quarantine centres in operation, providing a total of about 2,600 isolation rooms.
In addition, the SAR government reopened the Lei Yue Mun Park Resort on Hong Kong Island on the 24th as a community isolation facility for patients under the age of 50 who are capable of independent self-care.

A magnificent history of the Party and the history of New China records the arduous struggle and glorious course of the Communist Party of China since its birth, and shows the faith and loyalty forged by the Communists with their lives and blood, and the original intention and mission they will always adhere to.
History is the best textbook. For Party members and cadres, the history of the Party and the history of New China are the most important chapters in this textbook.

"Stuffing Jiangnan" in Pursuit of the Poetic "Dream of the Yellow River"
(China's Poverty Reduction Story) "Stuck in the South of the Yangtze River" Pursuing the Poetic "Dream of the Yellow River"
China News Service, Yinchuan, July 26 (Yang Di) "Jiuquan Yellow River Wanli Sand, waves and winds from the end of the world. "
The Yellow River, which has aroused the pride of countless literati, has given birth to the beautiful and rich Ningxia Plain. Today, Ningxia, which has the reputation of "stuffing Jiangnan," is adhering to the concept of "ecological priority and green development" and pursuing the poetic "Yellow River dream."
River Qingshui's "Bibo Dream"
The Yellow River, which flows 397 kilometers through Ningxia, is the "mother river" of the nurturing side.
However, with the rapid advancement of industrialization and urbanization, there is an imbalance between the development and utilization of rivers and lakes and the management and protection of rivers and lakes, and chaos such as excessive pollution, land reclamation around lakes, and encroachment on waters have become prominent, resulting in black and smelly water bodies, excessive water quality, dirty environment, and ecological degradation.
Now, Ningxia is promoting the restoration of water ecological diversity and striving to restore the water quality of the Yellow River.
Water control must start at the source.
In Yinchuan, Ningxia, the local government adopted the "bidding + pollution control + strict management" approach, all the sewage in the industrial park was centralized, all the urban sewage treatment plants achieved the first-class A standard discharge, and the black and smelly water in the urban built-up area was basically eliminated, and the third batch of China's black and smelly water demonstration cities was successfully declared.
In addition, Ningxia fully implemented the river and lake long system in 2017, and now has achieved full coverage of the five-level river and lake long system responsibility system in districts, cities, counties and villages, and river and lake long river patrol has become the norm.
Gu Jincheng, 64, who lives in a village near the Yellow River, has witnessed the changes in the Yellow River: "The water used to have a bad smell, but after the renovation, the smell has disappeared."
Gu Jincheng said that the ecological environment is good, his life is more comfortable, and now he often goes to the Yellow River with his family to take a walk and feel the blue sky.
The "wetland dream" of Sha Xiangji
Flying birds, green trees, boardwalks, clear water... The beauty of Fan Zhongyan's "Sand Dragonfly Collection" has become a reality in the Yellow River Wetland Park in Yinchuan, Ningxia.
The Yellow River flows through Ningxia, forming a variety of wetlands such as river wetlands, lake wetlands, and swamp wetlands along the way, which plays an important role in promoting the rational use of water resources and the ecological balance of water, and has also become an internationally important bird migration channel.
Since 2009, the relevant departments of Ningxia have invested a total of about 3.45 billion yuan in wetland protection projects. At present, the wetland area of Yinchuan is 19,200 hectares, the wetland protection rate is 78.5%, there are nearly 200 natural lakes and swamp wetlands, and there are five national wetland parks, one national urban wetland park, six autonomous region-level wetland parks, and eight municipal parks.
Lu Jinhu, deputy director of the Yinchuan Wetland Protection Center, told reporters that wetland protection has increased biodiversity, which is particularly evident in birds. "The widow is an endangered bird, there are only more than 20,000 in the world, of which more than 2,000 inhabit the Yinchuan Wetland."
At the same time, Ningxia has legally delineated a red line of 500 meters between the wetland protection areas on both sides of the Yinchuan section of the Yellow River, stipulating that except for public welfare projects, no unit or individual may carry out development, construction or business activities within the protected area.
Zhao Shaoyong, deputy director of the Yinchuan Water Conservancy Service Center, said that through the treatment of pollution sources, the comprehensive improvement of river and lake ecology, and the construction of terminal wetlands, the water quality of nine main drainage ditches in Ningxia has now reached 100% of Class IV standards. "Now the water is clear, the fish are swimming, and the flowers are blooming."
The "dream of drinking water" for universal people's livelihood
Yinchuan City in Ningxia once had an "embarrassing" title: the only city along the Yellow River that "guarded the Yellow River for lack of water to drink."
Since 2010, Yinchuan has been facing the problem of water shortage during the continuous summer peak, and the "pain of water shortage" in the past decade has become a painful summer experience for many high-rise residents. However, under the current situation where major water sources are at the limit of over-extraction and a large area of groundwater over-extraction funnel area has been formed under the urban area, water shortage has become a problem plaguing Yinchuan.
Thanks to the improvement of the water quality of the Yellow River, drinking purified Yellow River water has become a good way to solve the drinking water problems of local residents.
Ding Ming, deputy director of the Yinchuan Municipal Water Bureau, said that in order to improve the living and production water needs of urban and rural residents in Yinchuan, Ningxia timely launched the Yinchuan Metropolitan Area Urban and Rural West Line Water Supply Project to replace the original groundwater source with high-quality Yellow River water.
"On December 29, 2019, the water supply project was officially opened to the three districts of Yinchuan City, and in 2020, residents of Yining Town and Helan County also drank the Yellow River water."
Ding Ming said that the Yinchuan water conservancy department will consider the transformation of the integration of regional rural drinking water and urban water supply. "In the next step, we will integrate the scattered rural water supply points and connect them all to the western water supply project. It is expected that the urban and rural integrated water supply in Yinchuan will be basically realized by the end of this year."
Compaction Responsibility All Departments Strengthen Flood Control and Disaster Relief Work
Compaction Responsibility All Departments Strengthen Disaster Prevention and Relief Work
CCTV News (News Network): According to the Ministry of Water Resources, at 12 o'clock today (July 25), the over-alert water level in the lower reaches of the main stream of the Huai River, Wangjiaba, was 0.64 to 3.31 meters, and the over-alert water level in the lower reaches of the middle and lower reaches of the main stream of the Yangtze River, Shashi, and the two lakes was 0.05 to 2.02 meters.
Taihu Lake has been above the warning level for 28 days since June 28.
At 12 o'clock today, the average water level of Taihu Lake was 4.67 meters, exceeding the guaranteed level by 0.02 meters.
Today, the National Defense Commission deliberated and decided to continue to maintain the Yangtze River and Huai River flood control level II response, requiring all localities to consolidate their responsibilities and further implement flood control and disaster relief work.
Today, the National Defense Office and the Ministry of Emergency Management urgently dispatched professional plow trucks from Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Fujian to help Jiangxi solve local problems such as urban flooding caused by heavy rainfall.
For the first time, the United States has launched a countervailing investigation against China for "undervaluing the RMB exchange rate"
In response to the recent announcement by the US Department of Commerce that it has decided to launch an anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigation on cable ties (cable ties) products originating in China, and to launch an investigation on the "RMB exchange rate undervaluation" project.
China's Ministry of Commerce pointed out that this is the first time that the United States has investigated the so-called "renminbi exchange rate undervaluation" project in an anti-subsidy case, which China firmly opposes.
China's Ministry of Commerce issued a special press release on the evening of the 23rd, saying that China implements a managed floating exchange rate system based on market supply and demand, with reference to a basket of currencies, and the market plays a decisive role in the formation of the exchange rate.
The press release stressed that, on the whole, the RMB exchange rate is at a reasonable and balanced level and is not undervalued.
Since 2005, the RMB has appreciated by more than 17% against the US dollar.
According to data released by the Bank for International Settlements, from the beginning of 2005 to May 2020, the nominal effective exchange rate of the RMB appreciated by 38%, and the real effective exchange rate appreciated by 49%, making it the strongest currency among the G20 economies and one of the currencies with the largest appreciation in the world.
The Ministry of Commerce pointed out that the exchange rate issue exceeds the authority of members to conduct countervailing investigations in accordance with World Trade Organization rules.
In February this year, the United States amended its regulations to conduct countervailing investigations on other countries' exchange rates, which has been suspected of violating the WTO rules of the WTO and has been opposed in many ways.
According to the press release, even according to US regulations, the applicant's complaint contains a large number of errors and does not have the necessary anti-subsidy elements such as financial support, benefit award and specificity.
China urges the United States to abide by existing international rules and stop countervailing investigations into the so-called "undervaluation of the RMB exchange rate."
Affected by the further rise in tensions between China and the United States, the offshore and onshore RMB exchange rates against the US dollar fell sharply on the 22nd, both falling below the threshold of 7.0 yuan per US dollar.
Whether the US Department of Commerce's move is intended to force up the RMB is worth paying attention to.
The spot exchange rate of the yuan against the US dollar rose above the 7.0 mark on the 23rd, closing at 6.9961.
The central parity rate of the yuan against the US dollar, which is subject to official control, was lowered by 17 basis points to 6.9938 on the 24th.
As the epidemic gradually improved, the film and television industry, which had been silent for nearly half a year, gradually returned to normal.
Recently, the Organizing Committee of the 26th Shanghai Television Festival announced the shortlist for this year's Magnolia Awards.
In terms of the best male and female actors, the powerful Mesozoic actors have an absolute advantage. Lei Jiayin, Chen Baoguo, Zhang Ruohui, Sun Honglei and Huang Lei will compete for the best male actor, while Haiqing, Ma Yili, Qin Haitao, Sun Wei and Renee will compete for the best female actor.
The results will be officially announced on August 7.
From the current point of view, from the topic of the college entrance examination, the reality education TV series "Little Joy," which depicts the "Chinese-style family," won a total of 6 nominations for "Best Chinese TV Series," "Best Director," "Best Screenwriter," "Best Actress" and "Best Supporting Actor / Actress."
The "Best Male and Female Lead" award has always been one of the focuses of the outside world, and this year's competition is particularly fierce. The shortlisted male and female actors are all strong performers. Chen Baoguo, Huang Lei, Lei Jiayin, Sun Honglei and Zhang Ruojun will compete for the "Best Male Lead."
Chen Baoguo, Huang Lei and Sun Honglei are all well-qualified middle-aged actors, and 37-year-old Lei Jiayin is also a strong actor, while 32-year-old Zhang Ruohui is the youngest finalist.
In 2016, the 34-year-old Hu Ge won the Magnolia Award for Best Actor for "Gongbang," becoming the youngest actor to win the award. This year, if Zhang Ruoxuan can beat several other predecessors, he will set a new record.
The competition for the best actress was finally settled among the actresses who are the mainstay of the film and television industry, such as Haiqing, Ma Yili, Qin Haitao, Sun Wei, and Renee, and none of the traffic flowers were shortlisted.

Venezuela's foreign minister accuses the United States of fabricating lies and unprovoked attacks on China
Arreaza said that the US government's recent political, diplomatic, economic and public opinion pressure on China is an unfounded attack on a sovereign country.
Arreaza retweeted a tweet posted earlier in the day by Li Baorong, the Chinese ambassador to Venezuela, on his personal account and made the above comment.
Li Baorong said in a tweet that China strongly condemns the US forcible entry into the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, which is a serious violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and the Sino-US Consular Treaty, and China will make a justified and necessary response to it.
Venezuelan Vice President Rodriguez, Deputy Foreign Minister for North American Affairs Carlos Long and other government officials, social celebrities and mainstream media reporters have also retweeted Li Baorong's tweets, condemning the United States' actions as a serious violation of international law.
On the 26th, the day before Philippine President Duterte delivered his fifth State of the Nation Address (SONA), the cumulative number of confirmed cases of new coronavirus pneumonia in the Philippines exceeded 80,000, of which the number of confirmed cases of the Information Department of the Presidential Office (PCOO) and its immediate agency staff increased to 25.
To this end, the PCOO has specially prepared a working group that has not been in contact with the diagnosed staff to cooperate with President Duterte's SONA press release.
PCOO Minister Martin Andanar said in an interview with DZBB radio on the 26th that two sets of plans have been prepared for President Duterte to issue the SONA method.
According to plan A, Duterte will deliver SONA on the afternoon of the 27th at the Philippine Congress (Batasang Pambansa) building in Quezon City.
Because of the epidemic, only 50 seats were arranged for some government cabinet members and legislators, and a special video conference room was set up for other cabinet members, local government officials and others to watch.
All participants had to pass a rapid test to enter the parliament building that day.
As soon as one of the participants tested positive, Plan B was activated, that is, President Duterte delivered SONA at the Malacanang Palace, the presidential palace, and fewer seats were arranged for the hearing.
As is customary, SONA will be broadcast live to the entire Philippines.
At press time, the Philippine presidential palace had not confirmed whether Duterte's family would attend the SONA.
Andanar said that President Duterte's SONA will focus on how the government will lead the Philippines to deal with the new coronavirus epidemic and restore socio-economic life; it will also mention his promises when he took office, namely anti-government corruption, the fight against illegal drugs and poverty reduction.
Duterte will also explain other plans of the current administration, including creating more jobs, revitalizing the economy, promoting education, and helping overseas Filipino workers who have suffered in the epidemic.
Yinchuan: Classification policy to support stable teachers in kindergartens - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, July 26 (Reporter Ai Fumei) Affected by the epidemic, the kindergarten in Yinchuan, Ningxia, has not yet been restored, especially the financial pressure on private kindergartens has increased, which has a certain impact on the stability and future sustainable development of kindergarten teachers.
In response to this, Yinchuan City has taken a number of measures such as pre-allocating subsidy funds for inclusive private kindergartens, providing stable job subsidies for non-inclusive private kindergartens, and reducing and exempting the rent of private kindergartens to support these kindergartens to stabilize the teaching staff.
According to the relevant policies of Yinchuan City, during the epidemic period, if the organizers of inclusive private kindergartens (including kindergartens that have been transformed into inclusive kindergartens after the management of supporting kindergartens in urban communities) refer to the minimum wage standard of the three districts and pay the basic living expenses of not less than 1,660 yuan per person per month to the teaching staff, the municipal finance will allocate 6 months of subsidy funds in accordance with the standard of 1,000 yuan per student per year for inclusive private kindergartens to solve the teachers' salaries and social insurance costs.
For non-inclusive private kindergartens that also provide teachers and staff with a monthly basic living allowance of not less than 1,660 yuan per person, Yinchuan City will arrange a six-month subsidy fund as a stable job subsidy fund for preschool teachers in accordance with the subsidy standard of 500 yuan per student per year.
At the same time, for private kindergartens that rent state-owned assets for business use, Yinchuan will reduce the rent for three months during the period of immunization prevention and control, and encourage developers and other types of rental entities to assume social responsibility, reduce and exempt kindergarten rent, reduce and exempt more than three months, and reduce and exempt relevant taxes and fees according to policy regulations.
The third flood of the Yangtze River in 2020 forms the detailed and practical response measures of the Ministry of Water Resources
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26 (Reporter Hu Jun) On the 26th, the third flood of the Yangtze River in 2020 was formed.
When presiding over the meeting on the 26th, Minister of Water Resources E Jingping requested that the Three Gorges Reservoir be carefully dispatched, that the water from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and Dongting Lake be considered as a whole, that the wrong peak be dispatched, that sufficient storage capacity be left to prepare for possible major floods, and that the flood control safety of the middle and lower reaches of the main stream and the important dikes of Dongting Lake be ensured.
According to the forecast, in the next three days, there will be heavy to torrential rain in parts of eastern southwest, southern Jianghuai, western northern Jiangnan, southern eastern Hubei and central Guangxi, including heavy rain in parts of northern Hunan and southwestern Jiangsu; moderate to heavy rain in western central North China, including heavy rain in parts of central Hebei.
The Ministry of Water Resources expects that under its influence, the storage flow of the Three Gorges Reservoir in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River may reach about 60,000 cubic meters per second around the 28th, and the water level of the Lianhuatang River section and Dongting Lake in the middle reaches of the main stream will rise again and exceed 0.20 meters; the water level of the main stream in the middle reaches of the Huaihe River will generally slow down, and the water level of Hongze Lake will continue to rise slowly; the water level of the Haihe Daqing River system, Yongding River and other rivers will rise.
E Jingping proposed that the Huaihe River Basin should further increase flood discharge and reduce the water level of Hongze Lake as soon as possible to prepare for possible major floods.
It is necessary to do a good job in responding to heavy rains and floods in the Surabaya River system.
He said that the Taihu Lake basin should continue to increase the intensity of flood discharge, reduce the water level of Taihu Lake and the surrounding river network as soon as possible, and reduce the risk of high water level and typhoon encounter in Taihu Lake.
In addition, he stressed that floods in northern regions such as Inner Mongolia and Hebei rise and fall steeply, and the warning time is short, which is very easy to cause flash floods and mudslides, and the defense is difficult; the number of small and medium-sized reservoirs and silt dams is large, and there are security risks.
58 apps infringing on users' rights and interests were exposed, involving more than a dozen listed companies
The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology reported that in accordance with the Cybersecurity Law, the Telecommunications Regulations, the Regulations on the Protection of Personal Information of Telecommunications and Internet Users, and other laws and regulations, a third-party testing agency was recently organized to inspect mobile phone application software and urge enterprises with problems to rectify them.
The problems of these 58 apps include the private collection of personal information, the over-collection of personal information, the frequent application of permissions, the excessive request for permissions, the difficulty of account cancellation, the private sharing to third parties, and the denial of permissions.
The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology requires that 58 APP should complete the rectification and implementation work by July 30. If the rectification is not overdue, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology will organize the relevant disposal work in accordance with the law.
The reporter combed and found that more than ten US, Hong Kong and A-share listed companies were behind the 58 apps notified.
For example, "Fang Duoduo" is a product of the US-listed company Fang Duoduo, which has five major problems: private collection of personal information, over-collection of personal information, private sharing to third parties, forcing users to use the targeted push function, and frequent application permissions.
According to public information, Fangduo landed on Nasdaq in November 2019 and is "the first real estate intermediary company in China with an industrial Internet SaaS (software as a service) model," providing online solutions for many intermediary merchants.
In response to the difficulty of canceling the "where to go" APP account pointed out in the notice, according to the Beijing News, where to go responded that in order to prevent the black market from using frequent registration and cancellation to seek benefits, where to go was registered on the basis of self-cancellation, and the cancellation interval was set to one month.
Now, taking into account the convenience of cancellation and the security of the account, it has been changed to cancellation with immediate effect and is currently awaiting review.
A network security expert, who did not want to be named, told Zhongxin Jingwei Client that the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has issued three APP notifications this year for such infringements of users' rights and interests.
Among them, the three problems of private collection of personal information, excessive request for permissions, and difficulty in canceling accounts have been repeatedly "managed."
From the notification, it can also be found that the current APP invasion of privacy has attracted more attention.
On July 24, the day of the notification of 58 APP infringing on the rights and interests of users, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said that it had recently issued a notice to deploy and carry out a special rectification action to promote APP infringing on the rights and interests of users.
The special rectification will strengthen supervision and inspection in accordance with regulations, urge relevant enterprises to strengthen the protection of APP personal information, timely rectify and eliminate outstanding problems such as illegal collection, use of user personal information and harassment of users, deception and misleading users, and inadequate implementation of management responsibilities of application distribution platforms, and purify the APP application space.
Lewis family: John Lewis was a 'fighter for the weakest'
US Congressman and civil rights champion John Lewis was remembered at a memorial service for him on Saturday (July 25) as a fighter who "fought for the weakest."
Public memorial services for Lewis have been held in Alabama since Saturday.
There were two memorial services on the first day.
At a public memorial service at Troy University in Alabama on Saturday, Lewis' five siblings and a great-nephew spoke of him as a loving, fearless, family-oriented man.
"He dedicated his life to helping others," Lewis' youngest brother, Henry "Grant" Lewis, said at the meeting.
Samuel Lewis said his mother had warned John to "stay out of trouble, stay out of trouble."
He added that John did not heed his mother's warning, saying: "We all know that John was always getting into trouble, always getting into trouble, but it was for standing up for what was right, a good trouble."
Lewis's siblings reminded people at the memorial service that John's most famous argument was to make "good trouble," that is, to stir up trouble as long as it was for justice.
John had applied to Troy University in his native city of Troy, Alabama, but the then all-white school rejected his application.
John Lewis, who as a child preached the gospel to chickens on his family farm, eventually earned a degree in religion and philosophy from Fisk University.
Years later, Troy University awarded Lewis an honorary doctorate.
Doug Jones, a U.S. senator from Alabama, said the current protesters "are protesting peacefully and nonviolently," just as Lewis did during the civil rights movement.
Jones said: "Even if President Trump knocked over a boatload of people and called all the protesters thugs, he was wrong.
The protesters are patriots who want America to move toward a more equal country."
A six-day series of events honoring Lewis will culminate in his funeral in Georgia this week.
Lewis' coffin lay in state at a public memorial at Troy University on Saturday, where people came to pay their respects to the civil rights pioneer.
Later Saturday, a private ceremony paid tribute to him at a chapel in Selma, Alabama, followed by a public memorial.
On Sunday, Lewis' body will cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma.
It was in front of this bridge in 1965 that he and demonstrators demanding the right to vote for blacks were beaten by Alabama police, who also fired tear gas at demonstrators.
Lewis was nearly killed.
The day would become known as "Bloody Sunday."
Lewis' body will be transported to Alabama's capital, Montgomery.
Mayor Steven Reed encouraged people to line the sidewalks and walk with Lewis on his final journey.
At the same time, officials asked the public to wear masks and maintain social distance when participating in activities.
Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey ordered flags to be flown at half-staff Saturday and Sunday in honor of Lewis.
Lewis' body will lie in state briefly at the Alabama State Capitol in Montgomery, the Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta and the U.S. Capitol in Washington during the nearly week-long commemoration.
U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced last week that people can pay their respects to Lewis at the U.S. Capitol this Monday and Tuesday.
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the public event to honor Lewis will be held outdoors.

In addition, the draft also proposed that influenza patients must wear masks when entering and leaving public places, and medical and health institutions should be fined 20,000 yuan for disclosing patient privacy without consent.
It is worth noting that in addition to the physical and mental health of residents, the draft for comments also requires that all departments in Shenzhen should assess the impact of public policy implementation on the health of the population before formulating plans, normative documents, and approving major construction projects and implementing major public service projects involving urban space planning and construction, industrial park planning and construction, resource development and utilization and ecological environmental protection, and biomedical industry development.

Recently, General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed during his visit to Jilin Province that it is necessary to strengthen the party's leadership, promote the extension of party organizations to the grassroots level, improve the working system of grassroots party organizations, and provide a strong guarantee for urban and rural community governance.
Adhering to the guidance of Party building and implementing the Party's leadership in all aspects of grassroots governance is a fundamental requirement for the direction of grassroots governance.
To improve the level of grassroots governance, we must adhere to the leadership of party building. By strengthening political leadership, building a fighting fortress, and rallying red forces, we will promote the party's political advantages, organizational advantages, and mass work advantages into governance advantages, and transmit the party's strength and propositions to the "nerve end" and "last mile."
Focus on calcium supplementation to cast the soul and strengthen political leadership.
To strengthen the political leadership of grassroots governance, we must implement the "calcium supplementation and soul casting" project well.
It is necessary to take the study and understanding of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics in the New Era as the primary task, take "not forgetting the original intention and keeping the mission in mind" as the eternal task of party building and the lifelong task of party members and cadres, strengthen the principle of reading and understanding the original text, and continue to promote the party's innovative theory through special training, batch training, discussion and exchange, and holding large lectures.
Through the combination of online and offline learning methods, we will broaden the channels of learning and education, and guide grassroots party organizations and party members and cadres to truly integrate learning and education into their daily lives and grasp it regularly.
Focus on practical exercises, and in the process of resolving key and difficult issues in the field of grassroots governance, solve the troubles and troubles that the masses are concerned about, and temper the party spirit and ability.
Grasp the promotion of norms and create a fighting fortress.
Grassroots party organizations are both an important part of the grassroots governance system and an important vehicle for demonstrating governance capabilities.
To promote the standardized construction of grassroots party organizations, it is necessary to start with the work regulations of party branches, focus on issues such as the weakening and virtualization of the leadership of party organizations, and strengthen the foundation, make up for shortcomings, and promote development by establishing an up-and-down linkage mechanism, innovating the form of setting up branches, normalizing and rectifying weakness and laxity, establishing and improving decision-making and deliberation mechanisms, and serving the masses.
In rural areas, strengthen the standardization of village-level party organizations, standardize organizational forms, learning activities, and management mechanisms in accordance with the standardized construction standards of party branches, and effectively promote the detailed implementation of systems such as "three meetings and one lesson" and theme party day activities.
In cities, pay attention to street communities, explore innovative branch setting forms, focus on weak areas, "blocking points" and "pain points," and actively build urban party building alliances so that the party's work can be effectively covered.
At the same time, we will establish and improve the governance system and mechanism at the grassroots level, improve the decision-making and deliberation mechanism led by major events, practical matters, important matters, urgent matters, difficult matters, and grassroots party organizations, improve the mechanism for party members and cadres to contact and serve the masses, gather the hearts of the people in serving the people, enhance the sense of gain, happiness, honor, and pride of party members and the masses, and make grassroots governance more warm.
Play the role of vanguard and unite the red forces.
Grassroots party members and cadres are the cornerstone of grassroots governance.
Enhance grassroots governance capabilities, focus on enhancing the governance capabilities of grassroots party members and cadres, focus on giving play to the exemplary leadership role of "red cells" in grassroots governance, and unite red forces at the forefront of connecting and serving the masses.
It is necessary to take the improvement of governance ability as a compulsory course for grassroots party members and cadres, continuously strengthen ideological refinement, professional training, and practical exercise, carry forward the spirit of responsibility in their posts and urgent and difficult tasks, and contribute to the modernization of the national governance system and governance ability.
It is necessary to carry out a wide range of "community whistle blowing and party member registration" activities, and participate in community construction, management and service by participating in theme party day activities, contacting people in need, identifying service projects, claiming micro wishes, and making reasonable suggestions, so that party members can play a role in community governance.
It is necessary to give full play to the role of unemployed party members in rural areas, and guide the majority of grassroots party members to actively participate in various work such as poverty alleviation, ecological construction, petitioning, maintaining stability, and banning burning by setting up vanguard posts for unemployed party members and forming task forces for unemployed party members, so as to better integrate red forces and serve the people.
The foundation is a solid building.
The grassroots party organization is the foundation of the ruling edifice.
Only by adhering to the close relationship between the party and the masses, increasing the well-being of the people as the focus, and taking party building as the fundamental way to promote the innovation and development of grass-roots governance, can we build a solid foundation, so that grass-roots party organizations can pull out and stand up, grass-roots party members and cadres can catch up and rush up, and promote grass-roots governance with "soul," orderly, powerful and effective.

Cocos (Keeling) Islands Tibetan antelope enters migration season - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, July 25 (Reporter Wang Jinjin) The reporter learned from the Wudao Liang Protection Station of the Kekexili Management Office of the Yangtze River Source Park of the Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration that the monitoring showed that the Tibetan antelopes that had previously migrated to the Zhuonai Lake area in the hinterland of Kekexili were gradually ending their calving and began to return to their original habitat with their young.
Surveillance footage near the Wudao Liang Protection Station shows that on July 25, about 40 female Tibetan antelopes led three Tibetan antelope cubs through the 3002 km of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway and the Wudao Liang North Bridge of the Qinghai-Tibet Railway. The Tibetan antelopes have begun to return.
According to expert analysis, in recent years, the number of Tibetan antelope calves in the migratory flock accounts for one-fourth to one-fifth of the total number of Tibetan antelope herds.
Lian Xinming, an associate researcher at the Northwest Plateau Biological Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said: "At the beginning of the migration, the Tibetan antelope faces a high risk of predation, so the number of young in the herd will be relatively small, and there may even be no young."
According to the statistics of the Kekexili Management Office of the Yangtze River Source Park of the Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration, the number of Tibetan antelopes returning is generally increasing year by year. In 2019, the number of Tibetan antelopes returning was 4,860, an increase of 338 over 2018.
Lian Xinming said: "It is expected that this year's Tibetan antelope migration will end in early September, and the number of returning Tibetan antelope is still expected to continue to increase."
The Tibetan antelope is a state-level protected animal.
At the end of May every year, Tibetan antelopes from Sanjiangyuan in Qinghai, Qiangtang in Tibet, and Arjinshan in Xinjiang go to Zhuo Nai Lake in the hinterland of Kekexili to give birth to lambs.
Wu Xiaomin, an expert on the protection of Tibetan antelopes in China and a researcher at the Shaanxi Provincial Institute of Zoology (Northwest Endangered Animal Research Institute), said: "Tibetan antelope migration is a process in which female Tibetan antelopes return to their habitat with their young after the end of calving. At first, the migration group leaving the calving ground is relatively large, but then Tibetan antelopes will return to their respective habitats according to different geographical populations and along different paths."
In order to ensure the safe return of the Tibetan antelope herd, the reporter learned that the Cocosiri Management Office of the Yangtze River Source Park of the Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration has arranged staff to continuously carry out video monitoring and patrol the jurisdiction in the main return area.
If it is found that a herd of Tibetan antelope is trying to cross the road, the patrol team will carry out temporary traffic control at the first time, so that the sheep can safely pass through the wildlife passage and ensure that they are as little as possible disturbed by humans on their way back.
So, how to relieve the heat in daily life?
Experts suggest that when going out in the summer, try to avoid the high-temperature period, and it is best not to walk or work in the hot sun before and after noon, because the sun is strongest during this time, and the possibility of heat stroke is higher.
If you must go out at this time, be sure to do a good job of protection, such as using a parasol, wearing a sun hat, wearing sunglasses, and applying sunscreen if possible to prevent sunburn.
As far as possible, choose light-colored, breathable cotton, linen and silk fabrics for clothes, and wear less chemical fiber clothing, so as not to lose heat in time when sweating a lot, causing heat stroke.
In hot and muggy weather, prepare enough water to drink, drink it in time, don't wait for thirst to drink water, because once you feel thirsty, your body is already short of water, each time you drink water, control it to 150 ml to 200 ml, drink warm water, don't drink ice water.
Depending on the temperature, general personnel drink 1.5 to 2 liters of water per day, and high-temperature workers drink 3 to 5 liters of water per day.
When sweating more, it is appropriate to add some salt water to make up for the salt lost by the body due to sweating.
In addition, the human body is prone to potassium deficiency in summer, which makes people feel tired and tired. Potassium-containing tea water is an excellent summer drink.
In summer, eat more fruits and vegetables with high water content, such as lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, etc.; fresh fruits, such as peaches, apricots, watermelons, melons and other water content of 80% to 90%, can be used to replenish water; dairy products can not only replenish water, but also meet the nutritional needs of the body.
In addition, people working in high-temperature environments should be properly supplemented with drinks containing elements such as potassium and magnesium.
In summer, the days are long and the nights are short, the temperature is high, the human metabolism is strong, the consumption is also large, and it is easy to feel tired.
Adequate sleep can relax the brain and body systems, which is not only conducive to work and study, but also a measure to prevent heat stroke.
According to experts, the best time to go to bed is between 22:00 and 23:00, and the best time to get up is between 5:30 and 6:30.
When sleeping, be careful not to lie under the air conditioning outlet and electric fan, so as not to suffer from air conditioning disease and heat injury.
Experts suggest that people who are engaged in outdoor activities or high-temperature operations can carry heat-preventing drugs such as ten drops of water, human Dan, musk zhengqi water or musk zhengqi pills, or place them in the nearest workplace and use them at any time to prevent heatstroke.
Graduates' art exhibition moved to public welfare exhibition in shopping mall - Xinhua
In the season of "cloud graduation" of major institutions, a rare offline graduate art exhibition opened last weekend.
However, it is neither in the art museum nor in the campus, but appears in the public space of Chaoyang Dayue City, and is open to the public free of charge until August 23.
The reporter learned that the 2020 graduate art exhibition collected 50 pieces/groups of works by 57 young artists from the Central Academy of Fine Arts, China Media University and Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts. The exhibition space extended from the 2nd floor to the 6th floor, and made full use of the light box in the building to display graphic works to maximize the artistic atmosphere of the graduation season.
In the context of the epidemic, the significance of this exhibition is particularly special.
Ge Ping, head of Mei Chen of Chaoyang Dayue City, said frankly: "We chose to bring the graduation exhibition to the 'cloud' back to the offline space. We also hope to let more people see young people's exploration of themselves and their understanding of the world, and amplify the healing power of art for society and the mind."
She revealed that the works participating in the exhibition were solicited from graduates of several major art colleges, and those suitable for commercial space display were selected from them. The forms of the works ranged from traditional shelf paintings and sculptures to new media installations, interactive paintings, and VR panoramas, and the volume and richness were the highest in years.
Among them, Li Yunxiao expressed his feelings in the epidemic through the creative language of mechanical and manual mixing in "The First Battle of 2020"; Liu Jiaying explored the themes of "cryptocurrency," "credit creation" and "transaction" through the work "Sound Money" created by the Ethereum blockchain; Zhang Jiaxuan's "Cat Forest" and Qiu Daqiang's "Ju" are animals that are often accompanied by humans, which shows the young artist's understanding of the relationship between humans and animals; and Zhu Zhongyu's work "Winter of Faith - Gift" is a reminder to young people growing up, "When one day your career is successful, don't forget your original intention, remember the simplicity and sincerity."
Among the few graduates who exhibited in person was Li Jingyin from the Sculpture Department of Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts.
"I came to Beijing on July 7. At that time, I was actually a bit worried about the epidemic, and I took a nucleic acid test three days in advance. I brought alcohol cotton and test reports to the exhibition."
His work "Yesterday is like a mystery" has a complex structure and must be done by oneself.
At the same time, he also took on the task of helping his classmates repair their broken works.
"The exhibition was held until 4:30 a.m., and then it was repaired. The time was very tight, and I forgot to take a picture with the work, which is also a bit regrettable."
He hopes that when the epidemic is more stable, he and his classmates will come to Beijing to see the exhibition of his works.

Reward 50,000 yuan Hubei Enshi praises sand dam landslide "first person to warn" - China News Service
Hubei Daily News (Reporter Lin Jing) On July 26, Enshi City issued a statement praising Chen Guangming, a geological disaster spot monitor who made an important contribution to the landslide warning of the sand dam, and sent him a 50,000 yuan bonus.
At the same time, he called on party members and cadres in the city to learn from his dedication, courage, initiative and dedication.
On July 21, Chen Guangming, 58, was the first person to warn of the landslide when a landslide occurred at the Shazi Dam in Ma Zha Village, Tunburg Township, Enshi City, causing the main river of the Qingjiang River to form a dam lake.
On the afternoon of July 17, Chen Guangming learned that the wall of the villager's home was cracked, and immediately went to the scene to check.
He had just walked five or six hundred meters from his home when he saw that the village road had cracked four or five centimeters and extended along the road to the corn field, about 50 meters in length.
Chen Guangming was alert and sent photos of the cracked road to the township's "geological disaster monitor contact group" for the first time.
After the relevant person in charge of the Tunburg Township Natural Planning Institute inspected and judged on the spot that there was a great possibility of landslides, a decision was made to evacuate the people.
Chen Guangming's timely warning won 36 hours of valuable time for the safe evacuation of 1,339 people from 315 households in the affected area.
No one was injured in this major geological disaster.
Chen Guangming's conscientious and responsible professionalism was praised by the masses.
In the face of praise, he said: "There is no one to save, this is my responsibility."
New drug developed by Australian university is expected to be used to treat blood vessel blockage caused by new crown - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Sydney, July 26 (Reporter Chen Yu) Researchers at Monash University in Australia are developing a new drug to help prevent heart disease and stroke, and hope that this drug can be used to treat blood vessel blockages caused by the new coronavirus.
Researchers have found that an enzyme in platelets accelerates platelet clotting before a heart attack or stroke.
From this, they developed a drug that can temporarily inhibit platelet clotting, thereby avoiding blood vessel blockage and preventing heart disease and stroke.
The drug only inhibits the clotting effect of platelets when there are signs of heart attack or stroke, the researchers said.
Since studies have shown that similar blood vessel blockages are one of the main causes of death in patients with severe new coronavirus, researchers hope that this drug can be used in the future to treat such severe patients.
At present, the drug has achieved good results in animal model experiments, and the researchers are ready to conduct human clinical trials in the next stage.
The research results have been published in the US journal Science Translational Medicine.
He became the first spectator to enter the stadium after the CBA League rematch allowed spectators to watch the game live.
On the same day, in the second stage of the rematch of the 2019-2020 season of the Chinese Men's Basketball Professional League (CBA) (Lushan Division) held in Qingdao, Shandong Province, medical staff, teachers, and people from the public security front entered the stadium after completing the relevant processes, including nucleic acid testing, through the official ticketing platform to watch the Shanghai Jiuji team play against the Shandong East and West Kings.
During the game, spectators must wear masks throughout the game, take their seats in pairs, and strictly maintain a one-meter interval between seats.
When leaving the venue, the audience must follow the order of from back to front, first on both sides and then in the middle, maintaining a "one-meter line" social distance and orderly exit.
Xinjiang deeply cultivates "sunflower fields" to make good use of clean energy

China News Service, Hami, Xinjiang, July 26: Xinjiang cultivates "sunflower fields" to make good use of clean energy
More than 6,000 pentagonal heliostats, each 48 square meters, are arranged neatly in a circle, like a silver "sunflower field," which rotates with the sun and reflects sunlight to the central 200-meter-high heat-absorbing tower to generate electricity.
The reporter saw this scene on the 25th at the Hami molten salt tower solar-thermal power plant of the CLP project in Manmaohu Town, Yiwu County, Hami City, Xinjiang.
"The so-called molten salt tower solar thermal power generation is to reflect the sunlight through the mirror to the heat-absorbing tower to form thermal energy, and then convert the thermal energy into electricity through traditional power generation technology."
Zhang Yong, deputy general manager of CLP Hami Solar Thermal Power Co., Ltd., said that the design principle is similar to the solar cooker used in rural areas in northwest China, and the sunlight must be gathered.
The power plant began construction in October 2017 and was connected to the grid at the end of last year. It covers an area of 6,600 mu and plans to install a total of 14,500 heliostats.
"Compared with traditional solar power technology, its biggest advantage is that it can store the accumulated heat energy and generate electricity at night."
Zhang Yong said that the 13-hour heat storage system configured in the project can enable the generator set to maintain continuous and stable operation without being affected by changes in light; it can also quickly participate in peak shaving of the grid according to the peak and valley demand of the grid load.
When the project is fully completed, it will achieve an annual power generation capacity of 198 million kWh, save more than 60,000 tons of standard coal per year, reduce emissions of more than 60 tons of sulfur dioxide, more than 60 tons of nitrogen oxides, about 20 tons of soot, and more than 150,000 tons of carbon dioxide, and provide a steady stream of clean energy for the local area.
In addition, there is another silver "sunflower field" in Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park in Hami City.
The Hamifuguang solar photovoltaic power station covers an area of more than 2,300 mu, and the 714 power generation devices that have been built also follow the sun's rotation, always keeping the sun's light at a right angle of 90 degrees to the concentrating plate surface.
"We use dual-axis tracking concentrating power generation technology. Through unified integrated control, all power generation equipment will adjust the angle according to the height of the sun to maintain power generation efficiency."
Duan Mengqi, director of the power station, said that in good weather conditions, the power generation technology can increase the efficiency of traditional photovoltaic power generation by about 20%.
In the first half of this year, the power station has generated more than 7 million kWh of electricity, supplementing local electricity demand.
Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park is currently the largest single photovoltaic industry demonstration park in Xinjiang with the most complete types of photovoltaic modules, with a total of 38 photovoltaic power generation projects and a total installed capacity of 820,000 kilowatts.
The amount of electricity generated in the first half of this year exceeded 110 million kWh, an increase of 6% over the same period in 2019.
Hami is one of the regions with the best solar resources in China.
The annual average total solar radiation is more than 6200 megajoules per square meter, and the annual sunshine hours are about 3200 hours.
In recent years, the city has vigorously developed the photovoltaic industry and planted "sunflower fields."
More than 2.5 million kilowatts of solar power has been installed. In the first half of this year, the city's photovoltaic power generation exceeded 1.4 billion kWh, an increase of about 14% year-on-year.
At present, there are more than 330 grid-connected photovoltaic power plants in Xinjiang, with an installed capacity of over 10 million kilowatts.
It is expected that the annual photovoltaic power generation will reach 15 billion kWh this year, which can replace more than 6 million tons of standard coal.
Police report details of "female college student missing on Qinghai trip" Search and rescue work continues - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, July 26 (Reporter Wang Jinjin Zhou Wei) Recently, "a female college student lost contact after traveling to Golmud in Qinghai" has attracted the attention of netizens.
The Public Security Bureau of Golmud City, Haixi Mongolian Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, reported on the 26th that Huang Moumou, a student at a university in Nanjing, is still in a state of loss of contact, and the police in many places are going deep into the area where Huang Moumou lost contact and actively carrying out search work.
On July 10, 2020, the security detachment of the Public Security Bureau of Golmud City, Haixi Province, received a notice from their superiors that Huang Moumou, a student of a university in Nanjing, took the Z164 train from Nanjing to Golmud on July 5, and on July 9, his mobile phone was turned off and lost contact in the southwest area of Qingshuihe, Sonandajie Protection Station, Qumalai County, Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, and asked for assistance in finding it.
According to the investigation by the Golmud City Public Security Bureau, Huang entered Qinghai Province at 19:54 on July 6 and arrived in Golmud City at 04:00 on July 7.
At 8 o'clock on the same day, Huang Moumou, the missing person, took a taxi from the Yellow River Hotel in Golmud City to the G109 National Highway, and arrived at the Kokosiri Sonan Dajie Protection Station at 12 o'clock. The taxi driver returned alone, and Huang Moumou arrived at the Qingshui River area near the Sonan Dajie Protection Station at 15 o'clock on the 7th until 18 o'clock on the 9th.
During further investigation, the police found that Huang had passed through the Naigigou checkpoint at 17:07 on July 13.
The Naigigou checkpoint is a checkpoint set up by Nagqu City, Tibet Autonomous Region, in Nanshankou, Golmud City. Since there is no video surveillance at the checkpoint, it is impossible to determine the information of the person and the vehicle, so the police can only search along the way by driving, and coordinate with the checkpoints along the way in Tibet to contact the Golmud City Public Security Bureau immediately if they find Huang.
According to the latest situation, at 1 a.m. on July 26, the Golmud City Public Security Bureau organized rescue forces to carry rescue equipment and go to the non-freezing spring protection station and the Sonandajie protection station along the Qinghai-Tibet Highway to search, and actively contacted the Sichuan Police, the Tibet Police, and the Nanjing Police to work together. The search and rescue work is still continuing.
The local police hope that the majority of netizens and all sectors of society will provide relevant clues to the Golmud police and the Nanjing Jiangning police in a timely manner, and strive to find the missing person Huang Moumou as soon as possible.
At the same time, relevant experts suggest that tourists should be standardized, rational and civilized in outdoor activities, pay attention to roadside warning signs at any time, do not venture into no man's land, encounter unexpected situations, and report to the police in time.
US media reveals the truth about the US's unwarranted request for China to close its Consulate General in Houston
2020-07-26 14:40:44 Source: CCTV Author: Zhu Yanjing Editor: Zhu Yanjing
The U.S. media revealed the truth of the U.S. unwarranted request for China to close the Consulate General in Houston.
On the 24th, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the US Embassy in China that China decided to revoke the establishment and operation license of the US Consulate General in Chengdu, and put forward specific requirements for the Consulate General to stop all operations and activities, as a countermeasure to the US's sudden request on the 21st that China close the Consulate General in Houston.
This act of the US government has attracted a lot of attention, and its political motives have been questioned by foreign media and scholars.
Why did you ask China to close the Consulate General?
A number of foreign media said that it is not clear why the United States chose the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, but for the purpose of this move, foreign media said bluntly: for the election.
CNN reported on the 23rd that the move by the US to ask China to close its consulate general in Houston raised questions about its political motives.
According to the article, the US government's disastrous response to the new coronavirus epidemic has caused President Trump's poll approval rating to be relatively low before the election.
Privately, White House officials say the tough tactics on China are aimed at salvaging Trump's approval ratings and deflecting blame for the White House's botched response to the outbreak.
The article believes that the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is a "politically driven and very cautious" target chosen by the United States, and the US government selected it "to create a tough attitude while avoiding the risk of causing a major conflict."
The BBC also believes that Trump believes that "playing the 'China card' has political advantages" as the US election season approaches and the US economy is severely hit by the epidemic.
The current situation is "a spiraling, tit-for-tat struggle," which is partly driven by the US government from the perspective of domestic considerations and will only worsen the tensions between China and the United States.
CBS reported that Trump's re-election prospects are under pressure because of the outbreak, and he has repeatedly blamed China for the epidemic.
Almost every day in the United States, there is a new action against Trump's absurd argument that "China exploits the United States."
"The Consulate General in Houston is very important in establishing ties between the two countries"
The Associated Press commented that the United States' request for China to close its consulate general in Houston has exacerbated tensions between the world's two largest economies.
If the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is closed, in addition to the diplomatic impact, Chinese citizens in the southern United States face difficulties in obtaining consular services, and American citizens seeking visas and other services also face difficulties.
A Houston business group has expressed regret that the United States has asked China to close its consulate in Houston, saying the consulate has played an important role in building trade, investment and cultural ties between the two countries.
According to the Associated Press, this reflects the importance of the Chinese economy.
The US Foreign Policy magazine website believes that the US move "is part of a series of provocative measures that will only worsen US-China relations."
Reuters quoted Jonathan Pollack, an expert on East Asia at the Brookings Institution, an American think tank, as saying that since the establishment of full diplomatic relations between the United States and China in 1979, he could not think of any move comparable to the US action against the Chinese Consulate General in Houston.
Hong Kong's South China Morning Post reported that the U.S. move was unprecedented in more than 40 years of diplomatic relations between China and the United States.
Analysts believe the move could cause lasting damage.
The Chinese Consulate General in Houston was built in 1979 and was the first Chinese Consulate General opened in the United States.
Currently, China has one embassy and five consulates-general in the United States.

Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, attended the parade of the Baltic Fleet.
About 4,000 soldiers, 46 ships and more than 40 warplanes participated in the local military parade.
Putin first reviewed the parade of ships in the waters of the Kronstadt naval base in the Baltic Sea.
After that, he took a speedboat to the waters of the Neva River in the center of St. Petersburg and went ashore to watch the military parade on the Neva River.
Speaking at the military parade, Putin said that the modern technical level of the Russian Navy's equipment has continued to increase in recent years, and the Russian Navy will receive a total of about 40 new ships equipped with a unique hypersonic strike system in 2020.
In addition, Russian Navy Commander-in-Chief Yevmenov said in an interview with the Russian Defense Ministry's newspaper Red Star that Russia's plan to build ships has been effectively implemented, and the number of new ships the Russian Navy plans to receive in 2020 is the largest in recent years.
In 1696, Tsar Peter the Great embarked on the formation of a maritime fleet, creating the history of the Russian Navy.
The last Sunday of July each year is the Russian Navy Day.
In response to the new changes in the epidemic prevention and control work, since July 17, trade unions at all levels in Xinjiang have responded to the call of the General Union of the Autonomous Region and actively participated in the epidemic prevention and control work.
Tianshan North-South Trade Union cadres, workers, and model workers went into the street communities and residents to carry out activities such as delivering food and medicine, disinfecting and sterilizing, and promoting knowledge of epidemic prevention, serving the workers and the masses, and demonstrating the "hard core strength" of the trade union with practical actions.
Recently, the Urumqi Tianshan District Federation of Trade Unions sent a group of urgently needed epidemic prevention and control supplies to the staff of 12 isolation points.
After the outbreak of the epidemic, Tianshan District invested more than 1.05 million yuan in the first time, which was urgently allocated to 23 directly affiliated grassroots trade unions.
After receiving the company's notice on the prevention and control of the epidemic, Zhao Xiangguo, deputy secretary of the party committee and chairman of the trade union of China Construction Xinjiang Construction Industry, took the initiative to ask for help and chose to stay on duty in the unit to escort the employees.
He sent cooking utensils, food and daily necessities to the new employees living in the dormitory of the unit, and organized the staff to send them the necessary materials every two days.
"Starting from July 21, cadres and workers on the front line of the fight against the 'epidemic' will be surveyed, and online orders and door-to-door delivery by businesses will be used to supplement the purchase of epidemic prevention supplies and daily necessities for 704 front-line workers in Urumqi."
The head of the Xinjiang Transport Union told reporters that in the face of the sudden epidemic, they have made every effort to ensure epidemic prevention and control services, steadily promote the development of transportation, and create a strong atmosphere of fighting the epidemic.
At present, in the heat of summer, trade unions at all levels are keeping a close eye on front-line workers in key areas of epidemic prevention and control, and putting the "sending cool" care into practice.
On July 19, the Urumqi County Federation of Trade Unions launched a condolence campaign to "send coolness" to front-line workers in epidemic prevention and control. Police stations, card points and health systems in the county received drinks, fruits and other condolences.
"Trade union cadres should further improve their political standing, strengthen their responsibility, warm their hearts with care, and inspire their fighting spirit with action.
We must give full play to the role of trade unions in uniting workers and uniting workers, do a good job in epidemic prevention and control services, actively safeguard the health rights and interests of the majority of workers, and send care to front-line workers.
The head of the Autonomous Region Federation of Trade Unions said.
2020 direct recruitment of non-commissioned officers in full swing - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26 (Reporter Jia Qilong) The Political Work Department of the Military Commission and the National Defense Mobilization Department of the Military Commission recently jointly issued a notice to deploy the direct recruitment of non-commissioned officers from ordinary college graduates in 2020.

Spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in the UK: The Chinese government is a staunch defender of cyber security
China News Service, July 26th According to the website of the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom, on the 25th, the spokesman of the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom answered a reporter's question about the wrong remarks about cyber attacks.
The spokesman stressed that the Chinese government is a staunch defender of cyber security and has always firmly opposed and combated any form of cyber attacks and cyber crimes.
A reporter asked: According to the media, hacker groups related to China have interfered with the network systems of a British company, launched attacks on British and American technology companies that store patent data, and invaded the government networks of EU countries.
The spokesman said that the Chinese government is a staunch defender of cyber security and has always resolutely opposed and combated any form of cyber attacks and cyber crimes.
Cyberspace is highly virtual, difficult to trace, and has a variety of actors. When investigating and characterizing cyber incidents, sufficient evidence should be provided, and there should be no groundless speculation.
The spokesman said that a series of events such as the "Prism Gate" in the past proved that the United States has been conducting the world's largest cyber theft operation.
It is in the common interest of all countries to maintain peace and stability in cyberspace.
The spokesman pointed out that China's achievements in scientific and technological innovation are not stolen, not robbed, but obtained through self-reliance and hard work.
In 2019, China filed about 59,000 patent applications through the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), with an annual growth rate of 10.6%, becoming the country with the largest number of international patent applications.
China has become a powerhouse of innovation and intellectual property.
According to data from the Urumqi Central Branch of the People's Bank of China, in the first half of the year, new loans to agricultural and small and micro enterprises in Xinjiang exceeded the annual increase in 2019.
In the first half of this year, the Urumqi Central Branch of the People's Bank of China used a variety of monetary policy tools to guide the banking industry to continuously increase lending, providing sufficient funds for epidemic prevention and control and resumption of production.
Urumqi free nucleic acid testing has been basically completed in most districts, and secondary testing has been carried out in high-risk areas
China News Network, Urumqi, July 26 (Reporter Sun Tingwen Zhao Yamin) Zhang Wei, director of the Urumqi Municipal Health Commission, said on the 26th when reporting the latest epidemic situation and nucleic acid testing in Urumqi that at present, most of the free nucleic acid testing in Urumqi has been basically completed.
The State Council expert group and experts from the autonomous region and Urumqi are further assessing the development of the epidemic based on the results of nucleic acid testing and epidemiological investigations.
The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Information Office held a press conference on the 26th to report on the epidemic situation and prevention and control in Xinjiang.
According to him, from 0:00 to 24:00 on July 25, there were 22 new confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia in Urumqi (of which 5 were confirmed cases of asymptomatic infection) and 38 new asymptomatic infections.
As of 24:00 on July 25, there were 135 confirmed cases and 147 asymptomatic cases in Urumqi.
The new asymptomatic infections on the 25th are basically through the city's free nucleic acid testing and active screening.
Zhang Wei, director of the Urumqi Municipal Health Commission, said on the 26th that most of the free nucleic acid testing in Urumqi had been basically completed.
He also said that from the experience of other parts of the country, there are many factors that affect the results of nucleic acid testing, such as the sensitivity of the test reagent, the infection time and detoxification time of the tested person, the cooperation of the tested person when the specimen is collected (poor cooperation may lead to the specimen not being taken in place), and the testing environment and the proficiency of the inspector.
Nucleic acid tests can also produce false negative results for a variety of reasons.
The so-called false negative means that the subject is indeed infected, but the nucleic acid test result is negative.
In addition, for people who have had close contact with confirmed cases and suspected cases, two nucleic acid tests are usually required to rule them out.
For people who have been to high-risk areas in the epidemic, if they have fever and respiratory symptoms, a negative nucleic acid test may have a false negative, so two nucleic acid tests are also needed to rule it out.
He said that in view of the above situation, for the health of the people of all ethnic groups in the city, starting from today, the city of Urumqi will conduct two free nucleic acid tests in key areas such as Tianshan District and Shaibak District, and at the same time carry out "checking for omissions."
It is reported that Tianshan District and Shaybak District are high-risk areas for the epidemic.

Offline streamlining, "on the cloud" enthusiasm, Shanghai International Film Festival reveals unusual industry confidence
Yesterday, the 2020 Shanghai International Film and Television Festival, held under the background of strict epidemic prevention measures, opened the curtain of the 23rd Shanghai International Film Festival with an industry summit forum of "all-round prosperity and building a new era of dreams."
As the first international film and television festival held since the continuous spread of the global epidemic and the normalization of epidemic prevention and control in China, this year's Shanghai International Film Festival is of great significance.
On the basis of doing a good job in the normalization of epidemic prevention and control, holding the Shanghai International Film and Television Festival is not only a sign of confidence, but also a declaration of determination - our confidence in defeating the epidemic remains unchanged, our confidence in running the people's festival remains unchanged, and our confidence in building a global film and television creation center and launching the "Shanghai Culture" brand remains unchanged.
Every year, the Shanghai International Film Festival, with the attitude of continuous innovation and continuous progress, is a fresh start and a new beginning.
Therefore, it is necessary to take every step to serve the spiritual life of the people and the high-quality development of the film and television industry.
This is especially true this year.
In order to cherish the hard-won situation of epidemic prevention and control, the Shanghai International Film Festival, on the one hand, strictly adheres to the requirements of epidemic prevention and control, and implements the epidemic prevention and control measures in detail; on the other hand, with the vision of gathering wisdom for Chinese film creation and meeting the needs of film fans, it opens online and offline multi-sector activities.
On the first day of the opening, from the offline viewing to the industry forum, the related activities of the film festival strictly implemented the relevant epidemic prevention policies.
Forum activities are limited to 50 people, and each screening is separated by rows of seats, with attendance strictly limited to 30%.
As the organizing committee of the film festival upholds, in any case, "putting the safety and health of the people first" is the main premise.
Offline activities have been greatly streamlined, and there has been a lot of excitement on the "cloud."
In order to implement the important concept of "the people's city is built by the people, and the people's city is for the people," as a festival for the people, this year's Shanghai International Film Festival aims to innovate and transform, using online "cloud screening" and master class "cloud sharing" to meet the diverse needs of film fans.
On the first day of the opening, the official partners of the film festival, Migu Video and Oriental Pearl Blockbuster, respectively, put a number of "Belt and Road" films "on the cloud" to give back to fans.
On the same night, Jinjue's opening forum and Jia Zhangke's master class were also online on various platforms such as CCTV, Learning Power, and Wenhui App, so that people could pay attention to the latest trends in Chinese films without leaving home.
At the opening forum yesterday, Yan Xiaoming, member of the party group and deputy director of the Central Radio and Television General Station, delivered a speech and announced the opening of the film festival. Zhou Huilin, member of the Standing Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and Minister of Publicity, delivered a speech, and Vice Mayor Zong Ming attended.
White House epidemic expert Fauci: cautiously optimistic about the development of a vaccine in early 2021
Fauci made the remarks at an online video conference hosted by the International Leadership Foundation on the 25th.
He cautioned that it is not yet clear how the coronavirus epidemic will develop in the fall and winter, nor what the ultimate impact of the epidemic will be, "and the only way to end this is for each of us to choose to be part of the solution."
According to data from Johns Hopkins University, as of 21:00 on the 25th, the number of confirmed cases of new coronavirus in the United States has reached 4.176 million, with 146,000 deaths.
Fauci said that some areas of the United States are currently struggling to fight the rebounding epidemic.
Although epidemics vary from place to place and require tailor-made responses, a diverse anti-epidemic strategy does not mean that there are no close links between regions.
Outbreaks in one area will eventually affect other areas.
"Now is not the time for complacency," Fauci said. "Our work is not done, we must intensify our efforts, and we must remain vigilant to the uncertainties ahead."
He Dayi, a Chinese-American medical expert and founder of "cocktail therapy" to treat AIDS, pointed out at the meeting that the new coronavirus epidemic in the United States has not yet reached its peak.
"Each of us must do our part to slow the spread of this virus."
He Dayi called on the public to use their own practical actions to buy time for scientists to step up the development of new coronavirus treatment drugs and vaccines.
The International Leadership Foundation is a non-profit organization that promotes international exchange activities in the United States and the Asia-Pacific region. It is committed to promoting the status of Asian-Pacific Americans and cultivating young international leaders.
On the same day, U.S. Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao, U.S. Representative Meng Zhaowen and Dong Jiling, founding president of the International Leadership Foundation, spoke at the meeting.
They paid special tribute to the Asian Pacific American medical workers and volunteers fighting the epidemic on the front line, and called on the American public to continue to adhere to epidemic prevention guidelines such as "social distancing" to curb the spread of the epidemic.

Brazilian study shows that hydroxychloroquine is not effective for the treatment of mild coronavirus pneumonia
Recently, a Brazilian study showed that hydroxychloroquine is not effective for patients with mild-moderate coronavirus pneumonia.
The study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
Pakistani researchers divided 667 patients in 55 hospitals across the country into three groups and conducted clinical trials; mainly compared the treatment effect of hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with other antibiotics azithromycin, and analyzed whether it would help improve the condition of mild and moderate patients with new coronavirus pneumonia.
The results show that hydroxychloroquine not only has no therapeutic effect, but may have damaging side effects on organs.
The study was carried out by leading Brazilian hospitals such as Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Hospital of Cardiology (HCor) and Hospital Sírio-Libanês, in collaboration with the Brazilian Clinical Research Institute (BCRI) and the Brazilian Intensive Care Research Network (BRICNet).
On the 25th local time, Brazilian President Bolsonaro announced through social platforms that the 4th nucleic acid test result was negative.
During the infection, Bolsonaro has been taking hydroxychloroquine and has actively promoted it on many occasions.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 25 (Reporters Yu Junjie and Chen Aiping) Reporters learned from the State Internet Information Office on the 25th that the 2020 App illegal collection and use of personal information management work was officially launched recently, focusing on cracking down on App backstage private uploading of personal information and other issues that the masses have strongly reflected.
It is reported that this round of App governance work was jointly carried out by the State Internet Information Office, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the Ministry of Public Security, and the State Administration for Market Regulation.
According to reports, a special governance working group composed of four departments accepted more than 12,000 pieces of effective reporting information from netizens last year, carried out verification for more than 2,300 apps, and took public exposure, interviews, and removal of 260 apps with large user scale and outstanding problems.
According to the relevant person in charge of the State Cyberspace Administration, the current number of apps has exceeded 5 million, and the problem of illegal collection and use of personal information has not been fundamentally solved.
In 2020, the governance work will be further intensified, and the scope of governance will be further expanded to SDKs (software development kits) and small programs on the basis of App verification.

Johns Hopkins University: More than 16 million cases of new coronavirus confirmed worldwide
Xinhua News Agency, New York, July 26 - According to the new coronavirus epidemic statistics released by Johns Hopkins University in the United States on the 26th, as of 2:40 Eastern Time on the 26th (Beijing time 14:40), the cumulative number of confirmed cases of new coronavirus in the world reached 16048100, with a total of 644537 deaths.
According to the data, the United States is the worst affected country in the world, with a total of 4178,027 confirmed cases and 146,460 deaths.
Brazil has a total of 2,394,513 confirmed cases and 86,449 deaths, both figures second only to the United States.

On the 25th, the 2020 Hunan Red Tourism and Culture Festival and the first Xiangtan Red Cultural Industry Expo kicked off in Lushan.
In recent years, the demand for red tourism has gradually increased.
However, the development of the red tourism industry is also facing difficulties such as the lack of young groups, the homogenization of tour projects, and the single channel of commercialization.
Especially with the sudden outbreak of the epidemic this year, the country's cultural tourism industry has suffered a serious setback, and red tourist attractions are also facing severe challenges.
For example, the use of scientific and technological means such as drone shooting and VR immersion experience can meet the tourist demand of "people have not arrived, the scenery has arrived"; the introduction of webcasting means to promote the famous and special products of red scenic spots can directly enhance the economic benefits of red tourism; the introduction of "cloud" technology to create a boutique display with prominent themes, clear directions and rich connotations to fully display and enhance the missionary function of red scenic spots; the innovation of red culture communication methods to make revolutionary cultural relics "live up" and make red tourism popular, so that red genes can be inherited and enhance the attractiveness of red scenic spots.
This cultural festival uses the popular "county (district) mayor + professional anchor special promotion" method to promote red cultural tourism special products, and uses 5G technology to provide real-time viewing and smart city demonstration services to promote red cultural tourism attractions, all of which are efforts to put smart wings on red tourism, and expect Hunan red tourism to become more and more popular.
US-China trade negotiators to meet in August
Hong Kong's South China Morning Post, citing an anonymous source, reported on the 25th that the head of China's trade negotiation team, Vice Premier Liu He, and the co-leader of the US team, Trade Representative Lai Haizhe, are expected to hold formal talks in August to assess the implementation of the first phase of the Sino-US trade agreement between the two sides.
The report said that although China has significantly increased the number of purchases of US agricultural products in the past few months, due to factors such as the new coronavirus epidemic, China's purchases are still some distance from the amount promised in the trade agreement.
Analysts say the recent U.S.-China closure of each other's consulates, along with other disputes, could derail any progress on trade.
The first phase of the trade agreement between China and the United States took effect one month after it was signed on January 15. The agreement stipulates that the trade framework group composed of high-level officials from both sides should hold talks every six months.
According to people familiar with the matter, the meeting will be "an important turning point," allowing both sides to assess the progress of the agreement.
But the person also said that if the tension between the United States and China leads to a low willingness to talk at this time, the two sides may agree that the May 8 teleconference between Lai Haizhe and Liu He has met the terms of the trade agreement for semi-annual talks.
Since the beginning of this year, Sino-US relations have deteriorated rapidly. The disputes between the two sides include a series of issues such as the origin of the new coronavirus, trade, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, the South China Sea and ideology.
Although US President Trump boasted about his achievements in the first phase of the agreement at the beginning of the year, his attitude has changed recently.
He said at a White House press conference on the 23rd that although China recently purchased a record number of US corn in a single day and also bought a lot of soybeans, "this trade agreement is not as meaningful to me now as it was when it was first reached."
An anonymous Beijing government adviser also believes that a new round of trade negotiations is unlikely due to poor US-China relations, and that "trade issues have lost weight in Sino-US relations."
But he revealed that China's economic and trade-related units still met on the 23rd to discuss a series of issues, including how to increase imports from the United States. "We have tried our best to buy, so any additional purchases will be difficult."
Peng Jining, vice president of the US-China Business Council, said that it is "more important than ever" to maintain the momentum of the first phase of the agreement, and pointed out that China has made progress this year in further opening its financial markets to US companies.
Analysts at Plenum, an independent research firm, said: "Talking is better than not talking, although it may only be regarded as routine."
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26 (Reporter Wei Yukun) The reporter learned from the Ministry of Emergency Management on the 26th that the National Defense Office and the Ministry of Emergency Management, together with the State Food and Material Reserve Bureau, have once again urgently dispatched 1.35 million woven bags, 1.2 million square meters of woven cloth, 130,000 square meters of geotextiles and other six types of central reserve flood control materials to Anhui to support Anhui's flood relief and rescue work.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Ministry of Emergency Management, at present, the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the Huaihe River basin maintain high water level fluctuations, and the "Yangtze River Flood No. 3 of 2020" was formed in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River on the 26th, increasing the risk in some areas.
The meteorological department expects heavy rainfall in Chongqing, Guizhou and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in the next three days, and the flood control situation is still severe and complicated.
According to reports, since the flood, the Ministry of Emergency Management has deployed a national comprehensive fire rescue team to pre-position professional rescue forces in key flood-prevention areas, participating in a total of 10,364 flood rescue and rescue operations, dispatching more than 130,000 soldiers, 17,778 fire engines, and 11,887 boats, rescuing 37,777 people trapped in distress, and evacuating and transferring more than 107,000 trapped people.
Zou Sheng, chief representative of Nasdaq China: Now is the best time for Chinese companies to IPO in the United States - Economic Observer - Professional financial news website
Economic Observation Network reporter Zhang Bin Because of the Ruixing coffee fraud incident, the US market has imposed stricter supervision on the Chinese stocks, and the valuation has been under pressure for a long time. The Chinese stocks listed in the United States are under pressure.
Recently, companies such as Shell and Ideal Automobile have been enthusiastic about listing in the United States.
Under the epidemic and the stock market crisis, is now the best time for Chinese companies to go public in the United States?
"In terms of recent IPO cases and the situation of companies going public in the United States, the IPO in the United States has not been affected in essence, but the market is very good now, and even now this time is the best time for Chinese companies to IPO in the United States in the past 10 years."
Yu Sheng, the chief representative of the Nasdaq Stock Exchange in China, said at the "2020 Listed Company Leaders Summit" hosted by Snowball.
In April this year, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) issued the "Statement on Audit Quality and the Important Role of Regulatory Access to Audit and Other International Information - A Discussion of Current Information Access Challenges for U.S. Public Companies with Significant Operations in China."
The statement said that although international cooperation and coordination have increased significantly in recent years, the US regulatory authorities still have problems in accessing information, and the SEC and PCAOB still face legal and practical challenges; corresponding to the document, the PCAOB website details the list of listed companies and their audit institutions that have encountered audit obstacles, and a large number of Chinese companies are listed.
In addition, in May this year, the US Senate passed the Foreign Company Accountability Act, which imposes additional information disclosure requirements on foreign companies listing in the United States.
In Hao Sheng's view, the crisis in China's stocks has not affected investors' appetite.
"When the news first came out, it caused everyone to panic, and everyone was asking whether they could go public in the United States in the future, but later we found that these issues were not a problem for investors. Investors may have asked these questions during the recent IPO roadshow in the United States, and even became standardized questions, but this was not regarded by investors as an important factor in not investing in a Chinese company.
It is recommended that you try to look at the current situation with a normal heart.
Of course, this time may seem to be the most serious situation in the past two years, but in terms of investor appetite, it has not been affected at all.
So from now until the end of this year or before the US election, the rush of IPOs to the US will continue.
On May 9 this year, Kingsoft Cloud was officially listed on NASDAQ in the United States, becoming the first Chinese company to IPO in the United States after the epidemic.
"The listing of Kingsoft Cloud gives a lot of confidence to the Chinese companies preparing for the IPO."
Yu Sheng said.
According to the stock data report released by Snowball in the first half of 2020, a total of 20 Chinese companies went to the United States for IPO in the first half of this year, an increase of 17.6% over the same period last year; in terms of the total amount of initial fundraising, 20 companies raised a total of 2.725 billion yuan, an increase of more than 52.4% compared with the same period last year; in terms of industry distribution, the number of IPOs in the healthcare industry in the first half of this year was outstanding, an increase of 100% over the same period last year.
According to Yu Sheng, the quality of Chinese companies that went to the United States for IPO in the first half of this year is high, and high-quality companies with strong fundamentals and growth will be more favored by investors.
In the short, medium and long term, Yu Sheng continues to be optimistic about the IPO of Ming Chinese companies in the United States.
"In the short term, the IPO boom in the United States is still continuing; in the medium term, Chinese companies have more choices, A-shares, Hong Kong stocks, and U.S. stocks, and everyone will take the U.S. election and China-U.S. relations as a factor in market selection and timing; in the long term, everything will return to normal, and market fluctuations are cycles, both political cycles and economic cycles, and will eventually return to the normal stage. The stock market has always been volatile."
Yu Sheng also said, "There are many uncertainties this year, but for high-quality companies, regardless of whether the market is good or bad, as long as they are solid and have the growth that investors can see, other factors are relatively secondary. Investors need to invest in excellent Chinese companies."

Then he came to the public space on the first floor of the National Grand Theater. In front of three nine-foot pianos with stories, he started a dialogue with Yang Yang, Zhang Haochen and the National Grand Theater's piano tuner Yu Qiang. Gang Qiang discussed with them the maintenance and maintenance of the piano, Rachmaninoff's music, the musicians' usual life and pre-performance preparation from the perspective of a senior piano enthusiast.

People's Daily commentator: Concentrate on running your own business and create new advantages for future development - On learning and implementing General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech at the entrepreneurs' symposium - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 25th, People's Daily, July 26th commentator article: Concentrate on doing your own thing to create new advantages for future development
At present, the global epidemic and the world economic situation are still severe and complex, and the challenges facing China's development are unprecedented.
Maintaining strategic determination, enhancing confidence in victory, and concentrating on running our own affairs are the keys to our response to various risks and challenges.
At the entrepreneur symposium held recently, General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed that in the current external environment of rising protectionism, sluggish world economy and shrinking global market, we must concentrate on doing our own things well, give full play to the advantages of the domestic super-large-scale market, and gradually form a new development pattern with the domestic large-scale cycle as the main body and the domestic and international double cycles promoting each other, upgrade the level of industrial chain supply chain modernization, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation, accelerate key core technology research, and create new advantages for future development.
He who sees the trend is wise, and he who controls the trend wins.
In the external environment of deepening economic globalization, the market and resources have played an important role in the rapid development of our country.
Now, the world under the impact of the epidemic is undergoing profound changes, facing more unstable and uncertain factors, and economic globalization is encountering headwinds and reversals.
One of the most important aspects is to take the expansion and satisfaction of domestic demand as the strategic basis for development, give full play to its own advantages, add impetus to China's economic development through the prosperity of the domestic economy and the smooth circulation of the domestic economy, and drive the recovery of the world economy.
We must deeply realize that building a complete domestic demand system is related to China's long-term development and long-term stability.
The Party Central Committee reviewed the situation and clearly proposed to firmly implement the strategy of expanding domestic demand, which is the need to cope with the impact of the epidemic, the need to maintain the long-term sustainable and healthy development of China's economy, and the need to meet the growing needs of the people.
The advantage of a big economy is that it can be recycled internally.
China has the world's most complete and largest industrial system, strong production capacity and perfect supporting capacity, with more than 100 million market players and more than 170 million people with higher education or various professional skills, as well as a super-large-scale domestic demand market formed by 1.4 billion people, including more than 400 million middle-income groups. It is in the stage of rapid development of new industrialization, informationization, urbanization and agricultural modernization, and has great potential for investment demand.
The basic socialist economic system, such as the socialist market economy system, can not only stimulate the vitality of various market entities, liberate and develop social productive forces, but also promote the organic unification of efficiency and fairness, and continuously achieve common prosperity.
We must firmly grasp the strategic basis of expanding domestic demand, so that all aspects of production, distribution and circulation rely more on the domestic market to achieve a virtuous circle, clarify the strategic direction of supply-side structural reform, and promote the dynamic balance between total supply and total demand at a higher level.
It is necessary to accelerate the construction of a complete domestic demand system, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation and other aspects of innovation, accelerate the promotion of strategic emerging industries such as digital economy, intelligent manufacturing, life and health, and new materials, and form more new growth points and growth poles.
Openness leads to progress, while closedness inevitably leads to backwardness.
General Secretary Xi Jinping has repeatedly stressed that China's door of opening up will not be closed, but will only open wider.
With the domestic cycle as the main body, it is by no means a closed operation behind closed doors, but through the potential of domestic demand, the domestic market and the international market are better connected, and the two international and domestic markets and resources are better utilized to achieve stronger and more sustainable development.
At the same time, there is no contradiction between expanding domestic demand and expanding opening up. The smoother the domestic cycle, the more conducive it is to building a new pattern of opening up, and the more conducive it is to forming new advantages for participating in international cooperation and competition.
Although the trend of protectionism is rising internationally, we must stand on the right side of history, persist in deepening reform, expanding opening up, strengthening open cooperation in the field of science and technology, promoting the construction of an open world economy, and promoting the construction of a community with a shared future for mankind.
The Chinese nation has experienced many hardships in its history, but it has never been crushed. Instead, it has become more and more courageous, constantly growing through hardships and rising from them.
On the way forward, with the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, the significant advantages of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, the strong mobilization ability and strong comprehensive strength, and the unity and struggle of the whole party, the whole army and the people of all ethnic groups in the country, we will surely be able to overcome all difficulties and obstacles, maintain the good momentum of China's economic and social development, build a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way, and successfully start a new journey of building a socialist modern country in an all-round way!

Interestingly, the "post-90s" are more inclined to start saving from a sum of "small money," with 60% of them saving an average amount of less than 20 yuan each... ...
Using the balance to save money has also become a "post-90s" saving habit.
The data shows that among the 700 million users of Yu'e Bao, 134 million users are "post-90s."
There are 174 million "post-90s" in China, which means that about 3 out of every 4 "post-90s" in the country are saving money with their balance.
At present, the 7-day annualized yield of Yu'e Bao and other money funds has fallen from a level above 2% at the beginning of the year to around 1.5%.
Even so, it did not affect the pace of saving money after the 1990s.
In the context of the improvement of the "savings effect" of Yu'e Bao, many young people who are used to using Yu'e Bao are also directly transformed into "fundamentalists."
According to Alipay data, as of July 13, the number of new "basic people" on Alipay in the past month has more than doubled year-on-year, and more and more young people have achieved "advanced" financial management on Alipay.
Some analysts believe that the flow of funds from Yu'e Bao into the stock market is also an important reason for the clear decline in the share of money funds in June.
The report also shows that "post-90s" girls are more inclined to save more money, and the average amount of money saved is 20% higher than that of boys; among the users holding funds on the Alipay platform, 60% are men, and women tend to choose a more prudent financial management method than men.
After saving money, what are the plans of the post-90s generation?
Alipay data show that the "post-90s" have the habit of saving money for their goals, and the largest number of users use travel as a goal for saving money.
Affected by the epidemic, many "post-90s" saved money to prepare for travel after the epidemic; the resumption of cinemas also provided a new way to shift from saving money to consumption.

A total of 13 people from the Information Department of the Philippine Presidential Office have tested positive - China News Service
(Combating new coronavirus pneumonia) A total of 13 people in the Information Department of the Philippine Presidential Palace have tested positive
China News Network, Manila, July 26 (Reporter Guan Xiangdong) The Information Department of the Philippine Presidential Office (PCOO) issued a notice on the 25th, and the minister of the department, Martin Andanar, was tested negative for new coronavirus pneumonia on the 24th.
As of the afternoon of the same day, a total of 13 staff members of the PCOO had tested positive, and the previous three positive people, one dead and two still receiving treatment.
On the 24th, Andanar and 49 PCOO staff members were tested for new coronavirus pneumonia due to contact with an infected PCOO staff member.
The report released on the 25th showed that 10 of the staff tested positive.
PCOO Deputy Minister of Administration and Legal Affairs Marvin Gatpayat said that the ministry's new administrative office building in the presidential palace was scheduled to resume on the 27th, the day President Duterte delivered his fifth State of the Nation Address.
On the same day, Martin Andanar assured the public that the PCOO continues to fulfill its duties to the Filipino people, ensuring that important information is provided to the public in a timely manner, while strengthening contact tracing and testing to avoid further spread of the new coronavirus among PCOO staff. He prayed for the speedy recovery of the staff who tested positive.
The Ministry of Health of the Philippines announced that on the same day, 2019 new cases were confirmed in the country, with a total of 78,412 cases, of which 50,763 are still sick, nearly 90% are mild, 9% are asymptomatic, and less than 1% are severe and critical cases.
France to increase military investment in space - Xinhua
French Defense Minister Florence Parly said on the 24th that France will add hundreds of millions of euros to the space defense budget and develop space military forces to prevent "unfriendly actions" that other countries may carry out in outer space.
Parly told La Provence on the same day that between 2019 and 2025, France's budget for military space projects will increase from the previously proposed 3.6 billion euros ($4.2 billion) to 4.3 billion euros ($5 billion).
According to the French Military Planning Act for 2019-2025 approved by the French Parliament in 2018, France is expected to update the existing observation satellites and communication satellites, launch three electromagnetic interception satellites, and improve the modernization of space surveillance radars.
French President Emmanuel Macron announced last July that a military space command and an "aviation and space force" would be created within the French Air Force.
Parly said she would formally announce the creation of the space force later during a visit to a military school in Salon-de-Provence.
Parly said the Space Force, which is part of the Air Force, will have 500 people by 2025.
"Gone is the idea that space serves the common good of science," she said. "Today, space is a place where nations compete for global supremacy."
Parly reiterated Macron's previous statement, saying that France has no intention of provoking an arms race.
"We are by no means in an arms race. But it is my responsibility to be thoroughly aware of the threats we may face."
Parly recalled the 2017 surveillance of a military satellite shared by France and Italy.
She said that it was a Russian satellite that was "peeping."
Russia denies the claim.
Parly said France would "soon" have small patrol satellites capable of detecting and targeting "those behind unfriendly moves."
French media believe that the reason why France is seeking to establish a space force is that US President Donald Trump asked the US Department of Defense to draft a bill to establish a space force in February last year.
Trump signed the National Defense Authorization Act last December, approving the establishment of the Space Force, the sixth branch of the US military.
Some experts fear that these US initiatives have accelerated the pace of US space militarization and may trigger a new round of space arms race.

Shaanxi: cracking the problem of helping after relocation to avoid the masses "running in two directions"
Shaanxi: Solving the problem of post-relocation assistance to avoid the masses "running in both directions"
CCTV News: In response to the follow-up problems encountered by immigrants and relocated people in integrating into local life, Ankang County, Shaanxi Province, has built a "good-neighborly home" based on local practical innovations to guide relocated villagers to become citizens and achieve stability, rapid integration, and prosperity.
The county is located in the Qinba Mountains, and nearly one-third of the local population has moved out of the mountains through migration.
This year, 39-year-old Chai Changjiang moved from Zhongwu Village, Yanmen Town, Handan County, to the Pearl Community of Democracy Town.
He brought his pension insurance card to the "Good Neighbor House" where the community is located, and completed this year's pension insurance in less than two minutes.
At the beginning of this year, Handan County incorporated employment, civil affairs, medical insurance and other businesses into its management through the construction of a "good-neighborly home."
In the Pearl community, 305 residents entered the local community factory through the "Good Neighbor House" recruitment information.
At present, 31 centralized resettlement sites with more than 100 households in Handan County have been fully covered by community factories, providing 2,598 jobs.
The report said that the shared accommodation market began to pick up in March
According to the "China Shared Accommodation Development Report 2020" (hereinafter referred to as the "Report") released by the Sharing Economy Research Center of the National Information Center, the transaction volume of China's shared accommodation market fell by 72.1% year-on-year in the first five months of 2020 due to the impact of the epidemic.
However, the shared accommodation market has started to pick up since March, and the market turnover, order volume and reception number have gradually recovered.
The "Report" shows that the transaction volume of the shared accommodation market has fallen sharply. On the one hand, due to the sharp decline in the demand for travel accommodation under the prevention and control of the epidemic, the order volume has decreased sharply, and the total order volume in the first five months has dropped by 65% year-on-year, and the number of visitors has dropped by 63% year-on-year. On the other hand, the weak demand has also led to a significant decline in the price of overnight stays, and the average nightly price in the first five months has dropped by 16% year-on-year.
However, in March, April, and May, the market turnover increased by 78%, 199%, and 35% respectively; the number of orders increased by 141%, 152%, and 50% respectively; and the number of visitors increased by 81%, 112%, and 28% respectively.
The report pointed out that the development of the shared accommodation industry is promising in the long run, but there are still many uncertainties in the near future.
In this regard, Yu Fengxia, deputy director of the Sharing Economy Research Center of the National Information Center, told the "Workers' Daily" reporter that the development of shared accommodation needs stronger policy support. On the one hand, it is necessary to implement the policies that have been introduced in the early stage, further strengthen policy promotion, and focus on creating a better business environment. On the other hand, it is also necessary to further increase policy guidance and support from various aspects such as stimulating consumer demand, enriching the supply of tourist accommodation services, innovating service methods, and strengthening cooperation between the government and platform companies.
According to Reuters, ArcelorMittal, the world's largest steel producer, has a new coronavirus outbreak at a plant in Lázaro Cárdenas, Mexico, and 21 people have died so far.
According to reports, Solorio, secretary general of the local branch of the Mexican Union of Mining and Metallurgical Workers, said the dead included employees, contractors and suppliers of the plant.
Solorio said 21 people have died at the plant since April, nine of them union members.
Because of the factory's strict hygiene measures, it is possible that workers contracted the virus outside the factory.
The plant employs more than 7,000 people, according to the union.
As of July 25, Mexico has more than 385,000 confirmed cases and more than 40,000 deaths. Mexico has the fourth highest number of new coronavirus deaths in the world.
Xiamen, July 26 (Xinhua) -- China's famous vascular surgery center, the Vascular Surgery Department of Shanghai Changhai Hospital of the Naval Medical University, signed a contract with the Vascular Surgery Department of Zhongshan Hospital affiliated to Xiamen University on the 25th to jointly set up a collaboration center to promote exchanges and cooperation between the two sides in the field of vascular surgery, especially in the field of aortic emergency.
Zhongshan Hospital, affiliated with Xiamen University, said that after the vascular surgery of the two hospitals officially formed a collaborative unit, it will carry out remote consultation, formulate treatment plans with Changhai Hospital in real-time online consultation, select and send talents for further training, and jointly carry out surgical technology exchanges and teaching room inspections every week. For complex cases, Changhai experts can be invited to the hospital to perform surgery according to the needs of patients, so that patients in southwest China can enjoy the top medical resources in the country without leaving the province.
The two hospitals will also work together to carry out innovative scientific research on surgery, popularization of aortic diseases and early screening.
A special seminar on the aorta was held in Xiamen on the same day, sponsored by the Beijing Health Promotion Association and hosted by the Zhongshan Hospital of Xiamen University.
At the same time, the above-mentioned two well-known hospitals in Shanghai and Shanghai held a signing ceremony for the Vascular Surgery Collaborative Center and announced the formation of a collaborative unit to jointly improve the treatment level of vascular surgery-related diseases in southwest China.
Shanghai Changhai Hospital Vascular Surgery is the only vascular surgery institute in the army and the only clinical medical center for vascular system diseases in Shanghai. It is also the first national key discipline of vascular surgery. It led the establishment of the Professional Committee of Endovascular Angiology of the Chinese Medical Association and is a top team with deep accumulation in the industry.
Professor Huang Xiaojin, director of vascular surgery at the Zhongshan Hospital of Xiamen University, was interviewed by the media.
The vascular surgery department of Zhongshan Hospital, affiliated with Xiamen University, is the first independent vascular surgery department in Fujian Province, and has long been committed to the diagnosis and treatment of aortic and peripheral vascular diseases. In 2018, it was approved to build a provincial key clinical specialty.
In the treatment of aortic diseases, in addition to the treatment of dissecting aneurysms and aortic aneurysms, he has extensive experience in emergency ruptured aortic aneurysms.
"The vascular surgery of Zhongshan Hospital affiliated to Xiamen University is very outstanding in the region in terms of the history of development, the breadth, difficulty and complexity of surgery, so this time we set up a collaboration center. In addition to the aorta, we can also carry out in-depth cooperation in medicine, teaching and research in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases such as lower limb arteries and carotid arteries."
Professor Feng Rui, deputy director of vascular surgery at Shanghai Changhai Hospital, said.
Zhongshan Hospital, affiliated with Xiamen University, and Shanghai Changhai Hospital signed a contract in 2018 to establish the "Li Zhaoshen Famous Medical Studio" in Gastroenterology.
Professor Huang Xiaojin, director of the hospital's vascular surgery department, said in an interview with China News Network that the hospital's vascular surgery department has also had a long history of exchanges with Changhai Hospital. The two hospitals have officially formed a collaborative unit, bringing the cooperation and exchange between the two sides to a new level.
He said that the hospital will regularly invite Shanghai experts to Xiamen to carry out surgical technology exchanges, teaching room inspections, and discussion of difficult cases. At the same time, it will further carry out remote consultation, and currently plans to conduct remote consultation once a week. In addition, the department will also select personnel for further training and exchange, and strengthen the training and development of disciplinary personnel.
The reporter learned at the meeting that vascular disease is the number one cause of death in China, and the aorta plays an important role as the main artery of various organs in the human body, flowing from the heart to the whole body.
The occurrence of aortic disease is often accompanied by high risk, high mortality and high difficulty of treatment. The thickest section of the aorta has a diameter of 4 cm. Once a hemangioma forms, a rupture occurs, or a rupture of the blood vessel lining produces a dissection, which will cause major bleeding and is very dangerous.
In recent years, as people's lifestyles have changed and the pace of life has accelerated, China has become the world's largest country with high blood pressure, and aortic diseases have also increased. Today, with the development of surgical technology and industrial materials, the treatment of aortic diseases continues to develop in the direction of minimally invasive, rapid and efficient.
Doctors can achieve good treatment results by puncturing the thigh and placing a stent in the aorta to properly "divert" the blood flow, thereby avoiding the impact on the aneurysm or ruptured dissection. Some operations even require only local anesthesia.
This academic symposium invited more than ten domestic experts to discuss new advances in the treatment of aortic diseases, and carried out cutting-edge technical training and discussion of difficult cases in the form of a conference salon.
The reporter learned at the meeting that with the development of surgical technology and industrial materials, the current treatment of aortic diseases continues to develop in the direction of minimally invasive, rapid and efficient.
General Administration of National Defense Continues to Maintain the Yangtze River and Huaihe River Flood Control Level II Response
There will be heavy rainfall from the Sichuan Basin to the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River
The General Administration of National Defense continues to maintain the Yangtze River and Huai River flood control level II response
The reporter learned from the Ministry of Emergency Management on the 25th: It is expected that there will be heavy rainfall from the Sichuan Basin to the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River by the 27th. It is necessary to continue to pay attention to the impact on the flood situation of the Yangtze River and the Huai River. The dikes in some areas of the Yangtze River and the Huai River basin are immersed in high water levels for a long time, and there is a high risk of landslides, collapses, and pipe surges.
The State Defense Commission deliberated and decided to continue to maintain the Yangtze River and Huai River flood control level II response.
On the 25th, the meeting of the Ministry of Water Resources emphasized that the main stream of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River maintained a high water level, the flood peak of the main stream of the Huaihe River passed through the Bengbu section of Anhui, and the water level of Taihu Lake has continued to exceed the warning for 28 days and exceed the guarantee for 9 days.
At the same time, prepare for heavy rainfall in the southwest and north China.
The Ministry of Water Resources maintains a level II emergency response for flood and drought disaster prevention.
At the request of the Jiangxi Provincial Defense Office, the National Defense Office and the Ministry of Emergency Management urgently dispatched 20 sets of high-volume professional plow trucks from the Shandong, Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provincial Fire and Rescue Corps and Fujian Longyan Qiaolong Emergency Equipment Co., Ltd. to help solve serious disasters such as urban flooding and farmland waterlogging caused by heavy rainfall in Jiangxi.
On the 25th, all the equipment has arrived at the front line of flood control and rescue in Jiangxi.
In accordance with the unified dispatch of the local government, the Jiangxi Flood Control and Rescue Front Command of the Fire and Rescue Bureau of the Ministry of Emergency Management immediately arranged for the Jiangxi Fire and Rescue Corps and the reinforcement forces of the surrounding provinces to set up 20 professional plowing teams to carry out plowing and rescue tasks in Nanchang, Jiujiang and Shangrao, Jiangxi.
At the same time, the National Defense Office and the Ministry of Emergency Management also urgently called up 100 sets of trailer-type pumping stations of the central reserve of flood control materials to support the flood control, rescue and drainage work in Jiangxi Province.
The flood control and drought relief headquarters of Anhui Province announced that since 12:00 on July 25, the relevant areas of the Yangtze River, Huai River and Chaohu River basins in Anhui have entered an emergency flood control period.
The Hefei Municipal Disaster Mitigation Committee decided to upgrade Hefei's disaster relief emergency response to level II at 10:00 on July 25.
On July 25, the Sichuan Provincial Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters issued the first yellow warning for flash floods since the beginning of this year.
The warning points out that from 20:00 on July 25th to 20:00 on the 26th, there is a high possibility of flash floods in Dazhu County, Dazhou City, Linshui County, Guang'an City, Meigu County, Leibo County, Mianning County, Yuexi County, Xide County, Zhaojue County, and Jinyang County.

Recently, China's Yangtze River and Huaihe River basins suffered from floods, and some of the affected people moved to flood-prevention settlements for temporary residence.
The concentration of personnel at resettlement sites has led to an increase in the temporary use of fire and electricity, increasing the risk of fire.
On July 25, the Fire and Rescue Bureau of the Ministry of Emergency Management issued fire safety tips for flood-proof resettlement sites, calling on management units to implement the main responsibility of fire safety, the masses to strengthen safety precautions, and jointly create a good fire safety environment.

China Railway Chengdu Bureau Group Company Profile
China News Service, Chongqing, July 26 (Reporter Han Wei) The reporter learned from China Railway Chengdu Bureau Group Co., Ltd. on the 26th that the Zhengwan High-speed Railway Small Three Gorges Tunnel, with a total length of about 18.9 kilometers, was completed on the same day.
It is understood that the Little Three Gorges Tunnel is not only the longest high-speed rail tunnel within the Three Gorges Reservoir area, but also the longest single-hole double-line high-speed rail tunnel with a design speed of 350 km/h in the projects currently under construction in China.
Located in the three provinces and cities of Henan, Hubei and Chongqing, the Zhengwan high-speed railway connects with the Beijing-Guangzhou and Xulan high-speed railways in the north of Zhengzhou, and reaches Chongqing in the south of Wanzhou. It is an important part of the river channel and the Hunan channel in China's "eight vertical and eight horizontal" high-speed railway network.
The Zhengwan High-speed Railway's Little Three Gorges Tunnel was completed on the 26th.
The picture shows the scene of the breakthrough.
The Zhengwan high-speed railway starts in Zhengzhou City, Henan Province, and runs southwest through Pingdingshan City, Nanyang City, and Xiangyang City, Hubei Province, to Wanzhou District, Chongqing City. The new line has a total length of about 818 kilometers and a design speed of 350 kilometers per hour, with about 184 kilometers in Chongqing.
Among them, the Zhengzhou-Xiangyang section has started operation on December 1, 2019, and the Chongqing section is stepping up construction.
The Small Three Gorges Tunnel, which was completed on the 26th, is a control project for the entire line of the Zhengwan High-speed Railway. The project is located at the junction of Fengjie County and Wushan County in Chongqing, with a total length of about 18.9 kilometers and a maximum depth of 890 meters.
Construction of the tunnel began in February 2017, and the entire line was completed on July 26, 2020.
According to Wang Guojun, head of high-speed rail tunnel design at China Railway Second Academy Engineering Group Co., Ltd., the survey designer, the terrain and geological conditions of the location of the Little Three Gorges Tunnel are very complex, facing risks such as karst, muddy water, and large deformation of soft rock. It is a Class I high-risk tunnel, and tunnel design and construction are extremely difficult.
"During the construction of the project, we used geological survey, geophysical prospecting and advanced drilling methods to advance geological forecasting, and adopted special design schemes for more than 30 types of caves. For example, a bridge with a length of 24 meters was designed and built to cross a large cave with a longitudinal length of more than 10 meters and a depth of more than 55 meters in the tunnel to avoid tunnel settlement," said Wang Guojun.
According to the China Railway Tunnel Bureau, the construction party, during the construction of the tunnel, a combination of dredging and plugging was adopted. Through the construction of horizontal tunnel leveling, grouting and water plugging, strengthening the structural support of the tunnel and the construction of a sewage treatment station, it not only ensured the orderly progress of the project, but also avoided the damage of construction drainage to the water body of the Small Three Gorges Scenic Area. At the same time, it successfully overcame the construction problems of bad geology such as the large deformation of soft rock for up to 7 kilometers, and the maximum daily water inflow of 157,000 cubic meters of muddy water.
After the Zhengwan high-speed railway is completed and opened to traffic, it will become a new convenient and fast passenger transport main channel in southwest China to the Central Plains, North China and Northeast China. It is of great significance to improve the capacity and quality of the northeast railway channel in southwest China, improve the layout of the regional road network, accelerate the development of tourism resources and urbanization along the line, promote coordinated regional development, and promote the implementation of the western development strategy.
Experts say it is unconstitutional to collect immigration data through the U.S. census to allocate seats in the House of Representatives
Several civil rights groups and several U.S. cities and counties have sued the federal government, saying the Trump administration's attempt to exclude undocumented immigrants from the U.S. census is unworkable and unconstitutional.
The U.S. Census will determine the allocation of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Sarah Brannon, executive attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, told VOA, "This is not going to work."
She went on to say that Trump's request to determine the citizenship status of people on the census is difficult to do and "not very reliable."
Another civil liberties group, Common Cause, filed a lawsuit Thursday challenging Trump's executive order.
Some cities in New Jersey and Georgia have joined the lawsuit.
Virginia's Arlington County joined the lawsuit Friday.
Garvey, chairman of the Arlington County Board of Supervisors, said, "The U.S. Constitution requires an accurate count of our population every 10 years. We must accurately count every person living in Arlington County and not allow this unlawful attempt to scare people away and reduce the size of our immigrant community."
Other organizations and individuals praised President Trump's executive order.
Alabama Attorney General Marshall called the executive order a "victory" for the state.
He said, "The allocation of seats in the House of Representatives and the Electoral College to each state must be based on the number of residents living in each state, and the number of residents who are legal residents."
The US Supreme Court last year blocked the Trump administration from including a citizenship question on the 2020 census form.
President Trump signed an executive order earlier this week directing Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who oversees the U.S. Census Bureau, to submit data on the undocumented population from the census so that the administration can exclude the undocumented population from each state's census count and use it to determine whether each state increases, decreases or maintains its representation in the House.
Every 10 years, the United States redistributes seats in the House of Representatives based on population changes.
Heavy Rainfall in 33 Districts and Counties of Chongqing, Local Flood Control Level IV Emergency Response Launched - China News Service
Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, July 26 (Reporters Ke Gaoyang and Li Song) The reporter learned from the Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters of Chongqing that Chongqing has ushered in a new round of heavy rainfall since July 25, with heavy rains in 33 districts and counties, and super-alert water level floods in four small and medium-sized rivers.
According to the monitoring of Chongqing Hydrological Monitoring Station, from 8 a.m. on the 25th to 8 a.m. on the 26th, most parts of Chongqing ushered in heavy rain, and heavy rain occurred in 33 districts and counties such as Jiangjin, Minjiang and Wulong, including 16 districts and counties such as Wanzhou, Yunyang and Nanchuan.
The maximum daily rainfall was 197.5 mm in Longshan Village, Jinshan Town, Nanchuan.
Affected by heavy rainfall, four small and medium-sized rivers, namely Donkey Creek in Jiangjin District, Yujiang River in Fuling District, Yingyang River in Kaizhou District, and Tantan River in Yunyang County, have experienced over-alert water level floods, and the water level is still rising.
The heavy rainfall also caused a landslide in Liujing Village, Land Township, Wulong District, resulting in the interruption of village road traffic. The landslide slid into a tributary of the Wujiang River along the Canghe River, blocking the river and forming a dam lake. The local authorities have urgently organized the transfer of people downstream.
In response to the heavy rain, the Chongqing Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters issued a river flood level III warning message at 13:00 on the 26th, and launched a flood control level IV emergency response, requiring relevant districts, counties and units to strengthen patrol duty, mobilize emergency rescue teams and materials in a timely manner, and evacuate and transfer people in threatened areas.
Responding to the situation and promoting the construction of industrial projects
In the middle of summer in Hunan, a heat wave is raging.
The enthusiasm released by the on-site observation meeting to promote the construction of industrial projects in the province has overshadowed the sweltering heat of the three days, and the clear guidance of "comparing the strength of the industry and the hero of the project" has encouraged Sanxiang.
The development of Hunan has always depended on building projects and cultivating industries.
In the face of the extremely unusual first half of the year, under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, the whole province adhered to a game of chess, went all out to fight the two tough battles of epidemic prevention and flood prevention, and took industrial projects as the "first move" to implement "six stability" and "six guarantees."
From the 1.9% year-on-year decline in GDP in the first quarter to the 1.3% year-on-year growth in the first half of the year, it is self-evident that the period is difficult and the effort is huge.
On this precious report card, the construction of industrial projects is the key support for Hunan to accelerate economic recovery and stable development.
The momentum is smooth and irreversible.
The construction of industrial projects should be placed in the general trend of the overall situation, and be good at accumulating momentum, building momentum and seeking momentum, as well as being good at recognizing change, seeking change and responding to change.
Under the complex and severe background of the current international situation, in addition to the painstaking efforts to attract investment, it is also necessary to calm down and study the new characteristics of the current new situation, to better grasp the law, to be more scientific and accurate, and to better integrate into the new development pattern with the domestic cycle as the main body and the domestic and international double cycle promoting each other.
More attention should be paid to improving the capacity of the industrial base.
In the first half of the year, not only did a large number of heavyweight investment projects in emerging industries in our province break ground and sow hope, but more traditional industrial enterprises accelerated their deployment and success in the digital, intelligent and green industrial transformation.
The Yiyang Aoshikang Third Science Park project has transformed the existing production line, and the intelligent production line of high-end printed circuit boards has taken the lead; the new factory area of Hunan Zhongyan Changde Cigarette Factory is committed to intelligent transformation and the construction of modern factories, which is also a vivid portrayal of "old trees sprouting new shoots" ... ... Focusing on major national strategies and "two new priorities," we will focus on consolidating and upgrading advantageous industries, actively cultivating and developing emerging industries, and comprehensively increasing scientific and technological innovation and localization substitution, so as to continuously consolidate the basic conditions and save the momentum of transformation.
More attention should be paid to cultivating and developing new economic models and new business models.
The sudden new crown epidemic has brought the popularity of the "cloud economy," stimulated the potential of the digital economy, and provided new opportunities for industrial transformation: in the first half of the year, the computer and office equipment manufacturing industry, electronic and communication equipment manufacturing industry in our province increased by 12.6%, the online retail sales of wholesale and retail enterprises above the quota increased by 32.2% year-on-year, and the online meal fee income of catering enterprises increased by 35.6% year-on-year.
It is the general trend to nurture new opportunities in the crisis and open up new opportunities in the changing situation, actively promote digital industrialization and industrial digitization, and guide the integrated development of the digital economy and the real economy.
Pay more attention to optimizing and stabilizing the supply chain of the industrial chain.
Construction machinery is the main force of the Hunan industry, but two-thirds of the supporting enterprises are outside the province, and there is still space and potential in the supporting chain.
To strengthen the industrial chain thinking and grasping projects, it is not only necessary for the head enterprises to continue to accumulate and achieve technological breakthroughs in the key links of the industrial chain; it is also necessary to cultivate all over the country, stimulate the "chain" lock reaction by strengthening the chain and extending the chain, promote the coordinated layout of related supporting industries, and accelerate the construction of independent, controllable, safe and reliable industrial chain supply chain.
Overcoming difficulties and supporting enterprises, Hunan is still a hot and happy land with a good business environment and emerging market opportunities.
All over the province, there are frequent moves, new moves, and practical moves to promote the "acceleration" of high-quality development by "reducing the burden" of enterprises; Shaoyang implements "shareholder-style" services, and does not prevaricate for enterprises, does not discount policies, and does not solve problems overnight... In the process of recovering the losses caused by the epidemic, all kinds of "do everything possible" to identify the pain points of the short board and achieve a vivid story of turning the crisis into an opportunity.
A mind to study the industry, cultivate the industry, develop the industry, solidly optimize the business environment, will be able to win the favor of more investors.
The wind and waves ahead are still there, but the state of riding the wind and waves has become the norm for the province to grasp the construction of industrial projects and promote high-quality development.
During this critical period, we must learn well and implement the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's series of important instructions and instructions, effectively respond to external uncertainties with the certainty of our own work, persistently promote the construction of industrial projects, share enthusiasm and sweat, and ensure the successful completion of the "13th Five-Year Plan" and the building of a well-off society in all respects.

Cultivating New Business Forms and Opening New Spaces for Employment
New employment methods continue to emerge, opening up new employment space, and a number of innovative service policies have also been introduced to help new employment forms thrive.
According to the latest data from the National Bureau of Statistics, the national urban unemployment rate was 5.7% in June, down 0.2 percentage points from May.
This is also the second consecutive decline in the national urban survey unemployment rate since April. Behind the monthly decline in the unemployment rate data is the continuous emergence of new employment opportunities in new business forms.
Now the monthly salary of more than 5,000, coupled with the novelty of embracing information technology, has made Guo Mei more and more motivated.
At the innovation incubation base of the Shanxi Transformation and Comprehensive Reform Demonstration Zone, there are more than 2,300 data taggers.
Not only data annotators, since this year, the state has also defined 25 occupations such as nucleic acid testers and online learning service providers as new occupations, developed occupational skill standards, and launched skill training programs to support the development of practitioners.
The state is also innovating employment services in response to new employment methods and new entrepreneurial paths.
Recently, the National Development and Reform Commission and 13 other departments jointly issued the "Opinions on Supporting the Healthy Development of New Business Forms and New Models to Activate the Consumer Market and Drive the Expansion of Employment" to provide workers with a variety of employment opportunities.
Many departments will jointly cultivate new individuals in the market, further reduce the cost of online entrepreneurship and employment for self-employed people; make new business practitioners more secure, and policies such as flexible employment rights and social security will be introduced one after another.

The overall stability of employment and prices shows that the economy has a "temperature"

The overall stability of employment and prices shows that the economy has a "temperature"
Lin Huocan, reporter of Economic Daily and China Economic Net
In the first half of this year, in the face of the impact of the new crown pneumonia epidemic, China coordinated and promoted all aspects of epidemic prevention and control and economic and social development. The situation of epidemic prevention and control continued to improve, the steady recovery of the economy was obvious, and employment and price performance, which are closely related to people's livelihood, were generally stable. China's economy handed over a warm economic performance report card.
In the first two months of this year, the surveyed unemployment rate increased.
In particular, in February, the production and operation activities of many enterprises were basically suspended, the demand for labor by enterprises decreased, recruitment was delayed or canceled, and the urban survey unemployment rate increased.
With the gradual improvement of the epidemic prevention and control situation, the whole society's production and life order has been continuously restored.
The Party Central Committee adhered to the general tone of seeking progress while maintaining stability, further increased the hedging of macro policies, comprehensively strengthened the employment priority policy, and actively promoted the work of helping enterprises stabilize and expand employment.
China has increased its policy of hedging and stabilizing jobs, and has launched a policy combination of "reduction, exemption, delay and compensation," phased reduction and exemption of three social insurance unit contributions, allowing deferred payment of social insurance premiums, expanding the return of unemployment insurance for small and medium-sized micro-enterprises, benefiting from the work-training policy, and providing subsidies for enterprises to absorb key groups of employment, apprenticeship subsidies, etc.
With the implementation of various stable employment policies, the employment demand of enterprises has steadily rebounded, the employment situation has gradually improved, and the surveyed urban unemployment rate has gradually declined. In June, the surveyed unemployment rate was 5.7%.
Zhang Yi, director of the Department of Population and Employment Statistics of the National Bureau of Statistics, said that in the second quarter, various employment policies continued to be effective, and the labor force that had withdrawn in the previous period due to the impact of the epidemic gradually returned, and the urban labor participation rate in June increased by about 10 percentage points from February, close to the same period last year.
According to the data, the total urban employment in June increased by more than 19% compared with February, and most industries reached the pre-epidemic level; the average weekly working hours of employees in enterprises reached 46.8 hours, an increase of 6.6 hours from February and a slight increase of 0.1 hours from January.
Prices are also related to thousands of households.
In January this year, the CPI rose by 5.4% year-on-year, setting a new high for many years.
In February, although the year-on-year increase in CPI fell slightly, it was still in the "5 range."
The year-on-year increase in CPI is at a high level, which is driven by consumer demand before the Spring Festival, as well as the wrong month of the Spring Festival and the low year-on-year base.
However, the impact of the coronavirus epidemic on prices is particularly obvious.
Affected by the prevention and control of the epidemic, logistics delays, untimely supply of materials, and increased material transportation costs occurred throughout the country in January and February. In addition, some citizens hoarded and snapped up, and the prices of some necessities rose significantly.
In order to cope with the disturbance caused by the epidemic prevention and control to the price situation, the relevant departments have included important daily necessities in the scope of emergency transportation guarantee to ensure the smooth transportation of materials.
Under the effect of a series of policy measures, the market supply of vegetables and fruits has been effectively guaranteed.
In response to the rapid rise in pork prices at the beginning of this year, after the central government introduced the policy of ensuring supply and stabilizing prices, all regions and departments quickly implemented it, the supply of pork reserves was significantly improved, pig production capacity was restored in an orderly manner, and the production and marketing order gradually normalized.
Since March, pork prices have fallen continuously, and in May, the year-on-year increase in food prices fell to 10.6%; in June, pork prices rose slightly month-on-month due to factors such as a slowdown in the release of live pigs, a decrease in imports and a rebound in group consumption demand.
The seasonal variation of fresh vegetable prices is obvious, with an average increase of 3.4% in the first half of the year.
Affected by the higher comparison base in the same period last year, fresh fruit prices continued to decline year-on-year, with an average decline of 13.3% in the first half of the year.
The basic livelihood of the masses has been effectively safeguarded, and the overall economic and social situation has remained stable and orderly.
With the gradual recovery of transportation and logistics, localities have stepped up efforts to ensure supply, and market supply and demand conditions have improved.
Beginning in March, the CPI fell for four consecutive months, and the year-on-year increase also fell from 4.3% in March to 2.5% in June, and the price level generally returned to a stable level.
In the second half of the year, China's prices will continue to maintain a moderate level, with little overall inflationary pressure, but it is still necessary to promote the restoration of production and living order under the premise of normalizing epidemic prevention and control.
Effectively respond to natural disasters such as floods and droughts in the main production areas of grain, fruits and vegetables and other agricultural products, strengthen market supervision, and resolutely crack down on acts that disrupt market order such as hoarding and price gouging.

New book reveals Prince Harry thinks his brother is 'snobbish and arrogant'
The British "Times" and "Sunday Times" serialized a new book called "Finding Freedom," which depicts the journey of Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle's royal life.
But Reuters reported that Harry and Meghan have distanced themselves from the book, saying they were not interviewed by the author and did not provide any content.
The Sunday Times reported that the new book quoted sources as saying that when Harry and Meghan were dating before marriage, Prince William wanted to confirm whether Meghan, who was a Hollywood actress, had ulterior motives for Harry.
According to a source, William told Harry at the time: "Don't feel you have to rush [to marry Meghan].
You can spend as much time as you want getting to know this girl."
The report said that when Harry heard William use "this girl" to describe Meghan, he felt the arrogant snobbery from his brother's tone, and he also thought that he no longer needed to be reminded by others.
Harry and Meghan announced in January that they plan to live a more independent life and will support themselves.
The couple, who officially stepped down as senior members of the Royal Family in March, are currently living in Los Angeles with their son Archie to pursue new careers.
Harry and Meghan married in May 2018.
At the time, the marriage was seen as injecting Hollywood glamour and a new era into the British royal family, and the two became one of the most high-profile celebrity couples in the contemporary world.

China News Network, Qinghai, Hainan, July 26th, title: Qinghai Lake "Flower Sea Live Room": "Sweet" with goods to help farmers increase income
Author Hu Guilong Pan Yujie
"In midsummer, Qinghai Lake is full of golden flowers and flying bees. Here, the altitude is higher, the temperature difference between day and night is large, the air pollution is less, and the strong light gives birth to the most tenacious and generous bee colony, creating the characteristics of Qinghai royal jelly with high activity, high protein, rich nutritional value, low sugar and low fat."
On the 26th, Zhang Jianxun, deputy director of the Industry and Information Administration of Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, said.
On the same day, the live delivery of bee products was held on the shore of Qinghai Lake. The China Bee Products Association, representatives of entrepreneurs, bee farmers and other parties gathered together to promote Qinghai's characteristic bee products. A total of nearly 10,000 bottles of Qinghai Plateau royal jelly were sold online and offline, with a total delivery of nearly 3.8 million yuan.
The picture shows beekeepers displaying bee products on the spot.
It is reported that with the help of Beijing Houdeli Bee Industry Chain Store Network, Kuaishou, Taobao and other well-known domestic bee product retail enterprises, live broadcast and e-commerce platforms, the live broadcast and delivery activities have promoted the exchange and cooperation of "enterprises + beekeepers + growers" and continued to issue "Qinghai Plateau Spring Pulp Consumption Vouchers" to consumers through online and offline channels. It is expected that the total annual profit of enterprises will be nearly 5.28 million yuan.
In this regard, Zou Na, president of Beijing Houdeli Bee Industry Co., Ltd., believes that "it is worth it": "This move can expand the popularity of Qinghai bee products, attract more consumers to understand and like pure natural bee products without additives, and drive bee farmers to increase their income."
At present, the company has signed a production cooperation strategic agreement with Qinghai Cloud Bee Industry Co., Ltd. and Qinghai Huabao Bee Industry Joint Stock Cooperation Company, hoping to jointly promote the rapid development of the local bee industry in Qinghai.
The picture shows a sea of rapeseed flowers on the shore of Qinghai Lake.
This spring, due to the need to set up road access checkpoints for epidemic prevention and control, beekeepers were blocked from "chasing flowers and honey." Many bees died due to missed flowering and lack of food, and the income of beekeepers was seriously affected.
"Throughout the year, beekeepers travel long distances to follow the flowering period, moving from Yunnan and Sichuan all the way north to the northwest region, where they sleep rough and have no fixed abode, which is very hard.
As a business, we have a responsibility to help them."
Tina said.
"Small bees are 'environmental scouts', and bees cannot survive in heavily polluted areas," said Zhao Xiaochuan, executive vice president of the China Bee Products Association. Bee pollination is an important link in the ecological chain and plays an irreplaceable role in protecting plant diversity and improving the ecological environment.
At the same time, bee pollination can increase the yield and quality of crops, especially in areas with wide varieties and poor management conditions.
According to research data, pollination can increase the yield of rape by about 15%-30%.
The picture shows Zhao Xiaochuan (right), executive vice president of the China Bee Products Association, promoting Qinghai bee products.
"The economic, ecological and social benefits created by bee pollination are far greater than the value of bee products themselves, and the bee industry has great potential in human health, crop production, vegetation reproduction and ecological protection, which has been poorly understood."
Zhao Xiaochuan said.
Nowadays, the number of beekeepers is getting smaller and smaller. In addition to beekeepers who are on the move all year round, there are still many poor households with limited mobility who choose to invest in cooperatives with beehives.
"The state has financial support, we contact technical personnel to help guide, bee farmers lack understanding and judgment of the market environment, to open the market also need the help and coordination of the government, enterprises and industry associations."
Zhao Xiaochuan said.
"I hope that everyone will pay more attention to and help the beekeeping community in the future," said Gong Na. "Our bee products are also screened and controlled in strict accordance with national standards to ensure quality and protect consumer rights while helping beekeepers."

Liu Yunlong, the old face of the spy drama, plays a stammering leading man - Xinhua.com
Produced by Liu Yunlong, directed by Yin Fei, and starring Liu Yunlong, Su Qing, Liang Guanhua, and Li Liqun, the large-scale spy drama "Chance" landed on Guangdong TV's "Vitality Theater" at 7:30 p.m. on July 16.
The play tells the story of Tang Fei (Liu Yunlong), an underground member of the Chinese Communist Party lurking in the Japanese pseudo-police station, who joined forces with Soviet agents to assassinate the leader of the Japanese agents and smash the Japanese army's shocking plot.
"The Odds" is based on historical facts, and the material is taken from the Soviet military archives that have been sealed for many years.
During the defense of Moscow, the Soviet Red Army's Far East elite marched westward to help, and at this time, the Japanese Kwantung Army's "northward faction" thought that it could take advantage of it and wanted to send troops.
In order to relieve the danger of the enemy, the CCP and the intelligence personnel of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union jointly implemented the "Mudan-Ula" plan.
According to this historical background, the well-known screenwriter Deng Yuan has been polished several times, making the plot twists and turns burn the brain.
Liu Yunlong served as both the producer and the leading actor in "The Odds."
In the drama, he plays Tang Fei, the head of the criminal section of the Linhe Police Department, a stammering policeman with a sense of joy and even a bit of anger, whose real identity is an underground member of the Communist Party of China.
Cai Meng, the heroine of the rival play, is the section chief of the Linhe Security Bureau, deeply appreciated by the Japanese boss Fukuhara, and there is a subtle relationship between Tang Fei, who is also an enemy and a friend, and ambiguous.
Su Qing has tried a lot of different types of roles in recent years, from Lu Ruowen in "Those Years We Are Young" to Er Qing in "Yanxi Raiders," all of which have impressed the audience and been recognized for their acting skills.
This time, Su Qing and Liu Yunlong are partners for the first time, and the setting of the stuttering sheriff with the charming policewoman is quite interesting and new.
In addition to the two main characters, there are many powerful actors such as Liang Guanhua, Li Liqun, Qian Bo, Lei Han, and Shen Junyi in "The Odds." The old drama is also one of the highlights of the play.
It is understood that the production of "Chance" is also very sophisticated, and the crew traveled nearly 2,000 kilometers across Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Liaoning provinces to shoot scenes.
In order to restore the bizarre cityscape of the Northeast Japan period, the production team's art and props team worked day and night, carefully polishing every detail of the scene construction and props, making the scenes in the play exquisite and rich in historical texture.

"Jedi Strike" is released - Xinhua.com
Directed by young director Gao Zhuangzhuang and starring Liao William, Dongyu, Yang Xinran and Wang Yibo, the online film "Jedi Attack" was officially released on iQIYI.
The film tells the story of the down-and-out boxer Venus returning to the ring and fighting for dignity, showing a blood-boiling journey of unbridled dreams.
The film "Jedi Strike" is driven by Thailand as the main plot, using "Thai boxing" as the starting point for the down-and-out boxer Venus to pursue her dreams. The whole story is carried out under the adaptation of traditional Chinese cultural values. Whether it is Venus's early determination to play fake boxing for her master, or her later efforts to fight for dignity with the support of friends and lovers, it shows the pursuit and great love of men for family and dreams in traditional Chinese culture.
Combined with the classic Hollywood sports movie story mode and the strong cooperation of professional teams from China and Thailand, "Jedi Strike" not only presents an international effect, but also will impress different types of audiences.
At the same time, "Jedi Attack" shows a lot of Muay Thai fighting and training, and the scenes are intense and bloody.
In the film, Zhang Xiaoliang, a game designer played by Dongyu, helps Venus, played by William Liao, to return to the ring and win the crown through a fighting game, combining novel and interesting high-tech with hot-blooded competitive games. It also shows the brotherhood between Zhang Xiaoliang and Venus, who seem to be "different" but actually have the same goal.
In addition, the love between Venus and Jingjing is also very touching. Jingjing's silent support for Venus and Venus's firm commitment to Jingjing have allowed the audience to see the "iron man's tenderness" in Venus, and also added a lot of emotions to the down-and-out boxer.

Greenland opens a new round of mixed reform Shanghai's state-owned assets plan to transfer 17.5% of shares -Economic Observer-Professional financial news website
Economic Observer Network reporter Rao Xianjun On July 26, Greenland Holdings (600606.SH) issued a "prompt announcement on the state-owned shareholders' intention to transfer part of the company's shares and resumption of trading through public solicitation of transferees."
The content of the announcement shows that in order to further deepen the reform of state-owned state-owned enterprises, optimize the restructuring of the layout of state-owned assets, and improve the shareholding structure of Greenland, Shanghai Real Estate (Group) Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Shanghai Real Estate") and Shanghai City Investment (Group) Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Shanghai City Investment") intend to transfer part of the shares held by the company through public solicitation of transferees. The total proportion of shares to be transferred does not exceed 17.5% of Greenland's total share capital.
The price of the shares to be transferred is not lower than the higher of the following: the arithmetic average of the daily weighted average price of the 30 trading days prior to the indicative announcement date (July 27, 2020); and the audited net asset value per share of the company in the most recent fiscal year.
At present, there is still no conclusion on the new strategic investor of Greenland. According to the information released in the announcement, it is estimated that the new strategic investor needs to pay about 14 billion yuan to win the 17.5% equity transferred in the mixed reform of Greenland.
It is worth noting that after the completion of the transfer of shares, it is expected that Greenland still has no controlling shareholder and actual controller, but the control structure may change significantly.
Since its establishment, Greenland Holdings has carried out a number of institutional reforms: from 1992 to 1997, it operated in accordance with market-oriented rules under a purely state-owned system; from 1997 to 2013, it established and continuously improved the shareholding system of state-owned holding and employee shareholding; from 2013 to 2015, it introduced strategic investors to form a mixed ownership system of cross-shareholding and mutual integration of state-owned and non-public capital; from 2015 to the present, it has been listed as a public company.
Greenland's current mixed reform plan is similar to Gree. In December 2019, Zhuhai Alum, led by Gaolu Capital, took over a 15% stake in Gree Electric (000651.SZ) for 41.662 billion yuan, and Gree Group retreated to a small shareholder. After completing the mixed reform, Gree Electric implemented a modern corporate management method such as executive incentive plan and no actual controller structure.
Zhang Yuliang, chairman and president of Greenland Holdings, said that Greenland's move is an important measure for Shanghai to promote the comprehensive reform of state-owned state-owned enterprises and accelerate the reform of state-owned state-owned enterprises in a new stage in accordance with the requirements of the Party Central Committee. It fully demonstrates the new idea of reform tailored to local conditions and tailor-made. By introducing new outstanding strategic shareholders to listed companies, it supports enterprises to further improve the degree of marketization, enhance the freedom of operation and management, and accelerate the full release of reform vitality.

U.S. White House adviser "bites back" at states for returning to work too early
US White House adviser "bites back" at states for returning to work too early
On July 23 local time, the number of confirmed cases of new coronavirus in the United States exceeded 4 million, accounting for 30% of global cases.
For months, US President Trump has repeatedly asked all states in the country to return to work and go back to school, until recently he changed his attitude and took the initiative to wear masks in public, and his advisers are "biting back" saying that some state governments have returned to work too early.
On the 22nd, White House presidential adviser Kellyanne Conway said at a press conference that some state governments did not comply with the return-to-work standards and prematurely restarted places such as bars.
Conway also mentioned that the previous statement that the president has "absolute power" to decide the restoration of the states is a false rumor.
"The president is a federalist. He believes in the autonomy of the states."
She defended Trump.
However, the "rumor" in Conway's mouth was uttered by Trump himself at the White House epidemic briefing on April 13.
This self-deprecating operation was derided by netizens as "rewriting history."
Kellyanne Conway wants to rewrite history. She's a liar.
Trump called Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer a dictator because she followed medical guidelines and insisted on a shutdown.

Is it reasonable for a 3-year-old child to sue the school after being compensated for being smashed while playing in the university playground?

The playground was smashed, and the children sued the school after receiving compensation.
□ Zhao Yifan, Correspondent
Three-year-old Xiao Wen was playing in a university playground when he was accidentally hit in the head by Chen Mou of the softball team while throwing a ball.
After Chen's compensation, Xiaowen's father, Mr. Wen, as Xiaowen's legal representative, sued the school to the court, demanding that the school where the playground was located apologize and pay a total of 20,000 yuan for medical expenses and emotional damages.
Recently, after the trial of this case, the Haidian District People's Court of Beijing held that the school had set up a protective net in the playground at the time of the incident, had fulfilled the appropriate safety and security obligations, and Chen had made compensation, according to which the plaintiff's lawsuit was dismissed.
Mr. Wen complained that during the summer vacation in 2019, he took Xiao Wen to play in the school playground, when the softball team was training in the playground.
In order to avoid the resulting risks, Xiao Wen, Mr. Wen and many other children and parents were in the safe area designated by the softball team.
But then Chen Mou, a member of the softball team, lost his hand while throwing the ball, causing the softball to fly over the protective net to the above-mentioned safe area and hit the back of Xiao Wen's head.
Mr. Wen immediately took Xiaowen to the hospital for treatment and was diagnosed with head trauma.
Mr. Wen believes that the facilities of the school stadium do not meet the relevant safety regulations and do not effectively manage the team and related facilities.
The school's negligence led to the above incident, which caused Xiao Wen to suffer great physical and mental pain, and also brought great pain to his family, for which the school should bear legal responsibility.
In response, the school argued that the school had set up a protective net in the playground, and posted management regulations and training notices, informing that access to the playground must be kept at a safe distance from the training site and reminding them of their own safety. The plaintiff could not prove that the school "failed to fulfill its security obligations," so it did not agree to compensation.
After the trial, the court held that the site of the incident was a site open to the public free of charge by the university involved, and although the school had a security obligation for the management of the playground, such a security obligation only needed to meet the general duty of care.
At the time of the incident, the school set up a protective net in the playground, and has fulfilled the appropriate safety and security obligations, and Chen also compensated Xiaowen for more than 2,000 yuan in medical expenses, transportation expenses and other losses in accordance with the compensation agreement previously reached. The two sides agreed to resolve the dispute once.
After the incident, Xiaowen's parents again claimed compensation from the school, which was groundless, and the court dismissed all the plaintiff's claims.
After the verdict, neither side appealed, and the sentence is now in effect.
According to Article 37 of China's Tort Liability Law, the school, as the manager of the public place, has the obligation of safety and security; in the case that the third party's behavior causes damage to others, the third party bears the tort liability, and the public place manager who has not fulfilled the obligation of safety and security shall bear the corresponding supplementary liability.
The judge said that as the manager of the public place, he is most likely to understand the actual situation of the whole place, foresee the possible danger and damage, so that he is most likely to take the necessary measures to prevent the occurrence of loss or mitigate the extent of damage, and the cost of avoiding and mitigating the occurrence of damage is the lowest, so the law stipulates that he bears the corresponding guarantee obligation to engage in social activities.
In this case, for the unspecified group of people entering the playground, which is open to the public free of charge, the safety and security obligations of the school should be commensurate with the social activities it is engaged in. Specifically, it is mainly necessary to take basic safety measures and have an obligation to inform about hidden dangers.
In judicial practice, it is not appropriate to impose excessive security obligations on managers of public places.
If the school has taken measures to set up protective nets and fulfill its obligation to inform, it can be concluded that the school is not at fault and should not bear legal responsibility.
In addition, for third-party infringement, even if the managers of public places such as schools fail to fulfill their security obligations, their liability is also a supplement to damages. According to the newly promulgated Civil Code, after the managers assume additional liability, they can also recover from the third party.
Therefore, in such accidents, victims should not expand the scope of claims after they have already received compensation from the direct infringer.
Under the normalization of epidemic prevention and control, people's enthusiasm for sports and fitness has soared.
With the gradual liberalization of inter-provincial tourism business, the tourism market is also about to recover.
Fujian Province resumed inter-provincial tourism business from July 21, and the first weekend after the opening, Xiamen, a popular tourist destination, ushered in the peak of passenger flow.
As a popular tourist destination city, there are many tourists who arrive in Xiamen on weekends.
Xiamen Railway Station is expected to send 3.7 million passengers in the summer, while the airport's passenger flow is dominated by students, tourism and family visits.
The tourism market is gradually picking up. In July, Xiamen Airport operated an average of 440 flights per day, and domestic flights have recovered to 80% of pre-epidemic levels.
Airlines have encrypted air express routes from Xiamen to Shanghai, Beijing, Kunming, Xi'an and other major cities to seize the tourism market after recovery.
At present, a number of travel agencies in Xiamen have successively launched a batch of summer domestic inter-provincial tour products, and the team's itinerary mainly focuses on outdoor attractions.
In response to the summer peak of passenger traffic at railway stations and airports, relevant units have deployed additional manpower in areas where people are likely to gather, such as check-in counters and security checkpoints. Fujian has also optimized and upgraded the "eight health codes" to achieve health data sharing and mutual recognition with 31 provinces to promote the orderly recovery of the tourism market.
Can Liu Dehua and Liu Qingyun "demolish" a new spark? - Xinhua
"Bomb Disposal Expert 2" recently announced that it will be released on December 24, becoming the first film scheduled for the Lunar New Year.
The second part is still directed by Qiu Litao, produced and starred by Andy Lau, with a new story.
It is reported that the addition of the "nuclear bomb" element in the second part has also made the challenge faced by the bomb disposal experts more difficult. Several shocking glimpses in the trailer have made people's hearts hang in the air. The mushroom cloud of the big explosion and the airport engulfed in flames are quite shocking.
Three years ago, "The Bomb Disposal Expert," produced by the original team, won the May 1st box office champion of the year and won 7 nominations at the Hong Kong Film Awards. Qiu Litao and Andy Lau also became the gold medal partner in the minds of the audience.
This time, "Bomb Disposal Expert 2" also makes people once again look forward to whether this pair of aces can create new sparks.
"Bomb Disposal Expert 2" tells a new story: former bomb disposal expert Pan Chengfeng (Liu Dehua) fainted at the scene of the bombing and was listed as a suspect by the police.
In order to find the truth, he has to ask for help from his friend Dong Zhuowen (Liu Qingyun), who is also a bomb disposal expert.
Pang Ling (Ni Ni), a female inspector who is eager to solve the case and is also Pan's ex-girlfriend, is also involved.
He is still a bomb disposal expert, but you can feel the complexity of Andy Lau's new role from the trailer: he has a broken leg, wears a prosthetic limb, and is chased by Liu Qingyun, who is also a bomb disposal expert, while being directed by his ex-girlfriend Ni Ni.
What exactly is the relationship between the three, what did Andy Lau do at the Xiangdao Hotel, what kind of cases was he involved in, and what twists and turns did his career as a bomb disposal expert go through, all kinds of mysteries make people curious.
It is understood that the highlight of the film is the on-the-spot filming of Hong Kong's world landmark buildings, coupled with the top special effects production team, bringing a shocking and realistic visual impact.

China News Service, Chongqing, July 26 (Reporter Liu Xian) The Chongqing Development and Reform Commission announced on the 26th that the city has so far returned 4,404 fishermen, accounting for 42.54% of all fishermen involved.
In an interview with a reporter from China News Network, 53-year-old Li Daiguo said that his grandparents fished in the Longxi River, and since he was 11 years old, he has been fishing with his father, rocking a small boat, traveling along the Longxi River, going up to Liangping, Chongqing, and down to Longevity. Every time he leaves home, it is ten days and a half months, and he supports his family by fishing.
However, since 1997, as the rural population has gradually flocked to the town, the number of residents in Gao'an town has increased, and the environmental pollution has become more and more serious.
Paper mills, chemical factories and farms have been built along the Longxi River, which also pollutes the river.
By 2007 and 2008, the Longxi River had turned into a stinking ditch.
"The fish scales that were caught were all black, and the inside was also black after being cut open."
Li Daiguo said that it is more and more difficult to fish after the river is polluted.
The local government began to make great efforts to control the pollution of Longxi River, including clear drifting, river patrol, and aquatic resources management and protection.
Li Daiguo also switched from fishing to production and became a member of the river patrol team to manage aquatic resources.
From January 1, 2020, the aquatic biological reserve of Chongqing and the relevant waters of the main urban area have been completely banned.
According to the data of Chongqing Development and Reform Commission, up to now, Chongqing has withdrawn a total of 3,403 fishing vessels and 4,643 fishing vessels that have signed a withdrawal agreement, accounting for 63.3% and 86.3% of the total three-year tasks, respectively.
4,404 fishermen have been returned, accounting for 42.54% of all fishermen involved.
Of the 4,404 people who have been recaptured, 4,267 have been employed, accounting for 96.89% of the recaptured fishermen.
Pension insurance protection covers 2,691 people, accounting for 61.10% of retired fishermen.
In the next step, Chongqing will carry out in-depth special rectification actions, accelerate the clean-up and rectification of the Yangtze River main stream shoreline utilization project, complete a new round of Yangtze River inlet sewage outlet survey and carry out corresponding rectification actions, basically complete the "three phosphorus" (referring to phosphorus ore, phosphorus chemical industry and phosphogypsum depot) rectification task, small hydropower clean-up and rectification work, promote the special action of afforestation and greening on both sides of the Yangtze River, strengthen the construction of green mines, consolidate the results of the special rectification of illegal wharves and illegal sand mining on the Yangtze River main stream, and further promote the ban on fishing in the Yangtze River basin.
Israel to strengthen prevention and control of repeated epidemics
2020-07-26 04:56:44 Source: Guangming Daily Author: Wang Sisuo Editor: Wang Sisuo
Israel steps up prevention and control of repeated outbreaks
At the beginning of the outbreak, Israel's prevention and control measures were effective.
However, with the gradual lifting of prevention and control measures, the number of confirmed cases of new coronavirus pneumonia in Israel has recently increased significantly. The Israeli government has repeatedly taken emergency measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic.
On February 28, the first case of new coronavirus pneumonia was confirmed in Israel, prompting the closure of all entry and exit ports, the suspension of non-essential industries, the conversion of schools to online teaching, the restriction of public transportation and non-essential social activities, the lockdown of cities with serious epidemics, and the joint maintenance of prevention and control measures by the military and police.
This series of measures quickly achieved positive results, and by mid-May, the number of new confirmed cases of new coronavirus pneumonia in Israel had fallen to single digits.
With the epidemic under control, Israel's prevention and control measures have been fully lifted, and since June, the number of new confirmed cases of new coronavirus has gradually rebounded.
Especially since July, the spread of the epidemic has been accelerating.
In recent days, the daily number of new cases in Israel has been more than 1,500 for eight days, and as of the time of publication on July 25, there were 916 new cases on the same day.
As of July 25, Israel had 59,745 confirmed cases and 448 deaths.
In the face of the rapid rebound of the epidemic, the Israeli government has repeatedly taken emergency measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic.
On July 6, after the number of confirmed cases exceeded 30,000, the Israeli government closed gyms, swimming pools, bars, nightclubs and other public entertainment venues, and introduced a policy of restricting public transport, stipulating that no more than 20 passengers per bus.
On the 17th, the Israeli government announced a series of new restrictions, including the implementation of "city closure" on weekends, stipulating the implementation of "city closure" from 17:00 every Friday to 5:00 every Sunday.
During this period, people can go out, but shops, shopping centers, hairdressers, beauty salons, libraries, zoos, museums, exhibition halls, swimming pools and tourist attractions will be closed, while supermarkets, pharmacies and other basic services will remain open.
At the same time, gatherings of more than 10 people are prohibited on all dates and times, gyms, studios and other places will be closed, and restaurants and cafes are prohibited from serving food, and only take-out services are allowed.
At the same time, the Israeli public did not pay enough attention to the seriousness of the epidemic and failed to form a joint effort with the government in combating the epidemic.
After the recurrence of the epidemic in Israel, many people took to the streets to protest because the government's prevention and control measures affected their own economic interests.
On July 11, tens of thousands of people held a demonstration in Tel Aviv, arguing that the anti-epidemic policy affects the economy.
On the evening of the 21st, thousands of protesters gathered in front of Prime Minister Netanyahu's official residence in Jerusalem to protest Prime Minister Netanyahu's ban on restaurants, cafes and other prevention and control measures without corresponding compensation.
In addition, many people do not comply with the rules of wearing masks and maintaining a safe social distance of two meters when they are outdoors. In order to avoid being fined by the police for not wearing a mask, many people only wear a mask on their chin or hang it on their wrist.
During the recurrence of the epidemic, schools are the hardest hit areas for the spread of the new coronavirus, and according to the reporter's recent visit to this kindergarten, the teachers and students of the kindergarten did not wear masks as required by the government, nor did they maintain a safe social distance of two meters from each other, laying a hidden danger for a large number of teachers and students to be infected with the virus.
Professor Eli Waksman, a member of the Israeli National Security Council's expert advisory group on combating the epidemic, believes that Israel is heading towards a "dangerous situation," pointing out that the current epidemic prevention and control measures taken by Israel are not enough, and all leisure and recreational activities and summer schools should be closed to control the further spread of the epidemic.
Waxman said that Israel lacks an overall plan to combat the epidemic, and the parliament and government departments should abandon their respective interests as soon as possible, reach an agreement on the issue of combating the epidemic, and formulate clear steps that include relevant restrictions in different sectors.
TEL AVIV, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Our correspondent in Tel Aviv, Wang Qi
Wu Fengfang, a farmer in Guyuan, Ningxia, couldn't resist his wife's son, Dai Tianfu, and the two of them drove from their home 20 miles away to the Liangyun Cultural Complex.
Despite the inconvenience of his legs and feet in the past two years, the 77-year-old Dai Tianfu is still looking forward to "coming here every three to five days and playing tricks."
This is an inconspicuous courtyard in the Yuanzhou District of Guyuan City. Unlike ordinary farmhouses, there are often melodious Qin songs in the courtyard, as well as wonderful shadow puppet shows, embroidery works, traditional Qin songs, eyebrow and mustache dramas, etc.
The owner of the compound is Liang Yun, a former carpenter.
More than 10 years ago, he, who loved shadow puppetry and singing, began to plan the construction of a cultural compound.
With the Liang Yun Cultural Complex, the cultural life of the villagers has become rich and colorful.
The reporter has not yet entered the Liangyun Cultural Complex, and the tunes of Qin's voice have already been heard.
It is Bai Lixiang, a villager from a neighboring village, who is singing a Qin dialect selection for the villagers.
She has loved Qin since she was a child, and now she is well-known in the local area. Whenever she has free time, she will come to the cultural compound to perform for the villagers.
Recently, Park Lixiang also played a live webcast.
Bai Lixiang said: "It is a very happy thing to have a stage so that more people can see themselves performing."
On the stage, the singers looked at one another, the players played one tune after another, and although they were amateurs, their enthusiasm was undiminished.
Just like the rustic style of the farmhouse, the "grassroots" art and non-heritage culture in the Liangyun Cultural Complex came to the fore outside the Qin Dynasty.
The compound also has a collection of more than 300 pieces of farming utensils of different ages, traditional and handmade tile sculptures, paper cutting, embroidery, shadow puppets and other physical objects.
Liang Yun led the reporter into the exhibition hall in the courtyard, which showed his collection of old objects, old wine jugs, three-stringed strings, spinning wheels and so on.
Why did an ordinary farmer build a cultural compound?
"Shadow puppetry is my family craft, and I have been learning this craft since I was 15 years old."
Liangyun Cultural Complex was established in 2012 and became the first rural "intangible cultural heritage exhibition hall" in Ningxia. It is also a demonstration complex for the protection of intangible cultural heritage in Guyuan.
In addition to the Liangyun Cultural Complex, more than 120 cultural complexes and 79 folk performance groups have emerged in Yuanzhou District, Guyuan City. Among them, there are more than 50 cultural complexes of a certain scale, such as Shenjiahe Cultural Complex, Wang Yonghong Cultural Complex, Yanglang Cultural Complex, etc., covering all towns and streets in Yuanzhou District, with more than 5,000 participants.
These grassroots artists are active in the field, enriching the cultural life of the masses and satisfying their spiritual needs.
"As life gets better and better, traditional culture can't just be left behind."
"Liu's Spy War Drama" Returns to "The Odds" to Watch Liu Yunlong Li Liqun's Opponent "Play" - Xinhua
The 40-episode spy drama "Chance" will be aired on Beijing Satellite TV from July 16.
"The Odds" is based on real historical facts and is based on Soviet military archives that have been sealed for many years and are available for the first time.
The actor Liu Yunlong, who is known to the audience as a "spy drama," broke through the image in the play and challenged a rather pleasant "stuttering agent."
In recent years, the popularity of dramas such as "The Pretender," "The Mask" and "The Kite" has proved that the espionage genre has a strong vitality.
Unlike previous espionage works, "The Odds" looks at the world and extends the story background to the Soviet Far East battlefield.
Set against the backdrop of the final stage of the Anti-Japanese War in 1944, it tells the story of Tang Fei (Liu Yunlong), a secret intelligence worker of the Communist Party of China, who, under the leadership of the Secretary of the Linhe Provincial Committee of the Chinese Underground Party and the Director of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Bureau, carried out the "Mudan Ullah" strategic operation of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Bureau.
In many spy dramas, the male protagonist, as a senior spy, is the perfect image of handsome, highly intelligent, and mature.
But in Liu Yunlong's view, such a person is not suitable to be a spy. "A spy should be the kind of person who can't be found in a pile of people. If the appearance is the kind of very handsome image, I wish everyone would pay attention to you, can you still lurk? There is a line in "Kite," 'If you don't come to catch me, I will forget that I am a Kuomintang,' and the spy will be elitist."
Therefore, in "The Odds," Liu Yunlong ingeniously designed his protagonist Tang Fei as a "stuttering agent" with a sense of joy.
The other camp in "The Odds" is supported by the Japanese Fukuhara, played by Liang Guanhua, and the director of the police department, Fang Shibao, played by Li Liqun.
Two powerful actors, one from the south and one from the north, add a lot of masterful tricks to the whole play.
Director Yin Fei used the term "soaring drama" to describe the rivalry between Li Liqun and Liu Yunlong in the play. "It is absolutely soaring drama. The two of them have a special tacit understanding, and this tacit understanding on their bodies is very impactful to me. Many times their plays are 'hanging now', for example, we only wrote the length of half a page, and I did not stop when shooting, and they could continue to play."
When the actors are in the role and ensure the status of their characters, they can not only shape the characters from the perspective of the characters, but also bring more viewing possibilities to the audience. Yin Fei said that such a play is brilliant.
In the play, you can also see many familiar faces in the "Liu's Spy War Drama," and the famous and dignified "Mountain City F4" in the "Kite" also gathered three people in the "Chance."
Hou Yi and Liu Mingyang, who played Song Xiao'an and Zhao Jianzhi, once again played Tang Fei's left and right arms.
Director Yin Fei introduced, "There is no inferiority in these two people, they are just drifting in that era and environment."
Liu Yunlong also volunteered, "We must have a human touch. This human touch means that there must be good and bad people around me, and bad people are enemies, but we must also develop them, and our team must also grow."
The ending of these two people in the play is also carefully designed by Liu Yunlong, who believes that he will give the audience a satisfactory answer.

HONG KONG, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's financial market remains active and orderly, said Xu Zhengyu, Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury of the Hong Kong SAR Government.
He expressed optimism about Hong Kong's financial stability and economy.
Xu Zhengyu said at an online seminar jointly organized by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Toronto and the Hong Kong and Canada Chamber of Commerce (Canada Association) on the 24th (Toronto time) that Hong Kong is experiencing a difficult situation due to the "revision storm" and the new coronavirus epidemic.
The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is stable and biased towards the strong exchange guarantee level.
There are no obvious signs of capital outflows from the banking system. On the contrary, more than $11 billion has flowed in since June.
The total deposits of banks have also continued to increase in the past few months, and there has been a series of public offering and fund-raising activities in the stock market, and market transactions have risen frequently.
Xu Zhengyu said that the coronavirus outbreak has put pressure on the global economy and financial markets, but Hong Kong's basic advantages remain unchanged.
Hong Kong has a number of advantages, including geography, the rule of law, high-speed communications, the free flow of information and capital, and a simple and low tax system, making Hong Kong continue to be a leading international financial center.
Xu Zhengyu pointed out that the HKSAR government has set aside HK$6 billion in the "Epidemic Prevention and Control Fund" to create about 30,000 time-limited jobs in the public and private sectors in the next two years, covering people with different skills and educational qualifications.
To support the development of fintech, the HKSAR Government has also launched the "Thousand Talents Programme" to fund local fintech companies, start-ups and other enterprises with fintech-related businesses to create 1,000 new jobs, employ local talents and enrich Hong Kong's fintech talent pool.
Looking ahead, Xu Zhengyu expressed optimism about Hong Kong's financial stability and economy.
He encouraged Canadian enterprises to make good use of Hong Kong's advantages and its status as an international financial center, an international asset and wealth management center, and a global offshore RMB business hub to develop and invest in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and nearby regions.
Lancet article praises China's anti-epidemic efforts, encourages countries to learn from experience
According to an article published in The Lancet on the 25th, China, as a country with a population of 1.4 billion and a size similar to that of Europe or the United States, has effectively controlled the new coronavirus epidemic at this stage, and there has been no further widespread transmission, which has largely controlled the domestic epidemic.
The article said that in the past decade or so, China has invested heavily in domestic research and public health construction, which has made China much more prepared for the new coronavirus than it was for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).
The authors said that when SARS broke out in 2002, China was initially ill-prepared, especially because the pathogen could not be identified.
When the new coronavirus was discovered in December 2019, Chinese scientists were quickly able to identify the virus species, and shared the genome sequencing data with the international community on January 11, 2020.
By the end of January, doctors from mainland China and Hong Kong clarified the clinical characteristics of the virus and warned the world about the threat of the new coronavirus through research papers published in The Lancet.
China has also been at the forefront of vaccine research. Under the state of emergency declared by the country, such research has been carried out very quickly and rigorously through close cooperation within the country. In May and July, the results of the progress of early trials of the new coronavirus vaccine developed by China were published in the Lancet.
China's experience shows that it is important to invest in national health and research systems to effectively improve laboratory capacity.
This is the basis for a rapid and effective national response to health emergencies and global health security.
Other countries, especially low- and middle-income countries, are well worth learning from.
In addition, China's experience has proved that on the basis of strong research, it is necessary to have a strong high-level decisively rely on scientific evidence to make the right decision, which makes the new crown epidemic effectively controlled.
The article emphasizes that governments and their leaders must respect science, understand its value, and act on it in a way that is best for society.
In the early days of the outbreak, China's National Health Commission sent three groups of infectious disease experts to Wuhan to investigate the risk and spread of the new coronavirus. Their recommendations provided the basis for the decision to "close the city" of Wuhan on January 23; when some experts proposed the necessity and urgency of building a cabin hospital, the government quickly made a decision and implemented it quickly; at the same time, the widespread participation of the community and the masses also made the epidemic quickly and effectively controlled.
The article concludes by emphasizing that in response to the global health emergency, countries need to strengthen global cooperation and joint response.

Dapeng director's "Good Luck" shortlisted for Golden Goblet Award - Xinhua
On July 18, the 23rd Shanghai International Film Festival announced the official list of films selected for the Golden Goblet Award.
Dapeng's first reality-themed film, "Good Luck," was successfully shortlisted for the Golden Goblet Award at this year's Shanghai Film Festival, and the film's first poster was officially released.
A poster for the film
The film "Jixiang Ruyi" is the first realistic work directed by Dapeng, and it is also the second time he has been associated with the Golden Goblet Award.
The film tells the story of a comedy film director who, on a whim, returns to his hometown in the rural northeast, hoping to make a literary film about how a family celebrates the New Year, only to encounter a series of accidents.
The family members who had gathered for the film completed the final gathering.
In the movie poster released today, a member of the family, "Third Uncle" Wang Jixiang, sits in the center of the picture smoking a cigarette. In the background is the northeastern black land dressed in silver, and in the foreground are the red lanterns that Chinese people must hang on New Year's Day.
The red lantern, which symbolizes celebration and reunion, forms a huge contrast with the lonely Wang Jixiang, and seems to reveal the complexity and entanglement in this big family relationship.
It is reported that in the film, except for the daughter of "third uncle" Wang Jixiang, who is played by actor Liu Lu, the rest of the scenes are completed by the real director's family. The film's experimental audio-visual style breaks the boundary between drama and reality, bringing the audience a new immersive viewing experience.
According to director Dapeng, the creation of "Jixiang Ruyi" originated from "a providence," a series of sudden changes in the family during the shooting, so that the original shooting plan had to be changed, and life without a script was finally recorded as a film, but it released tension beyond design.
How does director Dapeng face this "providence," and how does he continue to meet the various changes brought about by this providence?
There is no doubt that "Good Luck" is full of experimentation. The almost all-amateur lineup and innovative audio-visual style turn the life in front of the camera into a film. Under the wrapping of real images, the audience will also find themselves and their families from the family presented in the film. With the end of the family gathering in the film, it evokes a series of thoughts.
NEWS.GOV.MO: New Coronavirus Infection Response Coordination Center Inquiry Hotline Statistics (July 25 08H00 - July 26 08H00)
From 08H00 on July 25 to 08H00 on July 26, 2020, the inquiry hotline of the New Coronavirus Infection Response Coordination Center received a total of 292 telephone inquiries.
291 inquiries about the epidemic have been immediately transferred to representatives of relevant departments for follow-up.
271 cases in the Health Bureau (involving: inquiries about isolation; inquiries about nucleic acid testing; inquiries about two land marks; health codes; others.)
17 cases at the Public Security Police Station (involving: inquiring about entry and exit measures; inquiring about entry and exit measures for vehicles registered in Guangdong and Macao; inquiring about the Zhuhai government hotline; inquiring about the stay of documents.)

Marine and Water Bureau 1 case (involving: asking whether Hong Kong fishing vessels entering the port need to declare to the Marine and Water Bureau and nucleic acid testing related matters.)
A platoon leader, Yu Wang, and a soldier stand guard at the checkpoint.
In this place where the average annual temperature is more than ten degrees below zero, a row of simple barracks stands in the mountain pass. Not far from the barracks, a national flag flutters in the wind. The soldiers stand guard in the wind every day, and they need to go to higher elevations to patrol regularly.
The soldiers had to use their hands and feet to climb the steep slope of the rock pile.
It was late July, when low-altitude areas are lush with flowers, and only in the ravine behind the barracks was there a relatively dense green in Ba Rong Cho Kang.
Gao Peng, a soldier who has been stationed at the post for six years, pointed to the ravine and said that this is their back garden, and only in July and August each year can they see the grass grow slowly, and soon after, it all turns yellow and is covered by snow.
On foot patrol, it may take about 9 hours.
In the harsh environment of the plateau, the soldiers stationed here are accompanied by snow-capped mountains and glaciers all year round, and they also regularly go to the higher mountain passes to patrol.
A few days ago, a patrol team consisting of eight soldiers, led by instructor Liang Yixin, once again took to the patrol road.
Each soldier carried a load of about 30 pounds and set off early in the morning to the target point.
On the way, a soldier suffered a high back injury, and his comrades urgently rescued him.
In addition to patrolling duties, the soldiers at the Balochistan post undergo tactical and physical training every day.
Time passes by, the altitude continues to rise, the oxygen content is getting lower and lower, and the physical strength is constantly overdrawn. These factors test the will of the patrol members.
They gritted their teeth and persevered, successively crossing several landslide points and crossing several difficult and dangerous beaches.
At 16 o'clock, it was lunch time for the patrol members. They took out their own dry food and sat on the ground at an altitude of more than 5,700 meters, accompanied by sleet and snow, and replenished their strength with food.
The soldiers at the Balochistan outpost conduct tactical and physical training.
During breaks, they would play cards together and the loser would do push-ups, both for fun and exercise.
After a short break in the cold wind, they climbed to the position of the target point of the patrol, took out the national flag on the mountain pass and solemnly swore.
Behind them are snow-capped mountains, and in front of them are dozens of kilometers of no man's land. They are the safest guardians of the country.
Beijing's consumption season restarts - Xinhua
Beijing restarted the activities of the Beijing consumption season in accordance with the principle of "comprehensive restart, key planning, orderly promotion and strict organization."
On July 26, 1.5 million government and enterprise consumption coupons were issued, including 1 million offline dining and shopping coupons and 500,000 smart product coupons, which consumers can receive on the JD.com APP.
Liu Meiying, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Commerce, introduced at a media briefing held on the 25th that the consumption season after the restart will further reduce the capital allocation of enterprises on the basis of maintaining the existing preferential subsidies for consumer coupon card packs.
From the beginning of August, the current 1: 1 allocation of funds contributed by the government and enterprises will be adjusted to 2: 1, for example, if the original consumer can enjoy a 120 yuan discount after receiving a card package to the store, the government will subsidize 60 yuan and the enterprise will give 60 yuan; after the adjustment, the government will subsidize 80 yuan and the enterprise will give 40 yuan.
During the consumer season, the three major operators will subsidize traffic and terminals around 5G consumption, further promoting Beijing's new 5G infrastructure and new 5G consumption.
Chen Maobo said that Hong Kong's economy has been hit by the outbreak of the epidemic again, and called on all sectors to share the hardships - China News Service
China News Service, Hong Kong, July 26 - Chen Maobo, Financial Secretary of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, said on the 26th that Hong Kong is facing a new wave of the impact of the new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic, and the business exchanges and economic activities that had been showing signs of recovery were also hit.
The HKSAR Government once again calls on landlords of all sizes to reduce rents and share the hardships with retailers, restaurants and small and medium-sized enterprises.
On the same day, Chen Maobo published an article entitled "The Rugged Road to Recovery" online.
He said that the recent number of confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia in Hong Kong is high and the situation is grim, which has affected the livelihood of the community and also plagued the economy.
When the epidemic recurs, the first priority is to strictly prevent imported cases, and to deal with and interrupt the chain of transmission of the virus as quickly as possible; when the epidemic is controlled, economic activities should be resumed accordingly in a timely manner.
He pointed out that in the face of a new wave of epidemic shocks, business transactions and economic activities that had shown signs of recovery were also hit.
For the business community, in addition to the spirit of the contract, social responsibility is equally important, especially for those groups that have received large government subsidies in the "Job Guarantee Program."
He mentioned that Hong Kong's economic situation in the second quarter of this year is still very severe, but the trend of contraction seems to have slowed down slightly.
In terms of exports, he believes that Hong Kong's external situation is still grim.
Chan said that Hong Kong's development over the past few decades has shown that every crisis hides new opportunities, and every difficulty hides the key to future development.
The largest earthquake in Taiwan this year occurred in the eastern waters of Taiwan
China News Service, Taipei, July 26: An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.1 on the Richter scale occurred in the eastern waters of Taiwan at 20:52 on the 26th, with a maximum seismic intensity of 4, and was felt throughout Taiwan. It is the largest earthquake in Taiwan this year.
Comprehensive Central News Agency, China Times Electronic News, ETtoday News Cloud and other Taiwan media reported that Taiwan's meteorological department reported that the epicenter of the earthquake was located 86.5 kilometers southeast of Yilan County Government, that is, the eastern sea of Taiwan, with a depth of 53 kilometers.
The China Earthquake Network measured the quake at magnitude 5.5.
The maximum seismic intensity in all parts of Taiwan was 4 in Hualien County, 3 in Yilan County, Taitung County, Nantou County and Yunlin County, and 1 to 2 in other counties and cities.
Taiwan's meteorological department pointed out that the earthquake is the largest in Taiwan this year and is a subduction zone earthquake at the plate boundary. Its epicenter has often experienced earthquakes in the past and has been relatively active this year.
In the coming week, it is still not ruled out that there will be aftershocks of magnitude 4 or more.
Marinichev said that the change in value was affected by the depreciation of the ruble and the epidemic.
He said: "The cost of services is increasing.
Because of the epidemic, people are starting to spend more time on the Internet."
Marinichev did not rule out a serious rise in Internet prices next year, arguing that operators could provide customers with higher speeds and more services to offset people's dissatisfaction with rising prices.
"Chinese Doctor" plans to pay tribute to anti-epidemic heroes - Xinhua
Recently, with the respect of Chinese filmmakers for anti-epidemic heroes, Yu Dong, chairman of Bona Film Group, and director Liu Weiqiang (pictured left) held a discussion with academician Zhong Nanshan in Guangzhou on the filming and production of the anti-epidemic film "Chinese Doctor."
Bona Film hopes to use "Chinese Doctors" to pay tribute to all medical and epidemic prevention workers fighting on the front line of epidemic prevention and control!
In 2021, the film will be released nationwide to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China.
At present, under the arrangement and deployment of the Central Propaganda Department and the National Film Bureau, and with the support of the Guangdong Provincial Film Bureau and the Hubei Provincial Film Bureau, Bona Film is organizing the original team of the film "Chinese Captain" to make the film "Chinese Doctor," which is a film that reflects the unity of the people of the whole country under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee to fight the new crown pneumonia epidemic.
The film focuses on the front line of Wuhan's anti-epidemic, with Wuhan medical staff and medical teams from various provinces and cities as the background characters. From the perspective of human nature, using a unique narrative and a highly impactful camera language, the panorama shows the touching story of Chinese medical staff who are full of dedication and sacrifice on the front line of the anti-epidemic.
It is understood that on the first day of the lifting of the lockdown in Wuhan, Bona Company overcame many difficulties and sent a filming team to the front line of the epidemic to communicate with hundreds of medical workers face to face to understand and collect information. At present, it has interviewed a large number of precious first-hand video materials, including Academician Zhong Nanshan himself, the first person in Guangzhou to help Wuhan, the Guangdong medical team, and the white angels at the forefront of the anti-epidemic front, such as Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan Union Hospital, Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital, and Wuhan Central Hospital.
Academician Zhong Nanshan also raised expectations and hopes for the filming of the film at this symposium: "I am looking forward to it, and I hope that you will not only visit some experts who have made a lot of appearances, but also interview more medical personnel who are working hard on the front line, which is the majority."
He said that he had seen "Me and My Motherland" and "Captain China" before, and thought that it was a good way to tell the big picture story from the perspective of ordinary people.
"Now some foreign friends still have some misunderstandings about China."
When talking about the spread of the film, Academician Zhong Nanshan said that at present, some people abroad like to label the virus as politicized, and he hopes that the film can impress the audience from the perspective of humanity: "In addition to screening in China, it is best to screen the film abroad, and to impress the audience with a true humanistic spirit in a way that both domestic and foreign audiences can understand."
Academician Zhong Nanshan also fondly recalled the film "Man to Middle Age" in the 1980s. "After so many years, I was most impressed by the film "Man to Middle Age" after the reform and opening up. At that time, doctors' friends outside China were crying. If "Chinese Doctor" can play such a role, it will be very great."
Academician Zhong Nanshan said that if "Chinese Doctor" can resonate with foreign audiences, it will be very successful.
During the discussion and exchange, Academician Zhong Nanshan also shared his opinions and suggestions on the current international epidemic prevention and control. "I believe that people are always smarter than viruses."
Academician Zhong Nanshan said that although the virus is difficult to predict, from the primitive society to the present, human beings have overcome thousands of difficulties and dangers. Nowadays, modern society has developed medical technology and social management measures. In addition, medical personnel and even ordinary people all over the world have a basic understanding of the scientific response to the new crown pneumonia epidemic. People will not be as passive as before.

The first Red Expo in Xiangtan - Today's news - Hunan Daily News - Huasheng Online
Hunan Daily, New Hunan Client Reporter Jiang Rui, Correspondent Xiao Yan
Jiaxing red boat mold, Lushan Mao Zedong bronze statue, Yan'an cloth pile flower crafts, Xiangxi Yongshun bacon... On July 25, the 2020 Hunan Red Tourism and Culture Festival opened in Lushan.
As one of the main activities, the first Xiangtan Red Cultural Industry Expo was held at the Lushan Global Tourism Consulting and Distribution Center.
The red cultural and creative products in the exhibition area and the local products in the old revolutionary area are dazzling, attracting tourists from all over the world to buy.
"The Red Expo is not only a display of the achievements of the national red cultural industry, but also an important platform for exhibitors and enterprises to exchange experiences and discuss development paths."
According to the relevant person in charge of the executive committee of the first Red Expo in Xiangtan, the theme of this Red Expo is "promoting red culture to help the tweet brigade warm up," with a total exhibition area of nearly 3,000 square meters, setting up an atmosphere-building area, a scenic display area and a red cultural tourism online shopping experience area.
Eight provinces and cities, including Jiaxing in Zhejiang, Zunyi in Guizhou and Yan'an in Shaanxi, as well as 137 enterprises and units in Changsha, Zhuzhou, Yueyang and Zhangzhou in our province were invited to participate in the exhibition. A total of 768 kinds of exhibits were exhibited, including red cultural relics, handicrafts, food specialties, tourist routes, red training courses, and red cultural and creative products.
The exhibition and sales area will be open until July 29.
As the host of the Red Expo, the Xiangtan exhibition area is full of highlights.
According to the person in charge of the exhibition area, the Xiangtan exhibition area is divided into two parts: red industry and red cultural industry development.
The red industrial exhibition area displayed 31 exhibits from six companies, including Hualing Xiangsteel, Hualing Cable, and Hunan Electric Power, and the red cultural industry development exhibition area displayed nearly 200 products from 27 units, including red series books, red series food, and red series cultural and creative products.
In the Yan'an exhibition area, many tourists were attracted by the display of cloth and flower handicrafts and paper-cut art.
Ma Dongpo, director of the Yan'an Municipal Bureau of Culture and Tourism, said that the exhibition carefully selected the outstanding red cultural and creative products in Yan'an in the past two years, of which 16 products are the outstanding works of the 2019 national red cultural and creative products.
At the same time, they invited the inheritors of the national intangible cultural heritage protection project "Ansei Paper Cutting," "Northern Shaanxi Folk Song" and the provincial non-heritage project Yanchuan Cloth Painting, focusing on the promotion of Yan'an folk products, and took the opportunity to communicate with other exhibition area units and enterprises to promote cross-regional cooperation.
More than 30,000 confirmed cases of new coronavirus in Japan - Xinhua
According to statistics, there were 239 new confirmed cases in Tokyo on the 26th, more than 200 new cases in a single day for six consecutive days, and a total of 11,214 cases.
In addition, there were 141 new confirmed cases in Osaka Prefecture, 90 new cases in Fukuoka Prefecture and 80 new cases in Aichi Prefecture.
In the first half of the year, the crime of telecommunication network fraud increased by 70%.
China News Service, July 26th According to the Supreme People's Procuratorate website, in the first half of this year, the national procuratorial organs prosecuted a total of 58,101 people for fraud crimes, an increase of 35% year on year.
In particular, among the crimes that obstruct epidemic prevention and control, fraud crimes are frequent, and the number of fraud crimes prosecuted by procuratorial organs accounts for 43.4% of the total number of crimes that obstruct epidemic prevention and control.
The Supreme People's Procuratorate has carried out targeted guidance, and of the ten batches of typical cases related to epidemic prevention and control that have been released so far, a total of nine involve fraud.
Judging from the handling of cases by procuratorial organs in the first half of the year, there are many names involved in fraud crimes, ranging from national macro policies to ordinary people's food, clothing and housing, including epidemic-related fraud, "medical care" fraud, "health care products" fraud, "enrollment intermediary" fraud, "routine loan" fraud, defrauding state subsidies fraud, national assets unfreezing fraud, etc. The scope involves education, medical care, employment, pension, social security, land acquisition and demolition, precision poverty alleviation, financial credit and other fields, which not only cause economic losses to victims, but also seriously affect economic and social development.
In particular, some telecommunications network frauds break through the restrictions of national borders, regions and personnel, and have the characteristics of stakeholder, cross-border, remote and electronic payment, with many unspecified victim groups and great harm.
For example, some set up special companies, rent high-end office buildings, set up multiple departments or positions, use legitimate online platforms to promote and recruit, train and assess recruiters, and adopt enterprise operation mode management, wearing a "legal cloak," which is more confusing.
It is the bounden duty of the procuratorate to punish and prevent crimes in accordance with the law, and to issue timely warnings to the public and relevant departments.
In the judicial handling of cases, the procuratorial organs conscientiously perform their duties, not only insisting on maintaining a high-pressure attitude towards fraud crimes, but also refining various law enforcement measures in a targeted manner, and promoting social governance by formulating and issuing procuratorial recommendations.
The procuratorate strictly controls the facts, evidence, procedures and application of the law in approving arrests and prosecuting fraud cases, taking the facts as the basis and the law as the criterion.
Especially for the crime of telecommunication network fraud, we pay attention to the central role of electronic data in the determination of facts, and strive to build a chain of evidence between electronic data, verbal evidence, and documentary evidence.
For example, in response to an epidemic-related fraud case handled by the Zhangzhou District Procuratorate in Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, the procuratorate intervened in advance at the first time, and it took only 5 days from the occurrence of the case to the conclusion, reflecting the attitude and determination to handle it quickly and strictly and maintain the overall stability of the society.
In the review of arrests and review of prosecutions, attention was paid to the prosecution of cases of omitted offenders, correcting the omission of public security organs to arrest 733 people, and correcting the omission of public security organs to review and prosecute 1,113 co-offenders.
In the first half of the year, the national procuratorate issued 298 procuratorial recommendations on fraud crimes, promoting joint efforts to prevent fraud crimes and promote in-depth governance.
For example, in response to the loopholes in the supervision of telecommunications networks found in the case of communication enterprises, banks, intermediary organizations, etc., the Guangzhou Municipal Procuratorate and the Dongguan Municipal Procuratorate of Guangdong Province promptly put forward procuratorial recommendations, urging relevant units to strengthen supervision and improve mechanisms to promote the construction of a long-term system.
The fourth is to do a good job of recovering losses.
Local procuratorial organs have seized the important links of intervening in investigation, guiding evidence collection, reviewing and prosecuting, urging investigative organs to actively recover stolen money, cooperating with relevant departments to do a good job in recovering losses, and striving to minimize the economic losses caused by fraud crimes to the people.
For example, in the case of Lin Moumou's road loan case handled by the Beijing Municipal Procuratorate, which involved 22 sets of real estate waiting to be seized, in the case that the real estate may be disposed of by other cases first, the "Suspended Execution Letter" was first issued and delivered to the relevant court in a timely manner. It is recommended that the court suspend the execution of the real estate involved in the case before the seizure, and dispose of it uniformly after the criminal facts are ascertained, and make the greatest effort to recover the real estate involved and recover the losses of the victims.
The prosecutor reminded everyone to be very vigilant against fraud and crime, not to expect "pie in the sky," and not to believe that it is cheap, and to guard their "money bags."
Jina Town, Weining County, Guizhou Province: Shortening the Apple Tree and Widening the Road Out of Poverty
2020-07-26 11:42:58 Source: China Economic Net Author: Zhu Yanjing Editor: Zhu Yanjing
In the scorching heat, a reporter from the Economic Daily - China Economic Net walked into Zhonghai Village in Jina Town, Weining County, Guizhou Province.
Under the scorching sun, villager Li Yuanzhong mowed grass at the base. Although his face was red from the sun, he hummed a few ditties from time to time.
Weining County, where Jina Town is located, has a certain reputation in the surrounding area due to its low latitude, high altitude, sufficient light, large temperature difference between day and night, high sugar content and good taste of apples, but also because of its small size and many spots, it has not been able to sell a good price and has not formed an industrial scale.
Jina Town was once a poverty-stricken township that "packed grain and potatoes for the spring and autumn," and the local poverty rate was as high as 25.8% 10 years ago.
In the crucial period when the fight against poverty has entered a decisive battle, it is urgent to change traditional planting habits, adjust the industrial structure, and increase farmers' income.
After many visits, Chen Chao, the party secretary of Jina Town, and a group of people in the town believe that industrial development can no longer follow the old path.
To this end, the town of Jina introduced leading enterprises to grow apples in a modern way.
Hou Jianwen, deputy general manager of Weining Beyond Agriculture Co., Ltd., came to Jina Town from Shaanxi in 2015 to investigate, and saw the local planting conditions at a glance, and began to plant apple trees there in 2016.
At first, the village mobilized Li Yuanzhong to transfer the land to plant apple trees, and Li Yuanzhong and his wife muttered in their hearts: "After growing apples for so many years, I have not seen anyone in the village grow apples and make a fortune."
"The apples planted are dwarf apples, which will not make the apple tree grow too tall."
What Li Yuanzhong did not expect was that the apple planting used a new method. Irrigation pipes were laid under each apple tree, water and fertilizer were poured to the roots, and when the fruit was harvested in autumn, the tractor drove directly into the orchard and could pick the fruit while standing.
At present, the apple base has gradually entered a period of abundant production, and the market is just as Hou Jianwen expected. Apple is not worried about selling, and is deeply loved by consumers in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and other cities.
The growing apple industry has brought new changes to Li Yuanzhong's life. Although he is still farming, he has a new source of income.
Li Yuanzhong's family has more than 9 acres of land transferred to the Apple base. Every year, in addition to the guaranteed land transfer fee, there are profit dividends after hanging fruit. The couple usually works in the base, "one person can get 80 yuan per day, and there is work all year round."
Li Yuanzhong told reporters that last year's profit dividend was more than 2,800 yuan, and with the land transfer fee and the couple's labor income, the family's income was more than 80,000 yuan.
"At present, it has achieved initial results, and the annual output value of 1 mu of apples exceeds 15,000 yuan, which is about 10 times that of corn."
Chen Chao told reporters that at present, the whole town of Jina has planted 20,000 mu of apples, and there are 6,000 mu in Zhonghai Village alone, covering 4,056 households and 17,200 people, including 656 households and 2,952 people in poor households with filing cards, and more than 6 million yuan in wages a year.
Li Yuanzhong, whose pockets are increasingly bulging, has also begun to realize his "wish."
This year's Lunar New Year, Li Yuanzhong bought an off-road vehicle, such as driving a car to and from work today, "there are still more than ten acres of land at home, and when the next step is to expand the scale of the Apple base, all of them will be transferred to them, and the income will be more."

Membrane separation technology helps to crack the "greenhouse effect"
Membrane separation technology helps crack the "greenhouse effect"
Schematic diagram of the new hybrid matrix membrane preparation technology
Our reporter Shang Rui reports: Recently, the atmospheric environment and bioenergy team of Tianjin University has made great progress in the "membrane separation method to capture carbon dioxide" and successfully developed a new hybrid matrix membrane preparation technology, which greatly improves the carbon dioxide capture performance of membrane materials.
The related results have been published as the cover article of the international journal Greenhouse Gases: Science and Technology.
The "greenhouse effect" is a major environmental problem plaguing human development, and carbon dioxide emissions are responsible for the "greenhouse effect."
How to efficiently capture and use the carbon dioxide emitted by humans is the focus of scientists.
"Membrane separation method" is an emerging carbon dioxide capture technology, which separates carbon dioxide gas with the help of membrane material, and has the characteristics of high efficiency, energy saving and simple operation.
How to let the membrane material "breathe deeply" and improve the gas separation efficiency is the bottleneck difficulty of using membrane separation to capture carbon dioxide.
Tianjin University research team innovative ideas, through repeated experiments, to explore the impact of different solvents on membrane gas separation performance.
The experimental results show that with N-methylpyrrolidone as the preparation solvent, the distribution of carbon nanotubes in the generated membrane material is more uniform and "more breathable," which effectively enhances the gas separation efficiency and rate of the membrane material.
The carbon dioxide separation performance of the hybrid matrix membrane prepared by this new technology is close to the theoretical separation limit of such membrane materials at present.
"The new technology provides new ideas for the capture of carbon dioxide by membrane separation."
Li Run, a member of the atmospheric environment and bioenergy team at Tianjin University, said: "We hope that this technology can provide strong support for the treatment of flue gas in coal-fired power plants and chemical companies in the future, and play a major role in controlling greenhouse gas emissions."

Before volunteering to fill in the report, first understand what is the professional grade difference
Every year, there are students or parents who fill out the college entrance examination voluntarily because they do not understand the terms involved in the voluntary report, which in turn affects the voluntary report.
This year, five universities - Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing University of Science and Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing Forestry University, and Beijing University of Chemical Technology - jointly issued an enrollment policy for 2020, abolishing the professional grade difference.
What is the meaning of professional grade difference and what is its significance in voluntary reporting?
There are three types of professional assignment rules
Experts remind that before filling in the volunteer application, you must read the "Admissions Regulations" of your favorite school in detail and understand the admission rules of the university, including the transfer ratio and the professional allocation rules.
The professional assignment rule means that after the transfer of colleges and universities, there are mainly three ways for professional admission: professional priority, score priority, and professional grade difference.
The specific method used by colleges and universities will be made clear in the Admissions Regulations.
However, the admission principle of some colleges and universities is that the total score is preferred, and there is no grade difference between majors.
That is to say, the candidates within the admission range will be lined up according to the total score, and when the score does not reach the first professional volunteer admission score line, it will be seen whether the second professional volunteer admission score line has been reached, and so on until the last professional volunteer is admitted, and there is no grade difference between the professional volunteers.
The so-called "professional grade difference" is that colleges and universities, when arranging candidates' majors, determine the admission majors of volunteer candidates in different majors according to one or several score values published in the admissions regulations. This score value is "professional grade difference."
That is, the difference between the scores of the first professional volunteer and the non-first professional volunteer, and the difference between the scores of each professional volunteer, such as 3 points, 2 points, 1 point, etc.
For example.
Assuming that the student Xiaoming applied for college A and scored 560 points, his professional volunteers were: computer, international trade, automation, mechanical engineering, e-commerce, and the professional admission of college A implemented the method of professional grade difference, the grade difference was divided into 2 points, 1 point, 1 point, and 0 points.
In the professional assignment, if Xiaoming's first professional volunteer meets the professional admission requirements and the professional has a planned balance, then Xiaoming is admitted to the "computer" major; if the computer is not admitted, his score will be subtracted by 2 points, and the score of 558 points will be sorted with the candidates of the first professional volunteer to apply for "international trade" to determine whether they meet the professional admission conditions; if they still cannot meet, the score will be subtracted by 1 point (that is, 557 points) for the admission of the third professional volunteer "automation"; if they still cannot meet, the score will be subtracted by 1 point (that is, 556 points) for the admission of the fourth professional, and the subsequent professional will not be deducted if they still cannot meet their professional volunteer, and so on.
Different universities set different grades for different majors
With the popularity of parallel volunteering, many universities have now abolished the professional grade difference, but this year there are still some universities that have retained this method. Judging from the "Admissions Regulations" published by each school, more than 20 universities have set up professional grade differences this year.
For example, Sichuan Agricultural University, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Heilongjiang University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Jiangxi Normal University, Chengdu Medical College, Northeast Electric Power University, Jimei University, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing University of Technology, Ningxia University, Shandong University of Technology, and China Civil Aviation Flight Academy.
Among these universities, each university sets a different professional level.
Some colleges and universities have a grade difference in each major, such as Ningxia University, and the candidates whose files have been submitted to the school are admitted in order of score after decreasing by 1 point according to the order in which the candidates fill in the major volunteer.
And some universities have set different professional levels between different majors.
For example, at Jimei University, the total score of professional volunteer grade difference is 4 points, that is, the difference between the first professional volunteer and other professional volunteers is 3 points, there is no grade difference between other professional volunteers, which is regarded as parallel volunteering, and the difference between other professional volunteers and transfer professional volunteers is 1 point.
When filling out the volunteer application, candidates and parents must carefully read the admission policy of the reported school to see if there is a professional grade difference and what the form of the grade difference is. While fully considering the score, it is also necessary to rationally analyze the schools and majors to be selected. If the institution clearly adopts the score difference method for admission in the enrollment charter, candidates should pay attention to the gradient between the majors when choosing a major to improve the admission rate.

Chengdu people gather to watch the US Consulate Police stop people from "looking too happy"
In response to the US closure of the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, China announced the closure of the US Consulate General in Chengdu on Friday.
On Saturday, the US consulate's badge was removed, and on Sunday, a dark-glass car drove away from the consulate amid boos from passers-by.
On Sunday, many Chengdu people gathered in front of the U.S. Consulate to take pictures, and those who had not been there were also driven by curiosity about current affairs.
Agence France-Presse's Chengdu station reporter also went to the vicinity of the US Consulate in Chengdu to observe, and reported back that there were many curious people, and many parents took their children to take a walk to see the consulate, take pictures of the building, or take selfies.
The consulate was surrounded by guards, and the police "corrected" people's behavior from time to time, and they did not seem to allow any extraordinary behavior: a woman was stopped just as she was about to sing a red song, and a guard confiscated a banner.
But residents of a nearby residential building managed to pull up a giant Chinese flag on their balcony and shouted slogans in support of China.
Opened in 1985, the U.S. Consulate in Chengdu covers all U.S. consular-related matters in southwest China, especially in the Tibet Autonomous Region.
Agence France-Presse's Chengdu station reporter said that the Chinese government's response to the United States was relatively restrained: many Chinese people online asked the government to close the US consulate in Hong Kong, but the official only said that "the closure of the Chengdu US consulate is a necessary and legitimate response to the unreasonable behavior of the United States."
In addition to Chengdu, the United States currently has consulates in Guangdong, Shanghai, Shenyang, Wuhan, and Hong Kong.
Large-scale financial media campaign "Go to the village live to see poverty alleviation" starts - Today's news - Hunan Daily News - Huasheng Online
Hunan Daily · New Hunan Client July 25th (Reporter of this newspaper) On July 25th, the large-scale financial media action "Walking Village Live to See Poverty Alleviation" sponsored by the Financial Program Center of the Central Radio and Television General Station departed from Xuzhou, Jiangsu, and two caravans carrying 5G new media mobile cloud broadcasting system were sent by the guests on the scene and slowly drove out of the scene.
General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out that "2020 is a landmark year. We will build a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way and achieve the first centenary goal. 2020 is also the year of decisive victory in the fight against poverty."
The large-scale financial media campaign "Going to the Village Live to See Poverty Alleviation" is an important measure for the financial program center of the Central Radio and Television General Station to cooperate with this major theme and do a good job in promoting poverty alleviation.
The action will go into poverty-stricken villages in more than 20 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the Central Government, dig up fresh stories of poverty alleviation, directly attack the dramatic changes in the appearance of villages, and show how villagers can break through the difficulties of survival and development and move towards the road to prosperity.
The operation will last for more than three months.
Starting from Xuzhou, the reporter divided into two routes and took the southwest route, passing through Anhui, Hubei, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangxi, Guizhou, Sichuan, Chongqing, Yunnan, Tibet and other places; the other route took the northwest route, passing through Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Hebei and other places, covering more than 10,000 kilometers.
In the form of reporting, "Going to the village to see poverty alleviation" is boldly integrated.
The economic development of the villages visited by the caravan will be broadcast through the CCTV Financial Channel of the Central Radio and Television General Station, the Voice of the Central Guangxi Economy, China Traffic Radio, and CCTV Financial New Media.
Among them, the live TV broadcast will be mainly completed in the midday news program "Tianxia Caijing" of CCTV Finance Channel (first broadcast time: Monday to Sunday 12:00-13:00), and the gold news program "Economic Information Network" of CCTV Finance Channel will open a column on poverty alleviation (first broadcast time: Monday to Sunday 20:30-21:30).
At the same time, the caravan will conduct a one-hour live broadcast on the CCTV financial client for each village it visits. Viewers can watch the live broadcast and participate in the lottery by downloading the CCTV financial app.
In terms of technology application and studio design, "Walking Village Live to See Poverty Alleviation" bravely broke through and pioneered the "New Media Caravan in the Outfield."
The car is equipped with a 5G new media mobile cloud broadcasting system, using 5G + 4K / 8K + AI technology to realize the organic combination of online and offline, large screen and small screen, and television broadcasting.
Equipped with a three-channel studio area, the studio area is converted from a container, with a length of 12 meters, a width of 2.55 meters, and a height of 3.98 meters. The box adopts a hydraulic automatic unfolding structure, which can be turned up to 120 degrees.
The studio area can also be automatically expanded and connected to an external expansion platform, with an area of more than 50 square meters, which can meet the scene requirements of most programs.
At present, the Dongchuan District of Kunming is already hot in summer, and what is hotter than the weather is the poverty alleviation workshop next to the relocation site.
"Now, as soon as I leave home, I go to the factory to earn money and take care of my family, thanks to the free vocational skills training organized by the trade union," said Lu Ling, an employee of Kunming Esfu Electronic Technology Company.
Walking into the poverty alleviation workshop of electronic components processing in Tongdu Street, Dongchuan District, a hot and busy picture came into view.
Lu Ling, who is in her 40s, is a single mother, raising her children alone and caring for her elderly parents.
In her most difficult time, the Dongchuan District Federation of Trade Unions helped to come up with ideas and find ways to "send charcoal in the snow."
Since 2018, Lu Ling has enjoyed housing, schooling, social security, employment and other assistance policies and assistance funds issued by trade unions at all levels.
This year, her children have successfully graduated and are employed, and she herself has a job and income after participating in skills training, and has been out of trouble at the end of April.
It is reported that the special skills training project of the Dongchuan District General Organization to help poverty alleviation is part of the skills training work of the Yunnan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions.
Combined with the characteristics of the difficult workers in the poverty alleviation and relocation resettlement sites in the area, the district has conducted in-depth investigations to understand the training needs and determine the types of training. In the near future, it plans to train a total of 450 electricians, welders, pastry chefs, etc.
Recently, Li Yi, an employee of the Yunnan Menglian County Branch of the Agricultural Bank, wrote a sincere letter of thanks to the County Federation of Trade Unions.
In her letter, she sincerely thanked the union for giving her a scholarship from August 2013 to January 2017 to help her complete her studies.
In 2004, Li Yi's father died in a car accident, and her mother was included in the file of difficult workers. Since then, she has been enjoying the care of the policy of building a file.
With the help of the local trade union, Li Yi successfully completed her studies.
Since 2016, 3,809 households have been lifted out of poverty through institutional guarantees and targeted assistance.
The successful rescue of Lu Ling's family and Li Yi is a microcosm of the Yunnan trade union's work to promote the rescue of workers in difficulty.
According to Kaiyuan Duan, a staff member of the Legal and Rights Protection Department of the Yunnan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the provincial government has strengthened the dynamic management of the files of employees in difficulty, promoted the normalization of the filing work, and promptly incorporated the help system for employees in difficulty who meet the filing conditions; broadened the application channels for employees in difficulty, and used WeChat to open an online application service platform for employees in difficulty to file, so as to facilitate the timely and active declaration of employees in difficulty.
During the epidemic, it is difficult to go out to work. In order to help the workers with difficulties in the file to ease the pressure of life, Yunnan Province has arranged more than 13 million yuan to send warm funds. According to the national standard of 2,000 yuan per household for workers with difficulties in the file and 1,500 yuan per household for workers with difficulties in the file at the provincial level, more than 6,000 households at the national level and more than 1,000 households at the provincial level have implemented special warm condolence activities for workers with difficulties in the file.
At the same time, the provincial government has linked up with various Internet recruitment platforms such as the Human Resources and Social Security Department and Zhaopin Recruitment to push recruitment information to workers in difficulty and provide employment counseling, employment guidance and other services.
