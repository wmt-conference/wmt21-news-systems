Where to find talent?
The outstanding group of returning migrant workers is an indispensable fresh force.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 26, Telegram Question: Turning Outstanding Returning Migrant Workers into a New Force for Rural Revitalization
The 34-year-old Zhang Xiong, whose family lives in Orchard Village in Meishan City, Sichuan, quit his job in Beijing with a monthly salary of tens of thousands of dollars to start a business in 2010.
After several years of struggle, now the grape-growing family farm he runs has an annual income of more than a million yuan, has become a well-known leader of wealth, and has also been selected into the team of the village "two committees".
In recent years, inspired by a series of policies to support and benefit farmers, such as the national fight against poverty and rural revitalization, more and more outstanding migrant workers like Zhang Xiong have chosen to return home to start their own businesses, activating a pool of spring water in rural areas.
Sichuan, a province with a large population and a large labour export province in western China, has led the implementation of the "Return and Training Project for Outstanding Migrant Workers" due to favourable circumstances. In 2019 alone, more than 8,000 village party branch secretaries were produced from among the outstanding migrant workers returned, 61,000 village reserves were trained and more than 20,000 party members were developed, providing a strong guarantee for winning the battle against poverty and implementing the strategy of rural revitalization.
Well-off is not well-off, the key is to look at the villagers.
Since the reform and opening up, a large number of young and middle-aged workers in rural China have gone out to work to increase their income, and some have set up their own enterprises through hard work.
However, objectively, it has also led to the emergence of "hollowing out" in rural areas to different degrees, especially the weakening of rural grass-roots organizations, and the ranks of village Party branch secretaries and Party members show the characteristics of "one old and one low", that is, old age, low education, weak ranks of leaders of village Party organizations, and the lack of access to young and yellow.
If rural talents and other factors have been flowing one way to the city, the countryside has long been in the state of "blood loss" and "anemia", revitalization is an empty word.
Attracting rural migrant workers who are capable, conscious and interested in serving their hometown back, guiding them to return home and start their own businesses to become rich leaders, choosing their best to train them into Party members and rural cadres, and enriching the ranks of cadres at the grass-roots level, is the solution to the root cause of the problem of the lack of youth and yellow among rural Party members and grass-roots Party organizations.
Excellent migrant workers can be brought back, but also let them stay and do a good job.
In recent years, Sichuan has started by paying close attention to the Party construction of rural migrant workers and, on the basis of strict candidate standards, has established institutional mechanisms such as targeted return, service guarantee, training and ability enhancement, selection and use of outstanding rural migrant workers, so that they can improve their abilities, secure their jobs and have expectations in their lives, truly take root in rural areas and have a sense of accomplishment in their entrepreneurship.
This year is the closing year of the decisive battle against poverty. Talents are the key factor in the connection between poverty eradication and rural revitalization.
Party committees and governments at all levels should attach great importance to this group of outstanding returning migrant workers, and adopt comprehensive measures to turn them into a task force and fresh force that can stay, fight and not take away, so as to provide strong organizational security and talent support for rural areas to lift themselves out of poverty and strive for a well-off, development and revitalization.
Because of the epidemic, this year's college graduates are a very special class. On the evening of July 11, the bilibili summer graduation song will bring a special live online performance for the graduates. Old Wolf, Park Shu, Li Yuchun, Mao Yi and other musicians sent songs and blessings to the fresh graduates.
The well-known up master SealWu Yifan Wu also brought with him a song called "Wild Grass," a rap song based on Lu Xun's poems of the same name, which is very popular among young people.
Due to the epidemic, many graduates did not experience the ritual sense of dialing ears and awarding degrees, so they transferred the sense of ritual to the line.
Data show that the 2.5-hour-long song concert peaked at more than 35 million viewers.
"Follow your heart, seize the opportunity, regardless of the consequences, and sometimes there will be unexpected gains."
Although it is a graduation song, many songs also moved non-fresh graduates.
"Look at the whole scene really want to cry, whose youth is full of beauty and regret, but all worth remembering, all have to go on bravely."
The sustainable improvement of Beijing's natural ecology attracts more than 500 species of wildlife to "settle" in the city.

The capital's natural ecology continues to improve to attract wildlife to "settle" in the city
There are more than 500 species of wildlife in Beijing
The reporter of this newspaper (reporter Wang Bin) Beijing Youth Daily learned from the Municipal Bureau of Landscape and Greening that with the continuous improvement of the natural ecological environment in the capital in recent years, the species and number of wildlife have also continued to increase.
At present, the number of terrestrial spinal wildlife living in Beijing has increased to more than 500 species, including state-level protected animals such as brown horse chicken and black stork, as well as state-level protected animals such as gazelle, swan, gray crane and mandarin duck.
Whether the urban forests planted everywhere in the Second Ring, or the small wetlands embedded in the buildings, not only bring natural wild interest to the citizens of the capital, but also attract wildlife to "settle" in the city.
In the middle of summer, the Songshan National Nature Reserve, located in the Yanshan Mountains in the northwest of Yanqing District, is vibrant.
A raccoon was playing leisurely by a mountain stream, while two badgers played with each other.
Looking back, a wild boar couldn't resist the "sting" on his body and was rubbing hard against the bark of the bark.Hu Qiaoli, director of the Songshan National Nature Reserve Administration, said that by the end of 2019, 178 species of wild animals, including gold eagles protected by the national level and chickens and wildebeest protected by the national level, lived in the Green Sea, which covers a total area of more than 6,200 hectares. Nearly a third of the wildlife species in the city could be found here.
"In Songshan, wild animals are the real 'owners', and our staff can only be the 'bodyguards' of people at best."
Hu said that in order to understand the situation of wildlife in the protected area on the ground, more than 30 professional rangers patrol along 16 carefully formulated protection routes every day, and there is a "big circle" once a month, which takes a whole day to travel almost all over the protected area.
"When patrolling, we should not only check and record biodiversity, but also check the installation of artificial bird nests, rescue injured wildlife, install field infrared cameras, and so on."
More than 200 infrared cameras have been installed in Songshan National Nature Reserve to record the living conditions of wildlife in the forest.
Hu Qiaoli said that with the continuous enrichment of biodiversity in the protected areas in recent years, more and more wild animals appear in the camera, leopard cats, raccoons and pig badgers have become "permanent guests", and the "appearance rate" of gazelle, an animal protected by the state at the second level, has become higher and higher.
Zhang Zhiming, Director of the Wildlife and Wetland Protection Division of the Beijing Landscape and Greening Bureau, said that the number of species of terrestrial spinal wildlife in Beijing has increased from 461 in 1994 to more than 500 now. The species and number of wildlife in Beijing have continued to increase in recent years.
The figure of wild animals in cities is becoming more and more common, which is closely related to the upgrading of urban greening in the capital in recent years.
In particular, the new round of million-mu afforestation and greening construction, which began in 2018, proposes to reshape the urban ecological environment, enhance the ecological function of woodland green areas, and highlight the concept of "near-nature".
The plan strives to achieve interconnection and interaction with the surrounding green areas to facilitate wildlife to "visit relatives and friends", and the trees planted are also the favorite source of honey and food plants for animals.
Black land "planted" for agricultural modernization
Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 26, telegram question: Black land "planted" out of agricultural modernization
In the middle of summer, two spraying planes passed the 10,000-acre high-yield demonstration field in the second operation station of the fifth management area of Friendship Farm, forming two white lines. The words "the first field in the world" planted with black rice seedlings in the green fields were particularly striking.
Kong Lingqiang, the station director of the operation station, said the aircraft could spray more than 6,000 acres of arable land in a day, with an efficiency of about eight times that of a drone and hundreds of times that of man.
This farm is located in the territory of Friendship County of Heilongjiang Province, China's largest grain-producing province. From the sound of "rice cutting" in the past to the sound of "rumbling" today, Chinese traditional farming and farming have transformed in this black soil belt.
In addition to aircraft, satellites are also used in the modern agricultural production of Friendship Farm.
Kong Lingqiang introduced that, on the one hand, they use satellite remote sensing technology to realize accurate fertilization, reduce agricultural input and reduce pollution. On the other hand, satellite navigation technology can improve the standardized operation level of agricultural machinery in the field.
In the course of rice production this year, the farm expanded the operational area of satellite navigation unmanned seedling transplanting technology from 3,000 mu last year to 30,000 mu.
This technology makes the planting of seedlings more uniform, can maximize the utilization of sunlight and cultivated land resources, and can save 16 yuan per acre of labor cost.
Farms have tried new technologies such as informationization and intelligence in agricultural production, forming the largest group of agricultural machinery in China from the ground to the sky.
According to statistics, there are currently a total of 49,000 farm machinery units (pieces), and the comprehensive mechanization rate in the field has reached 99.8%.
The operation of agricultural machinery has achieved 100% GPS satellite navigation, 100% precision seeding in drylands and 100% high-power locomotive operation in drylands.
"Green agriculture, intelligent agriculture and digital agriculture are the direction of agricultural modernization."
Liu Hualien, director of Friendship Farm, said.
The key to agricultural modernization is scientific and technological progress.
Agricultural reclamation in Heilongjiang, represented by farms, has played a demonstration and leading role in the "aircraft carrier" of modern agriculture in recent years, and has initially established a modern agricultural industry system led by large-scale cultivation, standardized production and industrial management.
In the suburb of Friendship County, there is an agricultural machinery extensive reading garden with an area of 350,000 square meters.
There is a concentrated display of more than 140 (pieces) agricultural machinery tools introduced and used in Heilongjiang agricultural reclamation over the years.
These agricultural machinery and farm have witnessed the development of China's agricultural modernization.

Fu Kun Bao's kitchen was clean and tidy, with a pot of pumpkin head dishes on the table, eggs and some brine in the fridge.
"I didn't expect to move, the water of Jiangkou River looks good at present."
Zhou Yan said that the home is a bungalow, and some large items have not thought about where to put for the time being.
"Pack up the expensive items first. Large items such as refrigerators and TV sets can be temporarily placed in the homes of high-lying neighbors or relatives."
Village cadre Wang Lijing gave Fu Kun Bao advice.
Wang Lijing was responsible for the transfer and resettlement of 13 villagers, notifying each household and confirming each person's resettlement plan.
The nearest settlement to Fu Kun Bao's home is Su Xiaoxue, Yan Dian Township, about 2 kilometers away.
In addition to large pieces, Fu Kunbao and his family have a headache of more than 1000 jin of grain and some newly bought furniture.

Church Fire in Nantes, France: Parish Volunteers Admit to Arson
China News Network, July 26: On July 18, the famous St. Peter and St. Paul Cathedral, a treasure of religious and historical architecture in Nantes, France, was severely damaged in a fire and the cathedral organ was completely destroyed, foreign media reported.
On the 26th local time, the Nantes prosecutor announced that a parish volunteer responsible for guarding the cathedral had been charged with "arson and destruction".
He has admitted that he lit the fire in the church.
Local prosecutor Senas said the 39-year-old diocesan volunteer from Rwanda admitted to setting fires in three places in the middle of the cathedral at night.
The man's lawyer said the arsonist now regretted doing so.
This person entered France through the way of asylum a few years ago, was sheltered in the parish where the fire occurred, and was taken in in the church.
The prosecution pointed out that he had recently tried to renew his visa and was talking to the police about it.
But the church said it still could not believe that the normally very kind, smiling but not very talkative believer would destroy the church he loved so much.
On the day of the fire on July 18, the volunteer had already been questioned by the police for illogical problems in his account, but he was later released.
The picture shows firefighters rescuing at the scene.
On the evening of the 25th, he was summoned again as professional engineers at the laboratory of the Paris Central Police obtained new evidence.
This time, the man admitted to the arson.
It was reported that if convicted of arson and vandalism, the suspects could face 10 years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros.
The report said the fire caused serious damage to the Cathedral of St. Pierre and St. Paul, where the organ was completely destroyed and the stained glass windows behind the organ were severely damaged.
According to Brunet, the chief architect of French historic preservation, it is conservatively estimated that the restoration of Nantes Cathedral will take at least three years.
Comprehensive news: US unilateralism undermines bilateral relations International public opinion supports China's countermeasures against the US - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26: On the morning of July 24, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the US Embassy in China that China had decided to revoke the license for the establishment and operation of the US Consulate General in Chengdu, and made specific requests for the Consulate General to cease all operations and activities.
International public opinion believes that the unilateral measures taken by the United States have caused serious distress to China-US relations. It is legitimate and necessary for China to respond to the unreasonable provocations of the United States and take countermeasures.
Andrés Bolquez, Director of the Center for China Studies at the Institute of International Studies of the University of Chile, said that the unilateral measures of the United States have destroyed the bridge of understanding between the Chinese and American peoples and put the relations between the two major countries in crisis.
China's notification to the United States to close its Consulate General in Chengdu is a countermeasure to the unilateral measures of the United States and is in line with diplomatic practice.
Patricio Justo, a professor at the Argentine Catholic University and director of the Center for Arab-China Studies, believes that the above-mentioned decision by China is a legitimate and necessary countermeasure to the previous provocations by the United States, not against the ordinary American people.
The United States is trying to divert the attention of the American public by pressuring China to cover up its inadequate response to the new epidemic.
Bambang Suryono, chairman of the Asian Innovation Research Center, an Indonesian think tank, said the provocative diplomatic posture adopted by the United States has caused serious distress to China-US relations and bilateral relations are facing serious challenges.
China's notification to the United States of the closure of its Consulate General in Chengdu is a normal countermeasure and is in line with diplomatic practice. It reflects both China's principled position of firmly safeguarding its own interests and the rational and beneficial nature of China's diplomacy.
Tanzanian commentator Francis Semwinza said that China's decision is a legitimate and necessary response to the US provocation.
For China-US relations to return to normal, the US should take the initiative to improve its relations with China and stop interfering in China's internal affairs.
The United States should focus on how to achieve win-win results with China economically and politically, and how to benefit the two peoples and even the international community as a whole.
Ali Youssef, executive director of the Sudan-based Federation of Arab-Chinese Friendship Associations, said that the countermeasures China was forced to take were a legitimate and necessary response to the unjustified actions of the United States and were in line with international law and the basic norms governing international relations, as well as with diplomatic practices.
Earlier, the United States called for the closure of the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, a serious violation of international law and the basic norms governing international relations.
We hope that the US will rescind its previous relevant decisions and create the necessary conditions for bilateral relations to return to normalcy.
Singapore's Lianhe Zaobao published an editorial saying that the larger strategic intention of the United States is to encircle China and prevent its continued rise.
In the face of the pressing steps of the United States, although China is very reluctant to see China-US relations continue to deteriorate, it has to take countermeasures.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 26 (reporter Mao Xin) learned from the Guangdong Maritime Police Bureau that recently, the Bureau, in conjunction with the customs and public security departments of Guangzhou, broke down a large smuggling gang of refined oil products, and preliminarily verified that the gang had smuggled about 120,000 tons of refined oil products since 2019, with a case value of about 800 million yuan and tax evasion of about 240 million yuan.
The Guangdong Maritime Police Bureau and the anti-smuggling department of the Customs have gradually mapped out the division of personnel and organizational structure of the group.
On July 8, the maritime police, customs and public security departments carried out unified net collection operations in Guangzhou, Foshan and other places, as well as in the sea area of the Pearl River Estuary, respectively, seizing four suspected smuggling vessels on the spot, seizing a total of 4,700 tons of refined oil products from the vessels involved and the oil depots, and freezing a number of fund accounts.
It is understood that a total of eight ships and two helicopters were deployed in the joint operation, which was divided into multiple operational groups to work together to carry out a full-chain crackdown on links such as maritime smuggling and illegal operations on land, and all 35 major criminal suspects arrived at the case.
The case is currently under further investigation.
The relevant person in charge of the Guangdong Maritime Police Bureau said that it would continue to maintain a high-pressure situation in the future, crack down on all kinds of illegal and criminal smuggling activities at sea and maintain good order in the maritime areas under its jurisdiction.
Hurricane Hanna makes landfall in Texas or causes river surges and flash floods
At 5: 00 p.m. local time on July 25, Hurricane "Hanna" made landfall in the U.S. state of Texas, which will bring strong winds, torrential rain, swollen rivers and possibly life-threatening flash floods, according to a comprehensive foreign media report.
The National Hurricane Center says Hurricane Hanna is expected to bring heavy rainfall across parts of southern and northeastern Texas, causing swollen streams and life-threatening flash flooding.
It was reported that the area most affected by Hurricane Hanna was south of the city of Corpus Christi to the mouth of the Rio Grande, while widespread flash flooding could occur in the Rio Grande Valley.
Texas Governor Abbott said on the 25th: "Any hurricane is a huge challenge."
Thirty-two counties in the state declared a disaster emergency due to the hurricane.
The city of Corpus Christi, with a population of more than 320,000, has closed its libraries and museums and residents are waiting.
Abbott also said the hurricane cannot be allowed to bring more casualties to Texas at a time when the state is being hit hard by the new outbreak.
It is reported that precipitation in southern Texas is expected to reach 6 to 12 inches on the night of the 26th, and 3 to 5 inches of rain will also occur in northern Texas and coastal Louisiana.
Due to global warming and other factors, Hanna formed earlier than previous Atlantic hurricane seasons.
Typically, the first hurricane in the Atlantic does not form until mid-August.
Poland to withdraw from European treaty to prevent violence against women
Poland's Justice Ministry said Saturday that Poland will take steps next week to withdraw from the European treaty on the prevention of violence against women.
Poland's right-wing government cabinet said the treaty violated the rights of students' parents by requiring schools to teach students about gender issues.
Speaking at a press conference, Polish Justice Minister Joblo said his ministry will submit a request to the Ministry of Labor and Family Monday to start withdrawing from the treaty.
That treaty is also known as the Istanbul Convention.
"The treaty contains elements of a meaning-form nature that we consider harmful," Gioblo said.
Poland's ruling Law and Justice Party and its ruling coalition partners have a close alliance with the Roman Catholic Church and advocate a conservative social agenda.
Polish President Andrzej Duda made hostility to gay rights one of his main issues during his successful re-election campaign this month.
On Friday, thousands of Poles (mostly women) protested in Warsaw and other cities against the withdrawal.
"The purpose of withdrawing from the treaty is to legitimize domestic violence," Lempat, one of the protest organizers, said at a protest march in Warsaw.
Some protesters held banners reading "Law and Justice is a hell for women."
PiS has long complained about the Istanbul Convention.
Poland's previous centrist government ratified the Convention in 2015.
The PiS government said the treaty did not respect religion and called for liberal social policies to be taught in schools.
To date, however, the party has not decided to withdraw from the Convention.

At present, the first two upgraded versions of the Wuzhika-52M are being modified and replaced at the Far East Helicopter Manufacturing Plant of the Russian "Progressive" Aerospace Group, and the completion of its national-level testing and improvement will be completed by October 2022, the Russian Yediot reported recently.
According to Russian experts familiar with the above-mentioned upgrading work, the "predecessor" of the "Super Alligator", the Kun-Wuzhika-52, was officially installed in November 2011, and some weaknesses were exposed in the use of the model, which was upgraded to "make up for the short plate".
It is reported that, compared with the Ka-52, the Ka-52M will partially use new protective materials that will not increase weight, its pilot cockpit will be strengthened and equipped with new equipment to resist missile attacks, thus increasing the probability of battlefield survival; it will be equipped with a more powerful generator to power more complex on-board electronic equipment; the photoelectric system will be upgraded to be able to detect and identify more distant battlefield targets; it will be equipped with a new light multi-purpose missile that mainly attacks armoured combat vehicles and reinforced concrete fortifications, with a range of 20 kilometers, which is about one time higher than the similar missile used in active service in Russia. Its defense weapons and communication equipment will be used to the maximum extent with the Mi-28NM helicopter that can attack air targets, thus making the maintenance simple and economical.
In addition, the Ka-52M will have a more advanced electronic guidance system, weapon aiming system and navigation equipment.
Russian experts also said that it is worth noting that the Ka-52M will be equipped with communication equipment to communicate with the UAV in order to obtain real-time information transmitted by nearby UAV in the air, such as displaying the UAV images on the cockpit screen of the helicopter.
As planned, the pilot of the Ka-52M can directly control the UAV with which it cooperates, thus improving the pilot's mastery of the battlefield situation and the guidance of long-range missiles.
According to Russian media reports, Russian Deputy Defense Minister Krivoruchko said last December that the Russian Defense Ministry plans to purchase more than 110 Wuzhika-52Ms by 2027.

Hebei river and lake ecological water recharge 1.75 billion cubic meters since this year
Xinhua News Agency Shijiazhuang, July 26 (Reporter Wang Kun) learned from the Hebei Water Conservancy Department that, since this year, Hebei Province has made overall use of water from diversion rivers and local reservoirs, and has successively implemented ecological water recharge to 28 rivers and Baiyangdian, including the Lutuo River, the Tanghe River and the Qianmahe River, accumulating 1.75 billion cubic meters of ecological water recharge from rivers and lakes.
Hebei Province clung to the favorable opportunity of increasing the flow and water delivery of the middle line of the South-to-North Water Transfer Project and implemented ecological water replenishment by using river water diversion to Tanghe, Shahe and Shulong rivers.
At the same time, nine large and medium-sized reservoirs such as the Western Ocean, East Wushi and Baiyangdian have been used to carry out ecological water recharge to rivers such as the Luoyang River and the Qinglong River, resulting in a cumulative surface area of more than 90 square kilometers.
In order to do a good job in the work of ecological water recharge, the Hebei Water Conservancy Department has actively organized and carried out the investigation of hidden dangers, remediation, reinforcement and river cleaning of recharge rivers, refined practical measures and strengthened inspection and management protection.
Through supervision and inspection and centralized unannounced visits, all kinds of problems were solved in time to ensure the safe and orderly recharge of the river.
According to the relevant persons in charge of the Hebei Water Conservancy Department, the orderly implementation of the ecological water recharge of rivers and lakes has effectively repaired the ecological environment of rivers and lakes in Hebei Province, promoted the recharge and conservation of coastal groundwater, greatly improved the human settlements environment and the economic development environment along the route, and is of great significance to the realization of the river and lake management and protection goals of "clear water, coastal green, river smooth and beautiful".
(Deutsche Welle) In the past two weeks, the number of new confirmed cases in Spain has risen sharply, with thousands of new cases appearing on several days.
The British government made a provisional decision on Saturday night (July 25) to remove Spain from the safe travel list from midnight local time on July 26, and people entering the UK from Spain must be quarantined for 14 days.
British tourists on holiday in Spain expressed surprise, fear and even anger at the decision, as the news came suddenly and took them by surprise.
British Transport Secretary Grant Shapps is also reportedly on holiday in Spain.
Prior to the UK's quarantine measures, Norway had also announced a 10-day quarantine for people returning to Norway from Spain.
France and Belgium have advised their residents to forgo holidays in and around Barcelona.
Beaches in these areas were overcrowded and people could not maintain social distancing, and the police had to take measures to reduce the number of beach visitors.
Tourism is an important pillar industry in Spain
Spain: It's safe here
In response to the decision made by the United Kingdom, the Spanish Foreign Ministry said Sunday that the epidemic in the country was under control.
Spanish Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya stressed to the media: "Spain is safe, not only for Spaniards, but also for tourists."
The Spanish government will try to persuade the British government to exclude the Balearic Islands and Canary Islands from the quarantine measures.
The reason is that the infection rate in these two resorts is much lower than in the UK.
In order to prevent the spread of the epidemic, the "ban on foot" has also been reintroduced in Catalonia, Spain.
Tourism is an important pillar industry in Spain, and Spain is one of the most popular holiday destinations for British tourists.
The British decision is expected to greatly affect Spain's tourism industry.

First Day of Medium Volt: Temporary Absence of High Temperature and Heat in Beijing to Open Rainfall Mode - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26, by wire (reporter Ni Yuan Jin) July 26 is the first day of "neutralization" this year.
The wind and rainstorm convective weather in the early morning of the 26th dispersed the high temperature and heat that had enveloped the Beijing area for days, and a new round of rainfall weather will last for several days.
The Beijing Meteorological Observatory announced at 11: 00 on the 26th that there were scattered showers (with weak thunder and lightning) in Beijing on the 26th, and the daily maximum temperature was only 27 degrees Celsius.
Previously, from 24 to 25, the whole city of Beijing was under a high temperature blue warning, and the daily maximum temperature in most areas was around 37 ° C, with local high temperatures exceeding 40 ° C.
Futian is the highest temperature, humid and sultry day of the year. There are "three volts" and the hottest is in the middle, which is when the Chinese people say "bitter summer".
When entering the barn, families fill the barn, and there is a folk saying of "one-volt dumplings and two-volt noodles."
According to the current forecast, Beijing will have cloudy and rainy weather in the next three days.
The meteorological department advised the public to minimize visits to mountainous areas and guard against geological disasters.
It is understood that this year's "mid-volt" will have 20 days, from July 26 to August 14.
After entering the "middle volt", people will feel physical weakness and loss of appetite.
Diet can choose mung beans, coix and other foods with the effect of clearing heat and relieving heat, strengthening spleen and appetizing, as well as bitter foods such as bitter cabbage and bitter gourd, which can help to enhance appetite and dispel heat.
The FAA ordered an urgent inspection of 2,000 Boeing airliners.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an emergency airworthiness directive on the 24th, requiring an emergency inspection of about 2,000 Boeing 737NG and 737 Classic aircraft registered in the United States, because the corrosion of the air check valves of the above-mentioned aircraft could cause the engines to stop in the air.
The FAA said that so far, it has received four reports of 737NG and 737Classic engines stopping in the air, so it has made a request for an urgent inspection of airliners that have been parked for more than seven consecutive days and those that have flown less than 11 times since re-entering flight.
The Federal Aviation Administration warned that if the stage 5 check valves of all two engines were corroded, they could jam in the open position, causing the aircraft to lose power and be unable to restart the engines.
The aviation regulator ordered that once the check valve was found to be corroded, air operators must replace this key component before the aircraft could be put into service again.
Boeing responded later in the day that the outbreak of the new epidemic had reduced travel demand, resulting in many airliners being sealed or less used, and "check valves are more vulnerable to corrosion."
At the same time, Boeing said it had advised air carriers to inspect the airliners covered by the directive and that if problems were found, Boeing would provide assistance in repairing and replacing check valves.
Major US airline operators' airliners usually fly several times a day, but a large number of airliners have been grounded after the outbreak of the new epidemic, and some have returned to operation as passenger travel demand has recently grown slowly, AP reported.
The FAA did not release details of the four air parking reports.
Alaska Airlines revealed one of the incidents late on the 24th.
The airline operator said in a statement that one of its aircraft was flying from Seattle, Washington, to Austin, Texas on July 15 when one of its engines suddenly failed, and the aircraft finally made a successful emergency landing at Austin Airport.
Alaska Airlines said it had replaced the aircraft's engines and had inspected the engines of six aircraft in accordance with FAA directives.
American Airlines, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines said on the 24th that their airliners had no engine failure related to the air check valve.
Four American Airlines aircraft will be inspected and 28 United Airlines aircraft will be inspected.
Delta Air Lines said it would inspect its 20 aircraft, but did not say whether there had been any engine failures.
Several media reported that the FAA emergency airworthiness directive is another blow to Boeing.
A Boeing 737 MAX from Lion Air Indonesia and Ethiopian Airlines crashed in October 2018 and March 2019, respectively, killing 346 people.
This series of airliners was subsequently grounded worldwide, stopped production in January this year, and resumed production in May.
FAA Director Steve Dickson admitted in June that the FAA had "made a mistake" in regulating Boeing with regard to the 737MAX.

In the program, this group of outstanding young knowledge role models, as "knowledge sharing officers", will challenge the interesting knowledge classroom.
They need to impress the audience by having an attitude of knowledge output and showing the most interesting side of their subject.
The "Tao Question Group", composed of all-age viewers, will ask changing questions live, make the teaching of the "knowledge sharing officer" more difficult, and also add a little exciting atmosphere to the program.
It is revealed that the "knowledge sharing officers" include outstanding young teachers such as Li Yongle, a physics teacher at a middle school attached to Renmin University of China, Zhang Xuefeng, a famous teacher of research examination guidance, and Wang Lei, a history teacher with 10 years of experience, who will show the "hard core" knowledge of various disciplines to the live audience in an unexpected way.
In addition, the program also invited Xue Zhaofeng, a professor of economics, as the "knowledge initiator" of the program, to join "Ding Dong Teaching Assistant" Du Haitao and Jin Mengjia to talk about youth with the audience and create an "open class on youth for all".
Chief Secretary for Administration of the HKSAR Government: The situation is serious and we will fight the epidemic.
Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, July 26: The Chief Secretary for Administration of the HKSAR Government, Mr Matthew Cheung Kin-chung, said on July 26 that the situation of the new pneumonia epidemic in Hong Kong continues to be severe. If the epidemic worsens, the HKSAR Government will decisively take more stringent control measures, further restrict the operation of business premises and reduce the space for citizens to go out.
However, at this stage, the HKSAR Government has no intention of introducing a "stay-at-home order" or a "no-foot order" to restrict citizens from going out.
On the same day, Zhang Jianzong published a blog entitled "The situation is serious and make every effort to fight the epidemic".
He said the epidemic is the most severe in half a year, and the next two weeks will be critical to prevent further spread of the virus in the community.
In addition to the necessary measures taken by the HKSAR Government, public self-discipline and cooperation are also very important.
He urged the public to stay at home and reduce social contact and eating out.
Members of the public should cooperate with the mandatory measures to wear masks to protect themselves and others, pay attention to personal and environmental hygiene and wash hands frequently. They should also suspend non-essential gatherings or meals of relatives and friends and reduce them to markets.
He said that the Central Government had been very concerned about the evolution of the epidemic in Hong Kong and supported the anti-epidemic and anti-epidemic work of the HKSAR Government, and had responded positively to the Chief Executive's latest request to provide assistance in increasing testing capacity and retrofitting AsiaWorld-Expo for work similar to a "square cabin hospital".
Mr Cheung said the free virus testing provided by the HKSAR Government for specific high-risk groups, namely staff of residential care homes for the elderly, homes for persons with disabilities and nursing homes, restaurant staff, taxi drivers and property management staff, had been fully launched, involving up to 400,000 people.
He was very concerned about the cases of infection in residential care homes for the elderly. The HKSAR Government had arranged specific temporary quarantine centres for residents of residential care homes for the elderly.
He said that the HKSAR Government was constructing an isolation and quarantine facility near the Penny's Bay Quarantine Centre on Lantau Island in the New Territories. It was expected that an additional 700 isolation rooms would be provided by the end of September.
The Chief Executive also announced on the 19th that the HKSAR Government would build an additional 2,000 isolation rooms at the Penny's Bay Quarantine Centre and aim to complete them by the end of this year.
Together with the 800 isolation and quarantine rooms already in use, the Penny's Bay quarantine center is expected to provide a total of 3500 isolation rooms by the end of the year.
There are currently four isolation and quarantine centres in operation in Hong Kong, providing about 2,600 isolation rooms.
In addition, on the 24th, the HKSAR Government re-opened the Lei Yue Mun Park Holiday Village on Hong Kong Island as a community isolation facility for the treatment of patients under the age of 50 who are able to take care of themselves independently.
The "Nutrition Agent" of the Party History and New China History
2020-07-26 17: 37: 29 Source: People's Tribune Network Author: Zhu Yanjing Responsible Editor: Zhu Yanjing
Recently, during a visit to the Siping Battle Memorial Museum, General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed that "1.4 billion people and more than 90 million Party members, especially leading cadres at all levels, should learn the history of the Communist Party of China and the history of New China well."
Studying Party history and the history of New China conscientiously is a compulsory course for Party cadres not to forget their beginnings and remember their mission. They should draw rich nourishment from it, enrich their national feelings and take the long road to the new era.
A magnificent history of the Party and the history of New China records the hard struggle and glorious course of the Communist Party of China since its birth, and shows the belief and loyalty forged by the Communists with their lives and blood, and the original heart and mission that they will always adhere to.
History is the best textbook. For Party members and cadres, Party history and New China history are the most brilliant chapters in this textbook.
Every Party member cadre should constantly strengthen the historical thinking of learning from history and moving towards the future, based on the new mission of the new journey, take the "baton" of the times and take the long journey of the present generation.
Shape the soul with history and adhere to the original mission in the study of Party history and new China history.
Turning over the history of the Party and the history of New China is full of the Chinese Communists' immutable original mission and rock-solid belief, demonstrating the simple feeling that the Communists will always be with the people.
To understand the important events, important meetings and important figures in the history of the Party and New China in close proximity is not only an intuitive mind shock and ideological baptism, but also to read the connotation of the first heart belief from the depths of the soul, and to know the weight of the mission.
For Party members and cadres, if they want to continuously strengthen their original mission and always preserve their original advanced character, it is necessary to find the original point of our departure and the fulcrum of our initial heart from the history of the Party and the history of New China, maintain a clear understanding and a firm position, inspire the strength of fighting bravely for the country and the people, and ensure that the red rivers and mountains laid down by the forefathers of the revolution with blood and life are handed down from generation to generation.
Study history wisely and inherit the noble spirit in the study of Party history and new Chinese history.
Since the founding of the Communist Party of China, it has shaped a series of great spirits, such as the spirit of Red Ship, the spirit of Jinggangshan, the spirit of the Long March, the spirit of Yan'an, the spirit of the Anti-Japanese War, the spirit of Xibaobo, the spirit of "two bullets and one star" and the spirit of space.
These great spirits precipitated by history have provided strong spiritual inspiration for our Party to overcome various risks and challenges on the way forward, and are valuable spiritual wealth that cannot be defeated, scattered or robbed.
The process of studying Party history and Chinese history is a process of revisiting and shaping these spirits. We should consciously take the noble spirit of the forefathers of the revolution as a mirror, adhere to the spiritual home of the Communists, build a solid spiritual base for the promotion of great causes and the realization of great dreams, inherit and carry forward these spirits and radiate the light of the new times.
Read history and introspect, constantly correct and dispel evil spirits in the study of Party history and new China history.
For Party members and cadres, there has never been any period of history that can bring more profound warning, enlightenment and reference than the history of the Party and the history of New China.
In the history of the Party and the history of New China, we can see not only the great deeds of the older generation of revolutionaries who committed themselves to their faith and worked tirelessly to achieve the set goals, but also the profound lessons of certain figures who were shaken by their ideals and beliefs and walked to the opposite side of the revolution. They enlighten and warn us to never stagnate or slacken with firm determination and will, always maintain a full and tenacious spirit of struggle, constantly purify the Party spirit and discipline ourselves.
To truly become a firm believer and faithful practitioner of the lofty ideal of communism, it is necessary to brush away the "dust" of ideas and strictly prevent "dirt" from dyeing themselves. The history of the Party and the history of New China should be the basis for every Party member cadre to examine himself and warn himself.
Knowledge of history and motivation to take on the important tasks of the times in the study of Party history and new China history.
General Secretary Xi Jinping once pointed out: "Learning Party history and national history is a compulsory course to adhere to and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics and continue to push forward the various undertakings of the Party and the state."
Looking back at history and asking about the original heart in order to continue the glory and move towards the future.
Every Party member and cadre should take the study of Party history and new Chinese history as a lifelong pursuit, constantly correct the course of life in his study, courageously undertake the historical mission, dare to take responsibility and take the initiative in his respective posts.
We will continue to take the advanced deeds of the older generation of revolutionaries as a reference and guide, constantly polish the political essence of the Communists, maintain the attitude of struggle that only works day and night, and the spirit of struggle that is more difficult and more dangerous, and move forward, and write our own brilliant piece in the vast journey of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
"Putting on the Jiangnan" and Pursuing the Poetic "Dream of the Yellow River"
(China's Poverty Reduction Story) The Search for Poetic "Yellow River Dream"
China News Agency Yinchuan July 26 (Yang Di) "Jiuqu Yellow River thousands of miles of sand, the waves from the Tianya."
The Yellow River, which aroused the pride of countless literati Chizi Wanzhang, gave birth to the beautiful and rich Ningxia Plain. Now, Ningxia, which is known as "Putting on the Jiangnan", is adhering to the concept of "ecological priority and green development" and pursuing the poetic "Yellow River dream".
"Blue Wave Dream" of River Clear Water Show
"The world's Yellow River is rich in Ningxia", and the Yellow River flows 397 kilometers through Ningxia, which is the "mother river" of raising one side.
However, with the rapid advancement of industrialization and urbanization, the development, utilization, management and protection of rivers and lakes are unbalanced, and chaotic images such as exceeding the standards for sewage discharge, encircling lakes for land and encroaching on water areas have emerged, leading to the black odor of water bodies, exceeding the standards for water quality, environmental mess and ecological degradation.
Now, Ningxia is promoting the diverse restoration of water ecology and working hard to return the Xiuhe Qing of the Yellow River.
Treat water from the source.
In Yinchuan, Ningxia, the local method of "raising the bid + controlling pollution + strict management" was adopted, all sewage from industrial parks was centrally treated, all urban sewage treatment plants achieved Grade I A standard discharge, black and smelly water bodies were basically eliminated in urban built-up areas, and the third batch of Chinese black and smelly water demonstration cities was successfully declared.
In addition, Ningxia fully implemented the long-term river and lake system in 2017, and has now achieved full coverage of the five-level long-term river and lake responsibility system in districts, cities and counties and villages, and long river and lake patrols have become the norm.
Gu Jincheng, 64, who lives in a village on the edge of the Yellow River, witnessed the changes in the Yellow River: "The water used to have a bad smell, and the smell has disappeared after remediation."
Gu Jincheng said that the ecological environment is better and his life is more comfortable. Now he often walks along the Yellow River with his family to feel the clear water and blue sky.
The "Wetland Dream" of Sha Luoxiang Collection
Flying birds, green trees, trestle roads, clear water.. Fan Zhongyan wrote that the beautiful scenery of "sand and informative collection" has become a reality in the Yellow River Wetland Park in Yinchuan, Ningxia.
As the Yellow River flows through Ningxia, a variety of wetlands such as river wetlands, lake wetlands and swamp wetlands have been formed along the way, which plays an important role in promoting the rational utilization of water resources and water ecological balance, and has also become an important international migration channel for birds.
Since 2009, the relevant departments in Ningxia have invested a total of about RMB 3.45 billion in wetland protection projects. At present, the area of Yinchuan wetlands is 19.2 million hectares, with a wetland protection rate of 78.5 per cent. There are nearly 200 natural lakes and swamp wetlands, with five national wetland parks, one national urban wetland park, six autonomous region-level wetland parks and eight municipal parks.
Lu Jinhu, deputy director of the Yinchuan Wetland Protection Center, told reporters that wetland protection has increased biodiversity, which is particularly evident in birds. "The remaining gull is an endangered bird, with only more than 20,000 in the world, of which more than 2,000 live in the Yinchuan Wetland."
At the same time, Ningxia has demarcated the red line of the 500-meter zone for the protection area of wetlands on both sides of the Yinchuan section of the Yellow River in accordance with the law, stipulating that no unit or individual may carry out development, construction and business activities within the protection area except for public welfare projects.
Zhao Shaoyong, deputy director of the Yinchuan Water Conservancy Service Center, said that through the control of pollution sources, the comprehensive improvement of the ecology of rivers and lakes and the construction of end wetlands, the water quality of the nine main yellow drains in Ningxia has now reached 100% of the standards. "Now the water is also clear, the fish swim and the flowers bloom."
Pu Huimin's "Drinking Water Dream"
Ningxia Yinchuan City once had an "awkward" title: the only city along the Yellow River that "guards the Yellow River for water and drinking".
Since 2010, Yinchuan City has been faced with a persistent problem of water shortage at the peak of summer, and the "pain of water shortage" in the past decade has become a painful summer experience for many high-rise residents. However, with the fact that major water sources are at the limit of overmining and a large area of groundwater overmining funnel area has been formed underground in the city, the water shortage has become a difficult problem perplexing Yinchuan City.
Thanks to the improvement of the water quality of the Yellow River, drinking the purified Yellow River has become a good solution to the drinking water problem of local residents.
Ding Ming, Deputy Director of the Yinchuan Water Affairs Bureau, said that in order to improve the living and production water needs of urban and rural residents in Yinchuan, Ningxia launched the Yinchuan Metropolitan Area Urban and Rural Western Line Water Supply Project in a timely manner, replacing the original underground water source with high-quality Yellow River.
"On December 29, 2019, the water supply project officially opened water to the three districts of Yinchuan City, and in 2020, residents of Minning Town and Helan County also drank the Yellow River."
Ding Ming said the Yinchuan water conservancy department will give overall consideration to the transformation of the integration of regional rural drinking water and urban water supply. "As a next step, we will integrate all the decentralized rural water supply points into the Western Line water supply project, and it is expected that the integrated urban and rural water supply in Yinchuan region will basically be realized by the end of this year."
The departments responsible for compaction strengthen flood prevention and relief work
The departments responsible for compaction strengthened flood prevention and relief work
CCTV news (news broadcast): News from the Ministry of Water Resources, at 12: 00 today (July 25), the river below Wangjiaba in the main stream of the Huai River exceeded the warning level by 0.64 ~ 3.31 meters, and the river below Sand City in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the two lakes exceeded the warning level by 0.05 ~ 2.02 meters.
Taihu Lake has lasted for 28 days since it exceeded the warning level on June 28.
At 12: 00 today, the average water level of Taihu Lake was 4.67 meters, exceeding the guaranteed water level by 0.02 meters.
Today, after consultation and deliberation, the State General Administration of Flood Prevention decided to continue to maintain the second-level flood control response of the Yangtze and Huaihe rivers, requiring all localities to consolidate their responsibilities and further implement the work of flood prevention and relief.
Today, the State Prevention Office and the Ministry of Emergency Management urgently deployed specialized flood drainage vehicles from Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Fujian to help Jiangxi solve local problems such as internal waterlogging caused by heavy rainfall.
US launches first countervailing investigation against China for "undervalued RMB exchange rate"
In response to the recent announcement by the US Department of Commerce, it decided to launch an anti-dumping countervailing investigation against strap (strap) products from China, and launched an investigation into the "RMB exchange rate undervaluation" project.
China's Ministry of Commerce pointed out that this is the first time that the United States has filed a case to investigate the alleged "undervaluation of the RMB exchange rate" in a countervailing case, which China firmly opposes.
China's Ministry of Commerce issued a special press release in this regard on the evening of the 23rd, saying that China implements a managed floating exchange rate system based on market supply and demand and adjusted with reference to a basket of currencies, and that the market plays a decisive role in the formation of the exchange rate.
The press release stressed that, on the whole, the RMB exchange rate is at a reasonable equilibrium level and is not undervalued.
Since 2005, the RMB has appreciated cumulatively against the US dollar by more than 17%.
According to the data released by the Bank for International Settlements, from the beginning of 2005 to May 2020, the nominal effective exchange rate of the Renminbi appreciated by 38 per cent and the real effective exchange rate by 49 per cent, making it the strongest currency among the G-20 economies and one of the largest currencies in the world.
The Ministry of Commerce pointed out that the exchange rate issue exceeds the competence of members to conduct countervailing investigation in accordance with the rules of the World Trade Organization.
The United States, which amended its laws and regulations in February this year to conduct countervailing investigations against other countries' exchange rates, has been suspected of violating WTO rules and has been opposed by many parties.
The press release said that even in accordance with US regulations, the content of the applicant's complaint contained a large number of errors and did not have the necessary elements of countervailing, such as financial support, granting of benefits and exclusivity.
China urges the US to abide by existing international rules and stop countervailing investigations into the so-called "undervaluation of the RMB exchange rate."
Affected by the further rise in tensions between China and the United States, the offshore and onshore RMB exchange rates fell sharply against the US dollar on the 22nd, both falling below the RMB 7.0 mark against the US dollar.
It is worth noting whether the US Commerce Department's move is intended to force up the renminbi.
The spot exchange rate of RMB against the US dollar rose above the 7.0 mark on the 23rd to close at 6.9961.
The middle price of the officially regulated RMB-US dollar exchange rate was cut by 17 basis points on the 24th to 6.9938.
With the gradual improvement of the epidemic, the film and television industry, which has been silent for nearly half a year, has gradually returned to normal.
A few days ago, the organizing committee of the 26th Shanghai Television Festival announced the shortlist of the White Magnolia Award.
In terms of the best male and female actors, the solid Mesozoic actors have an absolute advantage. Lei Jiayin, Chen Baoguo, Zhang Ruoyi, Sun Honglei and Huang Lei will compete for the best actor, while Hai Qing, Mai Yi, Qin Hailu, Sun Li and Yan Ni will compete for the best actress.
The results will be officially announced on August 7.
At present, from the topic of the college entrance examination, the realistic educational television series "Little Joy", which describes "Chinese-style family", has won a total of six nominations for "Best Chinese Television Series", "Best Director", "Best Writer", "Best Actress" and "Best Supporting Actor / Actress".
The "Best Male and Female Lead Actor" award has always been one of the focuses of attention from the outside world, and the competition this year is also extremely fierce. The shortlisted male and female actors are all solid and good actors. Chen Baoguo, Huang Lei, Lei Jiayin, Sun Honglei and Zhang Ruoyi will compete for "Best Actor".
Chen Baoguo, Huang Lei and Sun Honglei are all highly qualified Mesozoic actors. 37-year-old Lei Jiayin is also a solid actor, while 32-year-old Zhang Ruoyi is the youngest finalist.
In 2016, the 34-year-old Hu Ge won the White Magnolia Award for Best Actor for "Lang Liang", becoming the youngest emperor in the award. If Zhang Ruoyi can beat several other predecessors this year, he will set this record.
The competition for the best actress was also finally decided in Hai Qing, Mai Yong, Qin Hailu, Sun Li and Yan Ni, the mainstay of the film and television industry, none of which was shortlisted.
It is worth mentioning that Sun Li was shortlisted for the role of "Home" Room Xijin, which is her sixth nomination for the award. She won "Best Actress" twice for "The True Story of the Hot Mother" in 2014 and "The Story of the Moon" in 2016.

Venezuela's foreign minister accuses US of fabricating lies to attack China unprovoked - Xinhua
Arreaza said that the United States government has recently exerted constant pressure on China in the political, diplomatic, economic and public opinion fields, which is a baseless attack on a sovereign state.
Arreaza retweeted a tweet posted by Chinese Ambassador to Venezuela Li Baorong on his personal account earlier that day and made the above comments.
Li Baorong said in a tweet that China strongly condemns the forced entry of the US into the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, which constitutes a serious violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and the China-US Consular Treaty, to which China will make a legitimate and necessary response.
Venezuelan Vice President Rodriguez, Vice Foreign Minister for North American Affairs Carlos Long and other government officials, prominent social figures and mainstream media journalists also retweeted Li Baorong's tweets, condemning the actions of the United States as a serious violation of international law.
On the 26th, the day before Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte delivered his fifth State of the Union Address (SONA), more than 80,000 new cases of pneumonia were confirmed in the Philippines, of which the number of cases confirmed by the Presidential Information Department (PCOO) and its staff increased to 25.
To this end, the PCOO has prepared a special working group that has not been in contact with the diagnosed staff to cooperate with the press release of President Duterte's SONA.
PCOO Minister Martin Anandar said in an interview with DZBB Radio on the 26th that two sets of plans have been prepared for President Duterte to publish the SONA approach.
According to Plan A, Duterte will deliver SONA on the afternoon of the 27th at the Philippine Congress (Batasang Pambansa) Building in Quezon City.
Due to the epidemic, only 50 seats were arranged for some government cabinet members and legislators, and a special video conference room was set up for other cabinet members, local government officials, etc.
All participants passed a rapid test on the same day to enter the Capitol.
Once one of the participants tests positive, Plan B is activated, whereby President Duterte delivers SONA at the Malakanan Palace of the Presidential Palace, and fewer seats are arranged for the hearing.
As is customary, SONA will broadcast live to the Philippines in real time.
At the time of writing, the Philippine presidential palace had not confirmed whether Duterte's family would attend SONA.
Andanal said President Duterte's SONA will highlight how the government will lead the Philippines in dealing with the new pneumonia epidemic and restoring socio-economic life. It will also refer to his commitment when he took office to fight government corruption, combat illicit drugs and reduce poverty.
Duterte will also describe his administration's other plans, including creating more jobs, reviving the economy, promoting education, and helping overseas Filipino workers suffering from the epidemic.
Yinchuan: Classified Policies to Support the Stabilization of Teachers in Kindergartens
Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, July 26 (Reporter Ai Fumei) As a result of the epidemic, kindergartens in Yinchuan City, Ningxia, have not yet reopened, especially the increased financial pressure on private kindergartens, which has had a certain impact on the stability and sustainable development of kindergarten teachers in the future.
In response to this, Yinchuan City has taken a number of measures, such as pre-allocating subsidy funds to inclusive private kindergartens, providing job stabilization subsidies to non-inclusive private kindergartens, and reducing and reducing the rent of private kindergartens, to support these kindergartens in stabilizing the number of teachers.
According to the relevant policies of Yinchuan City, if, during the epidemic period, the organizers of inclusive private kindergartens (including those that have been transformed into inclusive kindergartens after the management of supporting kindergartens in urban districts) pay not less than 1,660 yuan per person per month to the basic living expenses of teaching staff and staff with reference to the minimum wage standard of the three districts, the municipal financial administration will pre-allocate six-month subsidy funds in accordance with the standard of 1,000 yuan per year per student of inclusive private kindergartens to cover teachers' salaries and social insurance costs.
For non-inclusive private kindergartens that also pay not less than 1,660 yuan per month to each of the teaching staff and staff for basic living expenses, Yinchuan City will arrange six-month subsidy funds as job stabilization subsidy funds for preschool teachers in accordance with the average subsidy standard of 500 yuan per student per year.
At the same time, for private kindergartens that rent houses operated by state-owned assets, Yinchuan City will reduce and reduce the housing rent for three months during the epidemic prevention and control period, and encourage developers and other rental subjects to assume social responsibility, reduce and reduce the rent of kindergartens for more than three months, and reduce and reduce the relevant taxes and taxes in accordance with the policy.
The formation of the No. 3 flood of 2020 of the Yangtze River by the Ministry of Water Resources to elaborate and concretize the response measures
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26, by wire (reporter Hu Lu) On July 26, the Yangtze River Flood No. 3 of 2020 formed.
When presiding over the meeting on the 26th, Minister of Water Resources Huo Jingping requested that the Three Gorges Reservoir be carefully dispatched, that incoming water from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and Dongting Lake be considered in a coordinated manner, that staggered peak scheduling be implemented, that sufficient storage capacity be left to prepare for possible major floods, and that the flood control safety of the central and downstream main flow and the important dikes of Dongting Lake be ensured.
It is predicted that there will be heavy to heavy rain in parts of eastern southwest China, southern Jianghuai, western northern Jiangnan, eastern Hubei and central Guangxi in the next three days, including heavy rain in northern Hunan and southwestern Jiangsu, and moderate to heavy rain in central and western North China, including heavy rain in central Hebei.
The Ministry of Water Resources predicts that, as a result of the impact, the reservoir flow of the Three Gorges Reservoir in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River may reach about 60,000 cubic meters per second after 28 days. The water level in the middle reaches of the main stream of the Lotus Tong River and Dongting Lake will rise again and exceed the guarantee by about 0.20 meters. The water level in the middle reaches of the Huai River will generally slow down and the water level in Hongze Lake will continue to rise slowly.
Wu Jingping suggested that the Huaihe River basin should further strengthen the flood discharge, reduce the water level of Hongze Lake as soon as possible, and prepare to face the possible major flood.
We should fully do a good job in the response to rainstorms and floods in the Yilu Surabaya system.
He said that the Taihu Lake basin should not relent and continue to increase flood discharge, reduce the water level of Taihu Lake and the surrounding river network as soon as possible, and reduce the risk of high water level of Taihu Lake and typhoons.
In addition, he stressed that floods in northern regions such as Inner Mongolia and Hebei rise and fall sharply, the early warning time is short, it is easy to cause flash flood and debris flow disasters, and it is difficult to defend against them. There are many small and medium-sized reservoirs and silt dams, and there are safety hidden dangers.
More than 10 listed companies involved in the exposure of 58 APPs infringing on users' rights and interests - China New Net
The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology informed that, in accordance with the Network Security Law, the Regulations on Telecommunications and the Provisions on the Protection of Personal Information of Telecommunications and Internet Users and other laws and regulations, third-party detection agencies have recently been organized to inspect mobile phone applications and urge enterprises with problems to make corrections.
The 58 APPs have problems, including private collection of personal information, overcollection of personal information, frequent application for permissions, excessive request for permissions, difficult account cancellation, private sharing to third parties, denial of permissions, etc.
The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology requires that the implementation of the rectification of the 58 APPs should be completed by July 30. If the rectification is not made within the time limit, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology will organize the relevant disposal work in accordance with the rules and regulations.
It was found that behind the 58 APPs announced, more than a dozen US, Hong Kong and A-share listed companies were involved.
For example, "Fudo" is a product of Fudo, a US-listed company. There are five major problems: collecting personal information privately, collecting personal information beyond the scope, sharing it privately to third parties, forcing users to use targeted push function, and frequently applying for permission.
According to public information, Fangdo was listed on Nasdaq in November 2019 and is "the first real estate intermediary company in China with the industrial Internet SaaS (software service) model", providing online solutions for many intermediary businesses.
In response to the "Go Where" APP account cancellation problem pointed out in the circular, according to the Beijing News, Go Where responded that in order to prevent black producers from taking advantage of frequent registration and cancellation for profit, Go Where has been registered and cancelled at an interval of one month on the basis of independent cancellation.
Taking into account the convenience of write-off and account security, it has been changed to write-off with immediate effect and is currently awaiting review.
A network security expert, who did not want to be named, told a client that the Ministry of Industry Information and Communications had issued three APP notices this year.
Among them, there are three problems: private collection of personal information, excessive request for permission and difficult account cancellation.
From the circular, it can also be found that more and more attention has been paid to the invasion of privacy by APP.
On July 24, the day of the announcement of 58 APPs infringing on users' rights and interests, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said that it had issued a notice to carry out in-depth special remedial actions to promote the infringement of users' rights and interests by APPs.
The special improvement will strengthen supervision and inspection in accordance with the rules, urge relevant enterprises to strengthen the protection of APP personal information, correct and eliminate outstanding problems such as illegal collection and use of user personal information, harassment of users, deception and misleading of users, and inadequate implementation of the management responsibility of the application distribution platform in order to purify the APP application space.
Lewis family: John Lewis was "fighting for the weakest"
Congressman and civil rights fighter John Lewis was remembered at his memorial service on Saturday (July 25) as a fighter who "fought for the weakest".
Lewis' public memorial service began Saturday in Alabama.
There were two memorial services on the first day.
At a public memorial service Saturday at Troy University in Alabama, Lewis' five siblings and a nephew spoke of him as a loving, fearless, family-oriented man.
"He devoted his life to helping others," Lewis' youngest brother, Henry "Grant" Lewis, said at the meeting.
Samuel Lewis said his mother had warned John "not to get into trouble, not to get into trouble."
He added that John did not heed his mother's warning, saying, "We all know that John is always going to get into trouble, always getting into trouble, but that's because he insists on the right thing, which is a good trouble."
Lewis's brothers and sisters reminded people at the memorial service that John's most famous argument was to make "good trouble", that is, to avoid provoking trouble as long as it is for the sake of justice.
John had applied to Troy University, his birthplace in Troy, Alabama, but Troy University, then an all-white school, rejected his application.
John Lewis, who preached to chickens on his farm as a child, eventually earned a degree in religion and philosophy from Fisk University.
Years later, Troy University awarded Lewis an honorary doctorate.
Senator Doug Jones of Alabama said the current protesters are "peacefully, nonviolently protesting" as Lewis did during the civil rights movement.
Jones said: "Even if President Trump immediately turned a boat over and described all the protesters as thugs, he was wrong.
The protesters are patriots who want America to move towards a more equal country.
A six-day series of events in memory of Lewis will culminate this week with a funeral in Georgia.
Lewis' coffin was parked Saturday at a public memorial at Troy University, where people came to pay tribute to the civil rights pioneer.
Later Saturday, a private ceremony paid tribute to him in a chapel in Selma, Alabama, followed by a public memorial.
On Sunday, Lewis' body will pass over the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma.
It was in front of the bridge in 1965 that he and black voting rights protesters were beaten and tear-gassed by Alabama state police.
Lewis was almost killed.
This day became known as Bloody Sunday.
Lewis' body will be transported to Montgomery, the capital of Alabama.
Mayor Steven Reed encouraged people to line up on the sidewalk for the final walk with Lewis.
At the same time, officials require the public to wear masks and maintain social distancing when participating in events.
Alabama Governor Kay Ivey ordered flags to be flown at half-staff on Saturday and Sunday in honor of Lewis.
During the nearly week-long commemoration, Lewis' body will be briefly placed at the Alabama State Capitol in Montgomery, the Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta, and the United States Capitol in Washington.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced last week that people could come to the U.S. Capitol on Monday and Tuesday to pay their respects to Lewis.
Due to the coronavirus epidemic, a public memorial to Lewis will be held outdoors.

Pay attention to practical exercise, in the process of solving key and difficult problems in the field of governance at the grass-roots level, solve the troubles and troubles of the masses, and hone the Party's character and ability.
Grasp to improve the norms and build battle forts.
The grass-roots Party organization is not only an important part of the grass-roots governance system, but also an important carrier of governance ability.
In promoting the standardization construction of grass-roots Party organizations, it is necessary to start with the regulations on the work of Party branches, focus on issues such as the weakening and falsification of the leadership of Party organizations, and strengthen the foundation, make up the shortboard and promote development by establishing a joint mechanism up and down, innovating the form of setting up branches, normalizing the weak and weak rectification, establishing and improving the decision-making and deliberative mechanism and serving the masses.
In rural areas, we will strengthen the standardized construction of Party organizations at the village level, standardize organizational forms, study activities and management mechanisms in accordance with the standardized construction standards of Party branches, and effectively promote the detailed implementation of systems such as the "Three Sessions and One Course" and thematic Party day activities.
In cities, we pay attention to street communities, explore innovative forms of branch setting, focus on weak areas, "blocking points" and "pain points", and actively build urban Party construction alliances so that the Party's work can be effectively covered.
At the same time, we will establish and improve the governance system and mechanism of grass-roots governance, improve the decision-making and deliberative mechanism led by major events, practical matters, matters to be decided together, urgent matters to be discussed together, difficult matters to be solved together, and grass-roots Party organizations to improve the mechanism of Party members and cadres to contact and serve the masses, gather the hearts and minds of the people in serving the people, enhance the sense of acquisition, happiness, honor and pride of Party members, and make governance at the grass-roots level more warm.

"Community whistleblowing and Party members reporting" activities should be widely carried out to enable Party members to play a role in community governance by participating in thematic Party Day activities, contacting people in need, determining service projects, claiming small wishes and making reasonable suggestions.
We should give full play to the role of rural non-official Party members, and guide the vast majority of grass-roots Party members to take an active part in poverty eradication, ecological construction, maintaining the stability of letters and visits, and prohibiting the burning of straw to better integrate the red forces and serve the people by setting up vanguard posts for non-official Party members and forming task forces for non-official Party members.

Kochai Xili Tibetan antelope enters migration season
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, July 25, by wire (reporter Wang Jinjin) The reporter learned from the Wudaoliang Protection Station of the Kokoxili Management Office of the Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration, Changjiang Yuan Park, that monitoring showed that the Tibetan antelope that had previously migrated to the Zhonai Lake area in the hinterland of Kokoxili to give birth to their offspring were gradually ending their calves and began to return to their original habitat with their young.
Surveillance footage near the Wudaoliang Protection Station shows that on July 25, about 40 female Tibetan antelope led three Tibetan antelope cubs through 3002 km of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway and the Wudaoliang North Bridge of the Qinghai-Tibet Railway. The Tibetan antelope has begun to move back.
According to expert analysis, in recent years, the number of Tibetan antelope young in returning sheep accounts for a quarter to a fifth of the total number of Tibetan antelope herds.
"In the early stage of remigration, the Tibetan antelope faces a higher risk of being preyed upon, so the number of young in the sheep will be relatively small, and there may even be no young," said Lien Xinming, an associate researcher at the Northwest Plateau Institute of Biology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
According to the statistics of the Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration, the number of Tibetan antelope relocating is generally increasing year by year. In 2019, the number of Tibetan antelope relocating was 4,860, 338 more than in 2018.
"The return migration of Tibetan antelope this year is expected to end in early September, and the number of returning Tibetan antelope is still expected to continue to increase," Lien said.
The Tibetan antelope is a nationally protected animal.
At the end of May every year, Tibetan antelopes from Sanjiangyuan in Qinghai, Qiangtang in Tibet and Aljinshan in Xinjiang go to Zhonai Lake, located in the hinterland of Kokoxili, to give birth.
Wu Xiaomin, a Chinese expert on Tibetan antelope protection and researcher at the Shaanxi Provincial Institute of Zoology (Northwest Institute of Endangered Animals), said: "The return migration of Tibetan antelope is a process in which female Tibetan antelope return to their habitat with their young after giving birth. At first, the return group leaving the breeding site is relatively large, but then the Tibetan antelope will return to their respective habitat along different paths according to different geographical populations."
In order to ensure the safe return of Tibetan antelope groups, the reporter learned that the management office of the Changjiang Source Park of the Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration has arranged for staff to continuously carry out video monitoring and district patrols in the main return areas.
If a herd of Tibetan antelope is found trying to cross the road, the mountain patrol team will carry out temporary traffic control at the first time to allow the sheep to pass safely through the wildlife passage and ensure that they are subject to as little human interference as possible during their return migration.
So, how to relieve the heat in daily life after all?
Experts suggest that when going out in summer, it is best not to walk or work in the hot sun around noon, because the sun is strongest during this time, the likelihood of heatstroke is higher.
If you have to go out at this time, you must do a good job of protection, such as playing a sunshade, wearing a sunshade hat, wearing sunglasses, the best conditions to apply sunscreen to prevent sunburn.
Clothes as far as possible choose light color, good breathability of cotton, hemp, silk texture, wear less chemical fiber clothing, so as to avoid a lot of sweating can not dissipate heat in time, causing heatstroke.
In hot and sultry weather, be prepared to drink plenty of water, drink it in time, do not wait for thirst to drink water, because once you feel thirsty, the body is already short of water, drink water from 150 ml to 200 ml at a time, drink warm water, do not drink ice water.
Depending on the temperature, general staff drink 1.5 to 2 liters of water per day, while high-temperature workers drink 3 to 5 liters of water per day.
When sweating more, you can properly supplement some salt water to make up for the salt lost by sweating.
In addition, the human body is prone to lack of potassium in summer, making people feel tired and tired. Potassium-containing tea is an excellent summer drink.
In summer, eat more fruits and vegetables with high water content, such as lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, etc. Fresh fruits, such as peaches, apricots, watermelons and melons, with 80% to 90% water content, can be used to supplement water. Dairy products can both replenish water and meet the nutritional needs of the body.
In addition, people working in a high-temperature environment should properly supplement drinks containing potassium, magnesium and other elements.
Summer days and nights are short, the temperature is high, the human body metabolism is exuberant, the consumption is also large, easy to feel tired.
Sufficient sleep can relax the brain and all systems of the body, which is not only conducive to work and study, but also a measure to prevent heatstroke.
Experts said that the best bedtime is 22 to 23, and the best time to get up is 5: 30 to 6: 30.
When sleeping, pay attention not to lie under the air-conditioning outlet and electric fan to avoid air-conditioning disease and hot cold.
Experts suggest that people who are engaged in outdoor activities or high-temperature work can take heat prevention drugs such as 10 drops of water, human hair, patchouli Zhengqi water or patchouli Zhengqi pills with them, or put them in the nearby workplace to be used at any time to prevent heatstroke.
Graduates' art exhibition moves into shopping mall public welfare exhibition - Xinhua
In the "cloud graduation" season of major colleges, a rare offline graduate art exhibition opened warm last weekend.
However, it is neither in the art gallery nor on campus, but in the public space of Dayue City in Chaoyang, which is open to the public free of charge and will last until August 23.
The reporter learned that the art exhibition of 2020 graduates collected 50 works / groups of 57 young artists from the Central Academy of Fine Arts, the Communication University of China and the Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts. The exhibition space was extended from 2 to 6 floors, and made full use of the light box in the building for the display of graphic works to maximize the artistic atmosphere of the graduation season.
The significance of this exhibition is particularly special under the epidemic.
Ge Ping, head of Chaoyang Dayue Chengmei Chen, said: "We choose to bring the graduation exhibition to the 'cloud end' back to the offline space again. We also hope to let more people see young people's exploration of themselves and their understanding of the world, and to amplify the healing power of art to society and the soul."
She revealed that the works participating in the exhibition were solicited from the graduates of several major art colleges and selected those suitable for commercial space display. The forms of the works range from traditional shelf painting and sculpture to new media devices, interactive animation and VR panorama, with the highest volume and richness in years.
Among them, in "The First Battle of 2020", Li Yunshao expressed his feelings in the epidemic through a mixture of mechanical and manual creative language; Liu Jiaying's work "Sound Money", created through Ethereum blockchain, discusses themes such as "cryptocurrency", "credit creation" and "transaction"; Zhang Jiaqi's "Cat Forest" and Qiu Daqiang's "Bohemian" show animals that often accompany humans, in which young artists can see their understanding of the relationship between people and animals; and Zhu Zhongyu's work "Winter of Faith - Gift" reminds young people growing up, "When you have a successful career one day, remember that simplicity and sincerity."
Among the few graduates who personally arranged the exhibition was Li Jingyin from the Department of Sculpture of Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts.
"I came to Beijing on July 7, when I was actually a little worried about the epidemic. I also did a nucleic acid test three days in advance. I came to the exhibition with alcohol cotton and the test report."
His work "Yesterday as a Mystery" has a complex structure and must be done in person.
At the same time, he also undertook the task of helping his classmates repair damaged works.
"The cloth was displayed until 4: 30 a.m., then it was repaired. The time was very tight, and I forgot to take a picture with the work, which was also a bit regrettable."
He hopes that when the epidemic is more stable, he and his classmates will come to Beijing to see the exhibition of his works.

Reward 50,000 Yuan Hubei for "First Person of Early Warning" for Sand Dam Landslide
Hubei Daily News (reporter Lin Jing) On July 26, the city of Enshi commended Chen Guangming, the geological disaster site monitor who had made an important contribution to the early warning of sand dam landslide, and sent him a prize of 50,000 yuan.
At the same time, Party members and cadres throughout the city are called upon to learn from his spirit of dedication, courage, initiative and dedication.
On July 21, a landslide occurred at the sand dam in Ma Village, Tunburg Township, Enshi City, leading to the formation of a barrier lake in the main channel of the Qingjiang River. Chen Guangming, 58, was the first person to warn of the landslide.
On the afternoon of July 17, Chen Guangming learned of the cracked walls of the villagers' homes and immediately went to the scene to inspect them.
As soon as he walked out of his home, he saw the village road split four or five centimeters, extending along the road to the cornfield, about 50 meters long.
Chen Guangming Tang Sheng alert, the first time to send the photos of the road cracking to the township "geological disaster monitor contact group."

The new drug developed by the University of Australia is expected to be used to treat the blockage of blood vessels caused by the new crown.
Xinhua News Agency Sydney, July 26 (Reporter Chen Yu) Researchers at Monash University in Australia are developing a new drug to help prevent heart disease and stroke and hope it can be used to treat blood vessel blockages caused by the new crown virus.
The researchers found that an enzyme in platelets accelerates platelet clotting before a heart attack or stroke.
As a result, they developed a drug that temporarily inhibits platelet clotting, thereby avoiding clogging blood vessels and preventing heart disease and stroke.
The researchers said the drug only inhibits the clotting effect of platelets when there are signs of a heart attack or stroke.
Since studies have shown that similar vascular blockages are one of the leading causes of death in severely ill patients, the researchers hope the drug can be used to treat such patients in the future.
At present, the drug has achieved good results in animal model experiments, and the researchers are ready to conduct human clinical trials in the next stage.
The research results have been published in the American journal Science and Transformative Medicine.
He became the first spectator to enter the CBA league to allow spectators to watch live after the game.
On the same day, during the second stage of the resumption of the Chinese Men's Professional Basketball League (CBA) of the 2019-2020 season (Laoshan Competition Area) held in Qingdao, Shandong Province, medical staff, teachers and members of the public security front entered the field after completing the relevant procedures, including nucleic acid testing, through the official ticket purchase platform to watch the match between the Shanghai Jiuzhi team and the Shandong Xiwang team.
During the viewing period, spectators are required to wear masks throughout the course, sit opposite numbers and strictly maintain one-meter intervals.
When exiting, the audience must exit in order to maintain the "one-meter line" social distance according to the order from back to front, first to two sides and then to the middle.
Good Clean Energy for Deep Cultivation of "Sunflower Field" in Xinjiang
2020-07-26 15: 43: 42 Source: China News Network Author: Chen Haifeng Responsible Editor: Chen Haifeng
China News Agency, July 26, Hami, Xinjiang: Use good clean energy for deep cultivation of "sunflower fields" in Xinjiang
More than 6,000 pentagonal sunsetting mirrors, each 48 square meters, are arranged neatly in a circle, such as a silver "sunflower field", which rotates with the sun and reflects sunlight to the central 200-meter-high heat-absorbing tower to generate electricity.
The reporter saw this scene on the 25th at the Hami molten salt tower photothermal power station of the China Electric Power Project in the town of Maohu, Ywu County, Hami City, Xinjiang.
"The so-called molten salt tower photothermal power generation is to reflect sunlight centrally through the mirror to the heat absorbing tower to form heat, and then convert heat into electricity through traditional power generation technology."
Zhang Yong, deputy general manager of CLP Hami Solar Thermal Power Generation Co., Ltd. introduced that the design principle is similar to that of the solar cookers used in rural areas in northwest China, which should concentrate sunlight.
Construction of the power plant began in October 2017 and was connected to the grid at the end of last year, covering an area of 6,600 acres, with a total plan to install 14,500 sunsetting mirrors.
"The biggest advantage over traditional solar power generation technology is that it can store the accumulated heat and generate electricity at night."
Zhang Yong said that the 13-hour heat storage system deployed in the project can enable the generator sets to maintain continuous and stable operation, not affected by light changes, and can also quickly participate in the peak adjustment of the grid according to the peak and valley demand of the grid load.
After its complete completion, the project will generate 198 million degrees of electricity per year, save more than 60,000 tons of standard coal per year, reduce emissions of more than 60 tons of sulphur dioxide, more than 60 tons of nitrogen oxides, about 20 tons of soot and more than 150,000 tons of carbon dioxide, and provide a continuous supply of clean energy to the local area.
In addition, there is another silver "sunflower field" in the Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park in Hami City.
The Hamifuguang Solar Photovoltaic Power Station covers an area of more than 2,300 acres. The 714 power generation equipment built also follows the rotation of the sun, always maintaining a right angle between the sun and the concentrated plate surface of 90 degrees.
"We use two-axis tracking concentrated power generation technology. Through unified integrated control, all power generation equipment will adjust the angle according to the height of the sun to maintain the power generation efficiency."
Duan Mengqi, the station director of the power station, said that under good light weather conditions, the power generation technology can improve the efficiency of photovoltaic power generation by about 20% compared with traditional photovoltaic power generation.
In the first half of this year, the power station has generated more than 7 million degrees of electricity, supplementing the local demand for electricity.
Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park is currently the largest single-scale photovoltaic industrial demonstration park with the most complete types of photovoltaic components in Xinjiang, with a total of 38 photovoltaic power generation projects with a total installed capacity of 820,000 kilowatts.
The amount of electricity generated in the first half of this year exceeded 110 million degrees, an increase of 6% over the same period in 2019.
Hami is one of the regions with the best solar energy resources in China.
The average annual total solar radiation is more than 6,200 megajoules per square meter, and the annual sunshine hours are about 3,200 hours.
In recent years, the city has vigorously developed the photovoltaic industry and planted "sunflower fields".
More than 2.5 million kilowatts of solar power have been installed, and the city's photovoltaic power generation in the first half of this year exceeded 1.4 billion degrees, an increase of about 14 per cent over the previous year.
At present, more than 330 grid-connected photovoltaic power stations in Xinjiang have an installed capacity of more than 10 million kilowatts.
The total amount of photovoltaic power generation is expected to reach 15 billion degrees this year, which can replace more than 6 million tons of standard coal.
Police report details of "missing female university students traveling to Qinghai" search and rescue work continues - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, July 26, by wire (reporter Wang Jin Jin Zhou) Recently, "a female college student lost contact after traveling to Germ in Qinghai" attracted the attention of netizens.
The Public Security Bureau of Germu City, Hainan Mongolian Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, informed on the 26th that Huang Mou, a student at a university in Nanjing, is still in the state of disconnection, and many police are actively looking for work along the lost area of Huang Mo.
On July 10, 2020, the Public Security Detachment of the Public Security Bureau of Haiyangermu City received notification from its superiors that Huang Mou, a student of a Nanjing university, took the Z164 train from Nanjing to Germu on July 5, and on July 9, his mobile phone was turned off and lost contact at the southwest area of Qingshuihe Protection Station in Quemalai County, Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, requesting assistance in locating him.
According to the investigation of the Germ City Public Security Bureau, Huang entered the territory of Qinghai Province at 19: 54 on July 6, and arrived in Germ City at 4: 00 on July 7.
At 8: 00 on the same day, the missing person, Huang Mou, took a taxi from the Yellow River Hotel in Germ City to the G109 National Highway, and at 12: 00 he arrived at the Ke Xili Sonandajie Protection Station. The taxi driver returned alone, and Huang Mou went to the Qingshui River area near the Sonandajie Protection Station at 15: 00 on the 7th until his plane was shut down in the area at about 18: 00 on the 9th.
In further investigation, the police found that Huang had passed through the Naigou checkpoint at 17: 07 on July 13.
Naigou Checkpoint is a checkpoint set up by Naqu City of the Tibet Autonomous Region in the South Pass of Germ City. Since there is no video surveillance at the checkpoint, it is impossible to determine the information of myself and the vehicle in which I am travelling. The police can only drive along the way to search, and coordinate with the checkpoints along the way in Tibet. If Huang is found, immediately contact the Germ City Public Security Bureau.
According to the latest situation, at 1 a.m. on July 26, the Germ City Public Security Bureau organized rescue forces to carry rescue equipment to the Unfrozen Spring Protection Station and the Sonam Dajie Protection Station along the Qinghai-Tibet Highway to conduct a search, and actively contacted the Sichuan Police, the Tibet Police and the Nanjing Police to carry out joint work. At present, the search and rescue work is still continuing.
The local police hope that if the vast number of netizens and all sectors of society have relevant clues, they will provide them to the Germ police and the Jiangning police in Nanjing in a timely manner, so as to try to find the lost member Huang Mou and Mou as soon as possible.
At the same time, relevant experts suggest that tourists should be standardized, rational and civilized in outdoor activities, pay attention to roadside warning signs at all times, do not venture into no man's land, encounter unexpected situations, call the police in time.
American media has uncovered the truth about the US unprovoked demand for China to close its Consulate General in Houston.

The American media uncovered the truth about the US unprovoked demand that China close its Consulate General in Houston
On the 24th, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the US Embassy in China that China had decided to revoke the permission for the establishment and operation of the US Consulate General in Chengdu, and made a specific request for the Consulate General to stop all business and activities, as a countermeasure to the US sudden request for China to close the Consulate General in Houston on the 21st.
This act of the US government has attracted much attention, and its political motivation has been questioned by the foreign media and scholars.
Why ask China to close the Consulate General?
Several foreign media said it was not clear why the United States would select the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, but for the purpose of the move, the foreign media said bluntly: for the election.
CNN (CNN) reported on the 23rd that the US demanded that China close its Consulate General in Houston, prompting the public to question its political motives.
The article said that the US government's disastrous response to the new epidemic resulted in President Trump's low poll approval rating before the election.
White House officials privately say the tough approach to China is intended to save Trump's approval ratings and to deflect responsibility for the White House's failure to respond to the pandemic.
The article argued that the Chinese Consulate General in Houston was a "politically driven and very cautious" target chosen by the United States, and that the US government chose it "to create a tough attitude while avoiding the risk of causing a major conflict".
The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) agreed that, as the US election season approaches and the US economy is severely hit by the pandemic, Trump believes that "playing the 'China card' has a political advantage".
The current situation is "a spiraling and tit-for-tat struggle", which is partly driven by the US government from the perspective of domestic considerations, and will only exacerbate the tension between China and the United States.
CBS (CBS) reported that Trump's re-election prospects are under pressure due to the outbreak, which he has repeatedly blamed on China.
Almost every day, the United States takes new action against Trump's absurd claim that "China exploits the United States".
"The Consulate General of Houston is very important in establishing contacts between the two countries."
The Associated Press commented that the US demand that China close its consulate-general in Houston has exacerbated tensions between the world's two largest economies.
In addition to the diplomatic implications of the closure of the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, Chinese citizens in the southern United States face difficulties in obtaining consular services, as do American citizens seeking visas and other services.
A Houston business group expressed regret that the United States had asked China to close its Consulate General in Houston, saying the Consulate General had played an important role in establishing trade, investment and cultural ties between the two countries.
The Associated Press believes this reflects the importance of China's economy.
The website of the US magazine Foreign Policy said the US move was "part of a series of provocative measures that will only worsen US-China relations."
Reuters quoted Jonathan Pollack, an expert on East Asia at the Brookings Institution, a US think tank, as saying that since the US and China established full diplomatic relations in 1979, he could think of no action comparable to the US action against the Chinese Consulate General in Houston.
The Hong Kong South China Morning Post reported that the US move is unprecedented in more than 40 years of diplomatic relations between China and the United States.
Analysts believe the move could cause lasting damage.
Established in 1979, the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is the first Chinese Consulate General to be opened in the United States.
At present, China has one embassy and five consulates general in the United States.

Direct recruitment of non-commissioned officers will be fully launched in 2020
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26 (Reporter Jia Qilong) The Political Work Department of the Military Commission and the National Defense Mobilization Department of the Military Commission recently jointly issued a notice to start the direct recruitment of non-commissioned officers from graduates of ordinary institutions of higher learning in 2020.
The direct recruitment of non-commissioned officers this year covers more than 270 general military and local specialties in 64 categories, such as computers, automation and machinery, with emphasis on increasing the recruitment of specialties such as drones, navigation, aerospace, electronic information and small languages, with an increase of nearly 2,000 compared with last year.
This year, the direct recruitment of non-commissioned officers was organized and implemented in parallel with the recruitment of conscripts, which began on August 1 and ended on September 30.
Young conscripts can check the conditions for direct recruitment of non-commissioned officers and the distribution of local recruitment specialties through the National Conscription Network (http: / / www.gfbzb.gov.cn), submit online registration information if they meet the professional scope and recruitment conditions, and participate in follow-up recruitment work such as medical examination and political examination in accordance with the uniform requirements of the military service organs of the places where they are recruited.
Qualified young people who cannot be recruited as non-commissioned officers due to the professional and planned restrictions on recruitment may participate in the conscription of conscripts. When they are selected as non-commissioned officers at the end of their compulsory military service, the number of years of study in the prescribed academic system of ordinary institutions of higher learning shall be treated as the length of military service.
This year, the recruitment of non-commissioned officers will be uniformly organized by the conscription offices of the people's governments at the provincial or municipal levels. The majors with rich registration potential will be selected on the basis of merit on the basis of a comprehensive measurement of the educational level of the applicants, the achievements of professional courses during the school period, and the acquisition of vocational qualification certificates. The scarce majors will be directed to local institutions that meet the professional requirements and have recruitment advantages.
In accordance with the requirements of normalizing epidemic prevention and control, this year's direct recruitment of non-commissioned officers will not, in principle, arrange for their own reporting, and will organize transportation into the camp at the same time as conscripts.
The time for direct recruitment of non-commissioned officers into the army will start from September 1, 2020, and the time for the army to issue the order for the appointment of non-commissioned officers will be December 1, 2020.
The receiving units of the armed forces will formulate plans for enlistment and professional training scientifically and carefully organize the delivery of training. After the completion of the training, the recruited non-commissioned officers will be uniformly and accurately assigned to the corresponding professional and technical posts in accordance with the principle of professional matching and uniform recruitment.
A spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in the UK: The Chinese Government is a staunch defender of cybersecurity.
China News Network, July 26: According to the website of the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom answered questions on the wrong remarks about the cyber attack on July 25.
The spokesman stressed that the Chinese Government is a staunch defender of cybersecurity and has always resolutely opposed and combated any form of cyberattacks and cybercrime.
A reporter asked: According to the media, hacker groups related to China have interfered with the network system of a British company, launched an attack on Anglo-American technology companies with patent data, and invaded the government networks of European Union countries.
The spokesman said that the Chinese Government is a staunch defender of cybersecurity and has always resolutely opposed and combated any form of cyberattacks and cybercrime.
Cyberspace has strong virtuality, difficult traceability and diverse actors. When investigating and characterizing cyberincidents, sufficient evidence should be produced, and there should be no unfounded speculation.
The spokesman said that a series of incidents such as "Prism Gate" in the past proved that the United States has been conducting the largest network theft operation in the world.
Maintaining peace and stability in cyberspace is in the common interest of all countries.
The spokesman pointed out that China's achievements in science, technology and innovation were not stolen or stolen, but achieved through self-reliance and hard work.
In 2019, China submitted about 59,000 patent applications through the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), with an annual growth rate of 10.6 per cent, making it the country with the largest number of international patent applications.
China has become a big country in innovation and intellectual property.
Data from the Urumqi Central Branch of the People's Bank of China show that in the first half of the year, the increase in new loans for agriculture-related and small and micro enterprises in Xinjiang exceeded the increase for the whole of 2019.
In the first half of this year, the Urumqi Central Sub-branch of the People's Bank of China used a variety of monetary policy tools to guide the banking sector to continuously increase its loan investment, and provided sufficient funds for epidemic prevention and control and the resumption of work and production.
Most free nucleic acid testing areas in Urumqi have basically completed secondary testing in high-risk areas.
Urumqi, July 26 (reporter Sun Tingwen Zhao Yarmin) Zhang Wei, director of the Urumqi Municipal Health Commission, said on July 26 that the work of free nucleic acid testing in Urumqi has been basically completed in most districts of the city.
The expert group of the State Council and experts from the autonomous region and the city of Urumqi are further evaluating the development of the epidemic based on the results of nucleic acid testing and epidemiological investigation.
The Press Office of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region held a press conference on the 26th to report on the epidemic and prevention and control in Xinjiang.
According to him, from 00: 00 to 24: 00 on July 25, there were 22 new confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia in Urumqi (of which 5 were transferred to confirmed cases by asymptomatic infected persons) and 38 new asymptomatic infected persons.
As of 24: 00 on July 25, there were 135 confirmed cases and 147 asymptomatic infections in Urumqi.
The new asymptomatic infected people on the 25th were also basically through the city's free nucleic acid testing and active screening.
Zhang Wei, director of the Urumqi Municipal Health Commission, said on the 26th that most of the free nucleic acid testing in Urumqi had been basically completed.
He also said that from the experience of other parts of China, there are many factors that affect the results of nucleic acid testing, such as the sensitivity of the testing reagent, the time of infection and detoxification of the tested person, the cooperation of the tested person when the specimen was taken (the poor cooperation may lead to the specimen not being taken in place), the testing environment and the operational proficiency of the inspectors.
For various reasons, nucleic acid tests can also produce false negative results.
The so-called false negative means that the person tested is indeed infected, but the nucleic acid test result is negative.
In addition, for people who have had close contact with confirmed and suspected cases, two nucleic acid tests are usually needed to exclude them.
For people who have been to high-risk areas in the epidemic, if fever and respiratory symptoms occur, one negative nucleic acid test may be false negative, so two nucleic acid tests are also needed to exclude.
He said that, in view of the above situation, and for the sake of the health of the people of the whole city, from today, the city of Urumqi will conduct second free nucleic acid tests in key areas such as Tianshan District and Shaybak District, while carrying out "residue detection and leak filling".
It is reported that Tianshan District and Shaybak District are high risk areas.

As the first international film and television festival to be held since the global epidemic continued to spread and China's epidemic prevention and control became normal, this year's Shanghai International Film Festival is of great significance.
On the basis of doing a good job in normalizing the work of epidemic prevention and control, holding the Shanghai International Film and Television Festival is not only a sign of confidence, but also a declaration of determination - our confidence and determination to overcome the epidemic will remain unchanged, our confidence and determination to run the people's festival well will remain unchanged, and our confidence and determination to build a global film and television creation center and launch the "Shanghai Culture" brand will remain unchanged.
Every year's Shanghai International Film Festival, with continuous innovation and progress, is a fresh start.
Therefore, it is necessary to take every step to serve the spiritual life of the people and the high-quality development of the film and television industry.
This is particularly true this year.
In order to cherish the hard-won situation of epidemic prevention and control, the Shanghai International Film Festival, on the one hand, strictly abides by the requirements of epidemic prevention and control and details the implementation of epidemic prevention and control measures. On the other hand, with the vision of gathering wisdom for Chinese film creation and meeting the needs of film fans, the Shanghai International Film Festival opened multi-plate activities online and offline.
On the opening day, the related activities of the film festival strictly implemented the relevant epidemic prevention policies, from offline viewing to industry forums.
Forum activities are limited to 50 people, and attendance is strictly limited to 30%.
As the film festival organizing committee maintains, in any case, "putting the people's lives and health first" is the main premise.
Offline activities have been greatly streamlined, and "on the cloud" has been lively.
In order to implement the important concept of "the people's city is built by the people, the people's city is for the people", and as a festival for the people, this year's Shanghai International Film Festival is innovative and seeking transformation, using measures such as online "cloud screening" and "cloud sharing" of master classes to meet the diverse needs of film fans.

White House epidemic expert Fauci: Cautiously optimistic that a vaccine will be developed by early 2021
Fauci said in an online video conference hosted by the International Leadership Foundation on the 25th.
He cautioned that it was not clear how the new epidemic would develop in the autumn and winter, nor what the ultimate impact of the epidemic would be, and that "the only way to end it is for each of us to choose to be part of the solution."
According to Johns Hopkins University, as of 21: 00 on May 25, the number of new confirmed cases in the United States had reached 4.176 million, with 146,000 deaths.
Fauci said some parts of the United States are now struggling with a rebound in the epidemic.
Although the epidemic is different from place to place and needs to be adapted to local conditions, the diversity of anti-epidemic strategies does not mean that there is no close link between regions.
An outbreak in one region will eventually affect others.
"This is not the time for complacency," Fauci said. "Our work is not done. We must step up our efforts and remain vigilant about the uncertainty of the future."
He Daichi, a Chinese-American medical expert and founder of "cocktail therapy" to treat AIDS, pointed out at the meeting that the new epidemic in the United States has not yet reached its peak.
"Each of us must do our part to slow the spread of this virus."
He called on the public to use their own practical actions to buy time for scientists to step up the development of new crown treatment drugs and vaccines.
The International Leadership Foundation is a non-profit organization that aims to promote international exchanges in the United States and the Asia-Pacific region. It is committed to enhancing the status of Asia-Pacific Americans and nurturing international young leaders.
On the same day, U.S. Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao, U.S. Representative Meng Zhaowen and International Leadership Foundation Founding President Dong Jiling spoke at the meeting.
They paid special tribute to the Asia-Pacific medical workers and volunteers on the front line of the fight against the epidemic, and called on the American public to continue to adhere to epidemic prevention guidelines such as "social distancing" to curb the spread of the epidemic.

Brazilian study shows that hydroxychloroquine is ineffective in the treatment of mild to moderate new crown pneumonia.
Recently, a Brazilian study showed that hydroxychloroquine was ineffective in patients with mild to moderate new crown pneumonia.
The study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
The Pakistani researchers divided 667 patients from 55 hospitals across the country into three groups and conducted clinical trials to compare the therapeutic effects of hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with other antibiotics azithromycin, and to analyze whether it helped to improve the condition of patients with mild and moderate new crown pneumonia.
The results show that hydroxychloroquine not only has no therapeutic effect, but may have damaging side effects on organs.
The study was carried out by several leading Brazilian hospitals such as Hospital Israeli Albert Einstein, Cardiology Hospital (HCor), Hospital Sírio-Libanês in Syria, in conjunction with the Brazilian Clinical Institute (BCRI) and the Brazilian Intensive Care Research Network (BRICnet).
On the 25th local time, Brazilian President Bolsonaro announced through social platforms that the fourth nucleic acid test result was negative.
During his infection, Bosonaro took hydroxychloroquine and actively promoted it several times.

On the 25th, the 2020 Hunan Red Tourism and Culture Festival and the first Xiangtan Red Cultural Industry Expo opened in Shaoshan.
In recent years, the demand for red tourism has gradually increased.
However, the development of the red tourism industry is also faced with difficulties such as the small number of young groups, the homogenization of tour projects and the single commercialization channel.
In particular, the epidemic hit this year, the national cultural and travel industry suffered a serious setback, and the red tourist attractions also faced serious challenges.
For example, the use of technological means such as drone photography and VR immersion experience can meet the tourist demand of "no one has arrived and the scenery has arrived"; the introduction of live webcasting means to promote the famous and special products of red scenic spots can directly enhance the economic benefits of red tourism; the introduction of "cloud" technology to create a display of fine products with prominent themes, clear guidance and rich connotation to fully display and enhance the educational function of red scenic spots; and the innovation of the dissemination of red culture to make revolutionary cultural relics "live", make red tourism popular, allow red genes to be passed on and enhance the attractiveness of red scenic spots.
The cultural festival uses the popular method of "county and city (district) chief + professional anchor special presentation" to introduce the special products of Red Culture Travel, and uses 5G technology to provide real-time scenery viewing and smart city demonstration services to promote the attractions of Red Culture Travel, all of which are an effort to insert the wings of wisdom for red tourism, and expect Hunan red tourism to become more and more popular.
Representatives of US-China Trade Talks to meet in August
Hong Kong's South China Morning Post on August 25 quoted an anonymous person familiar with the matter as reporting that the head of China's trade negotiation team, Vice Premier Liu He of the State Council, and the co-leader of the US team, Trade Representative Lai Haizhe, are expected to hold formal talks in August to assess the implementation of the China-US Phase 1 trade agreement.
The report said that although China has significantly increased its purchases of US agricultural products in the past few months, China's purchases are still some way from the amount promised in the trade agreement due to factors such as the new coronavirus epidemic.
Analysts say the recent closure of consulates between the United States and China, along with other disputes, could derail any progress on trade.
The China-US Phase I trade agreement will enter into force one month after it was signed on January 15. The agreement stipulates that the high-level trade framework group of the two sides shall hold talks every six months.
People familiar with the matter said the meeting would be "an important turning point", allowing the two sides to assess the progress of the agreement.
But the person also said that if the tension between the United States and China leads to a lack of willingness to talk at this time, the two sides may agree that the May 8 teleconference between Lai Haizhe and Liu He has met the terms of the semi-annual talks in the trade agreement.
Since this year, China-US relations have deteriorated rapidly, with disputes between the two sides including a series of issues such as the origin of the new crown virus, trade, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, the South China Sea and ideology.
While US President Donald Trump boasted about his achievements in the first phase of the agreement at the beginning of the year, his attitude has recently changed.
Although China has recently purchased a record amount of US corn in a single day and bought a lot of soybeans, "this trade agreement is less meaningful to me now than it was when it was reached," he said at a White House press conference on the 23rd.
An anonymous Beijing government adviser also said that a new round of trade negotiations is unlikely due to poor US-China relations and that "trade issues have lost weight in China-US relations".
However, he revealed that the relevant Chinese economic and trade units met on the 23rd to discuss a series of issues, including how to increase the volume of imports from the United States. "We have done our best to buy, so any additional purchases will be difficult."
Peng Jining, vice-president of the US-China National Committee on Trade, said it was "more important than ever" to maintain the momentum of the first-phase agreement, noting that China had made progress in further opening up its financial markets to US companies this year.
"It's better to talk than not talk, even though it may just be routine," said an analyst at Planum, an independent research firm.
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26 (reporter Wei Yukun) A reporter from the Ministry of Emergency Management learned from the Ministry of Emergency Management that the State Prevention Office and the Ministry of Emergency Management, together with the State Grain and Material Reserve Bureau, once again urgently transported to Anhui Province six categories of central reserve flood control materials, including 1.35 million woven bags, 1.2 million square metres of woven cloth and 130,000 square metres of geotextile, to support Anhui's flood relief and rescue work.
According to the relevant persons in charge of the Ministry of Emergency Management, at present, the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the Huaihe River basin maintain high water level fluctuations, and the "No. 3 Flood of 2020 of the Yangtze River" formed in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River on the 26th, increasing the risk in local areas.
Meteorological authorities expect heavy rainfall in Chongqing, Guizhou and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in the next three days, and the flood control situation is still severe and complex.
According to the report, since the beginning of the flood, the Ministry of Emergency Management has deployed national comprehensive fire and rescue teams to pre-position professional rescue forces in key flood prevention areas, participated in 10,364 anti-flood rescue and rescue cases of various kinds, deployed more than 130,000 soldiers, 17,778 fire engines and 1,1887 boats, rescued 37,777 people in distress and evacuated and transferred more than 107,000 people in distress.
Hao Yusheng, Chief Representative of NASDAQ China: Now is the best time point for Chinese companies to IPO in the US - Economic Observation - Professional Financial and Economic News Website
Economic Watch Network reporter Zhang Bin because of the Rui Luckin Coffee counterfeiting incident, the US market has implemented stricter supervision of Chinese stocks, combined with the long-term pressure on valuation, and the pressure on Chinese stocks listed in the United States, such as Netease, Jingdong and other Chinese stocks have recently begun their journey back to Hong Kong to list.
Recently, shell, ideal car and other companies have gone to the United States to list enthusiastically.
Under the epidemic and China's general stock crisis, is now the best time for Chinese enterprises to list in the US?
"As far as the recent IPO cases and the next companies to list in the US are concerned, the US IPO has not been affected in essence, but the market is now very good, and even now this point in time is the best point in time for Chinese companies to IPO in the US in the past 10 years."
Hao Yusheng, chief representative of the Nasdaq Stock Exchange in China, said at the "Stock Overview Chapter of the 2020 Listed Company Leaders Summit" hosted by Snowball.
In April this year, the US Securities Regulatory Commission (SEC) and the American Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) issued the Statement on the Important Role of Audit Quality and Regulatory Access to Audit and Other International Information - A Discussion on the Current Challenges of Information Access for US Listed Companies with a Large Business in China.
The statement said that despite the significant increase in international cooperation and coordination in recent years, there are still problems in obtaining information from US regulators, and the SEC and PCAOB still face legal and practical challenges. Correspondingly to the document, the PCAOB website details the list of listed companies that have encountered audit obstacles and their audit institutions, with a large number of medium-sized companies listed.
In addition, in May this year, the US Senate passed the Foreign Corporate Accountability Act, which introduced additional information disclosure requirements for foreign companies to list in the US.
In Hao Yusheng's view, the stock crisis did not affect the appetite of investors.
"When this news first came out, everyone was asking if they could go public in the United States in the future, but later we found out that these questions are not a matter for investors, investors may ask these questions during the recent US IPO roadshow, or even become standardized questions, but this has not been used by investors as an important factor in whether or not to invest in a Chinese company.
It is suggested that we try to take a normal view of the current situation.
Of course, this may appear to be the most serious situation in the past two years, but in terms of investor appetite, there has been no impact.
So the boom in US IPOs will continue from now until the end of this year or before the US election.
On May 9 this year, Jinshan Yun officially listed on the US Nasdaq, becoming the first Chinese company to IPO in the US after the epidemic.
"The listing of Jinshan Yun gives great confidence to Chinese companies preparing for an IPO."
Hao Yusheng said.
According to the mid-term stock summary data report for the first half of 2020 released by Snowball, a total of 20 Chinese enterprises went to the US to IPO in the first half of this year, an increase of 17.6% over the same period last year. In terms of the total initial capital raised, 20 enterprises raised a total of 2.725 billion yuan, an increase of more than 52.4% compared with the same period last year. In terms of industry distribution, the number of IPOs in the health care industry in the first half of this year was prominent, an increase of 100% over the same period last year.
According to Hao Yusheng, the Chinese companies that went to the United States to IPO in the first half of this year are of higher quality, and high-quality companies with strong fundamentals and growth will be more favored by investors.
In the short, medium and long term, Hao Yusheng continues to be optimistic about Ming China's IPO in the US.
"In the short term, the rush to IPO in the US will continue; in the medium term, Chinese companies will have more choices, with A-shares, Hong Kong stocks and US stocks, and the US election and China-US relations will be taken into account as market choices and timing factors. In the long term, everything will return to normal, market fluctuations are cyclical, both political and economic, and will eventually return to the normal stage, and the stock market has always been volatile."
Hao Yusheng also said, "There are more uncertain factors this year, but for high-quality companies, whether the market is good or bad, as long as they are solid and have the growth that investors can see, other factors are relatively secondary, investors need to invest in excellent Chinese companies."

Commentator of the People's Daily: Concentrate on Doing Your Business Well and Build New Advantages for Future Development--On Learning and Implementing the Important Speech by General Secretary Xi Jinping at the Symposium on Entrepreneurs - Xinhua Net
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 25, 2007, People's Daily, July 26, Commentator's article: Concentrate on doing your own business and build new advantages for future development
At present, the global epidemic and the world economic situation are still severe and complex, and the challenges facing China's development are unprecedented.
Maintaining strategic strength, enhancing confidence in victory and concentrating our efforts on doing our own business well are the key for us to meet various risks and challenges.
At the recent Symposium on Entrepreneurs, General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed that, in the current external environment of rising protectionism, the downturn of the world economy and the shrinking of the global market, we must concentrate our efforts on doing our own business, give full play to the advantages of the super-large domestic market, gradually form a new development pattern with the major domestic cycle as the main body and the mutual promotion of domestic and international cycles, raise the level of modernization of the industrial chain supply chain, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation, accelerate the resolution of key core technologies, and create new advantages for future development.
He who checks the situation is wise, he who is weak wins.
Under the external environment of deepening economic globalization, the market and resources have played an important role in China's rapid development.
Now, under the impact of the epidemic, the world is undergoing profound changes, facing more unstable and uncertain factors, and economic globalization is experiencing headwinds and waves.
A very important aspect is to take the expansion and satisfaction of domestic demand as the strategic basis for development, give full play to its own advantages, and add impetus to China's economic development by prospering the domestic economy and smoothing the domestic circulation.
We should deeply realize that the construction of a complete domestic demand system is related to China's long-term development and long-term stability.
The Party Central Committee reviewed the current situation and made it clear that it firmly implements the strategy of expanding domestic demand, which is the need to deal with the impact of the epidemic, to maintain the long-term sustainable and healthy development of China's economy and to meet the growing need of the people for a better life.
The advantage of large economies is that they are internally recyclable.
China has the most complete and largest industrial system in the world, strong production capacity and perfect supporting capabilities. It has more than 100 million market subjects and more than 170 million talents with higher education or various types of professional skills, as well as a super-large domestic demand market formed by a population of 1.4 billion, including more than 400 million middle-income groups. It is at the stage of rapid development of new industrialization, informatization, urbanization and agricultural modernization, with great potential for investment demand.
Public ownership is the main body, the economy of multiple forms of ownership develops together, distribution according to work is the main body and various modes of distribution coexist. The socialist market economic system and other basic socialist economic systems can not only stimulate the vitality of various market subjects, liberate and develop the social productive forces, but also promote the organic unity of efficiency and fairness and continuously realize common prosperity.
We should firmly grasp the strategic basis of expanding domestic demand, make all links of production, distribution and circulation rely more on the domestic market to achieve a virtuous circle, clarify the strategic direction of supply-side structural reform, and promote the dynamic balance between total supply and aggregate demand at a higher level.
We must accelerate the construction of a complete domestic demand system, vigorously promote scientific, technological and other innovation, accelerate the promotion of strategic new and emerging industries such as the digital economy, intelligent manufacturing, life health and new materials, form more new growth points and poles, and gradually form a new development pattern in which the domestic large cycle is the main body and the domestic and international dual cycles promote each other.
Opening up brings progress, and closure is bound to lag behind.
General Secretary Xi Jinping has repeatedly stressed that China's open door will not be closed, but will only get bigger and bigger.
Taking the big domestic circulation as the main body is not to operate behind closed doors, but to achieve stronger and more sustainable development by giving full play to the potential of domestic demand, making the domestic market and the international market better connected, and making better use of the two international and domestic markets and resources.
At the same time, expanding domestic demand and opening up are not contradictory. The smoother the domestic circulation, the more conducive to the construction of a new pattern of opening up and the more conducive to the formation of new advantages in participating in international cooperation and competition.
Although the trend of protectionist thought is now on the rise in the world, we should stand on the correct side of history, deepen reform, expand opening-up, strengthen opening-up and cooperation in the field of science and technology, promote the construction of an open world economy and promote the construction of a community of human destiny.
The Chinese nation has experienced many tribulations in its history, but has never been crushed, but has become more and more courageous, constantly growing up and rising from the tribulations.
On the road to progress, with the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, the remarkable advantages of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, the strong mobilization ability and strong comprehensive strength, and the united struggle of the whole Party, the whole army and the people of all ethnic groups in the country, we will surely be able to overcome all difficulties and obstacles, maintain the momentum of China's sound economic and social development, build a moderately well-off society in an all-round way, and successfully launch the new journey of building a modern socialist country in an all-round way!

Interestingly, "after 90" is more inclined to save from a "small amount of money", with 60% of the average amount of money saved below 20 yuan..
Saving money with balance treasure has also become the "after 90" saving habit.
The data show that of the 700 million balance treasure users, 134 million users are "after 90".
There are 174 million "post-90" in China, which means that about three out of every four "post-90" in the country are saving money with balance treasure.
At present, the 7-day annualized yield of the balance treasure fund has fallen to about 1.5% from above 2% at the beginning of the year.
Even so, it did not affect the pace of saving money after "90.
Under the background of the improvement of the "saving effect" of balance treasure, many young people who are used to using balance treasure have also been directly transformed into "basic people".
Alipay data shows that as of July 13, the number of new "people" on Alipay has more than doubled year-on-year in the past month, and more and more young people have realized "advanced" financial management on Alipay.
Some analysts believe that the inflow of funds from the balance treasure into the stock market is also an important reason for the clear decline in the share of the IMF in June.
The report also showed that "after 90", girls were more likely to save more money, on average 20% more than boys. Of the users holding funds on the Alipay platform, 60% were men, and women tended to choose a more robust way of managing money than men.
After saving money, what's the plan for "after 90"?
Alipay data shows that "after 90" has the habit of saving money for the goal, with the largest number of users taking travel as the goal of saving money.
Affected by the epidemic, many "post-90" people saved money to prepare for travel after the epidemic; the reopening of cinemas also provided a new way to switch from saving money to consumption.

Due to contact with an infected PCOO employee, on the 24th Andanal and 49 PCOO employees were tested for new crown pneumonia.
The report released on the 25th showed that 10 of the staff tested positive.
PCOO Deputy Minister for Administration and Legal Affairs Marvin Gatpayat said that the ministry, located in the new executive office building of the presidential palace, was scheduled to resume work on the day of President Duterte's fifth State of the Union address on the 27th.
On the same day, Martin Andanal assured the public that the PCOO would continue to fulfil its responsibilities to the Filipino people, ensuring that important information was provided to the public in a timely manner, while strengthening contact tracing and testing to avoid further spread of the new crown pneumonia virus among PCOO staff, and prayed for the speedy recovery of the staff who had tested positive.

France Increases Military Investment in Space - Xinhua
French Defense Minister Florence Parly said on the 24th that France will add hundreds of millions of euros to its space defense budget to develop its space military forces in order to guard against possible "unfriendly actions" by other countries in outer space.
On the same day, Parly told Le Provence that between 2019 and 2025, the expenditure budget for French military space projects will increase from the previously proposed 3.6 billion euros (about US $4.2 billion) to 4.3 billion euros (US $5 billion).
In accordance with the Act on French Military Planning 2019-2025, approved by the French Parliament in 2018, France is expected to upgrade its existing observation and communications satellites, launch three electromagnetic interception satellites and modernize its space surveillance radar.
French President Emmanuel Macron announced last July that a military space command and an "aviation and space force" would be established within the French Air Force.
Parley said she will officially announce the creation of the space force when she visits a military school in Salon, Provence, later this month.
Parley said the space force is part of the Air Force and will have a strength of 500 by 2025.
"The idea that space serves the common interests of science is gone forever. Today, space is a place where countries compete for global hegemony," she said.
Parly reiterated Macron's previous statement that France has no intention of provoking an arms race.
"We are by no means engaged in an arms race. But it is my responsibility to be fully aware of the threats we may face."
Palley recalled the surveillance of a military satellite shared by France and Italy in 2017.
She said the "sneak peek" was a Russian satellite.
The Russian side denied this claim.
Parly said France would "soon" have small patrol satellites capable of detecting and targeting "those behind unfriendly actions."
The French media believe that the reason why France seeks to establish a space force is due to the fact that US President Donald Trump asked the US Department of Defense to draft a bill to establish a Pacific Air Force last February.
Trump signed the National Defense Authorization Act last December, approving the establishment of the Pacific Air Force, the sixth US military force.
Some experts worry that these US measures have accelerated the pace of US space militarization and could trigger a new arms race in space.

Report says the shared accommodation market has picked up since March
According to the "China Shared Accommodation Development Report 2020" (hereinafter referred to as the "Report") recently released by the Sharing Economy Research Center of the National Information Center, the transaction volume of China's shared accommodation market decreased by 72.1% year-on-year in the first five months of 2020 due to the impact of the epidemic.
However, the shared accommodation market began to warm up since March, and the market turnover, order volume and reception number gradually recovered.
The Report shows that the volume of transactions in the shared accommodation market has declined significantly. On the one hand, due to the significant decline in the demand for travel and accommodation under the prevention and control of the epidemic, the number of orders decreased sharply, with the total number of orders falling by 65 per cent year-on-year and the number of receptions falling by 63 per cent year-on-year in the first five months. On the other hand, the weakness of demand also led to a more significant decrease in overnight prices, with the average overnight price falling by 16 per cent year-on-year in the first five months.
However, market turnover in March, April and May increased by 78%, 199% and 35% respectively; the number of orders increased by 141%, 152% and 50% respectively; and the number of receptions increased by 81%, 112% and 28% respectively.
The Report points out that the development of the shared accommodation industry has been promising for a long time, but there are still many uncertainties in the near future.
In this regard, Yu Fengxia, deputy director of the Sharing Economy Research Center of the National Information Center, told the Worker's Daily that the development of shared accommodation needs stronger policy support. On the one hand, it is necessary to do a good job in the implementation of the policies already issued in the previous period, further strengthen policy advocacy and coherence, and focus on creating a better business environment. On the other hand, it is also necessary to further strengthen policy guidance and support in terms of stimulating consumer demand, enriching the supply of tourism and accommodation services, innovating service methods and strengthening cooperation between the government and platform enterprises.

Xiamen, July 26 (Yang Fushan Zhang Shushan Xu Jingyi) China's famous vascular surgery center, Shanghai Changhai Hospital Vascular Surgery, Shanghai-Naval Military Medical University, signed a contract with Zhongshan Hospital Vascular Surgery, affiliated with Xiamen University, on July 25 to jointly set up a collaboration center to promote exchanges and cooperation between the two sides in the field of vascular surgery, especially aortic emergency and severe disease.
The Zhongshan Hospital, affiliated with Xiamen University, said that after the vascular surgery of the two hospitals formally formed a collaborative unit, it will conduct remote consultations, formulate treatment plans with real-time online consultations with Changhai Hospital, select and send talents for further training, and jointly carry out weekly surgical technical exchanges, teaching room inspections, etc. For complex cases, experts from Changhai can be invited to the hospital to perform operations according to the needs of the patients, thus realizing that patients in southwest Fujian Province can enjoy the country's top medical resources.
The two hospitals will also work together to carry out innovative surgical scientific research, popular science and early screening of aortic diseases, etc.
A special seminar on the aorta organized by the Beijing Health Promotion Association and hosted by the Zhongshan Hospital attached to Xiamen University was held in Xiamen on the same day.
At the same time, the two well-known hospitals in Shanghai and Xiamen held the signing ceremony of the vascular surgery collaboration center and announced the formation of collaborative units to jointly improve the treatment level of vascular surgery-related diseases in southwest Fujian.
Shanghai Changhai Hospital Vascular Surgery is the only Institute of Vascular Surgery in the Army and the only Clinical Medical Center for Vascular System Diseases in Shanghai. It is also the first national key discipline in vascular surgery. It has led the establishment of the Intraperitoneal Angiology Professional Committee of the Chinese Physicians Association, and is a top team with a deep history in the industry.
Professor Huang Xiaojin, Director of Vascular Surgery, Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University, gave an interview to the media.
Vascular surgery of Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University is the first independent subject of vascular surgery in Fujian Province. It has long been dedicated to the diagnosis and treatment of aortic and peripheral vascular diseases, and was approved to build a provincial key clinical specialty in 2018.
In the treatment of aortic diseases, in addition to the treatment of dissection aneurysms and aortic aneurysms, there is extensive experience in emergency ruptured aortic aneurysms.
"The history of vascular surgery in Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University and the breadth, difficulty and complexity of the operation are outstanding in the region, so this time we set up a collaboration center to carry out in-depth cooperation in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases such as lower extremity artery and carotid artery in addition to the aorta."
Professor Feng Rui, deputy director of vascular surgery at Shanghai Changhai Hospital, said.
Zhongshan Hospital affiliated with Xiamen University and Shanghai Changhai Hospital signed a contract to establish "Li Zhaoshen Famous Medical Studio" in digestive medicine in 2018.
Professor Huang Xiaojin, director of vascular surgery at the hospital, told CNN.com that the hospital also has a long history of exchanges with Changhai Hospital.
He said that the hospital will regularly invite Shanghai experts to the hospital to carry out surgical technical exchanges, teaching room visits, discussion of difficult cases, and further carry out remote consultations, which are currently planned to be held once a week. In addition, the department will also send personnel for further study exchanges to strengthen the training and development of the contingent of talents in the subject.
At the meeting, the reporter learned that vascular diseases are the leading cause of death in China. The aorta, as the main channel of all organs of the human body, flows from the heart to the whole body and plays an important role.
The occurrence of aortic diseases is often accompanied by high risk, high mortality and high difficulty of treatment. The thickest section of the aorta is up to 4 cm in diameter. Once a hemangioma is formed, there is a rupture, or the rupture of the intima produces a dissection, which will cause heavy bleeding and is very dangerous.
In recent years, with the change of people's lifestyle and the acceleration of the pace of life, China has become the largest country in the world with hypertension, and aortic diseases have increased. Today, with the development of surgical technology and industrial materials, the treatment of aortic diseases has continued to develop in the direction of minimally invasive, rapid and efficient.
Doctors can achieve good results by piercing the thigh and placing a stent in the aorta to properly "change the channel" of blood flow, thus avoiding the impact of an aneurysm or ruptured dissection, and some operations even require only local anesthesia.
More than a dozen domestic experts were invited to attend the seminar to discuss the new progress in the treatment of aortic diseases, and the cutting-edge technical training and discussion of difficult cases were carried out in the form of a conference salon.
At the meeting, the reporter learned that with the development of surgical technology and industrial materials, the treatment of aortic diseases continues to develop in the direction of minimally invasive, rapid and efficient.

This is also the second major production film to choose webcasting after "Mother".
"Journey", based on the online game of the same name, tells the story of Dongyi Long, a teenager from Qingyuan Village, and Chu Soul, a warrior of the Chujia Army, who embark on a journey to participate in the selection of the Grand Marshal of the State of Southern Zhao. On the way, they meet the little sister of King Kong, and the three work together to complete their mission.
This year is the 15th anniversary of the game "Journey" IP, and the launch of the film of the same name is undoubtedly a tribute to the classic game.

China News Network Chongqing July 26 (reporter Han Lu) The reporter learned from China Railway Chengdu Bureau Group Limited on July 26 that the 18.9-kilometer-long Zheng Wan High-Speed Rail Little Three Gorges Tunnel ran through the entire line on that day.
It is understood that the Little Three Gorges Tunnel is not only the longest high-speed rail tunnel in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, but also the longest single-hole two-line high-speed rail tunnel designed to reach a speed of 350 km / h in China.
Located in the three provinces and cities of Henan, Hubei and Chongqing, the Zheng Wan High-Speed Railway connects Beijing-Guangzhou and Xulan High-Speed Railway in Zhengzhou to the north, and the South-Lien-Yuwan High-Speed Railway in Wanzhou to Chongqing. It is an important part of the "eight-vertical and eight-horizontal" high-speed railway network in China.
The entire line of the Zheng Wan High-Speed Rail Xiao Three Gorges Tunnel opened on the 26th.
The picture shows the through site.
The Zheng Wan high-speed railway begins in Zhengzhou City, Henan Province, and runs southwest through Pingdingshan City, Nanyang City, Xiangyang City, Hubei Province, to Wanzhou District, Chongqing City. The new line is about 818 kilometers long, with a design speed of 350 kilometers per hour, and about 184 kilometers in Chongqing.
Among them, the Zhengzhou to Xiangyang section was first opened for operation on December 1, 2019, and the Chongqing section is stepping up its construction.
The Little Three Gorges Tunnel, which runs through the whole line on the 26th, is the full-line control project of Zheng Wan High-Speed Rail. The project is located at the border between Fengjie County and Wushan County in Chongqing. It is about 18.9 kilometers long and has a maximum burial depth of 890 meters.
Construction of the tunnel began in February 2017 and the entire line opened on July 26, 2020.
According to Wang Jun, who is in charge of high-speed railway tunnel design of Zheng Wan Engineering Group of China Railway Second Academy of Engineering, the survey and design party, the Xiao Three Gorges Tunnel is located in a very complex terrain and geological condition, facing the risks of karst, mud inrush water and large deformation of soft rock. It is a Grade I high-risk tunnel, and the tunnel design and construction are very difficult.
"In the course of the construction of the project, we used the methods of geological investigation, geophysical exploration and advanced drilling to advance geological prediction, and adopted special design plans for more than 30 caverns of various types. For example, a bridge with a length of 24 meters was designed and built, crossing a large cavern with a longitudinal length of more than 10 meters and a depth of more than 55 meters in the tunnel to avoid tunnel settlement," the Royal Army said.
According to the China Railway Tunnel Bureau, the construction party, the construction of the tunnel adopted the combination of diversion and blocking, through the construction of cross-hole leveling, grouting to block water, the strengthening of tunnel structural support and the construction of sewage treatment station, which not only ensured the orderly progress of the project, but also avoided the damage of the construction drainage to the water body in the Xiaotangxia Scenic Area. At the same time, it successfully overcome construction difficulties such as bad geology such as the large deformation of soft rock up to 7 kilometers long, and multi-inrush water with a maximum daily water inrush of 157,000 cubic meters.
After the completion and opening to traffic, the entire line of Zheng Wan high-speed railway will become a new convenient and fast passenger transport route from the southwest of China to the Central Plains, North China and Northeast China. It is of great significance to improve the capacity and quality of the northeast-to-northeast railway corridor in the southwest, improve the layout of the regional road network, accelerate the development of tourism resources and urbanization along the route, promote coordinated regional development and promote the implementation of the strategy for the development of the western region.
Experts say the collection of immigration data through the US census for the allocation of seats in the House of Representatives is unconstitutional
Some civil rights groups and several U.S. cities and counties have sued the federal government, saying the Trump administration's attempt to exclude undocumented immigrants from the U.S. census is unworkable and unconstitutional.
The U.S. Census will determine the distribution of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.
"This is not going to work," Sarah Brannon, executive attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, told VOA.
She went on to say that Trump's request to determine the citizenship of those surveyed in the census was difficult to do and "not very reliable."
Another civil liberties group, Common Cause, filed a lawsuit Thursday challenging Trump's executive order.
Several cities in New Jersey and Georgia joined the lawsuit.
Arlington County, Virginia, joined the lawsuit Friday.
"The United States Constitution requires an accurate count of our population every 10 years. We must accurately count everyone living in Arlington County and not allow this illegal attempt to scare people away and depopulate our immigrant community to succeed," said Garvey, chairman of the Arlington County Board of Management.
Other organizations and individuals praised President Trump's executive order.
Alabama Attorney General Marshall called the executive order a "victory" for the state.
"The allocation of seats in the House of Representatives and the Electoral College to each state must be based on the number of residents residing in the state and the number of residents legally residing," he said.
The U.S. Supreme Court last year blocked the Trump administration from including a citizenship question in the 2020 census form.
President Trump signed an executive order earlier this week directing Secretary of Commerce Ross of the U.S. Census Bureau to oversee the submission of census data on undocumented people so that the administration can exclude these undocumented people from state census figures in order to determine whether each state increases, decreases or maintains seats in the House of Representatives.
The United States redistributes seats in the House of Representatives every 10 years according to demographic changes.
Local Emergency Response to Flood Control in 33 Districts and Counties of Chongqing
Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, July 26 (reporters Ke Gaoyang, Li Song) The reporter learned from the Chongqing Flood Prevention and Drought Control Command that Chongqing has ushered in a new round of heavy rainfall weather process since July 25, with torrential rains in 33 districts and counties, and floods exceeding warning levels in four sub-small and medium-sized rivers, and the local emergency response at the flood control level has been launched.
According to the monitoring of the Chongqing Hydrological Monitoring Terminal, from 8: 00 p.m. on the 25th to 8: 00 p.m. on the 26th, heavy to heavy rainfall occurred in most parts of Chongqing, including 33 districts and counties, including Jiangjin, Luojiang and Wulong, including 16 districts and counties, including Wanzhou, Yunyang and Nanchuan.
The maximum daily rainfall was 197.5 mm in Longshan Village, Jinshan Town, Nanchuan.
Affected by the heavy rainfall, four sub-small and medium-sized rivers in Donkey Creek in Jiangjin District, Oil River in Yuling District, Yingyang River in Kaizhou District and Wutan River in Yunyang County experienced floods that exceeded the warning level, and the water level is still rising.
The heavy rainfall also caused a landslide in Liujing Village in Wulong District, causing the disruption of village road and road traffic, and the slippery body slid into the tributaries of the Wujiang River along the Canghe River, blocking the river to form a quake lake. The local area has urgently organized the transfer of people downstream.
In response to the heavy rain, the Chongqing Municipal Flood Prevention and Drought Control Command issued the Grade III early warning information for river floods at 13: 00 on the 26th, and launched the Grade III emergency response for flood control, requesting relevant districts, counties and units to strengthen inspection duties, mobilize emergency rescue teams and materials in a timely manner, and evacuate and transfer people in threatened areas.
Moving in Response to the Situation and Promoting the Construction of Industrial Projects - View Headline - Hunan Daily Network - Huasheng Online
In midsummer, heat waves hit Hunan.
However, the enthusiasm released by the promotion of on-site observation meetings in the construction of industrial projects throughout the province overcame the heat of Sanfu Day, and encouraged Sanxiang and Sishui with the clear guidance of "industrial comparative strength and project theory heroes".
The development of Hunan always depends on building projects and cultivating industries.
In the face of the very unusual first half of the year, under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee, with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, the whole province adhered to a game of chess, made every effort to fight the two hard battles of epidemic prevention and flood prevention, and took industrial projects as the "forehand" to implement the "Six Stability" and "Six Guarantees".
From a 1.9% year-on-year decline in GDP in the first quarter to a 1.3% year-on-year growth in the first half of the year, the difficulties and enormous efforts during the period are self-evident.
On this precious report card, the construction of industrial projects is the key support for Hunan's economic recovery and stable development.
The potential is smooth and irreversible.
The construction of industrial projects should be placed in the overall situation and be good at not only accumulating, accumulating and planning momentum, but also at recognizing change, seeking change and adapting to it.
Under the background of the current complex and severe international situation, in addition to the hard work of attracting business and attracting investment, it is necessary to calm down and study the new characteristics of the current new situation, better grasp the law, be more scientific and accurate, and better integrate into the new development pattern with the domestic great circulation as the main body and the domestic and international two cycles promoting each other.
Pay more attention to upgrading the basic capacity of industry.
In the first half of the year, a large number of heavyweight investment projects in new industries in our province not only broke ground and sowed hope, but also enterprises in traditional advantageous industries accelerated their deployment and fell in the transformation of digital, intelligent and green industries.
The Yiyang Aoshkang Third Science Park project revamped the existing production line, the high-end printed circuit board intelligent production line took the lead; the new factory area of Changde Cigarette Cigarette Factory in Hunan is committed to the process of intelligent transformation and the construction of modern factories, which is also a vivid reflection of the "new shoots of old trees"... Around the major national strategy and "two new and one heavy", efforts are made to consolidate and promote superior industries, actively cultivate and develop new industries, and comprehensively increase the strength of scientific and technological innovation and the substitution of domestic production.
Pay more attention to the cultivation and development of a new economy, a new business model.
The sudden new epidemic has brought about the popularity of the "cloud economy", stimulated the potential of the digital economy and provided a new opportunity for industrial transformation: in the first half of the year, the computer and office equipment manufacturing industry and the electronic and communication equipment manufacturing industry in our province grew by 12.6%, the online retail sales of wholesale and retail enterprises above the limit increased by 32.2% year-on-year, and the online meal fee income of catering enterprises increased by 35.6% year-on-year.
It is the general trend to cultivate new machines in the midst of the crisis, open new bureaux in the midst of the changes, actively promote digital industrialization and industrial digitization, and guide the integration and development of the digital economy and the real economy.
Pay more attention to optimizing and stabilizing the industrial chain supply chain.
Engineering machinery is the main force of Hunan industry, but two-thirds of the supporting enterprises are outside the province, and there is still space and potential in the supporting chain.
The project of strengthening the thinking and grasp of the industrial chain requires not only the continuous accumulation of leading enterprises to achieve technological breakthroughs in the key links of the industrial chain, but also the dedicated cultivation of local areas to stimulate the "chain" lock response by strengthening the chain to complement the chain, promote the coordinated layout of the relevant supporting industries, and accelerate the construction of an independent, controllable, safe and reliable industrial chain supply chain.
To overcome difficulties and support enterprises, Hunan remains a hot and happy land with a good business environment and emerging market business opportunities.
All parts of the province have made frequent offers, new offers and practical offers in the hope that the "burden reduction" of enterprise relief will lead to the "acceleration" of high-quality development; Shaoyang implements "shareholder-style" services, does business for enterprises without prevarication, implements policies without discount, and solves problems without overnight... In the process of recovering the losses caused by the epidemic, all kinds of "every effort" has been made to find the right pain points and achieve fresh stories that turn danger into opportunity.
Focusing on industry research, nurturing and developing industries, and firmly optimizing the business environment, will win the favor of more investors.
The wind and waves are still ahead, but the state of taking advantage of the wind and waves has become the norm for the construction of industrial projects up and down the province and promoting high-quality development.
During this critical period, we must learn and implement the spirit of a series of important instructions and instructions from General Secretary Xi Jinping, use the certainty of our own work to effectively address external uncertainties, persistently promote the construction of industrial projects, share enthusiasm and sweat, and ensure the successful conclusion of the 13th Five-Year Plan and the establishment of a moderately well-off society in an all-round way.

Cultivating New Business Mode and Opening New Employment Space
New forms of employment are constantly emerging, opening up new spaces for employment, and a number of innovative service policies have been introduced to help new forms of employment thrive.
According to the latest data from the National Bureau of Statistics, the unemployment rate in the national urban survey was 5.7 per cent in June, down 0.2 percentage points from May.
This is also the two consecutive declines in the unemployment rate in the national urban survey since April. Behind the monthly decline in the unemployment rate data is the new employment opportunities emerging from new business patterns.
Now the salary of more than 5,000 a month, coupled with the novelty of embracing information technology, has made Guo Mei more and more motivated.
In the innovation incubation base of Shanxi transformation and comprehensive reform demonstration area, there are more than 2300 data taggers.
Not only data taggers, but since this year, the State has also defined 25 occupations, such as nucleic acid testers and online learning service providers, as new occupations, developing vocational skills standards and launching skills training programmes to help the development of practitioners.
Aiming at the new way of employment and the new way of entrepreneurship, the state is also innovating employment services.
Recently, the National Development and Reform Commission and 13 other departments jointly issued the "Opinions on Supporting the Healthy Development of the New Business Model and Activating the Consumer Market to Promote the Expansion of Employment", so as to provide workers with diverse employment opportunities.
Multi-departments will jointly cultivate new individuals in the market and further reduce the cost of online entrepreneurship and employment for self-employed persons. Policies such as the protection of the rights and interests of flexible employment and social security will be introduced to provide greater security for new business operators.

The overall stability of employment and prices shows that there is a "temperature" in the economy

The overall stability of employment and prices shows that the economy has a "temperature"
Economic Daily China Economic Network reporter Lin Huan
In the first half of this year, in the face of the impact of the new crown pneumonia epidemic, China made overall efforts to promote epidemic prevention and control and economic and social development. The situation of epidemic prevention and control continued to improve, the steady economic recovery was evident, the performance of employment and prices, which are closely related to the people's livelihood, was generally stable, and the Chinese economy handed over a report card of warm economic operation.
In the first two months of this year, the surveyed unemployment rate rose.
In particular, in February, the production and operation activities of many enterprises were basically shut down and shut down, the demand for employment by enterprises was reduced, recruitment was delayed or cancelled, and the unemployment rate in urban surveys rose.
With the gradual improvement of the epidemic prevention and control situation, the order of production and life of the whole society has been continuously restored.
The Party Central Committee adheres to the general tone of seeking progress in stability, further strengthens the hedging of macroeconomic policies, comprehensively strengthens the priority employment policy, and actively promotes the work of assisting enterprises to stabilize jobs and expand employment.
China has increased its policy to hedge and stabilize jobs, played a policy combination of "relief, relief and slow return compensation", reduced and reduced the payment portion of three social insurance units in stages, allowed the postponement of the payment of social insurance premiums, expanded the benefits of unemployment insurance stabilization and job return for small and medium-sized and micro-enterprises, and provided absorption subsidies and internship subsidies to enterprises to absorb the employment of key groups.
With the detailed implementation of various stable employment policies, the demand for employment by enterprises has steadily recovered, the employment situation has gradually improved, and the urban survey unemployment rate has gradually declined. In June, the survey unemployment rate was 5.7 per cent.
Zhang Yi, Director of the Department of Population and Employment Statistics of the National Bureau of Statistics, said that in the second quarter, various employment policies continued to bear fruit, with the labor force that had withdrawn in the previous period due to the impact of the epidemic returning, and the urban labor force participation rate rose by about 10 percentage points in June compared with February, close to the level of the same period last year.
Data show that the total amount of urban employment in June increased by more than 19% compared with February, and most industries reached pre-epidemic levels; the average weekly working hours of employees in enterprises reached 46.8 hours, 6.6 hours higher than in February and 0.1 hours higher than in January.
Prices also concern thousands of families.
In January this year, the CPI rose 5.4% year-on-year, a multi-year high.
Entering February, the CPI year-on-year increase, although slightly reduced, is still in the "5 range."
The year-on-year increase in CPI is at a high level, not only the consumer demand-driven factors before the Spring Festival, but also the wrong month of the Spring Festival and the low year-on-year base factors.
However, the impact of the new pneumonia epidemic on prices is particularly evident.
Affected by the epidemic prevention and control, in January and February, all parts of the country experienced delays in logistics, untimely supply of materials and materials, and increased transport costs of materials, as well as hoarding and panic-buying by some citizens, resulting in a marked increase in the prices of some necessities of life.
In order to deal with the disturbance of the price situation caused by the prevention and control of the epidemic, the relevant departments have included important living materials in the emergency transport guarantee to ensure the smooth transportation of materials.
Under the influence of a series of policy measures, the market supply of vegetables, melons and fruits has been strongly guaranteed.
In response to the rapid rise in pork prices at the beginning of this year, after the Central Government introduced the policy of guaranteeing supply and stabilizing prices, all regions and departments quickly implemented it, the supply of pork reserves improved significantly, pig production capacity was restored in an orderly manner, and the order of production and marketing was gradually normal.
Since March, pork prices have fallen continuously, and the year-on-year increase in food prices fell to 10.6 per cent in May. In June, pork prices rose slightly on an annualized basis, influenced by factors such as the slowdown in the export of pigs, the reduction in the volume of imports and the rebound in group consumer demand.
The seasonal variation of fresh vegetable prices was obvious, with an average increase of 3.4% in the first half of the year.
Affected by the high comparative base in the same period last year, fresh fruit prices continued to decline year-on-year, with an average decrease of 13.3% in the first half of the year.
The basic livelihood of the people is effectively guaranteed, and the overall economic and social situation is stable and orderly.
With the gradual recovery of transportation and logistics, all places have increased the strength of guarantee and supply, and the market supply and demand situation has improved.
Beginning in March, the CPI ring-to-ring ratio declined for four consecutive months, and the year-on-year increase fell from 4.3 per cent in March to 2.5 per cent in June, and the overall price level returned to stability.
In the second half of the year, China's prices will continue to maintain a moderate level and the overall inflationary pressure will not be great, but we should still promote the restoration of the order of production and life on the premise of normalizing epidemic prevention and control.
We will effectively respond to natural disasters such as floods, droughts and other natural disasters in major producing areas of grain, fruits and vegetables, strengthen market supervision, and resolutely crack down on acts that disrupt market order such as hoarding and inflating prices.

Prince Harry finds his brother "snobbish and arrogant," new book reveals
The British newspaper The Times and the Sunday Times serialized a new book called Finding Freedom, which depicts the journey of the royal life of Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle.
But Reuters reported that Harry and Meghan had disassociated themselves from the book, saying they had not been interviewed by the author and had not provided any content.
The Sunday Times reported that the new book quoted sources as saying that when Harry and Meghan dated before their marriage, Prince William wanted to confirm whether Meghan, a former Hollywood actress, had ulterior motives for Harry.
According to the source, William told Harry at the time, "Don't feel the need to rush (to marry Meghan).
You can take the time to get to know the girl.
The report said that when Harry heard William use "this girl" to describe Meghan, he felt snobbish in his brother's tone and thought he no longer needed a reminder of care.
Harry and Meghan announced in January that they plan to live more independently and support themselves.

Qinghai-Hainan July 26 Telegram Question: "Flower Sea Direct Broadcast Room" by Qinghai Lake: "Sweet" Bring Goods to Help Farmers Increase Income
Author Hu Guilong Pan Yujie
"In the middle of summer, the Qinghai Lake is full of golden flowers and thousands of bees flying. There is a high altitude, large temperature difference between day and night and less air pollution. The intense light breeds the most tenacious and generous swarm of bees, creating the characteristics of high activity, high protein, high nutritional value, low sugar and low fat in Qinghai royal jelly."
On the 26th, Zhang Jianxun, deputy director of the Industry and Information Administration of Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Qinghai Province, said.
On the same day, the "Tongxin War Epidemic Spring Pulp to Help Farmers" live delivery event for bee products was held on the Qinghai Lake, and the China Bee Products Association, representatives of entrepreneurs, bee farmers and other parties gathered to introduce Qinghai characteristic bee products. A total of nearly 10,000 bottles of Qinghai Plateau royal jelly were sold online and offline, with a total delivery amount of nearly 3.8 million yuan.
The picture shows bee farmers demonstrating bee products.
It is reported that the live-streaming and delivery activity uses the Beijing Houde Gift Bee Industry chain network, fast hand, Taobao and other well-known domestic bee products retail enterprises, live streaming and e-commerce platforms to promote the exchange and cooperation of "enterprises + bee farmers + growers", and continues to issue "Qinghai Plateau spring pulp consumption vouchers" to consumers through online and offline channels, with an estimated total annual profit of nearly 5.28 million yuan.
In this regard, Yan Na, president of Beijing Houde Li Bee Industry Co., Ltd. thought it was "very worthwhile": "This move will expand the visibility of Qinghai bee products, attract more consumers to understand and like bee products without adding pure nature, and drive bee farmers to increase their income."
At present, the company has signed a production cooperation strategy agreement with Qinghai Yun Bee Industry Co. Ltd. and Qinghai Huabao Bee Industry Joint Stock Cooperation Company, hoping to jointly promote the rapid development of the local bee industry in Qinghai.
The picture shows the rapeseed sea along Qinghai Lake.
This spring, due to the need to set up road checkpoints for epidemic prevention and control, the way of bee farmers "chasing flowers for honey" was blocked. Many bees died due to missing the flowering period and lack of food, and the income of bee farmers was seriously affected.
"Throughout the year, bee farmers travel long distances following the flowering period, moving all the way north from Yunnan and Sichuan to the northwest. They live in the open, unsettled and very hard.
As businesses, we have a responsibility to help them.
Tina said.
"Small bees are 'environmental scouts', and bees in heavily polluted areas can't survive," said Zhao Xiaochuan, executive vice-president of the China Bee Products Association.
At the same time, honeybee pollination can improve crop yield and quality, especially in areas with widespread cultivation and poor management conditions, pollination is of greater significance.
Research data show that pollination can increase rapeseed production by about 15-30%.
The picture shows Zhao Xiaochuan (right), executive vice president of China Bee Products Association, introducing Qinghai bee products.
"The economic, ecological and social benefits created by bee pollination far exceed the value of bee products themselves. The bee industry has great potential in human health, crop production, vegetation reproduction and ecological protection, which has been poorly understood."
Zhao Xiaochuan said.
Today, the number of beekeepers is less and less. In addition to the perennial bee farmers, there are still many poor households with limited mobility who choose to share in cooperatives with beehives.
"The state has financial support, and we contact technical personnel to help guide. Bee farmers lack understanding and judgment of the market environment. To open a market, they also need the help and coordination of the government, enterprises and industry associations."
Zhao Xiaochuan said.
"I hope you will pay more attention to and help the beekeeping community in the future," she said. "Our bee products are also screened and controlled strictly in accordance with national standards, ensuring quality, and protecting the rights and interests of consumers while helping bee farmers."
Under the influence of continuous rainfall, since July 22, the soil on the back edge of the Zhongbao landslide in Liujing Village, Zhongtai Formation, Wulong District, Chongqing, has cracked, causing a large area of slip deformation, completely blocking along the Canghe River, forming a barrier with a water level of 13 meters in front of the dam and an estimated water capacity of about 550,000 cubic meters in the reservoir.
In order to ensure navigation safety, the maritime department of Chongqing decided to implement temporary traffic control from the boundary stone plate of the Yangtze River to Guanyin Beach.
According to the monitoring by the Chongqing Department of Meteorology and Hydrology, moderate to heavy rains have been common in the central, western and northeastern regions of Chongqing since the 25th, with heavy and locally heavy rains in some areas.
Luojiang Xiaohe Dam Station will have the highest water level on the night of the 26th, and the highest water level is close to the warning level.
In order to ensure navigation safety, the maritime department of Chongqing decided to implement temporary traffic control from the boundary stone plate of the Yangtze River to Guanyin Beach.
After an urgent meeting between the Chongqing Municipal Prevention Office and the departments and units of meteorology, water conservancy and hydrology, the Chongqing Flood Prevention and Drought Control Command decided to issue the Grade III early warning information of river floods and launch the Grade III emergency response to flood control.
The Chongqing Flood Prevention and Drought Control Command requests that the counties of Jiangbei, Shapingba, Hungnan, Wulong and other districts of Chongqing and the relevant member units of the Chongqing Prevention and Drought Control Index should pay high attention to the rainwater situation, especially the changes of the rising water of the Yangtze, Jialing and Wujiang Rivers, analyze and study in advance, issue early warning, strengthen inspection and duty, resolutely and decisively evacuate and transfer the people in threatened areas, mobilize emergency rescue teams and materials in a timely manner, deal with disasters (risks) quickly and efficiently, and avoid mass deaths and injuries.
Zheng Shixin, Minister Counsellor of the Vietnamese Embassy in Laos, the Vietnamese Buddhist Association in Laos, the Lao Vietnamese General Association, representatives of the Vientiane Provincial Government and the Lao Veterans Association participated in the laying ceremony.
The ceremony was held in a solemn atmosphere, with representatives offering incense to the heroes in memory of their great achievements and special ties of solidarity.
In his speech, Minister Counsellor Zheng Shixin said that this is an opportunity for the old Vietnamese and Lao people to jointly remember the revolutionary heroes of the two countries and jointly express their gratitude to the heroes who died for the independence and freedom of the two countries. It is also a good opportunity for the two peoples to recall that the two countries work together to fight the common enemy, strive for national independence, national reunification, jointly build national development and consolidate bilateral relations.
Seventy-four years ago, on January 23, 1946, 28 soldiers of the Lao-Vietnamese Combat Alliance died bravely while attacking the Phonehe position.
The victory of the attack became a historic victory for the two countries in the early stage of the revolutionary struggle for national liberation.
Ms. Zheng Shixin stressed that the two peoples will always remember all the heroes who died for the cause of the national liberation struggle of the two countries. At the same time, she stressed that the young areas of the two countries will continue to carry forward the heroic and strong tradition of their old predecessors and make due contributions to the continued blossoming and fruitful development of the relations between the two countries.

On July 26, the morning of Beijing time, traditional Serie A giants Inter Milan ushered in a landmark battle.
According to the Italian media, the away game against Genoa was the 3,000th Serie A game in the history of Inter Milan, and the Nerazzurri were the first team to unlock this milestone.
Since the restructuring of the league in 1929, Inter Milan is the only team that has never missed Serie A and the only team that has never been relegated.

Lukaku scored twice and substitute Sanchez also contributed a goal.
The game entered the rhythm of Inter from the beginning, and the strong attack finally turned into a goal in the 34th minute.
Biragi passed from the left and Lukaku wrapped up a header in the middle.
In the 82nd minute, Inter Milan did the same, Moses broke through on the right, Sánchez wrapped up and pushed in the middle; before the end of the game, Lukaku scored twice, in the counter-attack, Brozovic sent a long-distance straight stop, Lukaku burst into the penalty area and swung past Romero before pushing an empty goal to score, setting the score at 3: 0.

The statement said the drone crashed into Lebanese territory while the Israeli army was on a mission near the Blue Line on the border between Israel and Lebanon.
The statement did not mention the cause of the drone crash.
Israeli media reported that the drone may have broken down.
It is reported that Israeli Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Gantz said during a visit to northern Israel that afternoon that in order to ensure its security interests, Israel will continue to take action against Syria and Lebanon.
Israel has long regarded Hezbollah in Lebanon as a major security threat and accused Iran of sending weapons to Hezbollah through the Syrian land corridor. The situation near the Israeli-Lebanese border is sometimes tense.
Israel has repeatedly carried out air strikes against targets in Syria on the grounds of striking the group.
Liu Yunlong, the old face of spy drama, plays a stuttering hero.
Produced by Liu Yunlong, directed by Yin Fei and starring Liu Yunlong, Su Qing, Liang Guanhua, Li Liqun and others, the large-scale spy drama "Chance of Winning" landed on Guangdong Television's "Dynamic Theatre" at 7: 30 p.m. on July 16.
The play tells the story of Tang Fei (Liu Yunlong), an underground member of the Communist Party of China lurking in the Japanese fake police station, who joins forces with Soviet agents to assassinate the leader of Japanese agents and crush the shocking plot of the Japanese.
Chances of Winning is based on historical facts, and the material is taken from the dusty Soviet military archives for many years.
During the defense of Moscow, the elite of the Soviet Red Army in the Far East advanced westward to assist, at which time the "northward advance" of the Japanese Kanto Army thought it was an opportunity and intended to send troops.
In order to alleviate the danger of being exposed to the enemy, the Communist Party of China and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union jointly implemented the "Mudanula" project.
According to this historical background, the famous screenwriter Deng Yuan has polished several times, making the plot twists and turns to burn his brain.
Liu Yunlong served as both producer and lead actor in "Chance of Winning" this time.
In the play, he plays Tang Fei, the Chief of the Criminal Section of the Linhe Police Department, who is a very happy and even a little ruffian stuttering police officer, whose real identity is an underground member of the Communist Party of China.
The heroine, Cai Meng, who plays opposite him, is the head of the Linhe Security Bureau, who is deeply appreciated by the Japanese superior, Fuyuan, and has an ambiguous and delicate relationship with Tang Fei.
Su Qing has experimented with many different types of characters in recent years, from Lu Ruowen in "Those Years We Are Young" to Er Qing in "The Yanxi Strategy", which have impressed the audience and recognized her acting skills.
This time Su Qing and Liu Yunlong are partners for the first time. The stuttering sheriff with the charming policewoman set-up is quite interesting and innovative.
In addition to the two main characters, Liang Guanhua, Li Liqun, Qian Bo, Lei Han, Shen Junyi and other solid actors joined the cast in "Chances of Winning." The old drama is also one of the viewing points of the play.
It is understood that "Chance of Winning" is also very well produced, with the crew shooting nearly 2,000 kilometers across Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Liaoning provinces.
In order to restore the strange urban style of the period of Japanese rule in Northeast China, the props team of the production crew worked day and night to carefully polish every detail of the scene construction and props, so as to make the scene picture delicate and rich in historical texture.
Flooding in two provinces in western Yemen kills 16
Xinhua News Agency Kuwait City, July 26 (reporter Nie Yunpeng Wang Wei) Sana'a News: Local Yemeni media reported on July 26 that Hodeida and Hajjah provinces in western Yemen were hit by heavy rainfall, and floods have killed at least 16 people in the past 48 hours.

According to statistics from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, more than 1 million people have been infected with cholera in Yemen and more than 2,000 have died since 2017.
Yemeni medical institutions fear that continued flooding could lead to a renewed cholera epidemic.
"Strike of the Jedi" is a dream life in the boxing ring.
Directed by young director Gao Zhuangzhong, the online film "Strike of the Jedi" starring Liao William, Dongyu, Yang Xinyi, Wang Yibo and others was officially released at Aki Arts.
The film tells the story of fallen boxer Venus returning to the ring and fighting for dignity, and shows a hot-blooded and reckless dream journey.
The film "Strike of the Jedi" takes Thailand as the main plot and takes "Thai boxing" as the starting point for the fallen boxer Venus to pursue his dream. The whole story is based on the adaptation of traditional Chinese cultural values. Whether Venus decided to fight fake boxing for his master in the early stages, or the later efforts to reinvigorate the fight for dignity with the support of friends and lovers, all show the pursuit and great love of men for family and dreams in traditional Chinese culture.
Combining with the classic Hollywood sports film story mode and the strong joint efforts of the professional teams of China and Thailand, The Jedi Strike not only presents an international effect, but will also impress different types of viewers.
At the same time, "Jedi Strike" shows a lot of Thai boxing fighting and training plot, the scene is intense and hot-blooded.
In the film, the game designer Zhang Xiaoliang, played by Dongyu, helps Venus, played by William Liao, return to the ring and take off the crown through the fighting game, combining novel and interesting high-tech with the hot-blooded competitive competition, and also shows the brotherhood between Zhang Xiaoliang and Venus, which seems to be "different" and actually has the same goal.
In addition, the long-flowing love between Venus and Jingjing is also very touching. Jingjing's silent support for Venus and Venus's firm commitment to Jingjing let the audience see the "iron man's tenderness" on Venus, which also added a lot of human feelings to the down-and-out boxer.

Green Area Launches a New Round of Mixed Reform Proposed Transfer of 17.5% Shares by Shanghai State Investment - Economic Observation Network - Professional Financial and Economic News Website
Economic Watch Network reporter Rao Xianjun on July 26, Greenfield Holdings (600606.SH) issued the "Indicative Notice that state-owned shareholders intend to agree to transfer part of the company's shares and resume trading by means of public solicitation of the transferee".
The contents of the announcement show that, in order to further deepen the reform of state-owned enterprises, optimize the structural adjustment of state-owned enterprises and improve the ownership structure of green space, Shanghai Real Estate (Group) Co. Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Shanghai Real Estate") and Shanghai City Investment (Group) Co. Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Shanghai City Investment") intend to transfer some of the shares held by the transferee by agreement through public solicitation, and the total proportion of shares to be transferred shall not exceed 17.5% of the total share capital of green space.
The price of the proposed transfer of shares shall not be lower than the higher of the following: the arithmetic average of the daily weighted average price of the first 30 trading days of the indicative announcement date (July 27, 2020); and the audited net asset value per share of the company in the most recent fiscal year.
At present, there is still uncertainty about the new strategic investors in greenfield. According to the information published in the announcement, it is estimated that the new strategic investors need to pay about 14 billion yuan to take the 17.5% stake transferred in the mixed reform of greenfield.
It is worth noting that after the completion of the share transfer, it is expected that Greenfield still has no controlling shareholder and actual controller, but the control structure may change greatly.
Since its inception, Greenfield Holdings has carried out a number of institutional and institutional reforms: from 1992 to 1997, it operated in accordance with market-oriented rules under the purely state-owned system; from 1997 to 2013, it established and continuously improved the state-owned holding and employee-owned shareholding system; from 2013 to 2015, it introduced strategic investors to form a mixed ownership system in which state-owned and non-public capital are cross-held and integrated; and from 2015 to the present, it has been listed as a public company.
Greenfield's current reform plan is similar to that of Glee. In December 2019, Zhuhai Mingjun, led by Gaoyi Capital, took over a 15% stake in Glee Electric (000651.SZ) at a cost of 41.662 billion yuan, and Glee Group retired as a minority shareholder. After completing the reform, Glee Electric implemented modern enterprise management methods such as executive incentive plan and no real control structure.
Shanghai real estate and Shanghai city investment are all state-owned enterprise groups wholly owned by the Shanghai SASAC. Zhang Yuliang, chairman and president of Greenfield Holdings, said that the Greenfield move is an important measure for Shanghai to promote the comprehensive reform of state-owned enterprises and accelerate the reform of state-owned enterprises in the new phase, in accordance with the requirements of the Party Central Committee, and fully demonstrates the new ideas of reform adapted to local conditions and tailored to local conditions. By introducing new excellent strategic shareholders to listed companies, support enterprises to further improve the degree of marketization, enhance the freedom of operation and management, and accelerate the comprehensive release of reform vitality.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, July 25, by wire (reporter Li Ping) On July 25, at 12: 20 p.m., more than 200 Shanghai tourists who took the D771 train successfully arrived in Lanxi City, Zhejiang Province. This is also the first inter-provincial train since the Ministry of Culture and Tourism resumed inter-provincial (district and city) group travel on July 14.
The city of Lanxi, located in central and western Zhejiang, is beautiful and has many scenic spots such as Zhuge Eight Trigrams Village, underground Changhe Village and Zhiyan Ancient Village. During the two-day and one-night trip, more than 200 Shanghai tourists will experience these attractions one by one.
Li Li, deputy general manager of Shanghai Railway International Tourism (Group) Co., Ltd., said that according to the latest policy, the company paid close attention to the demand for cross-provincial travel, communicated and contacted the city of Lanxi for the first time, and carefully launched the products of "Shanghai to Lanxi" and "Summer Two-Day Tour with Enjoy", which sold out in less than a week.
Aunt Sun from Shanghai said she had not been out this year because of the epidemic.
"I was at home for a long time, as soon as I saw a group tour, I immediately shared the news to my friends to register together. I had never come to Lanxi before and was very looking forward to the trip," said Aunt Sun.
It is understood that in September last year, the city of Lanxi and Shanghai Railway International Tourism (Group) Co. Ltd. signed a strategic cooperation agreement on the project of "high-speed rail travel to Lanxi", planning to run 12 special high-speed rail tourism trains from four places in Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Shanghai and Anhui to Lanxi within a year.

US White House adviser "backbites" states back to work too soon
White House advisers "bite back" on states returning to work too soon
On July 23 local time, the number of confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia in the United States exceeded 4 million, accounting for 30% of the global cases.
For months, US President Donald Trump has repeatedly asked states across the country to return to work and school, but only recently changed his attitude and took the initiative to wear masks in public, while his advisers "bitten back" that some state governments returned to work too early.
On the 22nd, White House presidential adviser Kellyanne Conway said at a press conference that some state governments had not complied with the return-to-work standards and had reopened places such as bars prematurely.
Conway also referred to the previous claim that the president had "absolute authority" to decide on the return to work in the states as a false rumor.
"The president is a federalist. He believes in state autonomy."
She defended Trump.
However, what Conway called a "rumor" came from Trump himself during a White House briefing on the pandemic on April 13.
This self-facing operation has been ridiculed by netizens as "rewriting history".
Kellyanne Conway wants to rewrite history. She's a liar.
Trump called Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer a dictator because she followed medical guidelines and insisted on a work stoppage.
Trump wants to push for a return to work so he can hold a rally.
This is not the first time Kellyanne Conway has been controversial.
On April 15, in an interview with Fox News, Conway blurted out, "This is COVID-19, not COVID-1, friends!"
She seems to understand "19" as a version number, which has been ridiculed by netizens: read the newspaper without common sense!

Three-year-old Xiao Wen was accidentally hit in the head by Chen Mou of the softball team while pitching while playing on the playground of a university.
After Chen Mou's compensation, Xiao Wen's father, Mr. Wen, as Xiao Wen's legal representative, sued the school to the court, demanding that the school where the playground was located apologize, and pay a total of 20,000 yuan in compensation for medical expenses and moral damage.
Recently, after hearing the case, the Haidian District People's Court of Beijing concluded that the school had set up a protective net in the playground at the time of the incident, that it had fulfilled its appropriate safety and security obligations, and that Chen had made compensation, according to which the judgment rejected the plaintiff's claim.
Mr. Wen complained that during the 2019 summer vacation, he took Xiao Wen to play on the school playground while the softball team was training on the playground.
In order to avoid the resulting risks, Xiao Wen, Mr. Wen and many other children and parents operate in the safe area designated by the softball team.
But then softball team member Chen Mou took off his hand while pitching, causing the softball to fly over the net to the above-mentioned safe area and hit Xiao Wen in the back of the head.
Mr. Wen immediately took Xiao Wen to the hospital for treatment and was diagnosed with head trauma.
Mr. Wen was of the view that the facilities of the school stadium did not comply with the relevant safety regulations and did not effectively manage the team and related facilities.
The school's negligence led to the above-mentioned events, which caused Xiao Wen to suffer great physical and mental suffering, as well as greater suffering to his family, for which the school should bear legal responsibility.
In response, the school argued that the school had set up a protective net in the playground and posted management regulations and training notices informing people to enter the playground at a safe distance from the training site and reminding them of their own safety. The plaintiff could not prove that the school had "failed to fulfil its safety and security obligations" and therefore did not agree to compensation.
After the hearing, the court held that the site of the incident was open to the public free of charge by the university involved. Although the school has a safety and security obligation to the management of the playground, this safety and security obligation only needs to meet the general duty of care.
At the time of the incident, the school set up a protective net in the playground, which had fulfilled its appropriate safety and security obligations, and Chen Mou also compensated Xiao Wen for more than 2,000 yuan in losses such as medical and transportation costs in accordance with the previous compensation agreement. The two sides agreed to settle the dispute at one time.
Later, Xiao Wen's parents again claimed compensation from the school, which was not based on the law, and the court ruled to reject all the plaintiffs' claims.
Neither party appealed the verdict, which is now in effect.
According to Article 37 of the Tort Liability Law of China, schools, as administrators of public places, have safety and security obligations; in cases where the actions of a third party cause damage to others, the third party bears the tort liability, while the administrators of public places who fail to fulfil their safety and security obligations shall bear the corresponding supplementary responsibilities.
The judge stated that since, as the manager of a public place, he is most likely to know the actual situation of the whole place, to anticipate the possible dangers and damage, and thus to take the necessary measures to prevent the loss or mitigate the extent of the damage, and the cost of avoiding and mitigating the damage is the lowest, the law stipulates that he shall bear the corresponding guarantee obligation to engage in social activities.
In this case, for the non-specific group of people who enter the playground open to the public free of charge, the safety and security obligations of the school should be commensurate with the social activities it engages in. In particular, it should mainly take basic safety measures and have the obligation to inform the hidden dangers.
In judicial practice, it is not appropriate to impose excessive safety and security obligations on the managers of public places.
If the school has taken measures to set up a protective net and fulfilled its obligation to inform, it can be concluded that the school is not at fault and should not bear legal liability.
In addition, with regard to the infringement of the third party, even if the administrators of schools and other public places fail to fulfil their safety and security obligations, their liability is also a supplement to damages. According to the newly promulgated Civil Code, after assuming the supplementary liability, the administrators can also recover compensation from the third party.
Therefore, in such accidents, after the victim has received compensation from the direct infringer, the scope of claim should not be expanded.
Under the normalization of epidemic prevention and control, people's enthusiasm for sports and fitness is high.
With the gradual liberalization of inter-provincial tourism business, the tourism market is about to recover.
Fujian Province resumed inter-provincial tourism business from July 21, and Xiamen, as a popular tourist destination, welcomed the peak of passenger flow in the first weekend after its opening.
As a popular tourist destination city, many tourists arrive in Xiamen on weekends.
Xiamen Railway Station expects to send 3.7 million passengers during the summer transport, while the airport's passenger flow is dominated by students, tourism and family visits.
The tourism market is gradually warming up. In July, Xiamen Airport operated an average of 440 flights a day, and domestic flights have returned to 80% of their pre-epidemic level.
Airlines have encrypted the air express routes from Xiamen to Shanghai, Beijing, Kunming, Xi'an and other major cities to seize the tourism market after the recovery.
At present, many travel agencies in Xiamen have successively launched a number of domestic cross-provincial summer travel products, and the team's itinerary is mainly outdoor attractions.
In response to the summer passenger peak at railway stations and airports, relevant units have deployed additional personnel to guide and guide check-in counters, security check-in passageways and other areas where people easily gather. Fujian has also optimized and upgraded the "Bamuan Health Code", thus realizing the sharing and mutual recognition of health data with 31 provinces, and promoting the orderly recovery of the tourism market.
Andy Lau Can Liu Qingyun "Remove" the New Spark?
"Bomb Destroyer Expert 2" recently announced that it will be released on December 24, becoming the first film to be scheduled for the New Year.
The second part is still directed by Qiu Litao, produced and starring Andy Lau, with a new story.
It is reported that the addition of "nuclear bomb" elements in the second part also makes the challenge faced by the bomb disposal experts more difficult. The preview contains several startling glimpses of the scene, which has left the heart hanging, the mushroom cloud of the big explosion, the airport engulfed by the fire, the scene is quite shocking.
Three years ago, "Bomb Demolition Expert", produced by the original team, won the first box office in May of that year, and won seven nominations at the Hong Kong Film Awards. Qiu Li Tao × Andy Lau also became the gold medal partner in the eyes of the audience.
This time, "Bomb Destroyer Expert 2" also makes people look forward to whether this ace combination can wipe a new spark.

The female supervisor eager to solve the case, who is also Pan's ex-girlfriend Pang Ling (Nini), is also involved.
He is still a bomb disposal expert, but the complexity of Andy Lau's new role can be felt from the filed trailer: he broke a leg, wore a prosthetic limb, was chased by Liu Qingyun, who is also a bomb disposal expert, and was directed by his ex-girlfriend Nini.
What kind of relationship between the three, what Andy Lau did in the Fragrant Island Hotel, what kind of case he was involved in, and what kind of ups and downs his career as a bomb disposal expert has experienced, various mysteries make people curious.
It is understood that the main scenes of the film are the field filming of the world landmark buildings in Hong Kong, combined with the top special effects production team, which brings a shocking and realistic visual impact.

Chongqing, July 26 (reporter Liu Xian) Chongqing Municipal Development and Reform Commission released news on July 26 that the city has so far returned 4,404 fishermen, accounting for 42.54% of all fishermen involved.
Li Daiguo, 53, said in an interview with CNN.com that his grandfather had been fishing in the Longxi River since he was 11 years old. He followed his father to fish, rocked his boat and walked along the Longxi River, up to Liangping in Chongqing and down to live a long life. Every time he left home, he lived for ten days and a half months, relying on fishing to support his family.
However, since 1997, with the gradual influx of the rural population into the town, there have been more and more residents in the town, causing more and more serious environmental pollution.
Paper mills, chemical plants and breeding farms have been built along the Longxi River, which also pollutes the river.
By 2007 and 2008, the Longxi River had become a smelly ditch.
"The scales of the fish caught are black, and when cut open, they are black inside."
Li Daiguo said fishing became more and more difficult after the river was polluted.
The local area began to make great efforts to control the pollution of the Longxi River, including cleaning and floating, river patrol, management and protection of aquatic resources, etc.
Li Daiguo also retired from fishing to production and became a member of the river patrol team to protect aquatic resources.
As of January 1, 2020, the Chongqing Aquatic Biological Reserve and the relevant waters of the main city have been completely banned from fishing.
According to the data of the Chongqing Municipal Development and Reform Commission, so far, Chongqing has accumulated 3,403 fishing vessels and 4,643 fishing vessels that have signed fishing agreements, accounting for 63.3 per cent and 86.3 per cent of the total three-year tasks, respectively.
There are 4,404 retired fishermen, accounting for 42.54% of all fishermen involved.
Of the 4,404 retired fishermen, 4,267 were employed, accounting for 96.89 per cent of the retired fishermen.
Old-age insurance covered 2,691 people, accounting for 61.10 per cent of the retired fishermen.
As a next step, Chongqing will carry out in-depth special remediation actions, accelerate the clean-up and improvement of shoreline utilization projects in the main stream of the Yangtze River, complete a new round of survey of sewage discharges into the river of the Yangtze River and carry out corresponding remediation actions, basically complete the task of "three phosphorus" (referring to phosphate ore, phosphorus chemical industry and phosphorus gypsum banks), clean up and rectify small hydropower, promote special actions for afforestation and greening on both sides of the Yangtze River, strengthen the construction of green mines, consolidate the results of the special control of illegal wharves and illegal sand mining in the main stream of the Yangtze River, and deeply promote the work of banning and returning fishing in the Yangtze River basin.
Israel strengthens the prevention and control of repeated epidemics

Israel strengthens prevention and control of repeated outbreaks
At the beginning of the outbreak of the new crown pneumonia, Israel's prevention and control measures were effective.
However, with the gradual lifting of the ban on prevention and control measures, the number of confirmed cases of new pneumonia in Israel has increased significantly recently, and the Israeli Government has repeatedly taken urgent measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic.
On February 28, the first case of coronavirus pneumonia was confirmed in Israel itself. As a result, Israel quickly took measures to close all entry and exit points, suspend non-essential industries, switch schools to online classes, restrict public transport and non-essential social activities, block cities with serious outbreaks, and jointly maintain prevention and control measures.
This series of measures quickly achieved positive results, and by mid-May, the number of new confirmed cases of pneumonia in Israel in a single day had fallen to single digits.
With the epidemic under control and the complete lifting of all prevention and control measures in Israel, the number of new confirmed cases of crown pneumonia has gradually rebounded since June.
Especially since the beginning of July, the spread of the epidemic has been accelerating.
In recent days, the number of new daily cases in Israel has been more than 1,500 for eight days, and as of July 25, the number of new cases reached 916.
As of July 25, Israel had 59,745 confirmed cases and 448 deaths.
In the face of the rapid rebound of the epidemic, the Israeli Government has repeatedly taken urgent measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic.
On July 6, after the number of confirmed cases exceeded 30,000, the Israeli government closed gyms, swimming pools, bars, nightclubs and other places of public entertainment, and introduced a policy of restricting public transport, stipulating that the maximum number of passengers per bus should not exceed 20.
On the 17th, the Israeli government announced a series of new restrictions, including the implementation of "city closure" on weekends, stipulating that "city closure" should be implemented from 17: 00 every Friday to 5: 00 every Sunday.
During this period, people may go out, but places such as shops, shopping malls, hairdressers, beauty salons, libraries, zoos, museums, exhibition galleries, swimming pools and tourist attractions will be closed, while places of basic services such as supermarkets and pharmacies will remain open.
At the same time, gatherings of more than 10 people are prohibited on all days and hours, gyms, studios and other places will be closed, restaurants and cafes will be banned from eating, and only take-out services will be allowed.
At the same time, the Israeli people have not paid enough attention to the seriousness of the epidemic and have failed to form joint efforts with the government in combating the epidemic.
After repeated outbreaks in Israel, many people took to the streets to protest because the government's prevention and control measures affected their own economic interests.
On July 11, tens of thousands of people demonstrated in Tel Aviv, arguing that the anti-epidemic policy affected the economy.
On the evening of the 21st, thousands more protesters gathered in front of Prime Minister Netanyahu's official residence in Jerusalem to protest against Prime Minister Netanyahu's promulgation of preventive and control measures such as banning restaurants and coffee halls without providing corresponding compensation.
In addition, many people also failed to observe the rules of wearing masks and maintaining a safe social distance of two meters during outdoor activities. In order to avoid being fined by the police for not wearing a mask, many people only wore masks on their chin or hung them on their wrists.
During the repeated epidemics, the school was a major disaster area for the spread of the new crown virus, and according to a recent visit to the kindergarten by journalists, it was found that the teachers and students of the kindergarten did not wear masks as required by the government, nor did they maintain a safe social distance of two meters from each other, laying hidden dangers for a large number of teachers and students to be infected with the virus.
Professor Elie Waxman, a member of the Advisory Panel of Anti-epidemic Experts of the Israeli National Security Council, believed that Israel was moving towards a "dangerous situation", pointing out that the current measures taken by Israel to prevent and control the epidemic were not enough, and that all places of leisure and recreational activities and summer schools should be closed in order to control the further spread of the epidemic.
Waxman said that Israel lacks an overall plan to combat the epidemic, and that all departments of the parliament and government should abandon their respective interests as soon as possible, reach agreement on combating the epidemic and formulate clear steps that include relevant restrictions in different sectors.
TEL AVIV, July 25, Tel Aviv correspondent Wang Chung
Wu Fengfang, a farmer in Guyuan, Ningxia, couldn't overcome his old companion, Dai Tianfu, and the two people drove from their home 20 miles away to the Liang Yun Cultural Compound.
Despite the inconveniences of the past two years, 77-year-old Dai Tianfu is still looking forward to "coming here every other day to have a fun addiction."
This is a humble courtyard in Yuanzhou District of Guyuan City. Unlike the general agricultural courtyard, the courtyard often comes out with a melodious Qin cavity, as well as colorful shadow plays, embroidery works, traditional Qin cavity, eyebrow Hu opera and so on.
The owner of the compound was Liang Yun, a former carpenter.
More than 10 years ago, loving shadow and singing, he began planning the construction of a cultural compound.
With the Liang Yun Cultural Compound, the cultural life of the villagers has become colorful.
Before the reporter entered the Liang Yun Cultural Compound, the tunes of the Qin Dynasty had been passed out.
It is Berry Xiang, a villager from a neighbouring village, who is singing a selection of Qin passages for the villagers.
She has loved Qin Cai since she was a child, and now has a small local reputation. As long as she has free time, she will come to the cultural compound to perform programs for the villagers.
Recently, Berry also played a live webcast.
Paris said: "It's a very happy thing to have a stage to let more people see their performances."
On the stage, the singers one by one, the players one by one tune, although they are amateurs, but the enthusiasm does not diminish.
Like the simple style of the Nongjia Academy, outside the Qin Dynasty, the "grass-roots" art and non-legacy culture in the Liang Yun Cultural Academy came from the front.
The compound also contains more than 300 items of agricultural tools of different ages, traditional and hand-made tile, paper-cut, embroidery, shadow and other physical objects.
Liang Yun led the reporter into the exhibition hall in the courtyard, which showed his collection of old objects, old wine jugs, three strings, spinning wheels and so on.
Why does an ordinary farmer build a cultural compound?
"Shadow acting is my family craft, and I've been learning it since I was 15."
Established in 2012, the Liang Yun Cultural Compound became the first "intangible cultural heritage exhibition hall" in rural Ningxia and a demonstration compound for the protection of intangible cultural heritage in Guyuan City.
In addition to the Liang Yun Cultural Compound, more than 120 cultural compounds and 79 folk performance groups have emerged in the Yuanzhou District of Guyuan City. Among them, there are more than 50 cultural compounds of a certain size, such as the Shenjiahe Cultural Compound, the Wang Yonghong Cultural Compound and the Yang Lang Cultural Compound, covering towns and streets in the Yuanzhou District, with more than 5,000 performers.
These grass-roots artists are active in the fields, enriching the cultural life of the masses and meeting their spiritual needs.
"As life gets better and better, traditional culture can't just be left behind."
"Liu's Impossible War Drama" Returns to "The Chance of Winning" to Watch Liu Yunlong and Li Liqun's "Play" - Xinhua
The 40-episode ultimatum battle drama "Chance of Winning" will land on Beijing TV from July 16.
"Chances of Winning" is based on real historical facts and is based on the dusty Soviet military archives, which appeared for the first time in many years.
Actor Liu Yunlong, known to the audience as "spy drama", broke through his image in the play and challenged a very happy "stuttering agent".
In recent years, the popularity of plays such as "The Pretender," "The Mask" and "The Kite" has proved that spy drama has exuberant vitality.
Unlike previous espionage works, "Chance of Winning" looks at the world and extends the setting of the story to the Far East battlefield of the Soviet Union.
Set against the background of the final stage of the Anti-Japanese War in 1944, it tells the story of Tang Fei (Liu Yunlong), a secret intelligence worker of the Communist Party of China, under the leadership of the Secretary of the Linhe Provincial Committee of the Chinese Underground Party and the Director of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Agency, carrying out the "Mudanura" strategy operation of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Agency.
In many espionage dramas, the hero, as a senior spy, appears as a handsome, high intelligence and mature perfect image.
But in Liu Yunlong's view, such a person is not suitable to be a spy. "A spy should be the kind of person who can't be found in the pile of people. If the appearance is that kind of handsome image, I hope everyone should pay attention to you, can you still lurk? There is a line in" Kite ", 'If you don't catch me, I forget that I am a Kuomintang', and the spy should go elite."
So in "The Chance of Winning," Liu Yun Long ingeniously designed his hero Tang Fei as a "stuttering agent" with a sense of joy.
The other camp in "Chances of Winning" is supported jointly by Fukuhara, a Japanese played by Liang Guanhua, and Fang Shibao, director of the police bureau, played by Li Liqun.
One south, one north and two strong actors added a lot of tricks to the whole drama.
Director Yin Fei used the word "drama" to describe the opposite of Li Liqun and Liu Yunlong in the play. "It is definitely a drama, the two of them have a special tacit understanding, and this kind of tacit understanding on them is very influential to me. A lot of times their plays are 'hanging', for example, we only wrote half a page of paper, and they can play all the time without stopping when I shoot."
The masters do not rob the play, the director does not disturb the play. When the actors are in the role and ensure their own character state, they can not only shape the character from the perspective of the character, but also bring more viewing possibilities to the audience. Yin Fei said that such a play is brilliant enough.
In the play, you can also see many familiar faces in the "Liu Impossible War Drama", the famous and majestic "Mountain City F4" in "Kite", and three in "Chance of Winning".
Hou Yong and Liu Mingyang, who had played Song Xiaoan and Zhao Jane Zhi, played Tang Fei's right arm again.
Director Yin Fei introduced, "There is no evil in these two people, they just drift with the tide in that era, that environment."
Liu Yunlong also took the initiative, "We should have a human face. This human face means that there must be good and bad people around me, and bad people are enemies, but we should also develop them and strengthen our team."
The ending of the two people in the play was also carefully designed by Liu Yunlong, who believed that he would give the audience a satisfactory answer.

Four students drowned in A Rongqi, Inner Mongolia Official: The incident sounded an alarm
China News Network Hulunbuir, July 26 (reporter Li Aiping) On the evening of July 25, the reporter learned from the government of the city of Hulunbuir, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, that four local students drowned.
At 15: 50 on July 24, Ah Rongqi Public Security Bureau 110 received a police report that six local junior middle school students drowned.
After receiving the police, the local civilian police rushed to the scene the first time and rescued two students on the spot. Subsequently, the local emergency bureau, the water conservancy bureau and other units arrived at the scene and participated in the rescue all the way.
According to the report, more than 80 people were deployed at the rescue site, including public security police, forest police, fire control and medical care, three rubber boats were sent to continuously salvage the surrounding waters, and professional rescue teams were hired to arrive at the scene and conduct underwater search through sonar detection.

At present, the relevant departments of the local government are collating some drowning prevention knowledge, hoping that the tragedy will not happen again.
Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, July 25 (Xinhua)) The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury of the HKSAR Government, Xu Zhengyu, said that Hong Kong's financial markets remained active and operated in an orderly manner.
He expressed optimism about Hong Kong's financial stability and economy.
Speaking at an online seminar jointly organised by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Toronto and the Hong Kong-Canada Chamber of Commerce (Canadian Association) on the 24th (Toronto time), Mr Hui said that Hong Kong was experiencing a difficult situation due to the "law correction wave" and the new pneumonia epidemic.
The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is stable and biased towards the strong party exchange guarantee level.
There are no clear signs of capital outflows from the banking system; on the contrary, more than $11 billion has entered since June.
The total amount of bank deposits has also continued to increase in the past few months. The stock market has a series of public offering fund-raising activities, and market transactions have risen repeatedly.
Hui said that the new pneumonia outbreak has put pressure on the global economy and financial markets, but Hong Kong's basic advantages remain unchanged.
Hong Kong's many advantages, including geography, the rule of law, high-speed communications, the free flow of information and capital, and a simple and low tax system, have made Hong Kong a leading international financial centre.
Mr Hui pointed out that the HKSAR Government had set aside HK $6 billion in the "Epidemic and Anti-epidemic Fund" to create about 30,000 time-bound jobs in the public and private sectors over the next two years, covering people with different skills and qualifications.
To support the development of financial technology, the HKSAR Government has also launched the "Thousand Talents Plan" to subsidize local financial technology companies, start-ups and other enterprises with financial technology-related business, with a view to creating 1,000 new jobs, employing local talents and enriching Hong Kong's financial technology talent pool.
Looking ahead, Xu expressed optimism about Hong Kong's financial stability and economy.
He encouraged Canadian enterprises to make full use of Hong Kong's advantages and its position as an international financial centre, an international asset and wealth management centre and a global offshore RMB business hub to develop and invest in the Greater Bay Area of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao and the surrounding areas.
Lancet article praises China's anti-epidemic efforts and encourages countries to learn from experience
As a country with a population of 1.4 billion and a scale similar to that of Europe or the United States, China has effectively controlled the new epidemic at this stage, without further widespread transmission, and has largely controlled the epidemic in the country, The Lancet said in its 25th issue.
The article said that in the past decade or so, China has invested heavily in domestic research and public health construction, which has made China much more prepared for the new crown than it was for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).
The authors say that at the time of the SARS outbreak in 2002, China was initially ill-prepared, especially as the pathogen could not be identified.
When the new crown virus was discovered in December 2019, Chinese scientists were soon able to identify the type of virus and shared the genome sequencing data with the international community on January 11, 2020.
By the end of January, doctors from mainland China and Hong Kong had clarified the clinical characteristics of the virus and warned the world of the threat of the new crown virus through research papers published in The Lancet.
China has also always been at the forefront of vaccine research. Under the declaration of a national emergency and through close domestic cooperation, such research has been carried out very quickly and rigorously. In May and July, respectively, the results of the progress made in the early trials of the new crown vaccine developed by China were published in The Lancet.
China's experience has shown that it is very important to invest in the national health and research system and effectively improve laboratory capacity.
This is the basis for a rapid and effective national response to health emergencies and global health security.
Other countries, especially low- and middle-income countries, are well worth learning from.
In addition, China's experience has proved that, on the basis of strong research, strong high-level officials must make correct decisions decisively on the basis of scientific evidence in order for the new epidemic to be effectively controlled.
The article stressed that the government and its leaders must respect science, understand its value and act on it in the best way for society.
At the beginning of the outbreak, China's National Health and Construction Commission sent three groups of infectious disease experts to Wuhan to investigate the risk and spread of the new crown virus, and their suggestions provided the basis for the decision to "seal off" Wuhan on January 23. When the experts put forward the necessity and urgency of building a square cabin hospital, the government quickly made a decision and implemented it quickly. At the same time, the extensive participation of the community and the masses also enabled the epidemic to be controlled quickly and effectively.
Finally, the article emphasizes that in response to the global health emergency, countries need to strengthen global cooperation and joint response.

After completing the testing of all special dormitories, the vast majority of foreign workers will be able to return to work, but they still have to be tested for new crowns on a regular basis.
Director Dapeng's "Ruyi" is nominated for the Golden Viscount Award
On July 18, the 23rd Shanghai International Film Festival announced the official list of films selected for the Golden Viscount Award.
Director Dapeng's first realistic theme film, "Ruyi", was successfully nominated for the Golden Viscount Award at the current Film Festival, and the film officially released its first poster.
Poster for Photos
The film "Ruyi" is the first realistic theme work of director Dapeng, and it is also his second marriage with the Golden Viscount Award.
The film tells the story of a comedy film director who, on a whim, returned to his hometown in the northeast countryside, hoping to turn his family's New Year into a literary and art film.
The family members gathered for the film finished the final party.
In the film poster released today, a member of the family, "Uncle Wang" Jixiang, sits in the middle of the picture smoking, with the silver-clad northeast black land in the background, and the red lanterns that Chinese must hang for the New Year's Day in the foreground.
The red lantern, which symbolizes celebration and reunion, forms a huge contrast with the lonely Wang Jixiang, which also seems to reveal the complexity and entanglement in the relationship between this large family.
It is reported that in the film, except that the daughter of "Third Uncle" Wang Jixiang is played by actor Liu Lu, the other scenes are completed by the real director's family. The film's experimental audio-visual style breaks the boundary between drama and reality, and brings the audience a brand-new immersive viewing experience.
According to director Dapeng, the creation of "Ruyi" originated from "a providence". During the filming period, a series of sudden changes in the family forced the original shooting plan to be changed. Life without a script was finally recorded as a film, but the tension beyond the design was released.
Director Dapeng how to face this "providence" after all, and how to continue to meet the changes brought about by this providence?
There is no doubt that "Ruyi" is full of experimentation. The almost vegetarian lineup and innovative audio-visual style have turned life in front of the camera into a film. Under the package of real images, the audience will also find the shadow of themselves and their families from the family presented in the film, and with the end of this family gathering in the film, arouse a series of thoughts.
NEWS.GOV.MO: Enquiry Hotline Statistics of the COVID Response Coordination Centre (08H00 on July 25 - 08H00 on July 26)
From 08H00 on July 25 to 08H00 on July 26, 2020, the enquiry hotline of the COVID Response Coordination Centre received 292 calls.
The 291 enquiries on the epidemic were immediately forwarded to the representatives of the relevant departments for follow-up. The situation is as follows:
271 cases by the Health Bureau (involving: enquiries on isolation; enquiries on nucleic acid testing; enquiries on two places; health codes; other).
17 cases of Public Security Police (involving: Enquiries on immigration measures; Enquiries on entry and exit measures for licensed vehicles in Guangdong and Macao; Enquiries on Zhuhai Administrative Hotline; Enquiries on document stay issues).
MGTO 1 case (involving: enquiring about quarantine hotels)
1 case by the Education and Youth Affairs Bureau (involving: Enquiries on the methods of Macao students returning to the United Kingdom to study).
Marine and Water Bureau 1 case (involving: asking whether Hong Kong fishing vessels need to declare to the Marine and Water Bureau and nucleic acid testing related matters when entering Hong Kong).
At the Badong Zhuokang outpost, platoon commander Yu Wang and a soldier stood guard on duty.
In this place where the average annual temperature is more than ten degrees below zero, a row of simple barracks stands at the mountain pass. A national flag is flying in the wind not far from the barracks. The soldiers stand guard in the wind every day, while they have to regularly patrol higher elevations.
The soldiers had to use their hands and feet to climb the steep slope of the rubble.
It was late July, when flowers and grass flourished in low-altitude areas, and in Bawang Chaokang, only the trenches behind the barracks were relatively dense green.
Gao Peng, a soldier who had been stationed at the outpost for six years, pointed to the trench and said it was their back garden. Only in July and August of each year could the grass grow slowly, and soon after, it turned yellow and covered with snow.
Foot patrols can take about nine hours.
In the harsh plateau environment, the soldiers stationed here are accompanied by snowy mountains and glaciers all year round, and they also regularly patrol the higher-altitude passes.
A few days ago, the patrol composed of eight soldiers, led by the instructor Liang Yixin, took the patrol road again.
Each soldier carried a weight of about 30 jin and headed for the target point early in the morning.
On the way, a soldier rebelled and his comrades-in-arms rushed to the rescue.
In addition to patrol tasks, the soldiers at the Badong Chaokang outpost have to conduct tactical and physical training every day.
Time passed by minute by second, rising altitude, lower and lower oxygen content, constant physical overdraft, these factors tested the will of the patrol members.
They clenched their teeth and persisted, crossing several landslides and crossing several dangerous beaches.
At around 16: 00, it was lunch time for the patrol. They took out their own dry food and sat on the ground at an altitude of more than 5,700 meters, accompanied by sleet and snow, to supplement their strength with food.
The soldiers at the Bayonjokang outpost conducted tactical and physical training.
During the break, they will play cards together, and the losers will do push-ups, which can be both recreational and physical.
After a short break in the cold wind, they climbed to the target position of the patrol, took out the national flag on the pass and made a solemn oath.
Behind them are snow-capped mountains, in front of them are dozens of kilometers of no man's land, they are the safest guardians of the country.
Restart of the Beijing Consumption Season
Beijing will restart the activities of the Beijing consumption season in accordance with the principle of "comprehensive restart, key planning, orderly promotion and strict organization".
On July 26, 1.5 million government-owned enterprises consumption vouchers were issued, including 1 million offline catering vouchers and 500,000 smart product vouchers, which consumers can collect at the Jingdong APP.
Liu Meying, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Commerce, said at a media briefing held on the 25th that the consumption season after the restart will further reduce the capital allocation of enterprises on the basis of maintaining the existing preferential subsidy of consumer vouchers and card bags.
Since the beginning of August, the current 1: 1 allocation of capital by the government and enterprises has been adjusted to 2: 1. For example, if consumers receive a card bag to spend in the store, they can enjoy 120 yuan of preferential treatment, including 60 yuan of government subsidy and 60 yuan of interest by enterprises; after the adjustment, 80 yuan of government subsidy and 40 yuan of interest by enterprises.
During the consumption season, the three major operators will subsidize traffic and terminals around 5G consumption, further promoting Beijing's new 5G infrastructure and new 5G consumption.
Mr Chan said Hong Kong's economy has been hit by the renewed outbreak of the epidemic and called on all sectors to share difficult times.
Hong Kong, July 26: The Financial Secretary of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, Mr Chan Mau-po, said on July 26 that Hong Kong is facing the impact of a new wave of pneumonia, and business transactions and economic activities that had seen a slight recovery have also been hit.
The HKSAR Government once again called on major small business owners to reduce rent and share the difficult times with retailers, restaurants and small and medium-sized enterprises.
On the same day, Chen Maobo published an article entitled "The rugged road to recovery" on the Internet.
He said that the recent high number of confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia in Hong Kong posed a serious situation, affecting the livelihood of the community and disturbing the economy.
When the epidemic is repeated, the first priority is to strictly prevent imported cases, deal with and break the chain of virus transmission as quickly as possible. When the epidemic is under control, economic activities should be resumed in a timely and corresponding manner.
He pointed out that in the face of the impact of the new wave of the epidemic, business transactions and economic activities, which had seen a slight recovery, had also been hit.
For the business community, in addition to the spirit of contract, social responsibility is equally important, especially for those groups that have received large government subsidies under the Employment Protection Scheme.
He mentioned that Hong Kong's economic situation was still very serious in the second quarter of this year, but the trend of contraction seemed to slow slightly.
On the export side, he believed that Hong Kong's external situation was still serious.
Chan said that Hong Kong's development over the past decades has shown that every crisis hides new opportunities and every difficulty hides the key to future development.
The largest earthquake in Taiwan this year occurred in the eastern waters of Taiwan.
TAIPEI, July 26 (China News Service) - An earthquake measuring 6.1 on the Richter scale occurred in the eastern waters of Taiwan at 20: 52 on July 26, with the largest magnitude of 4, felt throughout Taiwan, making it the largest earthquake in Taiwan this year.
Taiwan's meteorological department reported that the epicenter of the earthquake was located 86.5 kilometers southeast of the Yilan County Government, that is, in the eastern waters of Taiwan, with a depth of 53 kilometers.
The China Earthquake Network measured the earthquake as 5.5.
The largest earthquake in all parts of Taiwan was magnitude 4 in Hualien County, magnitude 3 in Yilan County, Taidong County, Nantou County and Yunlin County, and magnitude 1 to 2 in other counties and cities.
Taiwan's meteorological department pointed out that the earthquake is the largest subduction zone earthquake in the whole of Taiwan this year, which belongs to the boundary of the plate. Its epicenter has often occurred in the past and has been relatively active since this year.
In the coming week, it is still not ruled out that there will be aftershocks of magnitude 4 or more.
Marinichev said the change in value was influenced by the devaluation of the ruble and the epidemic.
"The cost of services is increasing," he said.
Because of the epidemic, people are spending more time on the Internet.
Marinichev did not rule out a serious rise in Internet prices this year, arguing that operators could provide customers with higher speeds and more services to offset people's dissatisfaction with the price increases.
Chinese Doctors Prepare Tribute to Anti-epidemic Heroes
Recently, with the respect of the heroes of Chinese filmmakers in the fight against the epidemic, Yu Dong, chairman of Bona Film Group, and director Liu Weiqiang (pictured left) held discussions with Academician Zhong Nanshan in Guangzhou on the filming and production of the anti-epidemic film "Chinese Doctor".
Boehner Films hopes to pay tribute to all the medical and epidemic prevention workers fighting on the front line of epidemic prevention and control through "Chinese Doctors"!
In 2021, the film will be released nationally as a gift film to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China.
At present, Bona Films, under the arrangement and deployment of the Central Propaganda Department and the National Film Bureau, and with the support of the Guangdong Film Bureau and the Hubei Film Bureau, has organized the original crew of the film Captain China to prepare the film Chinese Doctor, which is a film that reflects the unity of the people of the whole country in the fight against the new pneumonia epidemic under the strong leadership of the Central Committee of the Party.
Focusing on the front line of the fight against the epidemic in Wuhan, the film will take the Wuhan medical staff and the provincial and municipal medical teams assisting Hubei Province as the character background. From the perspective of human nature, the film will use a unique narrative and highly influential camera language to show the moving stories of Chinese medical staff on the front line of the fight against the epidemic full of dedication and sacrifice.
It is understood that in the first days after Wuhan was released from lockdown, Boehner overcame many difficulties and sent a team of photographers to go deep into the front line of the epidemic, face-to-face exchanges with hundreds of medical workers to understand and collect data. At present, it has interviewed academician Zhong Nanshan himself, the first person in Guangzhou to help Wuhan, the Guangdong medical team to help Hubei, as well as the white angels at the forefront of the anti-epidemic front, such as Wuhan Yintan Hospital, Wuhan Union Hospital, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University and Wuhan Central Hospital.
At the symposium, Academician Zhong Nanshan also raised expectations and hopes for the filming of the film: "I look forward to it. I hope you will not only visit some experts who have made more appearances, but also interview more medical personnel who have worked hard on the front line. They are the majority."
He said he had seen "Me and My Country" and "Captain China" before and thought it was a good way to tell big-pattern stories from the perspective of ordinary people.
"Now some foreign friends still have some misunderstandings about China."
Speaking about the dissemination of the film, Academician Zhong Nanshan said that at present, some people abroad like to label the virus as politicized. He hoped that the film would impress the audience from the perspective of humanity: "In addition to being shown in China, it would be better for the film to be shown abroad. It should be in a way that audiences at home and abroad can understand and impress the audience with the true humanistic spirit."
Academician Zhong Nanshan also affectionately recalled the film "Man to Middle Age" in the 1980s. "After so many years, I was most impressed by the film" Man to Middle Age "after the reform and opening up, when my doctor friends abroad watched and cried. It would be great if" Chinese Doctor "could play such a role."
Academician Zhong Nanshan said that if Chinese Doctors could resonate with foreign audiences, it would be a great success.
During the discussion and exchange, Academician Zhong Nanshan also shared his opinions and suggestions on the current international epidemic prevention and control. "I believe that people will always be smarter than the virus."
Academician Zhong Nanshan said that although the virus is difficult to predict, mankind has overcome a thousand difficulties and dangers since the primitive society. Today, modern society has developed medical technology and social management measures, and medical personnel and even people all over the world have a basic understanding of the scientific response to the new crown pneumonia epidemic. People will no longer be as passive as before. "Next, we should pay attention to two aspects of work, one is to study how to strengthen cooperation around the world, and the other is to pay attention to soothing people's hearts and minds."

Wen Travel "Red Fruit" Gathers Shaoshan - Xiangtan First Red Expo - Today's Highlights - Hunan Daily Network - Huasheng Online
Hunan Daily New Hunan Client Reporter Jiang Rui Correspondent Xiao Yan
Jiaxing red boat mold, Shaoshan bronze statue of Mao Zedong, Yan'an cloth pile flower crafts, Xiangxi Yongshun bacon... On July 25, the 2020 Hunan Red Tourism and Culture Festival opened in Shaoshan.
As one of the main activities, the first Xiangtan Red Cultural Industry Expo was launched at the Shaoshan All-Region Tourism Advisory and Distribution Center.
The exhibition area is full of red literary and creative products, local products and other special products from the old revolutionary areas, which attract tourists from all over the world to buy.
"The Red Fair is not only a display of the achievements of the national red cultural industry, but also an important platform for exhibitors and enterprises to exchange experiences and explore development paths."
The relevant person-in-charge of the Executive Committee of the first Red Expo in Xiangtan introduced that the theme of the Red Expo was "Promoting Red Culture to Boost the Warmth of Wen Travel". The total area of the exhibition was nearly 3,000 square meters, and an atmosphere-building area, a scenic spot display and exhibition area and an online shopping experience area were set up.
Eight provinces and cities, including Jiaxing in Zhejiang, Zunyi in Guizhou and Yan'an in Shaanxi, as well as 137 enterprises and units in Changsha, Zhuzhou, Yueyang and Chenzhou in our province, were invited to participate in the exhibition, with a total of 768 exhibits, including red cultural relics, handicrafts, food specialties, tourism routes, red training courses and red literary and creative products.
The exhibition area will be open until July 29.
As the host of the Red Fair, Xiangtan Exhibition Area is full of bright spots.
The person in charge of the exhibition area introduced that the Xiangtan exhibition area is divided into two parts: the development of red industry and red cultural industry.
The Red Industrial Exhibition Area displays 31 exhibits from six enterprises, including Hualing Xianggang, Hualing Cable and Power, and the Red Cultural Industry Development Exhibition Area displays nearly 200 products from 27 units, including red series books, red series foods and red series creative products.
In the Yan'an Exhibition Area, many tourists are attracted by the display of cloth and flower handicrafts and paper-cut art.
Ma Dongpo, Director of the Culture and Tourism Bureau of Yan'an, introduced that the exhibition carefully selected the outstanding red literary and creative products of Yan'an in the past two years, of which 16 products were excellent works of 2019 national red literary and creative products.
At the same time, they invited the heirs of the national-level intangible cultural heritage protection projects "Ansei Paper-Cut", "Northern Shaanxi Folk Songs" and the provincial-level non-heritage projects "Yanchuan Cloth Pile Painting", focused on introducing the products with the characteristics of Yanan folklore, and took the opportunity to communicate with other units and enterprises in the exhibition area to promote cross-regional cooperation.
The cumulative number of new confirmed cases in Japan exceeds 30,000.
According to statistics, there were 239 new confirmed cases in Tokyo on the 26th, and more than 200 new cases in a single day for six consecutive days, bringing the cumulative number of cases to 11,214.
In addition, there were 141 new confirmed cases in Osaka Prefecture, 90 in Fukuoka Prefecture and 80 in Aichi Prefecture.
Telecom network fraud crime rose by 70% in the first half of the year
China News Network, July 26: According to the Supreme Inspection website, in the first half of this year, procuratorial organs nationwide prosecuted a total of 58,101 people for fraud crimes, an increase of 35% over the previous year.
In particular, among the crimes impeding epidemic prevention and control, fraud crimes are frequent, and the number of fraud crimes prosecuted by the procuratorial organs accounted for 43.4 per cent of the total number of crimes impeding epidemic prevention and control.
The Supreme People's Procuratorate has carried out targeted guidance. At present, of the 10 batches of typical cases involving epidemic prevention and control issued, a total of 9 involve the crime of fraud.
Judging from the cases handled by the procuratorial organs in the first half of the year, there are a wide range of crimes involving fraud, ranging from national macroeconomic policies to people's food, clothing and housing, including epidemic fraud, "medical care" fraud, "health products" fraud, "enrollment intermediary" fraud, "routine loan" fraud, fraud of defrauding state subsidies, fraud of unfreezing ethnic assets, etc., which are constantly "new", covering areas such as education, medical care, employment, old age, social security, land expropriation and demolition, accurate poverty alleviation, financial and credit, which not only cause economic losses to the victims, but also seriously affect economic and social development.
In particular, some telecommunications network frauds break through the limits of national borders, geography and personnel, and have the characteristics of stakeholders, cross-border, remote and electronic payments, with no specific group of victims and great harm.
For example, some set up special companies, rent high-grade office buildings, set up multiple departments or posts, use legal network platforms to publicize and recruit, train and evaluate recruiters, and adopt enterprise operation mode management, wearing the "cloak of legality", which is more attractive.
It is incumbent upon the procuratorial organs to punish and prevent crimes in accordance with the law and to issue early warning to the public and relevant departments in a timely manner.
In handling judicial cases, the procuratorial organs conscientiously perform their duties, not only maintaining a high-pressure trend against fraud crimes, but also refining various law enforcement measures in a targeted manner, and promoting social governance through the preparation and issuance of procuratorial recommendations.
The procuratorial organs strictly regulate the facts, evidence, procedures and application of the law in the approval of arrest and prosecution of fraud cases, taking the facts as the basis and the law as the criterion, so as to be fair and impartial.
Especially for the crime of telecommunications network fraud, we pay attention to the central role of electronic data in fact determination, and strive to build a chain of evidence between electronic data, verbal evidence and documentary evidence.
For example, in response to a certain epidemic-related fraud case handled by the Yinzhou District Prosecutor's Office of Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province, the procuratorial authorities intervened in advance at the first time, and it took only five days from the occurrence of the case to the conclusion of the case, reflecting the attitude and determination to handle it quickly and strictly and to maintain the overall stability of the society.
In the process of reviewing arrest and reviewing prosecution, attention was paid to the prosecution of missing cases, correcting the omission of 733 persons by the public security organs, and correcting the omission of the public security organs to examine and prosecute 1,113 co-offenders.
In the first half of the year, procuratorial organs nationwide issued 298 procuratorial recommendations on fraud crimes, promoting joint efforts to prevent fraud crimes and promoting in-depth governance.
For example, in response to the loopholes in the supervision of telecommunications networks found in the handling of cases by communications enterprises, banks and intermediary organizations, the Guangzhou Public Prosecutor's Office and the Dongguan City Public Prosecutor's Office of Guangdong Province put forward timely procuratorial recommendations, urging the relevant units to strengthen supervision and improve the mechanism so as to help promote the construction of a long-term system.
Fourth, make every effort to do a good job in the recovery of spoils and losses.
Local procuratorial organs have seized important links such as intervening in investigation, guiding the taking of evidence and reviewing prosecution, urging the investigative organs to actively pursue and recover the stolen funds, cooperating with the relevant departments in the work of recovering the stolen money and losses, and striving to minimize the economic losses caused to the people by the crime of fraud.
For example, the Beijing Municipal Public Prosecutor's Office handled a certain set loan case in Lin Mou, which involved 22 sets of properties waiting to be sealed up. Under the circumstances that the properties may be disposed of first by other cases, it was the first to create and issue a "Letter of Suspension of Execution", which was sent to the relevant court in a timely manner, recommending that the previous seizure court suspend the execution of the properties involved, and deal with them uniformly after the facts of the crime were ascertained, so as to make maximum efforts to recover the properties involved and recover the losses of the victims.
The prosecutor reminded everyone that the crime of fraud should be highly vigilant, do not expect "pie in the sky", do not think cheap to be credulous, keep their "purse".
Jinna Town, Weining County, Guizhou Province: Low Apple Tree Widens the Road to Poverty Alleviation
2020-07-26 11: 42: 58 Source: China Economic Network Author: Zhu Yanjing Responsibility Editor: Zhu Yanjing
In the hot heat, the reporter of Economic Daily - China Economic Network walked into Zhonghai Village, Jinna Town, Weining County, Guizhou Province.
In the hot sun, villager Li Yuanzhong was weeding in the base. Although his face was red, his mouth hummed a few little songs from time to time.
Wening County, where the town is located, has a certain popularity in the surrounding area because of its low latitude, high altitude, abundant light and large temperature difference between day and night. However, it has also been unable to sell a good price and form an industrial scale because of its small size and many spots.
Jinna Town used to be a poor town of "Baogu potato for spring and autumn", where the incidence of poverty was as high as 25.8% 10 years ago.
In the crucial period of overcoming poverty and entering a decisive battle, it is urgent to change traditional planting habits, adjust the industrial structure and increase farmers' income.
After many visits, Chen Chao, party secretary of Huna town, and a class of people in the town believed that industrial development could no longer follow the old path.
To this end, the town introduced leading enterprises to grow apples in a modern way.
Hou Jianwen, deputy general manager of Weining Transcending Agriculture Co., Ltd. came to the town of Jinna from Shaanxi in 2015 to investigate the local planting conditions at a glance, and began to plant apple trees there from 2016.
At first, the village mobilized Li Yuanzhong to transfer the land to plant apple trees. Li Yuanzhong's husband and wife had a murmur in their hearts: "After planting apples for so many years, they did not see who planted apples in the village made a fortune."
"All apples planted are dwarfed apples and will not let the apple tree grow too tall."
What Li Yuanzhong did not expect was that a new method was used for apple planting. Irrigation pipes were spread under each apple tree, and water and fertilizer were poured to the roots. When the fruit was harvested in the autumn, the tractor drove directly into the orchard and could pick the fruit while standing.
At present, the Apple base has gradually entered a period of high production, and the market is as expected by Hou Jianwen. Apple does not worry about selling, and is loved by consumers in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and other cities.
The growing apple industry has brought new changes to Li Yuanzhong's life. Although he is still farming land, he has a new source of income.
Li Yuanzhong's family has transferred more than 9 acres of land to the Apple base. Every year, in addition to maintaining the bottom of the land transfer fee, there are profit dividends after hanging the fruit. The couple usually work in the base, "one person gets 80 yuan a day and has work to do all year round."
Li Yuanzhong told reporters that last year's profit dividend earned more than 2,800 yuan, plus the land transfer fee and the husband and wife's work income, the family earned more than 80,000 yuan, "food and clothing do not worry, a moderately well-off life has been lived."
"At present, it has begun to show results. The annual output value of an acre of apples exceeds 15,000 yuan, about 10 times that of growing corn."
Chen Chao told reporters that at present, 20,000 mu of apples have been planted in the whole town of Jinna, and there are 6,000 mu in Zhonghai Village alone, covering 4,056 rural households and 17,200 people, including 656 poor households and 2,952 people who have built filing cards, and more than 6 million yuan in wages have been paid in a year, truly realizing that the base is built in front of their homes, and that there is no need to work outside.
Li Yuanzhong, with his bulging purse, also began to realize his "wishes."
This year's Lunar New Year, Li Yuanzhong bought a Land Cruiser and now drives his car to and from work every day. "There are still more than a dozen acres of land at home, such as the next step in the expansion of the Apple base, all of which will be transferred to them, and the income will be more."

Membrane separation technology helps crack the "greenhouse effect"
Membrane separation technology helps crack the "greenhouse effect"
Diagram of Preparation Technology of New Hybrid Matrix Film
This newspaper reporter Shang Rui reported: Recently, the atmospheric environment and bioenergy team of Tianjin University has made significant progress in "carbon dioxide capture by membrane separation method", successfully developed a new hybrid matrix membrane preparation technology, and greatly improved the carbon dioxide capture performance of membrane materials.
The results have been published as a cover article in the international journal Greenhouse Gases: Science and Technology.
The "greenhouse effect" is a major environmental problem perplexing human development, and carbon dioxide emissions are the culprit of the "greenhouse effect".
How to capture and utilize human carbon dioxide efficiently is the focus of scientists' attention.
"Membrane separation method" is a new carbon dioxide capture technology. It separates carbon dioxide gas with the help of membrane materials, which has the characteristics of high efficiency, energy saving and simple operation.
How to make membrane materials "breathe deeply" and improve the efficiency of gas separation is the bottleneck and difficulty of capturing carbon dioxide by membrane separation method.
The scientific research team of Tianjin University has an innovative idea to explore the influence of different solvents on the gas separation performance of films through repeated experiments.
The experimental results show that the carbon nanotubes produced by N-methylpyrrolidone are more evenly distributed and "more breathable" in the membrane material, effectively improving the gas separation efficiency and rate of the membrane material.
The carbon dioxide separation performance of mixed matrix films prepared by this new technology is close to the theoretical separation limit of this kind of membrane materials.
"The new technology provides a new idea for capturing carbon dioxide by membrane separation."
Li Run, a member of the atmospheric environment and bioenergy team of Tianjin University, said: "We hope this technology can provide strong support for the treatment of flue gas by coal-fired power plants and chemical enterprises in the future, and play an important role in controlling greenhouse gas emissions."
Find out what professional grade difference is before you volunteer.

Find out what professional grade is before you volunteer
Every year, there are students or parents who volunteer for the college entrance examination because they do not understand the terms involved in the voluntary application, which affects the voluntary application.
This year, five colleges and universities, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing University of Science and Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing Forestry University and Beijing Chemical University, jointly issued enrollment policies for 2020, eliminating professional grade differences.
What is the meaning of professional grade difference and what is the significance in voluntary filing?
There are three ways to assign professional rules
Experts remind that before filling in the volunteer, it is important to read the "Admission Charter" of the desired school and understand the admission rules of colleges and universities, including the transfer ratio, the rules of professional allocation, etc.
The rules of professional allocation refer to the three ways of professional priority, score priority and professional grade difference for professional admission after the transfer of colleges and universities.
The specific way used by colleges and universities will be made clear in the Admission Charter.
But there are also some colleges and universities whose admission principle is to give priority to the total score, and there is no grade difference between the majors.
That is, the candidates within the admission range will be lined up according to the total score, when the score does not reach the voluntary admission score for the first major, it will see whether the voluntary admission score for the second major has been reached, and so on until the admission to the last professional volunteer, and there is no grade difference between the professional volunteers.
The so-called "professional grade difference" means that, when arranging candidates' majors, institutions determine the admission majors of volunteer candidates for different majors according to one or more score values published in the admission regulations. This score value is "professional grade difference".
This is the score difference between the first professional volunteer and the non-first professional volunteer in the admission of candidates, and the grade difference between the various professional volunteers, such as 3, 2, 1, etc.
Take for example.
Suppose the student Xiaoming applied for the examination of A university and scored 560 points, and his professional volunteers were: computer, international trade, automation, mechanical engineering, e-commerce. The professional admission of A university implemented the method of professional grade difference, which was divided into 2, 1, 1 and 0 points.
In the professional assignment, if Xiaoming's first major volunteer meets the professional admission requirements and the major has a planned balance, then Xiaoming will be admitted to the "computer" major; if the computer is not accepted, his score will be reduced by 2 points, according to the ranking of 558 points with the candidates who volunteer for the "international trade" examination in the first major, to determine whether they meet the professional admission conditions; if the score is still not met, the score will be reduced by 1 point (i.e. 556 points) for the admission of the fourth major, and so on.
Different professional grade difference settings in different universities
With the popularization of parallel volunteering, many colleges and universities have now abolished professional grade differentials, but some colleges and universities have still retained this method this year. According to the Admission Charter published by various schools, more than 20 universities have mainly set up professional grade differentials this year.
For example, Sichuan Agricultural University, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Heilongjiang University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Jiangxi Normal University, Chengdu Medical College, Northeast Electric Power University, Jimei University, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing University of Technology, Ningxia University, Shandong University of Technology, China Civil Aviation Flight Institute, etc.
In these colleges and universities, the professional grades set by each university are different.
Some colleges and universities have grade differences in each major, such as Ningxia University. Candidates whose files have been submitted to the university are admitted by grade after decreasing one point in the order in which the candidates fill in their professional volunteers.
Some universities have set different professional grades between different majors.
In Jimei University, for example, the total difference between professional volunteers is 4 points, that is, the difference between the first professional volunteer and other professional volunteers is 3 points, there is no difference between other professional volunteers, which is considered as a parallel volunteer, and the difference between other professional volunteers and professional volunteers is 1 point.
When applying for volunteers, candidates and parents must carefully read the admission policy of the reported school to see if there is a professional grade difference and what the form of the grade difference is. While giving full consideration to the score, they should also make a reasonable analysis of the schools and majors to be selected. If the institution clearly adopts the method of score difference in its admission charter, candidates should pay attention to the gradient between the various majors when choosing a major to improve the admission probability.

The first Atlantic hurricane this year made landfall in pandemic-hit Texas
That morning, the National Hurricane Center announced that Hurricane Hanna, which reached 145 kilometers per hour, was expected to bring heavy rainfall to southern Texas and northeastern Mexico until Monday, which in turn would cause rapid flooding.
At present, with the gradual advance to the land, the custom has weakened somewhat, and although there are power outages in some areas, there are no statistical reports of casualties for the time being.
Some local officials in Texas are preparing for a possible tornado along the coast.
President Trump said via Twitter that his office was closely monitoring the developments of Hurricane Hanna and Hurricane Douglas in Hawaii, and called on people to listen to emergency management information from local governments and protect families and property.
At the same time, the new outbreak in Texas is also rapidly worsening, with the number of infections soaring, with more than 390,000 confirmed infections and more than 5,000 deaths.
When the hurricane hits, the government will face the dual challenge of accommodating the homeless and preventing the epidemic from worsening again.

[Editor: Haifeng Chen]
Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, July 25: The Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, Edward Yau, said on July 25 that all APEC member economies should act in concert to fight the epidemic and promote economic recovery, and should avoid establishing unnecessary trade barriers in accordance with the rights and obligations set out in the World Trade Organization.
Qiu Tenghua made the above statement when he participated in the video conference of trade ministers on combating the new pneumonia epidemic held by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) on the 25th.
At the meeting, participating ministers exchanged views on the substantive measures that APEC could take to deal with the impact of the new pneumonia epidemic and to promote economic recovery in the region.
Qiu Tenghua said that the public health and economic crisis triggered by the epidemic had brought unprecedented and far-reaching effects on society and the economy.
"We are in a double battle. We must defeat the epidemic before we can save the economy.
We should have a clear goal. The virus is our common enemy. Only cooperation can win, and vice versa will only fail.
Qiu said a series of trade restrictions caused by the new pneumonia outbreak would not help to control the epidemic.
Trade was a key solution to the current problem and should not be seen as the problem.
He condemned all discriminatory and divisive policy measures and urged all economies to keep their borders open, maintain the smooth functioning of supply chains and avoid establishing trade barriers or adopting irrational trade policies at this critical juncture.

People Pack Around US Consulate in Chengdu Police Stop People "Looking Too Happy"
In response to the US closure of the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, China announced the closure of the US Consulate General in Chengdu on Friday.
On Saturday, the insignia of the US consulate was removed, and on Sunday, a dark glass car left the consulate amid boos from passers-by.
On Sunday, many people in Chengdu gathered in front of the US consulate to take pictures, and those who had not come also came to see it driven by curiosity about current events.
The reporter of Agence France-Presse Chengdu Station also went to the vicinity of the US Consulate in Chengdu to observe some time, and sent back news that there was a steady stream of people, and many parents came to walk with their children to watch the Consulate, take pictures of the building, or take selfies.
The consulate was surrounded by guards, and the police occasionally "corrected" people's behavior, and they did not seem to allow any outrageous behavior: a woman was stopped just as she was about to sing a red song, and a guard confiscated a banner.
But residents of a nearby residential building succeeded in pulling up a giant Chinese flag on their balcony and shouting pro-China slogans.
The US Consulate in Chengdu opened in 1985 and covers all US consular affairs in southwest China, especially the Tibet Autonomous Region.
The AFP Chengdu station reporter said that the Chinese government's response to the United States was relatively restrained: many Chinese people online asked the government to close the US Consulate in Hong Kong, but the official only said that "the closure of the US Consulate in Chengdu is a necessary and legitimate response to the unreasonable behavior of the United States."
At present, in addition to Chengdu, the United States has consulates in Guangdong, Shanghai, Shenyang, Wuhan and Hong Kong.
Large-scale Financial Media Action "Going to the Village Live to Watch Poverty Alleviation" - Today's Highlights - Hunan Daily Network - Huasheng Online
Hunan Daily and New Hunan Client News on July 25 (this reporter) On July 25, the large-scale media integration campaign "Go to the Village Live to Watch Poverty Alleviation", hosted by the Financial Program Center of the Central Radio and Television General Station, started from Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province. Two caravans carrying the 5G new media mobile cloud broadcasting system were seen by the live guests and slowly drove out of the scene.
General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out that "2020 is a landmark year. We will build a moderately well-off society in an all-round way and achieve the first century goal. 2020 will also be the year of decisive victory in the decisive battle against poverty."
The large-scale financial media campaign "Go to the Village Live to Watch Poverty Alleviation" is an important measure of the Financial Program Center of the Central Radio and Television Station to do a good job in the publicity of poverty eradication in line with this important theme.
The operation will go into poverty alleviation villages in more than 20 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the Central Government throughout the country, dig fresh stories of poverty eradication, directly attack the great changes in the appearance of villages and villages, and show how villagers can break through the predicament of survival and development and move towards the road to wealth.
The operation will last for more than three months.
Starting from Xuzhou, the soldiers took the Southwest Line through Anhui, Hubei, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangxi, Guizhou, Sichuan, Chongqing, Yunnan and Tibet, and the Northwest Line through Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi and Hebei, covering more than 10,000 kilometers.
In the form of reporting, "Go to the Village Live to Watch Poverty Alleviation" boldly integrates.
The economic development of the villages visited by the caravan will be broadcast through CCTV Financial and Economic Channel, CCTV Economic Voice, China Communications Radio and CCTV Financial New Media.
Among them, the live television broadcast will mainly be completed on the noon news program "World Finance" of CCTV Finance and Economics Channel (premiere time: Monday to Sunday 12: 00-13: 00), and the golden news program "Economic Information Network" of CCTV Finance and Economics Channel will set up a column on poverty eradication (premiere time: Monday to Sunday 20: 30-21: 30).
At the same time, the caravan will carry out a one-hour live broadcast to each village in the CCTV financial client. By downloading CCTV financial APP, viewers can watch the live broadcast and participate in the lottery.
In the application of technology and studio design, "Go to the Village Live to Watch Poverty Alleviation" has the courage to break through and pioneered the "outfield new media caravan".
The car is equipped with a 5G new media mobile cloud broadcasting system, which uses 5G + 4K / 8K + AI technology to realize the organic combination of online and offline, large and small screens and television broadcasting.
Equipped with a three-signal broadcast area, the broadcast area is converted from a container, which is 12 meters long, 2.55 meters wide and 3.98 meters high. The box body adopts a hydraulic automatic expansion structure and can be turned up to a maximum of 120 degrees.
The studio area can also be expanded automatically, and the external expansion platform, with an area of more than 50 square meters, can meet the scene requirements of most programs.
At present, the Dongchuan District of Kunming City is already hot in summer, and what is hotter than the weather is the poverty alleviation workshop next to the relocation site.
"Now, as soon as you get out of the house, you enter the factory door and make money and take care of the family, thanks to the free vocational skills training of the trade union organization," said Lu Ling, an employee of the Kunming Esford Electronic Technology Company.
Walking into the poverty alleviation workshop of electronic component processing in the copper capital of Dongchuan District, a busy picture of heat came into view.
In her 40s, Lu Ling is a single mother who takes care of her elderly parents.
In her most difficult time, the Dongchuan District Federation of Trade Unions helped to come up with ideas and ways to "send money in the snow" after being busy before running.
Since 2018, Lu Ling has benefited from assistance policies such as housing, schooling, social security and employment, as well as assistance grants from trade unions at all levels.
This year, her children have successfully graduated and been employed, and she herself has a job and income after attending skills training, and was out of trouble at the end of April.
It is reported that the special skills training project of the Dongchuan District General Organization to help fight poverty is part of the skills training work of the Yunnan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions.
Taking into account the characteristics of the difficult workers in the poverty alleviation relocation and resettlement sites in the area, the district will conduct an in-depth investigation to understand the training needs and determine the types of training, and plans to train a total of 450 electricians, welders and noodle artists in the near future.
Recently, Li Yi, an employee of the Menglian County Branch of the Agricultural Bank of Yunnan, wrote a sincere thank-you letter to the County General Trade Union.
In her letter, she expressed her sincere gratitude to the union for the grant she received from August 2013 to January 2017 to help her complete her studies.
In 2004, Li Yi's father died in a car accident, and her mother was included in the file of workers in difficulty. Since then, she has been enjoying the care of the policy of building a file card.
With the help of the local trade union, Li Yi successfully completed his studies.
Since 2016, 3,809 households have been lifted out of poverty through institutional guarantees and precise assistance.
The successful relief of the Lu Ling family and Li Yi is a microcosm of the work of Yunnan trade unions to promote the relief and relief of workers in difficulty.
According to Duan Kaiyuan, a staff member of the Legal and Human Rights Work Department of the Yunnan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the province has always strengthened the dynamic management of the files of workers in difficulty, promoted the normalization of the work of filing, and for workers in difficulty who meet the conditions for filing, they are promptly integrated into the assistance system.
During the epidemic period, it was difficult for migrant workers to go out to work. In order to help ease the living pressure of workers in difficulty at the national level, Yunnan Province arranged more than 13 million yuan in warm relief funds, and implemented special warm relief activities for more than 6,000 families at the national level and more than 1,000 families at the provincial level, in accordance with the standards of 2,000 yuan per family of workers in difficulty at the national level and 1,500 yuan per family of workers in difficulty at the provincial level.
At the same time, the General Administration of the Province has connected with various Internet recruitment platforms, such as the Department of Human and Social Affairs and the Intellectual Recruitment Union, to push recruitment information to workers in difficulty, and to provide employment counselling, employment guidance and other services.
