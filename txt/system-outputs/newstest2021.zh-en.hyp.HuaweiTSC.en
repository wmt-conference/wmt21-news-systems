Where do you find talent?
The outstanding group of returning migrant workers is an indispensable fresh force.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 26, by wire: Make outstanding returning migrant workers a fresh force for rural revitalization
Zhang Xiongjia, 34, is in Orchard Village, Meishan City, Sichuan Province. In 2010, he quit his job in Beijing, which earned tens of thousands of dollars a month, and returned home to start a business.
After several years of hard work, he now runs a grape growing family farm with an annual income of more than one million yuan, making him a little famous leader in becoming rich. He has also been selected to enter the village "two committees" team.
In recent years, inspired by a series of policies to support agriculture and benefit farmers, such as the national fight against poverty and rural revitalization, more and more outstanding migrant workers like Zhang Xiong have chosen to return home to start their own businesses, activating a pool of spring water in the countryside.
Sichuan, a populous province and a major labor export province in the western part of China, has implemented the "Outstanding Migrant Workers Return and Training Project" in light of the situation. In 2019 alone, more than 8,000 village party branch secretaries will be produced from among the outstanding migrant workers returned, 61,000 village reserve forces will be nurtured and more than 20,000 Party members will be developed, providing a strong guarantee for winning the battle against poverty and implementing the rural revitalization strategy.
If a well-off society is not a well-off society, the key depends on the townsfolk.
Since the reform and opening up, a large number of young and middle-aged laborers in rural areas of China have gone out to work to increase their income, and some have set up their own enterprises through hard work.
However, objectively, it has also led to the emergence of "hollowing out" in rural areas to varying degrees, especially the weakening of grass-roots organizations in rural areas. Both the secretaries of village party branches and the ranks of party members have shown the characteristics of "one old and one low", that is, aging and academic qualifications are low, and the team of leaders of village party organizations is not strong and the problems of green and yellow are prominent.
If rural talents and other elements have been flowing to the city in one direction, and the countryside has been in a state of "blood loss" and "anemia" for a long time, revitalization is an empty word.
Attract back migrant workers who are capable, conscious and interested in serving their hometown, guide them to return home and start businesses to become leaders in becoming rich, train them to become Party members and village cadres on the basis of merit, and enrich the ranks of cadres at the grass-roots level. This is a solution to the root causes of the shortage of rural Party members and grass-roots Party organizations.
Outstanding migrant workers can be brought back, and they should be allowed to stay and do a good job.
In recent years, Sichuan has started by focusing on the Party building of migrant workers. On the basis of strict selection criteria, it has established institutional mechanisms such as targeted return, service guarantee, training and enhancement, selection and use of outstanding migrant workers, so that they can improve their abilities, have security in their work and have hope in their lives. They can truly take root in the countryside and have a sense of achievement in starting their own businesses.
This year is the closing year of the decisive battle against poverty. Talent is the key factor in making a good connection between the fight against poverty and the revitalization of the countryside.
Party committees and governments at all levels should attach great importance to the group of outstanding returning migrant workers and, through comprehensive measures, establish them as a task force and fresh force that can stay, fight and take them away, so as to provide strong organizational guarantee and talent support for rural poverty eradication and well-off and development and revitalization.
Because of the epidemic, this year's college graduates are a very special class. On the evening of July 11, the bilibili Summer Graduation Song Club brought a special live online performance to the graduates. Musicians such as Lao Wolf, Park Shu, Li Yuchun and Mao Yi sent songs and blessings to the recent graduates.
Wu Yifan, the well-known up owner, also brought a "Wild GraSS", a rap style song based on Lu Xun's prose and poetry collection of the same name, which is extremely popular among young people.
Due to the epidemic, many graduates failed to appreciate the sense of ceremony of dialing ears and awarding degree certificates on the spot, so they transferred the sense of ceremony online.
The data showed that the live popularity of the 2.5-hour song party peaked at more than 35 million.
"Follow your heart, seize the opportunity and do not care about the consequences. Sometimes, there will be unexpected gains."
Although it is a graduation song party, many songs also moved non-recent graduates.
"The whole scene really wants to cry. Whose youth is full of beauty and regret, but it is worth remembering. We must go on bravely."
Beijing's natural ecology continues to improve to attract more than 500 species of wildlife cities to "settle" -- ScienceDaily

The natural ecology of the capital continues to improve to attract wildlife cities to "settle".
There are more than 500 species of wild animals in Beijing.
This newspaper (reporter Wang Bin) A reporter from Beijing Youth Daily learned from the Municipal Landscape and Greening Bureau that as the natural ecological environment of the capital has continued to improve in recent years, the species and number of wild animals have also continued to increase.
At present, the number of terrestrial spinal wild animals inhabiting Beijing has increased to more than 500, including state-level protected animals such as brown horse chicken and black stork, as well as state-level protected animals such as wildebeest, swan, gray crane and mandarin duck.
Whether it is planted into urban forests everywhere within the Second Ring or small and micro wetlands embedded between buildings, it not only brings the wild interest of nature to the citizens of the capital, but also attracts wild animals to "settle" in the city.
In the height of summer, the Songshan National Nature Reserve, located in the Yanshan Mountains in the northwest of Yanqing District, is vibrant.
A young man played leisurely by the mountain stream, while two dogs and badgers fought with each other.
In retrospect, a wild boar could not help but "scratch" on his body and was rubbing hard against the bark of the tree. Hu Qiaoli, director of the Matsuyama National Nature Reserve Administration, said that by the end of 2019, there were 178 species of wild animals, including golden eagles, state-level protected animals, spoon chickens and wildebeest, living in this green sea with a total area of more than 6,200 hectares. Nearly one third of the wildlife species in the city can be seen here.
"In Matsuyama, wild animals are the true 'owners', and our staff can only be regarded as the 'bodyguards' of others at best."
Hu Qiaoli said that in order to understand the wildlife situation in the reserve on the ground, more than 30 professional rangers inspect 16 carefully formulated protection routes every day. There will also be a "big circle" every month, spending a whole day traveling almost all over the reserve.
"During the inspection, it is necessary not only to check and record the biodiversity, but also to check the installation of artificial nests, rescue injured wild animals, install infrared cameras in the field and so on."
More than 200 infrared cameras have been installed in the Songshan National Nature Reserve to record the living conditions of wildlife in the forest.
Hu Qiaoli said that with the continuous enrichment of biodiversity in protected areas in recent years, more and more wild animals have appeared in the camera. Leopard cats, roebuck and pig badgers have become "resident guests", and the "mirror rate" of wildebeest, a second-class national protected animal, has become higher and higher.
Zhang Zhiming, Director of Wildlife and Wetland Protection of the Beijing Landscape and Greening Bureau, said that the number of terrestrial spinal wildlife in Beijing has increased from 461 in 1994 to more than 500 now. The species and number of wildlife in Beijing have continued to increase in recent years.
The figure of wild animals in cities is becoming more and more common, which is closely related to the continuous upgrading of urban greening in the capital in recent years.
In particular, a new round of million-acre afforestation construction, which began in 2018, proposed to reshape the urban ecological environment, enhance the ecological function of woodland green space and highlight the concept of "near nature".
In the planning, we strive to achieve interconnection and interaction with the surrounding green areas, so as to facilitate wild animals to "visit relatives and friends". The trees planted are also popular honey and food source plants for animals.
Black land "planted" agricultural modernization - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 26, by wire: Black land "planted" agricultural modernization
In the height of summer, two pharmaceutical spraying aircraft skimmed the 10,000-acre high-yield demonstration field at the second operation station of the Fifth Management Area of Friendship Farm, forming two white lines. The words "the first field in the world" planted with black rice seedlings in the green field stood out.
Kong Lingqiang, the station manager of the operation station, said that the aircraft can spray more than 6,000 mu of arable land a day, which is about eight times more efficient than drones and hundreds of times more efficient than manual labor.
This farm is located in Friendship County, Heilongjiang Province, the largest grain producing province in China. From the sound of "Shua Shua" rice cutting in the past to the sound of "rumble" today, traditional Chinese farming and farms have achieved metamorphosis in this black soil belt.
In addition to aircraft, satellites are also used in the modern agricultural production of Friendship Farm.
Kong Lingqiang introduced that on the one hand, they use satellite remote sensing technology to achieve precise fertilization, reduce agricultural inputs and reduce pollution. On the other hand, satellite navigation technology can improve the level of standardized operation of agricultural machinery in the field.
In the process of rice production this year, the farm expanded the operating area of satellite navigation unmanned transplanting technology from 3,000 mu last year to 30,000 mu.
This technology makes seedling planting more uniform, maximizes the utilization of sunlight and cultivated land resources, and can also save 16 yuan per acre in labor costs.
Farms have tried new technologies such as informatization and intelligentization in agricultural production, forming the largest agricultural machinery group in China from the ground to the sky.
According to statistics, at present, the total number of agricultural machinery on farms is 49,000 units (pieces), and the comprehensive mechanization rate in the field has reached 99.8%.
Agricultural machinery operations achieve 100% GPS satellite navigation, 100% precision sowing in dry fields and 100% high-powered locomotive operations in dry fields.
"Green agriculture, smart agriculture and digital agriculture are the exploration direction of agricultural modernization."
Liu Hualian, director of Friendship Farm, said.
The key to agricultural modernization lies in scientific and technological progress.
Heilongjiang Agricultural Reclamation, represented by farms, has played a demonstration and leading role in modern large agricultural "aircraft carriers" in recent years, and has initially established a modern agricultural industry system dominated by large-scale planting, standardized production and industrial management.
On the outskirts of Friendship County, there is an agricultural machinery Expo Park covering an area of 350,000 square meters.
More than 140 agricultural machinery and equipment introduced and used by Heilongjiang Agricultural Reclamation over the years are on display here.
These agricultural machinery, equipment and farms have witnessed the development of agricultural modernization in China.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, July 26, by wire: Xie Xiaojia for everyone - the transfer of people of all ethnic groups in the Jiangkou River Union in Hefei, Anhui Province
Xinhua News Agency reporters Chen Shangying, Wang Liwu, Liu Xia Cun
On July 25, at about 4 p.m., Fu Kunbao, wearing muddy rubber shoes, went from the front house to the back room and went back and forth with his wife, Zhou Yan, busy packing up his things.
"When I received a phone call from village cadres to transfer, I was still cutting grass in the field."
Fu Kunbao said that he has transferred more than 60 acres of land and grown rice, which is now growing well. "He also took medicine yesterday, and his tools and everything have not been cleaned up."
Fu Kunbao pointed to the pesticide sprayer placed in the corner. "No one wants their home to be flooded. Give up their small home for everyone."
In order to cope with the persistent high water level pressure and possible heavy rainfall in Chaohu Lake, the city of Hefei, Anhui Province, is ready to open the flood diversion storage of Jiangkou River Union County, where Fu Kunbaojia is located, on the 26th.
Jiangkou River Union County is located in Feixi County, next to the Chaohu levee.
There are thousands of villagers involved in Yan Dian Township and Sanhe Township who need to be transferred.
As of 1600 hours on the 25th, the water level of Chaohu Lake, the fifth largest freshwater lake in China, remained at a high of 13.2 meters, exceeding the guaranteed water level by 0.7 meters.
The kitchen of Fu Kunbao's house is clean, with a pot of pumpkin head vegetables on the table, as well as eggs and some brine vegetables in the fridge.
"I didn't expect to move. The water of the Chiangkou River is looking good at present."
Zhou Yan said that the home is a bungalow, and some large objects have not yet thought where to put them for the time being.
"Pack up the valuable items first. Refrigerators and televisions can be put in the homes of neighbors or relatives on high ground for the time being."
Wang Li, a village cadre, gave Fu Kunbao advice.
Wang Lizheng is responsible for the transfer and resettlement of 13 villagers, with one household notified to confirm the resettlement plan of each person.
The closest settlement to Fu Kunbao's family is Su Xiaoxue, Yan Dian Township, about 2 kilometers away.
In addition to large pieces, Fu Kunbao and his wife also have a headache with more than 1,000 jin of grain and some newly bought furniture in their home.
"The grain is ready to be dragged to relatives' homes. There is no way to move the furniture."
As soon as the couple discussed, they put a stool under the newly bought bed and raised the bed by about half a meter.
At 6 p.m., Fu Kunbao began to use a tricycle to transport things to relatives' homes, and Zhou Yan continued to clean up at home.
At about 11 p.m., the couple looked at it before and after at home, pulled the electric gate and prepared to go to the settlement.
"I hope the water will return early."
Fu Kunbao said.
On July 26, at 9: 30 a.m., the reporter saw at the scene of Jiangkou River Union County that the local area had made all preparations before flood diversion.
Zhang Ji Colin small house team to support muscular teenagers - Xinhua
The sports youth warm-blooded competitive show "Sports Bar Teenager" officially landed on Hunan TV on July 11.
Sports leader Zhang Jike and sports assistant Lin Xiaojia shared the stage across the border. Lindane and Fu Yuanhui had their own styles of comments, while the hardcore of the "behemoth" power pull device made the program "burn".
In the first episode, 11 sports teenagers appeared on the power track, stunning the live audience. At the same time, the "strong conflict", "strong confrontation" and "strong heart" on the competitive stage also received attention.
Among them, the "strong conflict" came from Super A sports student Qiao Wenyi, who openly provoked Xu Zhibin, known as the "beautiful man" on the same track, before the competition. He choked that Xu Zhibin's appearance condition should sing and dance the program, and even let out the harsh words "Don' t cry your makeup if you lose".
Some remarks made the teenagers and sports leaders on the field gasp.
And "strong confrontation" is more like a fairy fight. Sun Jianqi, known as the "Great Devil King", met Zhang Xindong, who was also strong, and staged a strong matchup.
And their identity is also unexpected. Sun Jianqi is an actor who loves fitness, while Zhang Xindong is a retired special warfare team member and three-time Warrior Medal recipient.
At the beginning of the competition, the two teenagers made every effort to pull out the small pole quickly. The lasting confrontation on the large pole made the live audience sweat for them.
Under the tense competition conditions, Zhang Jike, as one of the leaders of the "Sports Bar Teenager" movement, also watched the war carefully.
In the comment session, he was also very careful, patiently encouraging the young man who lost the game and helping every mistake point in the process of resuming the game.
Lin Xiaojia, a sports assistant, is a fancy assist. She has made no secret of her appreciation for the teenagers with face value strength online.
When I learn about the overloaded daily training of sports teenagers, I admire it even more.
Lindane and Fu Yuanhui, who are also sports leaders, have their own styles. One is a calm "prophet" and the other is a "flood girl" who dispels the tension with a smile.
In addition, Ji Ke Junyi and Liu Ye, as sports assistants, have also created a lot of explosive topics around sports teenagers.
Church fire in Nantes, France: Parish volunteers admit to arson and are usually kind and taciturn - CNN
On July 26, according to foreign media, on July 18, the famous Cathedral of St. Peter and St. Paul, a gem of religious and historical buildings in Nantes, France, was severely damaged in a fire, and the large organ was completely destroyed.
On the 26th local time, the Nantes prosecutor announced that a parish volunteer in charge of security in the cathedral had been charged with "arson and destruction".
He has admitted that he set the fire in the church.
According to the report, local prosecutor Senas said that the 39-year-old parish volunteer from Rwanda admitted that he set fire to three of the cathedrals at night.
The lawyer of the man said that the arsonist now regrets doing such a thing.
This man entered France a few years ago through the means of asylum. He was sheltered in the parish where the fire occurred and taken in in the church.
The prosecution pointed out that recently, he tried to renew his visa and was in dialogue and communication with the police station on this issue.
However, the church said it still could not believe that the usually very kind, smiling, but not very talkative believer would destroy the church he loved so much.
On the day of the fire on July 18, the volunteer had already been questioned and investigated by the police because of illogical problems in his account, but he was later released.
The picture shows firefighters carrying out rescue at the scene.
On the evening of the 25th, the man was arraigned again because the professional engineers of the laboratory of the Central Police Department in Paris obtained new evidence.
This time, the man admitted to setting the fire.
It is reported that if convicted of intentional arson and destruction, the suspect may face 10 years' imprisonment and a fine of 150,000 euros.
According to the report, the fire caused serious losses to the Cathedral of St. Pierre and St. Paul. The organ in the church was completely destroyed and the colored glass windows behind the organ were also severely damaged.
According to Brunet, the chief architect of French historical conservation buildings, it is conservatively estimated that the restoration of Nantes Cathedral will take at least three years.
Comprehensive news: American unilateralism undermines bilateral relations. International public opinion supports China's countermeasure against the United States - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26 (Xinhua) -- On the morning of July 24, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the US Embassy in China that China had decided to revoke the establishment and operation license of the US Consulate General in Chengdu and put forward specific requirements for the Consulate General to stop all business and activities.
International public opinion believes that the unilateralist measures taken by the United States have caused serious distress to the relations between China and the United States. China has responded to unreasonable provocations by the United States, and it is legitimate and necessary to take countermeasures.
Andres Borks, director of the China Research Center of the Institute of International Studies at the University of Chile, said that the unilateralist measures of the United States have damaged the bridge of understanding between the Chinese and American peoples and caused a crisis in the relations between the two great powers.
China's notification to the United States of the closure of its Consulate General in Chengdu is a countermeasure to the unilateral measures of the United States and is in line with diplomatic practice.
Patricio Justo, a professor at the Catholic University of Argentina and director of the Arab-China Research Center, believes that China's above decision is a legitimate and necessary countermeasure to the previous provocations of the United States and is not aimed at ordinary Americans.
The United States is trying to divert the attention of the American people by pressuring China to cover up its poor response to the new crown epidemic.
Bambang Suryono, chairman of the Asian Innovation Research Center, an Indonesian think tank, said that the United States has adopted a provocative diplomatic posture, which has caused serious distress to the relations between China and the United States, which are facing serious challenges.
China's notification to the United States of the closure of its Consulate General in Chengdu is a normal countermeasure, in line with diplomatic practice, and not only reflects China's principled position of resolutely safeguarding its own interests, but also reflects the rational and beneficial nature of China's diplomacy.
Tanzanian commentator Francis Semwinza said that China's above decision is a legitimate and necessary response to the provocation of the United States.
In order for China-US relations to return to normal, the United States should take the initiative to improve relations with China and stop interfering in China's internal affairs.
The United States should focus on how to achieve win-win economic and political results with China and how to benefit the two peoples and the international community as a whole.
Ali Youssef, executive director of the Sudan-based Federation of Arab Indigenous China Friendship Associations, said that the countermeasures China is forced to take are a legitimate and necessary response to the unreasonable actions of the United States, in line with international law and the basic norms of international relations, as well as in line with diplomatic practices.
Previously, the United States requested the closure of the Chinese Consulate General in Houston in serious violation of international law and the basic norms of international relations.
It is hoped that the United States will revoke the previous relevant decisions and create the necessary conditions for the return of bilateral relations to normal.
Singapore's Lianhe Zaobao newspaper published an editorial saying that the greater strategic intention of the United States is to encircle China and prevent China from continuing to rise.
In the face of the pressure of the United States, although China is very reluctant to see China-US relations continue to deteriorate, it has to take countermeasures.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 26 (Xinhua) -- A reporter learned from the Guangdong Maritime Police Bureau that recently, the bureau, in conjunction with the Guangzhou Customs and public security departments, knocked out a huge refined oil smuggling gang and preliminarily verified that the gang had smuggled about 120,000 tons of refined oil products since 2019, with a case value of about 800 million yuan and tax evasion of about 240 million yuan.
The Guangdong Maritime Police Bureau and the customs anti-smuggling department jointly gradually mapped out the personnel division of labor and organizational structure of the gang.
On July 8, the maritime police, customs and public security departments carried out unified network collection operations in Guangzhou, Foshan and other places, as well as the waters of the Pearl River Estuary, respectively. Four ships suspected of smuggling were seized at the scene, a total of 4,700 tons of refined oil products were seized at the ships and oil depots involved, respectively, and a number of fund accounts were frozen.
It is understood that a total of eight ships and two helicopters were deployed in the joint operation, which was divided into a number of action groups to work together to carry out a full-chain crackdown on smuggling at sea and illegal operations on land. All 35 major criminal suspects arrived at the case.
At present, the case is under further investigation and handling.
The relevant person in charge of the Guangdong Maritime Police Bureau said that in the future, he will continue to maintain a high-pressure situation, crack down on all kinds of illegal and criminal smuggling activities at sea, and maintain good order in the sea areas under his jurisdiction.
Hurricane Hannah made landfall in Texas or triggered river surges and flash floods -- ScienceDaily
On July 26, CNN comprehensive foreign media reported that at 5 p.m. local time on July 25, Hurricane Hannah made landfall in Texas, United States, which will bring strong winds and heavy rain to Texas, surging rivers and may also trigger life-threatening flash floods.
The National Hurricane Center said Hurricane Hannah is expected to carry heavy rain and sweep through parts of southern and northeastern Texas. The rain may cause some streams to soar and life-threatening flash floods.
According to the report, the most severely affected by Hurricane Hannah is the area south of Corpus Christi to the mouth of the Rio Grande River, while widespread flash floods may erupt in the Rio Grande Valley.
Texas Governor Abbott said on the 25th: "Any hurricane is a huge challenge."
Thirty-two counties in the state have entered a disaster emergency because of the hurricane.
Corpus Christi, a city with a population of more than 320,000, has closed its libraries and museums, and residents are bracing for it.
Abbott also said that at a time when Texas is being hit hard by the new crown epidemic, the hurricane can no longer be allowed to bring more casualties to Texas.
It is reported that precipitation in southern Texas is expected to reach 6 to 12 inches on the night of the 26th, while northern Texas and coastal Louisiana will also see 3 to 5 inches of rain.
Due to the influence of global warming and other factors, the formation of "Hannah" predates the previous Atlantic hurricane season.
In general, the first hurricane in the Atlantic usually does not form until mid-August.
Poland will withdraw from the European treaty to prevent violence against women.
The Polish Ministry of Justice said on Saturday that Poland will take steps next week to withdraw from the European Treaty on the Prevention of Violence against Women.
Poland's right-wing government cabinet said the treaty requires schools to teach students about gender issues, trampling on the rights of students' parents.
Polish Justice Minister Gioblo held a press conference and said that his Ministry of Justice will make a request to the Ministry of Labour and Family on Monday to begin withdrawing from the treaty.
That treaty is also known as the Istanbul Convention.
Gioblo said, "The treaty contains some elements of the morphological nature of meaning that we consider to be harmful."
Poland's ruling Law and Justice Party and its ruling coalition partners have a close alliance with the Roman Catholic Church and promote a conservative social agenda.
Polish President Duda made hostility to gay rights one of the main issues during his successful re-election campaign this month.
On Friday, thousands of Poles, most of them women, protested against withdrawing from the convention in Warsaw and some other cities.
Lempath, one of the organizers of the protest, said at the protest march held in Warsaw that "the purpose of withdrawing from the treaty is to legalize domestic violence".
Some protesters held banners that read, "The Law and Justice Party is a hell for women".
The Law and Justice Party has long complained about the Istanbul Convention.
Poland's previous centrist government ratified the convention in 2015.
The Law and Justice Party government says the treaty does not respect religion and requires liberal social policies to be taught in schools.
However, up to now, the party has not decided to withdraw from the convention.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 25 (Xinhua) -- According to the plan of the Russian Ministry of Defense, the Ka-52M, an upgraded version of the Russian helicopter gunship (hereinafter referred to as Wuzhi) Ka-52, will be transformed and replaced and go out of the factory for the first time in December this year. The model will be greatly improved in reconnaissance, communications and weapons performance.
According to a recent report in Russia's Yediot, Wuzhika-52M is called "Super Alligator". Its development contract was signed by the Russian military and military industrial units in April last year. At present, the first two upgraded Wuzhi are being transformed and replaced at the Far East Helicopter Manufacturing Plant of the Russian "Progress" Aerospace Group Corporation. Its state-level testing and improvement finishing work will be completed by October 2022.
According to Russian experts with knowledge of the above upgrade work, Wuzhika-52, the "predecessor" of the "super alligator", was officially installed in November 2011. The model exposed some weaknesses in its use. This upgrade is precisely to "fill the short board".
The report said that the weight of the cockpit will not be increased, thus increasing the probability of battlefield survival. It will be equipped with more powerful generators to power more complex airborne electronic equipment. The photovoltaic system will be upgraded to be able to detect and identify battlefield targets further away from each other. The new light multi-purpose missile will be equipped to mainly attack armored combat vehicles and reinforced concrete fortifications, with a range of 20 kilometers, about twice the range of similar missiles used by Russian active armed forces. Its defense weapons and communication equipment will maximize the use of Mi-28NM helicopter gunships that can attack air targets, thus making related maintenance simple and economical.
In addition, Ka-52M will have more advanced electronic guidance systems, weapons targeting systems and navigation equipment.
Russian experts also said that it is worth noting that Ka-52M will be equipped with communication equipment to communicate with drones, so as to obtain information transmitted by nearby drones in real time in the air, such as displaying images taken by drones on the cockpit screen of the helicopter.
It is planned that the pilots of Ka-52M can directly control the drones that cooperate with them, thus improving the pilots' grasp of the battlefield situation and the guidance of long-range missiles.
According to Russian media reports, Russian Deputy Minister of Defense Klitschko said in December last year that the Russian Ministry of Defense plans to purchase more than 110 Wuzhika-52M by 2027.
The new decree stipulates that masks must be worn in indoor public places in the Campania region with immediate effect, and violators may be fined up to 1,000 euros.
On June 1, local time, the Colosseum reopened in Rome, the capital of Italy.
It is reported that according to the latest epidemic prevention decree issued by the regional government, people in the Campania region must wear masks in accordance with the epidemic prevention requirements when travelling on all public transport, as well as entering and leaving indoor public places such as shops, bars, supermarkets and pavilions.
Those who violate this regulation may be fined up to 1,000 euros.
At the same time, the decree stipulates that all passengers from non-Schengen countries entering the Campania region must be quarantined.
The regional government will authorize health institutions to coordinate the arrangement of specific hotels to isolate positive and asymptomatic persons.
The decree entered into force on July 25.
In less than an hour, three customers who entered the supermarket have accepted the fine.
Hebei has replenished 1.75 billion cubic meters of ecological water from rivers and lakes since the beginning of this year -- ScienceDaily
Xinhua News Agency, Shijiazhuang, July 26 (Reporter Wang Kun) A reporter learned from the Hebei Provincial Water Resources Department that since the beginning of this year, Hebei Province has made overall use of diversion river water and local reservoir water, and has successively implemented ecological water recharge to 28 rivers and Baiyangdian, including Hutuo River, Tanghe River and Yuma River, with a cumulative total of 1.75 billion cubic meters of ecological water recharge of rivers and lakes.
Hebei Province has seized the favorable opportunity of the South-to-North Water diversion Central Line project to increase the flow and transmission of water, and has implemented ecological water recharge using the diversion of river water to the Tanghe, Shahe and Shilong rivers.
At the same time, nine large and medium-sized reservoirs, including the Western Ocean and Dongwushi, as well as Baiyangdian, have been used to implement ecological water recharge to Shuyang and Qinglong rivers, resulting in a cumulative surface area of more than 90 square kilometers.
In order to do a good job in ecological water recharge, the Hebei Provincial Water Resources Department has actively organized and carried out the work of detecting, rectifying and strengthening hidden dangers of water recharge rivers and river cleaning, refining practical measures and strengthening inspection and management.
Through supervision and inspection and centralized unannounced visits, all kinds of problems are solved in a timely manner, ensuring the safety and order of river water recharge.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Hebei Provincial Water Resources Department, the orderly implementation of the ecological water recharge of rivers and lakes has effectively repaired the ecological environment of rivers and lakes in Hebei Province, promoted the recharge and conservation of groundwater along the coast, greatly improved the living environment and economic development environment along the route, and is of great significance for achieving the river and lake management and protection goal of "clear water, green shore, smooth rivers and beautiful scenery".
(Deutsche Welle) In the past two weeks, the number of new crown cases in Spain has picked up sharply, with thousands of new cases in many days.
The British government temporarily decided on the evening of Saturday (July 25) to remove Spain from the safe travel list from 0: 00 local time on July 26. People entering the UK from Spain must be quarantined for 14 days.
British tourists who are vacationing in Spain expressed surprise, concern and even anger when they heard about the decision, because the news came suddenly and caught them off guard.
It is reported that British Transport Secretary Grant Shapps is also currently on holiday in Spain.
Before the UK issued the isolation measures, Norway also announced that people returning to Norway from Spain would be quarantined for a period of 10 days.
France and Belgium advised their residents to abandon their holiday plans in Barcelona and surrounding areas.
Beaches in these areas are overcrowded and social distance cannot be maintained between people. At one point, the police needed to take measures to reduce the number of beachgoers.
Tourism is an important pillar industry in Spain.
Spain: It is safe here.
In response to the decision made by the United Kingdom, the Spanish Foreign Ministry said on Sunday that the outbreak in the country was under control.
Spanish Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya stressed to the media: "Spain is safe, not only for Spaniards, but also for tourists."
The Spanish government will try to persuade the British government to exclude the Balearic Islands and Canary Islands from the isolation measures.
The reason is that the infection rate of these two tourist resorts is much lower than that of the UK mainland.
In order to prevent the spread of the epidemic, the Catalonia region of Spain has also restarted the "foot ban".
Tourism is an important pillar industry in Spain, and Spain is one of the most popular resorts for British tourists.
This decision by the UK is expected to greatly affect the tourism industry in Spain.

On the first day of the Chinese volt: Beijing takes a break from the heat and heat to open the rainfall pattern - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26 (reporter Ni Yuanjin) July 26 is the first day of this year's "Zhongfu".
The windy, showers and convective weather in the early hours of the 26th dispelled the heat and heat that have enveloped the Beijing area for days. A new round of rainfall weather will continue for several days.
The Beijing Meteorological Observatory announced at 11: 00 on the 26th that there were scattered showers (accompanied by weak thunder and lightning) in Beijing on the 26th, with a daily maximum temperature of only 27 ° C. At night, it was cloudy with light to moderate rain (accompanied by weak thunder and lightning), and the minimum temperature at night was 23 ° C.
From the previous 24 to 25, the whole city of Beijing was in a high temperature blue warning, with the daily maximum temperature around 37 ° C in most areas, and local high temperatures exceeding 40 ° C.
Futian is the highest temperature, humid and sweltering day of the year. There are "three volts" a year, and the hottest is in the middle volt. This is what the Chinese people call "bitter summer".
At the time of the ambush, the family filled the barn, and there was a folk saying of "one volt of dumplings and two volts of noodles".
According to the current forecast, there will be more rainy weather in Beijing in the next three days.
The meteorological department reminded the public to minimize play in mountainous areas and guard against geological disasters.
It is understood that this year's "medium volt" has 20 days, starting on July 26 and ending on August 14.
After entering the "middle volt", people will feel weak and loss of appetite.
In the diet, you can choose green beans, coix and other foods that have the effect of clearing heat and relieving heat, strengthening spleen and appetizing, as well as bitter foods such as bitter vegetables and bitter gourd, which can help enhance appetite and remove heat.
Engines may stall FAA urgently orders inspection of 2,000 Boeing airliners - Xinhua
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an emergency airworthiness directive on the 24th, requiring emergency inspection of about 2,000 Boeing 737NG and 737 Classic airliners registered in the United States. The reason is that the air check valve of the above-mentioned airliners may cause the engine to stop in the air after it is corroded.
The FAA said that so far, it has received four reports of air parking of the engines of 737NG and 737 Classic passenger aircraft, so it has made emergency inspection requirements. The inspection targets are passenger aircraft that have been parked continuously for seven days or more and passenger aircraft that have flown less than 11 times so far after being put back into flight.
The FAA warned that if the stage 5 check valve of all two engines of the airliner is corroded, it may jam in the open position, causing the airliner to completely lose power and be unable to restart the engine.
The aviation regulator ordered that once the check valve is found to be corroded, air operators must replace this key component before the airliner is put into service again.
Boeing responded later in the day that the outbreak of the new crown outbreak led to a reduction in travel demand. As a result, many passenger aircraft were mothballed or used less, making "check valves more vulnerable to corrosion".
At the same time, Boeing said that air operators have been advised to inspect the airliners involved in the instructions. If problems are found, Boeing will provide assistance in overhauling and replacing check valves.
The Associated Press reported that passenger aircraft owned by major US air operators usually fly multiple times in a day, but after the outbreak of the new crown epidemic, a large number of passenger aircraft were grounded. With the recent slow growth of passenger travel demand, some passenger aircraft have been put back into operation.
The FAA did not release the details of the four air parking reports.
Alaska Airlines disclosed one of the incidents later on the 24th.
In a statement, the air operator said that one of its airliners was flying from Seattle, Washington, to Austin, Texas, on July 15 when an engine suddenly stalled and the airliner finally made a successful emergency landing at Austin Airport.
Alaska Airlines said that the engine of the airliner has been replaced and the engines of six airliners have been inspected in accordance with the instructions of the Federal Aviation Administration.
American Airlines, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines said on the 24th that there were no engine stalls associated with air check valves on their airliners.
Four airliners owned by American Airlines will be inspected and 28 airliners owned by United Airlines will be inspected.
Delta Air Lines said it would inspect 20 of its airliners, but did not say whether there had been engine stalls.
A number of media reports that the FAA emergency airworthiness directive is another shock to Boeing.
Lion Air Indonesia and Ethiopian Airlines each crashed a Boeing 737 MAX in October 2018 and March 2019, respectively, killing a total of 346 people.
This series of passenger aircraft was subsequently grounded worldwide, stopped production in January this year and resumed production in May.
FaA Administrator Steve Dixon admitted in June that the FAA "made a mistake" in the supervision of Boeing with regard to the 737 MAX airliner.
"Ding Dong Online! Good Teacher" will go live next week. Xue Zhaofeng leads the "Knowledge Sponsor - Xinhuanet
A new variety has come online.
The interactive knowledge sharing program "Ding Dong Online! Good Teacher" will be broadcast on Hunan TV from July 20.
It is understood that the program will create a new all-age youth classroom, and a group of teachers with face and talent will take part in the battle to challenge the export of interesting knowledge.
Unlike the serious impression of the teacher group in the hearts of the public in the past, "Ding Dong Online! Good Teachers" gathers a group of knowledge representatives with both face value and talent.
They are not only young knowledge role models from various disciplines, but also a group of all-round "paragraph hands" who can shake baggage and are good at teaching and having fun.
In the program, this group of outstanding young knowledge role models, as "knowledge sharing officers", will challenge interesting knowledge classes.
They need to show the most interesting side of their discipline through the export of knowledge with attitude, so as to impress the audience present.
The "Taoist Ask Group", composed of an all-age audience, will ask a variety of questions live, making it more difficult to teach the "Knowledge Sharing Officer" and adding a little exciting atmosphere to the program.
It was revealed that the "knowledge sharing officer" included outstanding young teachers such as Li Yongle, a physics teacher at the secondary school attached to Renmin University of China, Zhang Xuefeng, a famous examination and research instructor, and Wang Lei, a history teacher with ten years of professional experience. They will show the "hardcore" knowledge of various disciplines to the live audience in an unexpected way.
In addition, the program also invited Xue Zhaofeng, an economics professor, to serve as the "knowledge initiator" of the program, joining Du Haitao and Jin Mengjia, "Ding Dong Assistant", to talk about youth with the audience and create an "open class on youth for all".
Chief Secretary for Administration of the Hong Kong SAR Government: The situation is serious and make every effort to fight the epidemic - CNN
Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Zhang Jianzong, Chief Secretary for Administration of the Hong Kong SAR Government, said on July 26 that the situation of the Xinguan pneumonia epidemic in Hong Kong continues to be serious. If the epidemic turns bad, the SAR Government will resolutely take stricter control measures to further restrict the business of business premises and reduce the space for citizens to go out.
However, at this stage, the SAR Government has no intention of introducing a "home order" or a "foot ban order" to restrict citizens from going out.
On the same day, Zhang Jianzong published a blog entitled "The situation is severe and make every effort to fight the epidemic".
He said that this wave of epidemic is the most serious in half a year, and the next two weeks will be very critical. We should make every effort to prevent the further spread of the virus in the community.
In addition to the necessary measures taken by the SAR Government, it is also very important for citizens to self-discipline and cooperate.
He called on the public to stay at home as much as possible, reduce social contact and eat out.
Members of the public should cooperate with the compulsory measures of wearing masks to protect themselves and others, and pay attention to personal and environmental hygiene and wash their hands frequently. They should also suspend non-essential gatherings or dinners of relatives and friends and reduce their visits to markets.
He said that the Central Committee has always been very concerned about the changes in the epidemic in Hong Kong and supported the epidemic prevention and anti-epidemic work of the SAR Government, and has responded positively to the latest request of the Chief Executive to provide assistance in increasing the testing capacity and retrofitting the Asia International Expo Pavilion to serve as a similar "square cabin hospital".
Zhang Jianzong said that the free virus testing provided by the SAR Government for specific high-risk groups, namely, staff of homes for the elderly, homes for the disabled and nursing homes, restaurant staff, taxi drivers and property management staff, has been fully launched, involving up to 400,000 people.
He is very concerned about the cases of infection in homes for the elderly. The SAR Government has arranged specific temporary quarantine centers for residents of homes for the elderly.
He said that the SAR Government is building quarantine facilities near the Penny's Bay Quarantine Centre located on Lantau Island in the New Territories. It is expected that an additional 700 isolation units will be provided by the end of September.
The Chief Executive also announced on the 19th that the SAR Government will build an additional 2,000 isolation houses at the Penny's Bay Quarantine Centre, with a view to completing them by the end of this year.
Together with the 800 quarantine centers that have been put into operation, the Penny's Bay Quarantine Center is expected to provide a total of 3,500 isolation rooms by the end of the year.
At present, there are four quarantine centers in operation in Hong Kong, providing a total of about 2,600 isolation rooms.
In addition, the SAR Government reopened Lei Yue Mun Park Resort on Hong Kong Island as a community isolation facility on the 24th for the treatment of patients under the age of 50 who have the ability to take care of themselves independently.
A "nutritional agent" that often supplements the history of the Party and the history of New China -- ScienceDaily
2020-07-26 17: 37: 29 Source: People's Tribune Network Author: Zhu Yanjing Responsible Editor: Zhu Yanjing
Recently, General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed during his visit to the Siping Battle Memorial Hall: "We should enable 1.4 billion people and more than 90 million Party members, especially leading cadres at all levels, to study the history of the Communist Party of China and the history of New China well."
Carefully studying the history of the Party and the history of New China is a compulsory course for Party members and cadres not to forget their first thoughts and remember their mission. They should draw rich nourishment from it, cultivate the feelings of their family and country, and follow the long journey of the new era.
A magnificent history of the Party and the history of New China record the hard work and glorious course of the Communist Party of China since its birth, and show the belief and loyalty forged by the Communists with their lives and blood, as well as their initial heart and mission to adhere to it forever.
History is the best textbook. For Party members and cadres, the history of the Party and the history of New China are the most brilliant chapters in this textbook.
Every Party member and cadre should constantly strengthen the historical thinking of taking history as a mirror and moving towards the future, base on the new journey and new mission, pick up the "baton" of the times and follow the long journey of the present generation.
Cast the soul with history and adhere to the mission of the original heart in studying the history of the Party and the history of New China.
Turning to the history of the Party and the history of New China, it is full of the immutable initial mission and rock-solid belief of the Chinese Communists, demonstrating the simple feelings of the Communists to always be with the people.
To understand the history of the Party, important events, important meetings and important figures in the history of New China up close is not only an intuitive shock to the heart and a baptism of thought, but also to understand the connotation of the original faith from the depths of the soul and to know the weight of the mission.
For Party members and cadres, in order to continuously strengthen the mission of the original heart and maintain the advanced essence, it is necessary to find the origin and fulcrum of our initial heart from the history of the Party and the history of New China, maintain a clear understanding and firm position, stir up the strength to work hard for the country and the people, and ensure that the red rivers and mountains laid down by the revolutionary forebears with blood and life are passed down from generation to generation.
It is wise to study history and pass on the noble spirit in studying the history of the Party and the history of New China.
Since the founding of the Communist Party of China, it has successively shaped a series of great spirits such as the spirit of the Red Ship, the spirit of Jinggangshan, the spirit of the Long March, the spirit of Yan 'an, the spirit of the War of Resistance, the spirit of Xibaipo, the spirit of "two bullets and one star" and the spirit of spaceflight.
The great spirit precipitated by these histories provides a strong spiritual incentive for our Party to overcome all kinds of risks and challenges on the way forward, and is a valuable spiritual asset that cannot be defeated, broken up or robbed.
The process of studying the history of the Party and the history of China is a process of revisiting and shaping these spirits. We should consciously take the noble spirit of the revolutionary forebears as a mirror, adhere to the spiritual home of the Communists, build a solid spiritual foundation for advancing the great cause and realizing the great dream, and inherit and carry forward these spirits to radiate a new light of the times.
Read history and introspection, and constantly correct and remove evil spirits in studying the history of the Party and the history of New China.
For Party members and cadres, there has never been any history that can bring more profound warning, enlightenment and reference than the history of the Party and the history of New China.
In the history of the Party and the history of New China, we can not only see the great deeds of the old revolutionaries who aspired to devote themselves to their faith and persevere in their efforts to achieve their stated goals, but also see the profound lessons of some characters who have been shaken by their ideals and beliefs and have come to the opposite side of the revolution. We can enlighten and warn us to never stagnate or slacken with firm determination and will, always maintain a full and tenacious spirit of struggle, constantly purify the Party spirit and cultivate self-discipline.
In order to truly become a firm believer and faithful practitioner of the lofty ideals of communism, it is necessary to brush away the "dust" of thought and strictly prevent the "dirt" from being stained. The history of the Party and the history of New China should become the basis for every Party member and cadre to examine himself and warn himself.
To know the history is inspirational and to shoulder the heavy responsibilities of the times in studying the history of the Party and the history of New China.
General Secretary Xi Jinping once pointed out: "Studying the history of the Party and the history of the country is a compulsory course for upholding and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics and pushing forward various undertakings of the Party and the state."
Look back at history and ask questions about the first heart in order to continue the glory and move towards the future.
Every Party member and cadre should take the study of the history of the Party and the history of New China as a lifelong pursuit, constantly correct the course of life in their study, shoulder the historical mission, dare to take responsibility and act proactively in their respective jobs.
We will continue to take the advanced deeds of the old revolutionaries as a reference and guide, constantly polish the political essence of the Communists, maintain the posture of striving for the day and striving for success and the spirit of fighting more and more difficult and moving forward, and write our own brilliant stroke in the vast journey of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
"The South of the Yangtze River" Pursues the Poetic "Dream of the Yellow River" -- ScienceDaily
(China's Poverty Alleviation Story) "The South of the Yangtze River" Pursues the Poetic "Dream of the Yellow River"
Yinchuan, China News Agency, July 26 (Yang Di) "The Jiuqu Yellow River is thousands of miles of sand, and the waves are from the horizon."
The Yellow River, which aroused the pride of countless literati Akako wanzhang, has given birth to the beautiful and rich Ningxia Plain. Today, Ningxia, which has the nickname of "plugging the south of the Yangtze River", is adhering to the concept of "ecological priority and green development" and pursuing the poetic "Yellow River Dream".
The "Bibo Dream" of River Qingshui Show
"The Yellow River in the world is rich in Ningxia", and the Yellow River flows 397 kilometers through Ningxia, making it the "mother river" for raising one side.
However, with the rapid progress of industrialization and urbanization, the development, utilization and management and protection of rivers and lakes are unbalanced, and disturbances such as excessive sewage discharge, land construction around lakes and encroachment on waters have come to the fore, leading to black odor of water bodies, excessive water quality, messy environment and ecological degradation.
Now, Ningxia is promoting the restoration of water ecological diversity and striving to return the Yellow River to Xiuhe Qing.
Water control should be carried out from the source.
In Yinchuan, Ningxia, the local area has adopted the method of "raising standards + controlling pollution + strictly controlling". All sewage in industrial parks has been centrally treated, all urban sewage treatment plants have achieved first-class A standard discharge, and black and smelly water bodies in urban built-up areas have been basically eliminated. The third batch of Chinese black and smelly water demonstration cities have been successfully declared.
In addition, Ningxia fully implemented the river and lake long system in 2017. Today, it has achieved full coverage of the five-level river and lake long responsibility system in districts, cities and counties, and river and lake long patrol has become the norm.
Gu Jincheng, 64, lives in a village along the Yellow River. He has witnessed the changes of the Yellow River: "The former water has a stench, and the stench is gone after remediation."
Gu Jincheng said that the ecological environment is good and his life is more comfortable. Now he often goes for a walk along the Yellow River with his family to feel the blue water and blue sky.
The "Wetland Dream" of Sha Ji Xiangji
Flying birds, green trees, trestles, blue water... The beautiful scenery of Fan Zhongyan's "sand and sand collection" has become a reality in the Yellow River Wetland Park in Yinchuan, Ningxia.
The Yellow River flows through Ningxia, and a variety of wetlands, including river wetlands, lake wetlands and marsh wetlands, have been formed along the way, which play an important role in promoting the rational use of water resources and water ecological balance. At the same time, it has also become an important international bird migration channel.
Since 2009, the relevant departments in Ningxia have invested a total of about RMB3.45 billion in wetland protection projects. At present, the Yinchuan wetland area is 192,000 hectares, with a wetland protection rate of 78.5%. There are nearly 200 natural lakes and marsh wetlands. There are five national wetland parks, one national urban wetland park, six autonomous region level wetland parks and eight municipal parks.
Lu Jinhu, deputy director of Yinchuan Wetland Conservation Center, told reporters that wetland protection has increased biodiversity, which is particularly evident in birds. "The remaining gull is an endangered bird, with only more than 20,000 in the world, of which Yinchuan Wetland is home to more than 2,000."
At the same time, Ningxia has drawn a red line with a 500-meter range for the wetland protection areas on both sides of the Yinchuan section of the Yellow River in accordance with the law, stipulating that no unit or individual may carry out development, construction and business activities within the scope of protection except for public welfare projects.
Zhao Shaoyong, deputy director of Yinchuan Water Conservancy Service Center, said that through the treatment of pollution sources, the comprehensive improvement of river and lake ecology and the construction of terminal wetlands, the water quality of the nine main yellow drains in Ningxia has now reached 100% of the Class IV standard. "Now the water is clear, the fish are swimming and the flowers are blooming."
The "Drinking Dream" of Pu Huimin Sheng
Yinchuan City, Ningxia, once had an "awkward" title: The only city along the Yellow River to "keep the Yellow River short of water and drink".
Since 2010, Yinchuan has been facing the problem of water shortage at the peak of the summer period. The "pain of water shortage" in the past decade has become a painful summer experience for many high-floor residents. However, under the current situation that major water sources are at the limit of overexploitation and large areas of groundwater overexploitation funnel areas have been formed underground in urban areas, water shortage has become a difficult problem for Yinchuan.
Thanks to the improvement of the water quality of the Yellow River, drinking the purified Yellow River has become a good solution to the drinking water problem of local residents.
Ding Ming, deputy director of Yinchuan Municipal Water Bureau, said that in order to improve the water demand of urban and rural residents in Yinchuan for domestic production, Ningxia duly launched the water supply project on the urban and rural western route of Yinchuan Metropolitan Area, replacing the original underground water source with high-quality Yellow River.
"On December 29, 2019, the water supply project was officially opened to the three districts of Yinchuan City. In 2020, residents of Minning Town and Helan County also drank the Yellow River."
Ding Ming said that the Yinchuan water conservancy department will take into account the transformation of the integration of regional rural drinking water and urban water supply in an integrated manner. "In the next step, we will integrate all the scattered rural water supply points into the Western Route water supply project. It is expected that the integrated urban and rural water supply in Yinchuan region will be basically realized by the end of this year."
Compacting the responsibility of all departments to strengthen flood control and relief work -- ScienceDaily
Compacting the responsibility of all departments to strengthen flood control and relief work
CCTV News (newscast): According to the Ministry of Water Resources, at 12: 00 today (July 25), the section below Wangjiaba, the main stream of the Huai River, exceeded the warning level by 0.64 to 3.31 meters, while the section below Sha City, the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and the two lakes exceeded the warning level by 0.05 to 2.02 meters.
Taihu Lake has lasted for 28 days since it exceeded the warning level on June 28.
At 12: 00 today, the average water level of Taihu Lake was 4.67 meters, 0.02 meters above the guaranteed water level.
Today, after consultation and judgment, the State General Administration of Prevention decided to continue to maintain the flood control level II response of the Yangtze and Huai rivers, and requested all localities to compacting their responsibilities and further implement all flood control and relief work.
Today, the State Prevention Office and the Ministry of Emergency Management urgently deployed professional drainage vehicles from Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Fujian to help Jiangxi solve local urban waterlogging and other problems caused by heavy rainfall.
For the first time, the United States launched a countervailing investigation against China on the basis of "undervaluation of the RMB exchange rate".
In response to the recent announcement by the US Department of Commerce, it has decided to launch an anti-dumping countervailing investigation against tie (bundle belt) products originating in China and launch an investigation into the "undervaluation of the RMB exchange rate" project.
China's Ministry of Commerce pointed out that this is the first time that the United States has filed a case to investigate the so-called "undervaluation of the RMB exchange rate" project in a countervailing case, which China firmly opposes.
China's Ministry of Commerce issued a special press release in this regard on the evening of the 23rd, saying that China implements a managed floating exchange rate system based on market supply and demand, adjusted with reference to a basket of currencies, and that the market plays a decisive role in the formation of the exchange rate.
The press release stressed that, on the whole, the RMB exchange rate is at a reasonable and balanced level and is not undervalued.
Since 2005, the cumulative appreciation of the RMB against the US dollar has exceeded 17%.
According to the data released by the Bank for International Settlements, from the beginning of 2005 to May 2020, the effective exchange rate of the RMB name appreciated by 38% and the real effective exchange rate appreciated by 49%, making it the strongest currency among the G20 economies and one of the currencies with the largest appreciation worldwide.
The Ministry of Commerce pointed out that the exchange rate issue exceeds the authority of members to conduct countervailing investigations in accordance with the rules of the World Trade Organization.
In February this year, the United States amended its regulations to conduct countervailing investigations into the exchange rates of other countries. It has been suspected of violating the WTO rules of the WTO and has been opposed by many parties.
According to the press release, even in accordance with US regulations, there are a large number of errors in the content of the applicant's complaint, which does not have the necessary countervailing elements such as financial assistance, benefit granting and exclusivity.
China urges the United States to abide by existing international rules and stop conducting countervailing investigations into the so-called "undervaluation of the RMB exchange rate".
Affected by the further rise in tensions between China and the United States, the offshore and onshore RMB exchange rates against the US dollar fell sharply at one point in the session on the 22nd, both falling below the 7.0 yuan mark against the US dollar.
Whether the move by the US Department of Commerce is intended to force up the renminbi is worth paying attention to.
The spot exchange rate of the RMB against the US dollar rose above the 7.0 mark on the 23rd, closing at 6.9961.
The midpoint of the RMB exchange rate against the US dollar, which is officially regulated, was reduced by 17 basic points to 6.9938 on the 24th.
As the epidemic gradually improves, the film and television industry, which has been silent for nearly half a year, has also returned to normal.
A few days ago, the organizing committee of the 26th Shanghai Television Festival announced the shortlist for this Magnolia Award.
In terms of best actor and actress, powerful Mesozoic actors occupy an absolute advantage. Lei Jiayin, Chen Baoguo, Zhang Ruoxuan, Sun Honglei and Huang Lei will compete for best actor, while Haiqing, Ma Yili, Qin Hailu, Sun Li and Yan Ni will compete for best actress.
The results will be officially announced on August 7.
At present, from the topic of the college entrance examination, the realistic educational TV series "Little Joy", which depicts "Chinese style family", won a total of six nominations for "Best Chinese Television Drama", "Best Director", "Best Screenwriter", "Best Actress" and "Best Male / Supporting Actress".
The "Best Actor and Actor" award has always been one of the focuses of outside attention. This year, the competition is also particularly fierce. The shortlisted actors and actresses are powerful and good dramatists. Chen Baoguo, Huang Lei, Lei Jiayin, Sun Honglei and Zhang Ruoxuan will compete for "Best Actor".

Venezuelan Foreign Minister accused the United States of fabricating lies and unprovoked attacks on China - Xinhua
Areasa said that the US government has recently continuously pressured China in politics, diplomacy, economy and public opinion, which is a baseless attack on a sovereign state.
Arreaza retweeted the tweet posted by Li Baorong, the Chinese ambassador to Venezuela, on his personal account earlier in the day and made the above comments.
Li Baorong said in his tweet that China strongly condemns the forced entry of the United States into the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, which seriously violates the Vienna Convention on consular Relations and the Sino-US consular Treaty, and China will make a legitimate and necessary response to this.
Venezuelan Vice President Rodriguez, Deputy Foreign Minister for North American Affairs Carlos Long and other government officials, prominent social figures and mainstream media journalists also retweeted Li Baorong's tweets, condemning the actions of the United States for seriously violating international law.
On the 26th, the day before Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte delivered his fifth State of the Union address (SONA) during his term of office, a total of more than 80,000 cases of newly crowned pneumonia were confirmed in the Philippines on the same day, of which the number of confirmed cases by the staff of the Department of Public Information of the Presidential Palace (PCOO) and its directly affiliated agencies increased to 25.
To this end, PCOO has specially prepared a working group that has not come into contact with the diagnosed staff to cooperate with President Duterte in the press release of SONA.
PCOO Minister Martin Andanar told DZBB radio on the 26th that two sets of schemes have been prepared for President Duterte to issue the SONA method.
According to Plan A, Duterte will deliver SONA at the Philippine Congress (Batasang Pambansa) building in Quezon City on the afternoon of the 27th.
Because of the epidemic, only 50 seats were arranged for some government cabinet members and legislators at the scene, and a special video conference room was set up for other cabinet members, local government officials, etc., to watch.
All participants passed rapid testing on the same day before they could enter the Capitol building.
Once one of the participants tests positive, Plan B will be activated, in which President Duterte will deliver SONA at the Maracanan Palace of the presidential palace, and fewer hearing seats will be arranged at the scene.
As is customary, SONA will broadcast live to the whole of the Philippines in real time.
At the time of writing, the Philippine presidential palace had not confirmed whether Duterte's family would attend SONA.
Andanar said that President Duterte's SONA will focus on how the government will lead the Philippines in responding to the new crown pneumonia epidemic and restore social and economic life. It will also mention his commitment when he took office to fight government corruption, combat illegal drugs and reduce poverty.
Duterte will also explain other plans of the current government, including creating more jobs, revitalizing the economy, promoting education, and helping overseas Filipino workers suffering from the epidemic.
Yinchuan: Classified policies to support the stabilization of the teaching force in kindergartens - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, July 26 (reporter Ai Fumei) Affected by the epidemic, Yinchuan Kindergarten in Ningxia has not yet resumed. In particular, the financial pressure on private kindergartens has increased, which has a certain impact on the stability of the kindergarten teaching staff and the sustainable development in the future.
In response, Yinchuan has adopted a number of measures, such as pre-allocating subsidy funds to inclusive private kindergartens, providing job stabilization subsidies to non-inclusive private kindergartens, and waiving and waiving the rent of private kindergartens, to support these kindergartens in stabilizing the teaching force.
According to the relevant policies of Yinchuan City, if the organizers of inclusive private kindergartens (including those that have been converted into inclusive kindergartens after the management of supporting kindergartens in urban areas) pay teachers and staff not less than 1,660 yuan per month for basic living expenses with reference to the minimum wage standard of the three districts during the epidemic period, the municipal finance will allocate six months of subsidy funds in advance to solve teachers' salaries and social insurance expenses in accordance with the standard of 1,000 yuan per student per year for inclusive private kindergarten students.
For non-inclusive private kindergartens that also pay teachers and staff not less than 1,660 yuan per month for basic living expenses, Yinchuan will arrange six-month subsidy funds as stable subsidy funds for preschool teachers in accordance with the average subsidy standard of 500 yuan per student per year.
At the same time, for private kindergartens that lease state-owned assets for business use, Yinchuan will reduce and waive the rent of houses for three months during the period of epidemic prevention and control, and encourage developers and other types of rental subjects to assume social responsibility. If the rent of kindergartens is reduced and reduced for more than three months, the relevant taxes and fees will be reduced and reduced in accordance with the policy provisions.
The Ministry of Water Resources has refined practical response measures for the formation of flood No. 3 of the Yangtze River in 2020 -- ScienceDaily
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26 (reporter Hu Lu) On July 26, the 3rd flood of the Yangtze River in 2020 formed.
When presiding over the meeting on the 26th, the Minister of Water Resources, Huo Jingping, requested that the Three Gorges Reservoir should be carefully dispatched, the water coming from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and Dongting Lake should be taken into account in an integrated manner, staggered peak dispatch should be carried out, sufficient reservoir capacity should be left to prepare for possible major floods, and the flood control safety of the middle and lower reaches of the main stream and the important embankments of Dongting Lake should be ensured.
It is forecast that there will be heavy to heavy rain in parts of the eastern southwest, southern Jianghuai, western northern Jiangnan and southern eastern Hubei and central Guangxi in the next three days, including heavy rain in northern Hunan and southwestern Jiangsu, and moderate to heavy rain in central and western North China, including heavy rain in central Hebei.
The Ministry of Water Resources expects that under its influence, the flow of the Three Gorges Reservoir in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River may reach about 60,000 cubic meters per second before and after 28 days. The water level of the Lotus Tong River section and Dongting Lake, the middle reaches of the main stream, will rise again and exceed the guarantee by about 0.20 meters. The water level of the middle reaches of the Huai River will generally recede slowly, and the water level of Hongze Lake will continue to rise slowly. The Haihe Daqing River system and Yongding River will experience a rising water process.
Huo Jingping proposed that the Huaihe River Basin should further strengthen flood discharge, reduce the water level of Hongze Lake as soon as possible, and prepare to face possible major floods.
We should fully do a good job in responding to rainstorms and floods in the Yishu Surabaya system.
He said that the Taihu Lake Basin should continue to increase flood discharge efforts, reduce the water level of Taihu Lake and the surrounding river network as soon as possible, and reduce the risk of high water level and typhoons in Taihu Lake.
In addition, he stressed that floods in Inner Mongolia, Hebei and other northern regions have risen and fallen steeply, and the warning time is short, which can easily cause flash floods and mudslides, making it difficult to prevent them. The number of small and medium-sized reservoirs and silt dams is large, and there are safety hazards.
58 APPs that infringe on users' rights and interests have been exposed involving more than a dozen listed companies - CNN
The Ministry of Industry and Communications informed that in accordance with the Cybersecurity Law, the Telecommunications Regulations, the Regulations on the Protection of Personal Information of Telecommunications and Internet Users and other laws and regulations, third-party testing agencies have recently been organized to inspect mobile phone application software and urge enterprises with problems to carry out rectification.
The problems existing in these 58 APPs include the private collection of personal information, the collection of personal information beyond the scope, frequent application for permissions, excessive request for permissions, difficulty in cancelling account numbers, private sharing to third parties, and the denial of permissions.
The Ministry of Industry and Communications requires that the rectification and implementation of 58 APPs should be completed by July 30. If the rectification is not carried out within the time limit, the Ministry of Industry and Communications will organize and carry out the relevant disposal work in accordance with the law and regulations.
Zhongxin Jingwei reporters combed and found that behind the 58 APPs notified, more than a dozen US, Hong Kong and A-share listed companies were involved.
For example, "Fangduo" is a product owned by Fangduo, a US-listed company. There are five major problems: Collecting personal information privately, collecting personal information beyond the scope, sharing it privately to third parties, forcing users to use targeted push functions, and frequently applying for permissions.
According to public information, more houses landed on Nasdaq in November 2019, and are "the first real estate agency with the industrial Internet SaaS (software service) model in China", providing online solutions to a large number of intermediary merchants.
In response to the difficulty of cancelling the "Where to Go" APP account pointed out in the circular, according to the Beijing News, Where to Go responded that in order to prevent black production from using frequent registration and cancellation for benefits, where to go has been set up with a one-month interval between registration and cancellation on the basis that it can be cancelled independently.
Taking into account the convenience of cancellation and the security of the account, the cancellation has been changed to take effect immediately and is currently awaiting review.
A network security expert, who did not want to be named, told Zhongxin warp and weft client that the Ministry of Industry and Communications has issued APP notices like this that infringe on users' rights and interests three times this year.
Among them, the three problems of private collection of personal information, excessive request for permissions and the difficulty of cancelling account numbers have been repeatedly "managed".
From the circular, it can also be found that at present, APP invasion of privacy is attracting more and more attention.
On July 24, on the day of the notification of 58 APPs infringing on users' rights and interests, the Ministry of Industry and Communications said that it had recently issued a notice to deploy and carry out special remedial actions to promote the infringement of users' rights and interests by APPs.
The special rectification will strengthen supervision and inspection in accordance with regulations, urge relevant enterprises to strengthen the protection of APP personal information, promptly rectify and eliminate outstanding problems such as illegal collection, use of users' personal information and harassment of users, deceiving and misleading users, and inadequate implementation of the management responsibilities of application distribution platforms, so as to purify the APP application space.
Lewis family: John Lewis was a warrior "fighting for the weakest"
John Lewis, a member of the United States Congress and civil rights fighter, was remembered as a warrior who "fought for the weakest" at a memorial service held for him on Saturday (July 25).
Lewis' public memorial service has been held in Alabama since Saturday.
There were two memorial services on the first day.
At the public memorial service at Troy University in Alabama on Saturday, Lewis' five siblings and a grandson talked about him as a loving, afraid man who put his family first.
"He devoted his life to helping others," Lewis's youngest brother, Henry "Grant" Lewis, said at the meeting.
Samuel Lewis said his mother had warned John "not to get into trouble, not to get into trouble."
He added that John did not listen to his mother's warning, saying, "We all know that John will always get into trouble and always get into trouble, but that is because he insists on the right thing, which is good trouble."
Lewis' brothers and sisters reminded the people at the memorial service that John's most famous argument was to create "good trouble", that is, as long as he was righteous, he would not shy away from stirring up trouble.
John once applied to Troy University, located in Troy, Alabama, where he was born, but Troy University, which was an all-white school at the time, rejected his application for admission.
John Lewis, who preached the gospel to chickens on his farm as a child, eventually received a degree in religion and philosophy from Fisk University.
Years later, the University of Troy awarded Lewis an honorary doctorate.
Doug Jones, a congressional senator from Alabama, said that the current protesters "are protesting peacefully and nonviolently", just as Lewis did in the civil rights movement.
Jones said, "Even if President Trump turned over a ship of people and described all the protesters as thugs, he was wrong.
The protesters are patriots, and they want the United States to move towards a more equal country, "he said.
A six-day series of events to honor Lewis will culminate this week at a funeral in Georgia.
On Saturday, Lewis' coffin was parked at a public memorial service at the University of Troy. People came to pay their respects to the civil rights pioneer.
Later on Saturday, a private ceremony paid tribute to him in a chapel in Selma, Alabama, followed by a public tribute.
On Sunday, Lewis' body will pass the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma.
In 1965, he and the demonstrators demanding the right of blacks to vote were beaten by the Alabama police in front of this bridge. The police also fired tear gas at the demonstrators.
Lewis was nearly killed at the time.
After this day, it will be known as "Bloody Sunday".
Lewis' body will be transported to Montgomery, the capital of Alabama.
Mayor Steven Reed encouraged people to line up on the sidewalk to complete this last journey with Lewis.
At the same time, officials asked the public to wear masks and maintain social distance when participating in activities.
Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey ordered flags to be flown at half-staff on Saturday and Sunday in honor of Lewis.
During the nearly week-long commemoration, Lewis' body will be placed at the Alabama State Capitol in Montgomery, the Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta, and the United States Capitol in Washington for the public to express their condolences.
Speaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced last week that people can come to the US Capitol on Monday and Tuesday this year to pay their respects to Lewis.
Due to the coronavirus outbreak, public tributes to Lewis will be held outdoors.

During his recent visit to Jilin Province, General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed the need to strengthen the Party's leadership, promote the extension of Party organizations to the most basic level, improve the work system of grass-roots Party organizations, and provide strong guarantees for the governance of urban and rural communities.
Adhering to Party building as the lead and implementing the Party's leadership in all aspects of grass-roots governance is a fundamental directional requirement for doing a good job in grass-roots governance.
To enhance the level of governance at the grass-roots level, we must adhere to the leadership of Party building, promote the transformation of the Party's political advantages, organizational advantages and mass work advantages into governance advantages by strengthening political leadership, building battle forts and rallying red forces, and pass on the Party's strength and ideas to the "nerve endings" and the "last kilometer".
We should pay attention to calcium supplementation to cast the soul and strengthen political leadership.
To strengthen the political leadership of grass-roots governance, it is necessary to implement the "calcium supplementation and soul casting" project well.
We should make it a top priority to deeply understand Xi Jinping's thought of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era, take "never forget your first heart and remember your mission" as the eternal subject of the Party's construction and the lifelong subject of Party members and cadres, strengthen the principle of reading the original Constitution and understanding the original text. Through special training, batch training, discussions and exchanges, and holding lecture halls, we should continuously promote the Party's innovative theoretical armed forces to become practical, and push Party members and cadres to further enhance the "four consciousness", firmly strengthen the "four self-confidence" and achieve the "two maintenance", so as to better perform their duties and responsibilities.
Through a combination of online and offline learning methods, we will broaden the channels of learning and education, and guide grass-roots Party organizations and Party members and cadres to truly integrate learning and education into their daily lives and focus on it on a regular basis.
Pay attention to practical exercise, solve the worries and worries of the masses in the process of resolving key and difficult issues in the field of grass-roots governance, and hammer out the Party spirit and ability.
We should grasp the promotion of norms and build a battle fortress.
Grassroots Party organizations are not only an important part of the grass-roots governance system, but also an important carrier for the demonstration of governance capabilities.
To promote the standardization of Party organizations at the grass-roots level, we should start by focusing on the regulations on the work of Party branches, focus on issues such as the weakening and falsification of the leadership of Party organizations, and strengthen the foundation, fill the shortcoming and promote development by establishing an up-and-down linkage mechanism, innovating the form of branch establishment, normalizing the rectification of weakness and laxity, establishing and improving the decision-making and deliberation mechanism and serving the masses.
In rural areas, we will strengthen the standardization of village-level Party organizations, standardize organizational forms, study activities and management mechanisms against the standardized construction standards of Party branches, and earnestly promote the detailed implementation of the "three meetings and one lesson" and thematic party day activities.
In cities, we should pay attention to street communities, explore innovative forms of branch establishment, focus on weak areas, "blocking points" and "pain points", and actively build urban party building alliances so that the work of the Party can achieve effective coverage.
At the same time, we will establish and improve the institutional mechanism of governance at the grass-roots level, improve the decision-making and deliberation mechanism of joint discussion of major issues, joint handling of practical matters, joint discussion of urgent matters, joint resolution of difficult matters and the leadership of grass-roots Party organizations, improve the mechanism of contact between Party members and cadres to serve the masses, gather the hearts and minds of the people in serving the people, enhance the sense of access, happiness, honor and pride of the Party members and the masses, and make grass-roots governance more temperate.
Give full play to the pioneering role and coalesce the red power.
Grassroots Party members and cadres are the cornerstone of grass-roots governance.
To enhance the governance ability at the grass-roots level, emphasis is placed on enhancing the governance ability of Party members and cadres at the grass-roots level, giving full play to the exemplary and leading role of "red cells" in grass-roots governance, and rallying red forces at the forefront of connecting and serving the masses.
We should make the enhancement of governance ability a compulsory course for Party members and cadres at the grass-roots level, continuously strengthen ideological hardening, professional training and practical training, carry forward the spirit of responsibility in our posts and in urgent and dangerous tasks, and strengthen the foundation and contribute to the modernization of the national governance system and governance capabilities.
It is necessary to carry out a wide range of activities such as "community whistling and Party members reporting for duty", and participate in community construction, management and service by participating in thematic party day activities, contacting the needy, determining service projects, claiming micro-wishes and making reasonable suggestions, so that Party members can play a role in community governance.
We should give full play to the role of unemployed Party members in rural areas, and guide the vast number of grassroots Party members to actively participate in the work of fighting poverty, ecological construction, maintaining stability in complaint reporting and banning the burning of straw by setting up vanguard posts for unemployed Party members and setting up task forces for unemployed Party members, so as to better integrate the red forces and serve the people.
The foundation is solid and the building is strong.
Grassroots Party organizations are the foundation of the ruling building.
Only by insisting on strengthening the relationship between the Party and the masses and increasing the well-being of the people as the focus, and taking the leadership of Party building as the fundamental way to promote the innovative development of grass-roots governance, can we build a solid foundation so that grass-roots Party organizations can pull out and stand up, and grass-roots Party members and cadres can catch up with and rush up, so as to promote grass-roots governance to have a "soul", orderly, powerful and effective.

Kokoxiri Tibetan antelope enters relocation season - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, July 25 (Reporter Wang Jinjin) A reporter learned from the Wudaoliang Protection Station of the Kokoxiri Administration Office of the Yangtze River Source Park of the Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration that monitoring showed that the Tibetan antelope that had previously migrated to the Zhuonai Lake area of the Kokoxiri hinterland to give birth were successively ending giving birth and beginning to return to their original habitat with their children.
Surveillance footage near the Wudaoliang Protection Station showed that on July 25, about 40 female Tibetan antelope led three Tibetan antelope cubs through 3002 km of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway and the Wudaoliangbei Bridge of the Qinghai-Tibet Railway. The Tibetan antelope has begun to move back.
Experts have analyzed that in recent years, the number of Tibetan antelope cubs in the returning sheep accounted for one-quarter to one-fifth of the overall number of Tibetan antelope groups.
Lien Xinming, an associate researcher at the Northwest Plateau Institute of Biology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said: "In the early days of relocation, Tibetan antelope faced a high risk of predation, so the number of cubs in the sheep will be relatively small, and there may even be no cubs."
According to the statistics of the Kokoxiri Administration Office of the Yangtze River Source Park of the Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration, the number of Tibetan antelope relocated is generally increasing year by year. In 2019, the number of Tibetan antelope relocated was 4,860, an increase of 338 over 2018.
Lien Xinming said, "It is expected that the relocation of Tibetan antelope will end at the beginning of September this year, and the number of Tibetan antelope relocated is still expected to continue to increase."
The Tibetan antelope is a protected animal at the national level.
At the end of May each year, Tibetan antelope from the source of the Sanjiang River in Qinghai, Qiangtang in Tibet and Alshan Mountain in Xinjiang go to Zhuonai Lake, located in the hinterland of Kokoxiri, to lay lambs.
Wu Xiaomin, an expert in the protection of Tibetan antelope in China and a researcher at the Shaanxi Provincial Institute of Zoology (Northwest Institute of Endangered Animals), said, "The relocation of Tibetan antelope is the process by which female Tibetan antelope return to their habitat with their cubs after giving birth. At first, the relocation group that left the birth site is relatively large, but then the Tibetan antelope will return to their respective habitats according to different geographical populations and along different paths."
In order to ensure the safe relocation of Tibetan antelope groups, the reporter learned that the Kokoxiri Administration Office of the Yangtze River Source Park of the Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration has recently arranged for staff to continuously carry out video monitoring and district patrols in the main relocation areas.
If a Tibetan antelope group is found to be trying to cross the highway, the mountain rangers will carry out temporary traffic control at the first time to allow the sheep to safely pass through the wildlife passageway and ensure that they are as little disturbed by humans as possible on the way back.
So, how on earth should we relieve the heat in our daily life?
Experts suggest that you try to avoid the hot period when you go out in summer. It is best not to walk or work in the hot sun around noon, because the sun is strongest during this period and the possibility of heatstroke is higher.
If you have to go out at this time, you must do a good job of protection, such as wearing a parasol, wearing a visor and sunglasses. If you are in a position to do so, it is best to apply sunscreen to protect against sunburn.
Try to choose cotton, hemp and silk textures with light colors and good breathability, and wear less chemical fiber clothing, so as not to fail to dissipate heat in time when sweating a lot, causing heatstroke.
In hot and sweltering weather, prepare enough water to drink and drink it in time. Do not wait for thirst to drink water, because once you feel thirsty, your body is already short of water. Drink water at 150ml to 200ml at a time. Drink warm water and do not drink ice water.
According to the temperature, the average person drinks 1.5 to 2 litres of water per day, while high-temperature workers drink 3 to 5 litres of water per day.
When sweating more, some salt water can be replenished appropriately to make up for the salt lost by the human body due to sweating.
In addition, the human body is prone to potassium deficiency in summer, which makes people feel tired and tired. Potassium-containing tea is an excellent summer drink.
In summer, eat more fruits and vegetables with high water content, such as lettuce, cucumber and tomatoes. Fresh fruits, such as peaches, apricots, watermelon and melon, have 80 to 90 water content, which can be used to hydrate. Dairy products can not only hydrate, but also meet the nutritional needs of the body.
In addition, people working in a high temperature environment should properly supplement drinks containing potassium, magnesium and other elements.
In summer, the days and nights are short, the temperature is high, the human metabolism is exuberant and the consumption is also large, making it easy to feel tired.
Adequate sleep can relax all systems of the brain and body, which is not only conducive to work and study, but also a measure to prevent heatstroke.
According to experts, the best bedtime is from 22: 00 to 23: 00, and the best time to get up is from 5: 30 to 6: 30.
Be careful not to lie under air conditioning vents and electric fans during sleep, so as not to suffer from air conditioning diseases and hot colds.
Experts suggest that people who carry out outdoor activities or high-temperature work can carry ten drops of water, human Dan, patchouli positive gas water or patchouli positive gas pills with them, or place them in the nearest workplace and use them at any time to prevent heatstroke.
Graduates' art exhibition moves into shopping malls for public welfare exhibition - Xinhua
In the "cloud graduation" season of major institutions, a rare offline graduate art exhibition opened warm last weekend.
However, it is neither in the art gallery nor on campus, but appears in the public space of Chaoyang Grand Hyatt City and is open to the public free of charge and will continue until August 23.
Reporters learned that this 2020 graduate art exhibition collected 50 works / groups by 57 young artists from the Central Academy of Fine Arts, the Communication University of China and the Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts. The exhibition space extended from the second floor to the sixth floor, and made full use of the light box in the building for the display of graphic works to maximize the artistic atmosphere of the graduation season.
Under the epidemic, the significance of this exhibition is particularly special.
Ge Ping, head of Chaoyang Grand Yue Chengmei Chen, said, "We have chosen to bring the graduation exhibition, which is moving towards the 'cloud', back to the offline space again. We also hope to let more people see the exploration of themselves and understanding of the world by young people, and amplify the healing power of art for society and the mind."
She revealed that the works in the exhibition were collected from graduates of several art colleges and universities, from which they were selected suitable for commercial space display. The forms of the works ranged from traditional easel paintings and sculptures to new media installations, interactive animations and VR panoramas. The volume and richness were the highest in the past year.
Liu Jiaying expressed his feelings in the epidemic through the mechanical language of Ethereum blockchain, "Sound Money", explored the themes of "cryptocurrency", "credit creation" and "transaction". Zhang Jiaqi's "Cat Lin" and Qiu Daqiang's "Ruian" show animals that often accompany humans. From this, you can see young artists' understanding of the relationship between people and animals. Zhu Zhongyu's work "Winter of Faith - Gift" reminds growing young people that "when you have a successful career one day, you will never forget your first heart and remember that simplicity and sincerity."
Among the few graduates who laid the exhibition in person was Li Jingyin from the Department of Sculpture of Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts.
"I came to Beijing on July 7. At that time, I was actually a little worried about the epidemic. I also did a nucleic acid test three days in advance. I came to the exhibition with alcohol cotton and test report."
His work "Yesterday Is Like a Mystery" is more complex in structure and must be done by himself.
At the same time, he is also responsible for the task of helping his classmates repair broken works.
"The cloth exhibition until 4: 30 in the morning and then make repairs. Time is very tight. I forgot to take a picture with the work. It is also a bit of a pity."
He hopes that when the epidemic is more stable, he will come to Beijing with his classmates to see the exhibition of his works.

Award of 50,000 yuan Hubei Enshi praised the "first person in early warning" of sand dam landslide -- ScienceDaily
Hubei Daily News (reporter Lin Jing) On July 26, Enshi City announced that it praised Chen Guangming, a geological disaster site monitor who made important contributions to the early warning of sand dam landslides, and sent him a 50,000 yuan bonus.
At the same time, Party members and cadres throughout the city are called upon to learn from his spirit of due diligence, daring to take responsibility, taking the initiative and being willing to give.
On July 21, a landslide occurred at the sand dam in Ma Shi Village, Tunbao Township, Enshi City, resulting in the formation of a quake lake in the main stream of the Qingjiang River. Chen Guangming, 58, was the first person to warn of the landslide.
On the afternoon of July 17, Chen Guangming learned of the news that the wall of the villagers' home was cracked and immediately went to the scene to check it out.
As soon as he walked five or six hundred meters out of his home, he saw the village group road crack four or five centimeters, extending along the highway to the cornfield, about 50 meters in length.
Chen Guangdonsheng was alert and sent the photo of the cracked highway to the township "geological disaster monitor contact group" at the first time.
After on-site inspection and judgment by the relevant person in charge of Tunbao Township Nature Planning Institute, the possibility of landslide is very high, and the decision to evacuate the masses was made immediately.
Chen Guangming's timely warning provided 36 hours of valuable time for the safe evacuation of 315 households and 1,339 people in the area.
In this major geological disaster, no one was killed or injured.
Chen Guangming's conscientious and responsible professionalism was praised by the masses.
In the face of praise, he said, "There is no one who has been saved. This is my responsibility."
The development of new drugs by Australian universities is expected to be used to treat blood vessel blockage caused by the new crown - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Sydney, July 26 (reporter Chen Yu) Researchers at Monash University in Australia are developing a new drug that can help prevent heart disease and stroke, and hope that the drug can be used to treat blood vessel blockage caused by the new crown virus.
The researchers found that an enzyme in platelets accelerates platelet clotting before a heart attack or stroke.
From this, they developed a drug that can temporarily inhibit platelet coagulation, thus avoiding blood vessel blockage and playing a preventive role in heart disease and stroke.
The researchers said that this drug will only inhibit the clotting effect of platelets when there are signs of heart disease or stroke.
Since studies have shown that similar blood vessel blockage is one of the main causes of death in patients with severe new crown illness, the researchers hope that this drug can be used in the treatment of such patients with severe illness in the future.
At present, the drug has achieved good results in animal model experiments, and the researchers are ready to conduct the next phase of human clinical trials.
The research results have recently been published in the American journal Science Translational Medicine.
He became the first spectator to enter the game after the CBA League rematch allowed spectators to watch the game live.
On the same day, during the second phase of the 2019-2020 Chinese Men's Basketball Professional League (CBA) rematch (Laoshan Division) held in Qingdao, Shandong Province, medical staff, teachers and public security front personnel came in to watch Shanghai Jiushi Team take on Shandong Xiwang Team after completing the relevant process, including nucleic acid testing, through the official ticket purchase platform.
During the viewing period, spectators should wear masks throughout the process, take their seats on the right number and strictly keep their seats one meter apart.
When exiting, the audience should maintain the "one-meter line" social distance to exit in an orderly manner in the order of moving forward from the back, first on both sides and then in the middle.
Xinjiang deeply ploughs "sunflower fields" to make good use of clean energy -- ScienceDaily

China News Agency, Hami, Xinjiang, July 26, by wire: Xinjiang deeply ploughs "sunflower fields" to make good use of clean energy
More than 6,000 Pentagonal fixed sun mirrors, each 48 square meters, are neatly arranged in a circle, such as a silver "sunflower field", which turns with the sun and reflects the sun to the heat-absorbing tower more than 200 meters high in the center to generate electricity.
Reporters saw this scene at the Hami molten salt tower photothermal power plant of the CLP Project in Mu Maohu Town, Iwu County, Hami City, Xinjiang, on the 25th.
"The so-called molten salt tower photothermal power generation means that sunlight is reflected centrally through the mirror to the heat absorption tower to form heat energy, which is then converted into electricity through traditional power generation technology."
Zhang Yong, deputy general manager of CLP Hami Solar Thermal Power Co., Ltd, said that its design principle is similar to that of solar stoves used in rural areas in northwest China, and sunlight should be gathered.
Construction of the power plant began in October 2017 and was connected to the grid at the end of last year. It covers an area of 6,600 mu. A total of 14,500 fixed day mirrors are planned to be installed.
"Compared with traditional solar power technology, its greatest advantage is that it can store the accumulated heat energy and also generate electricity at night."
Zhang Yong said that the 13-hour heat storage system equipped with the project can enable the generating units to maintain continuous and stable operation and are not affected by light changes. It can also quickly participate in the peak adjustment of the power grid according to the demand of the load peaks and valleys of the power grid.
When the project is fully completed, it can generate 198 million degrees of electricity per year, save more than 60,000 tons of standard coal per year, reduce emissions by more than 60 tons of sulfur dioxide, more than 60 tons of nitrogen oxides, about 20 tons of soot and more than 150,000 tons of carbon dioxide, and provide a steady stream of clean energy to the local area.
In addition, there is another silver "sunflower field" in the Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park in Hami City.
The Hamiver Light Solar Photovoltaic Power Station covers an area of more than 2,300 mu. The 714 power generation equipment that has been built also follows the rotation of the sun, always maintaining a 90-degree right angle between the sunlight and the concentrated plate surface.
"We adopt dual-axis tracking concentrated power generation technology. Through unified integrated control, all power generation equipment will adjust the angle according to the height of the sun to maintain the efficiency of power generation."
Duan Mengqi, the station manager of the power station, said that under good light weather conditions, the power generation technology can improve the efficiency of traditional photovoltaic power generation by about 20%.
In the first half of this year, the power station has generated more than 7 million degrees of electricity, supplementing local electricity demand.
Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park is currently the largest photovoltaic industry demonstration park with the largest single scale and the most comprehensive photovoltaic component types in Xinjiang. It has a total of 38 photovoltaic power projects with a total installed capacity of 820,000 kilowatts.
In the first half of this year, more than 110 million degrees of electricity were generated, an increase of 6% over the same period in 2019.
Hami is one of the regions with the best solar energy resources in China.
The total average annual solar radiation is more than 6,200 megajoules per square meter, with about 3,200 hours of sunshine throughout the year.
In recent years, the city has vigorously developed the photovoltaic industry and planted "sunflower fields".
More than 2.5 million kilowatts of solar power have been built and installed. In the first half of this year, the volume of photovoltaic power generation in the city exceeded 1.4 billion degrees, an increase of about 14% year-on-year.
At present, there are more than 330 grid-connected photovoltaic power stations in Xinjiang, with an installed capacity of more than 10 million kilowatts.
It is expected that the volume of photovoltaic power generation will reach 15 billion degrees for the whole of this year, which can replace more than 6 million tons of standard coal.
The police informed the details of "female college students have lost their travel to Qinghai" that the search and rescue work is still continuing - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, July 26 (reporter Wang Jinjin Zhou Zhe) Recently, the incident of "a female college student was disconnected after traveling to Germu, Qinghai" aroused the concern of netizens.
The Public Security Bureau of Germu City, Haixi Mongol Tibetan Autonomous prefecture, Qinghai Province, informed on the 26th that Huang Mou, a student at a university in Nanjing, is still in a state of disconnection, and many police are going deep into the route of Huang Mou's disconnection and actively carrying out the search work.
On July 10, 2020, the security detachment of the Public Security Bureau of Germu City, Hessee, received a notice from its superiors that Huang Mou, a student at a university in Nanjing, took the Z164 train from Nanjing to Germu on July 5. On July 9, his mobile phone was turned off and disconnected in the southwest area of the Qingshui River at the Sonandajie Protection Station in Qumalai County, Yushu Tibetan Autonomous prefecture, Qinghai Province, and asked for assistance in finding it.
According to the investigation of the Germu Public Security Bureau, Huang entered the territory of Qinghai Province at 19: 54 on July 6 and arrived in Germu City at 4: 00 on July 7.
At 8: 00 on the same day, Huang Mou, the lost person, took a taxi from the Yellow River Hotel in Germu City towards the G109 National Highway and arrived at the Kokoxiri Sonandaj Protection Station at 12: 00. The taxi driver returned alone. Huang Mou went to the Qingshui River area near the Dasonandaj Protection Station at 15: 00 on the 7th until he shut down the machine in the area at about 18: 00 on the 9th.
In further investigation, the police found that Huang had passed the Naijigou checkpoint at 17: 07 on July 13.
The Naijigou Checkpoint is a checkpoint set up by Nachu City of the Tibet Autonomous Region at the Nanshan Pass of Germu City. Because the checkpoint does not have video surveillance, it is impossible to determine the information of myself and the vehicle in which I am travelling. The police can only drive along the way to find it. If Huang is found at the checkpoints along the route in Tibet, they immediately contact the Germu Public Security Bureau.
According to the latest situation, at 1 a.m. on July 26, the Germu Public Security Bureau organized rescue forces to carry rescue equipment to the Frozen Spring Protection Station and the Sonandaj Protection Station along the Qinghai-Tibet Highway to search, and actively contacted the Sichuan police, the Tibetan police and the Nanjing police to jointly carry out the work. At present, the search and rescue work is continuing.
The local police hope that if the vast number of netizens and all sectors of society have relevant clues, they will provide them to the Germu police and the Nanjing Jiangning police in a timely manner, so as to find the lost person Huang Mou at an early date.
At the same time, relevant experts suggested that tourists should be standardized, rational and civilized in outdoor activities, pay attention to roadside warning signs at all times, do not venture into no man's land, and promptly call the police in case of emergency.
The US media unraveled the truth that the US side unjustifiably asked China to close the Consulate General in Houston - CNN

The US media unraveled the truth that the US side unjustifiably asked China to close the Consulate General in Houston.
On the 24th, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the US Embassy in China that China had decided to revoke the establishment and operation license of the US Consulate General in Chengdu, and made specific requirements for the Consulate General to stop all business and activities, as a countermeasure to the sudden request of the United States to China to close the Consulate General in Houston on the 21st.
This behavior of the US government has aroused many concerns, and its political motivation has been questioned by foreign media and scholars.
Why is China required to close the Consulate General?
According to a number of foreign media, it is not clear why the United States selected the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, but as for the purpose of this move, the foreign media bluntly said: For the general election.
CNN reported on the 23rd that the move of the United States to ask China to close the Consulate General in Houston raised questions about its political motives.
According to the article, the disastrous response of the US government to the new crown epidemic has resulted in a relatively low poll approval rating of President Donald Trump before the election.
White House officials privately said that the tough strategy adopted against China is to save Trump's approval rating, but also to deflect responsibility for the failure of the White House to respond to the epidemic.
According to the article, the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is a "politically driven and very cautious" target chosen by the United States, and the United States government chose it "to create a tough attitude while avoiding the risk of causing major conflicts".
The BBC also believes that at a time when the US election season is approaching and the US economy is severely hit by the epidemic, Trump believes that "playing the 'China card' has a political advantage".
The current situation is "a spiraling and tit-for-tat struggle", which is driven to a certain extent by the US government from the point of view of domestic considerations, which will only worsen the tension between China and the United States.
According to CBS News, Trump's re-election prospects have been pressured by the outbreak, and he has repeatedly blamed China for the outbreak.
Almost every day, the United States has new actions against Trump's absurd argument that "China exploits the United States".
"The Consulate General of Houston is very important in establishing ties between the two countries"
The Associated Press commented that the United States asked China to close the Consulate General in Houston, exacerbating tensions between the two largest economies in the world.
If the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is closed, in addition to the diplomatic impact, Chinese citizens located in the southern part of the United States face difficulties in obtaining consular services, as do American citizens seeking visas and other services.
A business group in Houston expressed regret that the United States asked China to close the Consulate General in Houston, saying that the Consulate General played an important role in establishing trade, investment and cultural ties between the two countries.
According to the Associated Press, this reflects the importance of China's economy.
According to the website of US Foreign Policy magazine, this move by the US side "is part of a series of provocative measures, which will only worsen US-China relations".
Reuters quoted Jonathan Pollack, an expert on East Asia at the Brookings Institution, an American think tank, as saying that since the United States and China established comprehensive diplomatic relations in 1979, he could not think of any move comparable to the US action against the Chinese Consulate General in Houston.
Hong Kong's South China Morning Post reported that this move by the United States is unprecedented in more than 40 years of diplomatic relations between China and the United States.
Analysts believe that this move may cause lasting damage.
The Chinese Consulate General in Houston was built in 1979 and is the first Consulate General opened by China in the United States.
At present, China has an embassy and five consulates general in the United States.

On the same day, Russia's North Sea, Baltic Sea, Black Sea, Caspian Sea and Pacific fleets held military parades in the waters where their respective bases are located, with a total of 15,000 military personnel, 219 ships of various types and 71 military aircraft participating.
Putin, Russian President and Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, attended the military parade of the Baltic Fleet.
About 4,000 military personnel, 46 ships and more than 40 warplanes took part in the local military parade.
Putin first reviewed the parade of ships in the waters of the Kronstadt Naval Base in the Baltic Sea.
After that, he arrived in the waters of the Neva River in the center of St. Petersburg by speedboat and went ashore to watch the military parade held on the Neva River.
In a speech at the military parade, Putin said that the modern technology level of Russian naval equipment has continued to improve in recent years, and the Russian Navy will receive a total of about 40 new ships equipped with unique hypersonic strike systems in 2020.
In addition, Russian Navy Commander-in-Chief Yevmenov recently told the Red Star newspaper, the official newspaper of the Russian Ministry of Defense, that Russia's plan to build ships has been effectively implemented, and the number of new ships planned by the Russian Navy in 2020 is large in recent years.
In 1696, Tsar Peter the Great began to form a maritime fleet, ushering in the history of the Russian navy.
The last Sunday of July each year is the Russian Naval Festival.
In response to the new changes in the prevention and control of the epidemic, since July 17, trade unions at all levels in Xinjiang have responded to the call of the General Trade Union of the Autonomous Region and actively participated in the prevention and control of the epidemic.
Trade union cadres, workers and model workers from the north and south of Tianshan have entered street communities and the masses of residents to carry out activities such as delivering food and medicine, disinfecting and sterilizing, and publicizing knowledge of epidemic prevention, so as to serve the working masses and demonstrate the "hard nuclear force" of trade unions with practical actions.
Recently, the comfort group of the Tianshan District General Trade Union of Urumqi sent a batch of urgently needed epidemic prevention and control living materials to the staff of 12 isolation sites.
After the outbreak of the epidemic, Tianshan District invested a total of more than 1.05 million yuan at the first time, and urgently allocated 23 directly affiliated grass-roots trade unions.
After receiving the notice of the company on the prevention and control of the epidemic, Zhao Xiangguo, deputy secretary of the Party Committee of China Construction Xinjiang Construction Industry and president of the trade union, volunteered and chose to stay on duty at the unit to protect the staff and workers.
He sent cooking utensils, food and household goods to the workers living in the dormitory of the unit and new entrants, and organized personnel to send them the necessary materials for life every two days.
"From July 21, the cadres and staff who adhere to the front line of the war 'epidemic' will be mapped out, and the method of online orders and door-to-door delivery by merchants will be adopted to first supplement the purchase of epidemic prevention supplies and living materials for 704 frontline workers in Urumqi."
The head of the Xinjiang Transport Trade Union told reporters that in the face of the outbreak, they made every effort to do a good job in ensuring epidemic prevention and control services, steadily promote the development of transportation, and create a strong atmosphere of unity in fighting the "epidemic".
At present, it is in the summer heat, and trade unions at all levels are keeping a close eye on frontline workers in key areas for epidemic prevention and control, and have put "sending cool" care and care into practice.
On July 19, the Urumqi County General Trade Union launched a "cool" condolence campaign to workers on the front line of epidemic prevention and control. Police stations, card points and health systems throughout the county received drinks, fruit and other comforts.
"Trade union cadres should further improve their political position, strengthen their responsibility, warm the hearts of the people with care and boost their fighting spirit with their actions.
We should give full play to the role of trade union organizations in rallying and uniting workers, do a good job in safeguarding epidemic prevention and control services, actively safeguard the health rights and interests of the broad masses of workers, and send care to frontline workers. "
The relevant person in charge of the General Trade Union of the Autonomous Region said.
The direct recruitment of non-commissioned officers will be fully launched in 2020 - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26 (reporter Jia Qilong) The Political Work Department of the Military Commission and the National Defense Mobilization Department of the Military Commission recently jointly issued a notice to deploy and launch the direct recruitment of non-commissioned officers from graduates of ordinary institutions of higher learning in 2020.
This year, the direct recruitment of non-commissioned officers covered more than 270 military and local general specialties in 64 categories, including computers, automation and machinery, with emphasis on increasing the recruitment of drones, navigation, aerospace, electronic information and small languages. The recruitment scale increased by nearly 2,000 compared with last year.
This year, the direct recruitment of non-commissioned officers was organized and implemented simultaneously with the recruitment of conscripts, which began on August 1 and ended on September 30.
Through the National Conscription Network (http: / www.gfbzb.gov.cn), young conscripts can check the conditions for direct recruitment of non-commissioned officers and the distribution of recruitment specialties in various places, submit registration information online if they meet the professional scope and recruitment conditions, and participate in medical examination, political examination and other follow-up recruitment work in accordance with the unified requirements of the military service organs of the place of conscription.
Qualified young people who have not been recruited as non-commissioned officers due to the restrictions on the recruitment of specialties and plans may participate in the recruitment of conscripts. When they are selected as non-commissioned officers at the end of compulsory military service, the number of years of study in ordinary institutions of higher learning in accordance with the prescribed academic system shall be regarded as the length of service.
This year, the recruitment of non-commissioned officers will be uniformly organized by the conscription offices of the provincial or prefectural and municipal people's governments. Specialties with rich registration potential will be selected on the basis of merit on the basis of comprehensive measurement of the academic level of the applicants, the results of professional courses during their stay in school and the acquisition of vocational qualification certificates. Scarce specialties will be targeted for local institutions that meet the professional requirements and have the advantage of recruitment.
According to the requirements of normalizing the prevention and control of the epidemic, the direct recruitment of non-commissioned officers this year will not, in principle, arrange to report for duty on their own, and will organize transportation into the camp simultaneously with the conscripts.
The time for the direct recruitment of non-commissioned officers into the army will begin on September 1, 2020, and the time for the army to issue the order for non-commissioned officers to serve will be December 1, 2020.
The receiving units of the armed forces will scientifically formulate enlistment and professional training plans and carefully organize the training. After the completion of the training, the recruitment of non-commissioned officers will be uniformly and accurately assigned to corresponding professional and technical posts in accordance with the principle of professional counterpart and consistent recruitment.
Spokesman of the Embassy in the UK: The Chinese government is a staunch defender of cyber security - CNN
On July 26, according to the website of the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom, on July 25, the spokesman of the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom answered a press question on the false remarks about cyber attacks.
The spokesman stressed that the Chinese government is a staunch defender of cyber security and has always resolutely opposed and combated any form of cyber attacks and cyber crimes.
A reporter asked: According to the media, hacking organizations related to China have interfered with the network system of a British company, launched attacks on British and American technology companies that hold patent data, and hacked into the government networks of EU countries.
The spokesman said that the Chinese government is a staunch defender of cyber security and has always resolutely opposed and combated any form of cyber attacks and cyber crimes.
Cyberspace has strong virtual nature, difficult traceability and a variety of actors. When investigating and characterizing cyber events, sufficient evidence should be produced, and there should be no gratuitous speculation.
The spokesman said that a series of events such as the "Prism Gate" in the past proved that the United States has been carrying out the largest cyber theft operation in the world.
It is in the common interest of all countries to maintain peace and stability in cyberspace.
The spokesman pointed out that China's achievements in science, technology and innovation are not stolen or snatched, but obtained through self-reliance and hard work.
In 2019, China submitted about 59,000 patent applications through the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), with an annual growth rate of 10.6%, making it the country with the largest number of international patent applications.
China has become a major country in innovation and intellectual property rights.
Data from the Urumqi Central Branch of the People's Bank of China showed that in the first half of the year, new loans for agriculture-related and small and micro enterprises in Xinjiang exceeded the increase for the whole of 2019.
In the first half of this year, the Urumqi Central Branch of the People's Bank of China used a variety of monetary policy tools to guide the banking industry to continuously increase its loan investment, providing adequate financial security for the prevention and control of the epidemic and the resumption of work and production.
Urumqi free nucleic acid testing Most areas have basically completed secondary testing in high-risk areas -- ScienceDaily
Urumqi, July 26 (reporter Sun Tingwen Zhao Yamin) Zhang Wei, director of the Urumqi Municipal Health Committee, said in a briefing on the latest outbreak and nucleic acid testing in Urumqi on July 26 that at present, the free nucleic acid testing work in most districts of Urumqi has been basically completed.
The expert group of the State Council and experts from the autonomous region and Urumqi are making further assessments of the development of the epidemic based on nucleic acid testing and epidemiological investigation results.
The press office of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region held a press conference on the 26th to inform Xinjiang of the epidemic situation and prevention and control.
According to him, between 0: 00 and 24: 00 on July 25, there were 22 new confirmed cases of Xinguan pneumonia in Urumqi (of which 5 were transferred to confirmed cases of asymptomatic infected persons) and 38 new asymptomatic infected persons.
As of 2400 hours on July 25, there were 135 confirmed cases and 147 asymptomatic infected persons in Urumqi.
The new asymptomatic infected persons on the 25th also basically passed free nucleic acid testing and active screening throughout the city.
Zhang Wei, director of the Urumqi Municipal Health Committee, said on the 26th that the free nucleic acid testing in Urumqi has been basically completed in most districts.
He also said that from the experience of other regions in the country, there are many factors affecting the nucleic acid test results, such as the sensitivity of the detection reagent, the infection time and detoxification time of the tested person, the cooperation of the tested person when the specimen is taken (poor cooperation may lead to the specimen not being taken in place), as well as the testing environment and the operational proficiency of the inspectors.
For various reasons, false negative results will also appear in nucleic acid testing.
The so-called false negative means that the tested person is indeed infected, but the nucleic acid test result is negative.
In addition, for persons who have had close contact with confirmed and suspected cases, two nucleic acid tests are usually needed to rule them out.
For those who have been to high-risk areas in the epidemic, if they experience fever and respiratory symptoms, there is a false negative possibility for a negative nucleic acid test, so two nucleic acid tests are also needed to rule it out.
He said that in view of the above situation, for the health of people of all ethnic groups in the city, starting today, Urumqi will conduct secondary free nucleic acid testing in key areas such as Tianshan District and Shaybak District, while carrying out "checking and filling leaks".
It is reported that Tianshan District and Shaybak District are high-risk areas for the epidemic.

The offline streamlining of "on the cloud" is enthusiastic, and the Shanghai International Film Festival reveals unusual industry confidence.
This newspaper (chief reporter Wang Yan) Yesterday, the 2020 Shanghai International Film and Television Festival, held in the context of strict epidemic prevention measures, opened the 23rd Shanghai International Film Festival with an industrial summit forum on "striving for a well-off society in an all-round way and building a new era of dreams".
As the first international film and television festival held since the continuous spread of the global epidemic and the normalization of epidemic prevention and control in China, this year's Shanghai International Film Festival is of great significance.
On the basis of doing a good job in normalizing epidemic prevention and control, holding the Shanghai International Film and Television Festival is not only a sign of confidence, but also a declaration of determination - our confidence and determination to overcome the epidemic remains unchanged, our confidence and determination to run the people's festival well remains unchanged, and our confidence and determination to build a global film and television creation center and launch the "Shanghai Culture" brand remains unchanged.
Every year, the Shanghai International Film Festival, with a continuous innovation and enterprising attitude, is a new start and a new beginning.
Therefore, it is necessary to take every step to serve the spiritual life of the people and serve the high-quality development of the film and television industry.
This year is even more so.
In order to cherish the hard-won situation of epidemic prevention and control, the Shanghai International Film Festival, on the one hand, strictly adheres to the requirements of epidemic prevention and makes detailed implementation of epidemic prevention and control measures. On the other hand, it has launched a multi-plate activity online and offline with the vision of gathering wisdom for Chinese film creation and meeting the viewing needs of fans.
On the first day of the opening, from offline viewing to industry forums, the relevant activities of the festival strictly implemented the relevant epidemic prevention policies.
Forum activities are limited to 50 people, and each viewing session is separated by seats and the attendance rate is strictly controlled within 30%.
As the organizing committee of the festival adheres to, in any case, "putting the safety and health of the people first" is the general premise.
Offline activities have been greatly streamlined, and "on the cloud" has become a lot more lively.
In order to implement the important concept of "People build cities for the people and people build cities for the people", and as a festival for the people, this year's Shanghai International Film Festival plans to innovate and seek transformation, using initiatives such as online "cloud exhibition" and master class "cloud sharing" to meet the diverse needs of fans.
On the first day of the opening, the official partners of the festival, Mi Kuo Video and Oriental Pearl Blockbuster, respectively, will "cloud" a number of "Belt and Road" films to give back to fans.
In the evening, the Jinjue Opening Forum and Jia Zhangke Master Class also went live on a number of platforms, including Central Video, Learning Powerhouse and Wenhui App, so that people can pay attention to the latest trends in Chinese films without leaving their homes.
At the opening forum yesterday, Yan Xiaoming, member of the Party Group and Deputy Director of the Central Radio and Television Station, delivered a speech and opened the festival. Zhou Huilin, member of the Standing Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Committee and Minister of Publicity, delivered a speech. Vice Mayor Zong Ming attended.
White House epidemic expert Fauci: Cautiously optimistic about the development of a vaccine in early 2021
Fauci made the remarks at an online video conference hosted by the International Leadership Foundation on the 25th.
He reminded that it is not yet clear how the new crown epidemic will develop in autumn and winter, nor what the ultimate impact of the epidemic will be. "And the only way to end all this is for each of us to choose to be part of the solution."
According to data from Johns Hopkins University in the United States, as of 2100 hours on the 25th, the number of confirmed cases and 146,000 deaths in the new crown in the United States had reached 4.176 million.
Fauci said that some parts of the United States are currently struggling with the rebounding epidemic.
Although the epidemic situation varies from place to place and requires response plans adapted to local conditions, diversified anti-epidemic strategies do not mean that there is no close connection between regions.
An outbreak in one region will eventually affect other regions.
"This is not a time for complacency," Fauci said. "Our work is not completed. We must step up our efforts. We must also be vigilant about the uncertainty in the future."
He Daichi, a Chinese-American medical expert and founder of "cocktail therapy" for the treatment of AIDS, pointed out at the meeting that the new crown epidemic in the United States has not yet reached its peak.
"Each of us must do our part to slow the spread of this virus."
He Daichi called on the public to use their practical actions to buy time for scientists in order to step up the development of new crown therapeutic drugs and vaccines.
The International Leadership Foundation is a non-profit organization with the aim of promoting international exchange activities in the United States and the Asia-Pacific region. It is committed to enhancing the status of Asia-Pacific people in the United States and cultivating international young leaders.
On the same day, US Secretary of Transportation Xiaolan Zhao, US Federal Rep. Meng Zhaowen and Dong Jiling, Founding President of the International Leadership Foundation, addressed the meeting.
In particular, they paid tribute to the medical workers and volunteers of Asia-Pacific descent who fought the epidemic on the front line, and called on the American public to continue to adhere to epidemic prevention guidelines such as "social distance" to curb the spread of the epidemic.

Brazilian study shows that hydroxychloroquine is not effective in the treatment of mild to moderate new crown pneumonia -- ScienceDaily
Recently, a Brazilian study showed that hydroxychloroquine is not effective in patients with mild to moderate new crown pneumonia.
The study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
Pakistani researchers divided 667 patients in 55 hospitals across the country into three groups and conducted clinical trials. They mainly compared the treatment effect of using hydroxychloroquine alone or combined with other antibiotic azithromycin, and analyzed whether it would help improve the condition of patients with mild and moderate new crown pneumonia.
The results showed that hydroxychloroquine not only has no therapeutic effect, but may have damaging side effects on viscera.
This study was jointly completed by a number of authoritative hospitals in Brazil, such as Hospital Israel Albert Einstein, Cardiology Hospital and Hospital S-rio-Libans, together with the Brazilian Clinical Research Institute (BCRI) and the Brazilian Intensive Care Research Network (BRCNet).
On the 25th local time, Brazilian President Bolsonaro announced through the social platform that the fourth nucleic acid test result was negative.
During the infection, Bolsonaro has been taking hydroxychloroquine and actively promoted it many times.

On the 25th, the 2020 Hunan Red Tourism and Culture Festival and the first Xiangtan Red Cultural Industry Expo kicked off in Shaoshan.
In recent years, the demand for red tourism has gradually increased.
However, the development of the red tourism industry is also faced with difficulties such as the small number of young groups, the homogenization of tourism projects and the single commercialization channel.
In particular, this year's epidemic raid has seriously frustrated the national cultural and tourism industry, and red tourist attractions are also facing serious challenges.
For example, using scientific and technological means such as drone shooting and VR immersion experience can meet the tourist needs of "people have not arrived and scenery has arrived"; introducing webcasting means to promote the famous products of red scenic spots can directly enhance the economic benefits of red tourism; introducing" cloud "technology to create boutique displays with outstanding themes, distinct orientations and rich connotations to fully display and enhance the educational functions of red scenic spots; innovating the communication methods of red culture to make revolutionary cultural relics" live ", make red tourism popular, allow red genes to pass on and enhance the attractiveness of red scenic spots.
This cultural festival uses the popular "county and city (district) chief + professional anchor special promotion" method to promote red cultural tourism specialties, and uses 5G technology to provide real-time viewing and smart city demonstration services to promote red cultural tourism attractions. All are efforts to plant smart wings for red tourism. It is expected that Hunan red tourism will become more and more popular.
Representatives of the U.S.-China Trade Talks were rumored to meet in August.
Hong Kong's South China Morning Post quoted an anonymous person familiar with the matter as reporting on the 25th that Liu He, head of the Chinese trade negotiation team and Vice Premier of the State Council, and Lai Haizhe, co-leader of the US team and trade representative, are expected to hold formal talks in August to assess the implementation of the first phase of the China-US trade agreement between the two sides.
The report said that although China has significantly increased the amount of American agricultural products purchased in the past few months, due to factors such as the new crown virus epidemic, the volume of Chinese purchases is still some way from the amount promised in the trade agreement.
Analysts said that the recent closure of each other's consulates by the United States and China, together with other disputes, may undermine any progress in trade between the two sides.
The first phase of the trade agreement between China and the United States entered into force one month after its signing on January 15. The agreement stipulates that the trade framework group composed of senior officials from both sides shall hold semi-annual talks.
According to people familiar with the matter, the meeting will be "an important turning point", allowing both sides to assess the progress of the agreement.
However, this person also said that if the tension between the United States and China leads to a low willingness to talk at this time, the two sides may agree that the conference call between Lai Haizhe and Liu He on May 8 has met the terms of semi-annual talks in the trade agreement.
Since the beginning of this year, China-US relations have deteriorated rapidly. The disputes between the two sides include a series of issues such as the origin of the new crown virus, trade, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, the South China Sea and ideology.
Although US President Donald Trump boasted about his achievements in the first phase of the agreement at the beginning of the year, his attitude has changed recently.
He said at a White House press conference on the 23rd that although China has recently purchased a record amount of American corn in a single day and has also bought a lot of soybeans, "this trade agreement is not as meaningful to me now as it was when it was reached".
An anonymous Beijing government adviser agreed that due to the poor relations between the United States and China, a new round of trade negotiations is unlikely to take place, and that "trade issues have lost weight in China-US relations".
However, he revealed that China's economic and trade related units still met on the 23rd to discuss a series of issues, including how to increase the volume of imports from the United States. "We have tried our best to buy, so any additional purchases will be difficult".
Peng Jining, Vice President of the National Committee on U.S.-China Trade, said that it is "more important than ever" to maintain the momentum of the first phase of the agreement, and pointed out that China has made progress in further opening its financial markets to American enterprises this year.
Analysts at Planum, an independent research company, said: "It is better to talk than not, although it may only be regarded as routine."
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26 (reporter Wei Yukun) A reporter learned from the Ministry of Emergency Management on July 26 that the State Prevention Office and the Ministry of Emergency Management, together with the State Food and Material Reserve Bureau, have once again urgently transferred 1.35 million woven bags, 1.2 million square meters of woven cloth, 130,000 square meters of geotextile and other six types of central reserve flood control materials to Anhui to support the flood rescue and rescue work in Anhui Province.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Ministry of Emergency Management, at present, the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the Huaihe River basin maintain high water level fluctuations. The "Yangtze River Flood No. 3 of 2020" formed in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River on the 26th, increasing local risks.
The meteorological department expects heavy rainfall in Chongqing, Guizhou and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in the next three days, and the flood control situation is still serious and complex.
According to the report, since the beginning of the flood, the Ministry of Emergency Management has deployed the national integrated fire and rescue team to pre-position professional rescue forces in key flood control areas. It has participated in a total of 10,364 flood rescue and rescue cases of various types. It has deployed more than 130,000 commanders, 17,778 fire engines and 11,887 boat boats to rescue 37,777 people trapped in distress and evacuate and transfer more than 107,000 people trapped.
Hao Yusheng, Chief Representative of Nasdaq China: Now is the best time node for Chinese companies to go to the United States for IPOs. - Economic Watch? Professional Financial News Website
Zhang Bin, a reporter for the Economic Watch Network, has implemented stricter supervision on Chinese shares in the US market because of the Ruixin coffee fraud incident. Combined with the long-term pressure on valuation, Chinese shares listed in the US have felt pressure. Netease, Jingdong and other Chinese shares have recently begun the journey of returning to Hong Kong for listing.
Recently, Shell, Ideal Automobile and other companies have been enthusiastic about listing in the United States.
Under the epidemic and the Chinese stock crisis, is this the best time for Chinese enterprises to list in the United States?
"As far as the recent IPO cases and the situation of the companies to list in the United States are concerned, the IPO in the United States has not been affected in essence. On the contrary, the market is very good now. Even now this time point is the best time node for Chinese companies to IPO in the United States in the past 10 years."
Hao Yusheng, chief representative of the Nasdaq Stock Exchange China, said at the "China Stock Branch of the 2020 Leaders Summit of Listed Companies" hosted by Snowball.
In April this year, the Securities and Futures Commission (SEC) and the American Public Company Accounting Regulatory Commission (PCAOB) issued the "Statement on the Important Role of Audit Quality and Regulatory Access to Audit and Other International Information - Discussion on the Current Challenges of Information Access for American Listed Companies with Large Business in China".
The statement said that although international cooperation and coordination have increased significantly in recent years, the problems of the US regulatory authorities in obtaining information still exist, and the SEC and PCAOB still face legal and practical challenges. Corresponding to the document, the PCAOB website details the list of listed companies and their audit institutions that have encountered audit obstacles, with a large number of Chinese stock companies listed.
In addition, in May this year, the Senate of the United States Congress passed the Foreign Company Accountability Act, which imposes additional information disclosure requirements for foreign companies to list in the United States.
In Hao Yusheng's view, the Chinese stock crisis has not affected investors' appetites.
"When this news first came out, it caused panic among everyone. Everyone was asking if we could list in the United States in the future, but later we found that these questions were not a matter for investors. Investors may ask these questions during the recent roadshow for IPOs in the United States, or even become standardized questions, but this was not regarded by investors as an important factor in investing in and not investing in a Chinese company.
It is suggested that we try to view the current situation with a sense of normalcy.
Of course, this may be the most serious situation in the past two years on the surface, but as far as investors' appetites are concerned, it has not been affected in any way.
So between now and the end of this year or before the US election, the boom in IPOs in the US will continue. "
On May 9 this year, Jinshan Cloud was officially listed on Nasdaq in the United States, becoming the first Chinese company to go to the United States for an IPO after the outbreak.
"The listing of Jinshan Cloud gives great confidence to the Chinese companies preparing for the IPO later."
Hao Yusheng said.
The Chinese stock data report for the first half of 2020 released by Snowball showed that in the first half of this year, a total of 20 Chinese enterprises went to the United States for IPOs, an increase of 17.6% over the same period last year. In terms of total initial capital raising, 20 enterprises raised a total of 2.725 billion, up from the same period last year, up more than 52.4%. In terms of industry distribution, the number of IPOs in the health care industry in the first half of this year was outstanding, up 100% from the same period last year.
According to Hao Yusheng, Chinese companies that went to the United States for IPOs in the first half of this year are of high quality, and quality companies with excellent fundamentals and growth will be more favored by investors.
In the short, medium and long term, Hao Yusheng continues to be optimistic about the IPO of Ming China Company in the United States.
"In the short term, the boom in IPOs in the United States continues. In the medium term, Chinese companies have more choices. A shares, Hong Kong stocks and US stocks. We will take the US election and China-US relations as considerations for market choice and time choice. In the long term, everything will return to normal. Market fluctuations are cycles, both political and economic cycles, and will eventually return to normal stages. The stock market has always been volatile."
At the same time, Hao Yusheng said, "There are many uncertainties this year, but for quality companies, no matter whether the market is good or bad, as long as they are solid and have growth that investors can see, other factors are relatively secondary. Investors need to invest in excellent Chinese companies."

In this work, the composer presented a more introspective emotion and incorporated his new inspiration and memory of past creations and his native land.
In Yang Yang's calm and calm handling, the melancholy temperament and grandeur of this work were revealed, and the orchestra also performed Rakhmaninov's "last spark" in a gorgeous and dazzling manner.
The performance forerunner of this concert once again brought unexpected surprises to the audience.
Then he came to the public space on the first floor of the National Theatre to start a dialogue with Yang Yang, Zhang Haochen and the tuner of the National Theatre in front of three nine-foot pianos with stories. Gangqiang discussed with them the maintenance and maintenance of the piano, Rakhmaninov's music, musicians' usual life and pre-performance preparation from the perspective of a senior piano enthusiast. At the end of the guide, Gangqiang also worked with Zhang Haochen's "Relay", which made the netizen audience feast their eyes on it.
In the evening, at the Taihu Amphitheatre of the National Theatre, the military song was loud and clear - the military choral song concert kicked off with the melodious and beautiful "Never Forget the First Heart".
This is the first performance of the "Taihu Week Concert" of the National Theatre since the fight against the epidemic.

Commentator of People's Daily: Concentrate on doing your own thing well to create new advantages for future development - On studying and implementing General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech at the Entrepreneur Symposium - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 25 (Xinhua) -- People's Daily commentator article of July 26: Concentrate on doing your own thing well to build new advantages for future development
At present, the global epidemic and the world economic situation are still serious and complex, and the challenges facing China's development are unprecedented.
Maintaining strategic determination, enhancing confidence in victory and concentrating our efforts on doing our own thing well are the key for us to meet various risks and challenges.
At the entrepreneurs' symposium held recently, General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed that under the current external environment of rising protectionism, depressed world economy and shrinking global market, we must concentrate our efforts on doing our own thing well, give full play to the advantages of the domestic mega-market, gradually form a new development pattern with the domestic and international cycles as the main body and the domestic and international double cycles promoting each other, upgrade the level of modernization of the supply chain of the industrial chain, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation, accelerate the tackling of key core technologies and build new advantages for future development.
He who inspects the situation is wise, and he who controls the situation wins.
Under the external environment of the in-depth development of economic globalization, the "two ends outside" of the market and resources have played an important role in the rapid development of our country.
Now, the world under the impact of the epidemic is undergoing profound changes, facing more unstable and uncertain factors, and economic globalization is encountering headwinds and backwaves.
We will make ideological and working preparations to deal with changes in the external environment for a longer period of time, and push our economy to ride the waves and make steady progress. An extremely important aspect is to take expansion and meeting domestic demand as the strategic basis for development, give full play to our own advantages, add impetus to China's economic development through the prosperity of the domestic economy and the smooth flow of the domestic cycle, and drive the recovery of the world economy.
We should deeply realize that building a complete domestic demand system is related to the long-term development and long-term stability of our country.
The Central Committee of the Party reviewed the situation and clearly stated that it is necessary to firmly implement the strategy of expanding domestic demand, which is the need to deal with the impact of the epidemic, to maintain the long-term sustained and healthy development of our economy, and to meet the growing needs of the people for a better life.
The advantage of the economy of a large country is that it can be recycled internally.
China has the most complete and largest industrial system, strong production capacity and perfect supporting capabilities in the world. It has more than 100 million market players and more than 170 million talents with higher education or various professional skills. There is also a super-large domestic demand market formed by 1.4 billion people, including more than 400 million middle-income groups. It is in the stage of rapid development of new industrialization, informatization, urbanization and agricultural modernization, with great potential for investment demand.
Public ownership is the main body, the economy of various forms of ownership develops together, distribution according to work is the main body and various distribution methods coexist. The socialist market economic system and other basic socialist economic systems can not only stimulate the vitality of all types of market subjects, liberate and develop social productive forces, but also promote the organic unity of efficiency and fairness and continuously achieve common prosperity.
We should firmly grasp the strategic basis of expanding domestic demand, make all links of production, distribution and circulation rely more on the domestic market to achieve a virtuous circle, clarify the strategic direction of supply-side structural reform, and promote a dynamic balance between aggregate supply and aggregate demand at a higher level.
It is necessary to accelerate the construction of a complete domestic demand system, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation and other innovations, accelerate the promotion of strategic emerging industries such as the digital economy, intelligent manufacturing, life health and new materials, form more new growth points and poles, and gradually form a new development pattern with the domestic and international cycles as the main body and the domestic and international double cycles promoting each other.
Openness brings progress, and closure is bound to lag behind.
General Secretary Xi Jinping has repeatedly stressed that the door to China's opening will not be closed, but will only be opened wider and wider.
Taking the domestic cycle as the main body is not to close the operation behind closed doors, but to make the domestic and international markets better connected by giving full play to the potential of domestic demand, make better use of both international and domestic markets and resources, and achieve stronger and more sustainable development.
At the same time, there is no contradiction between expanding domestic demand and expanding opening up. The smoother the domestic cycle, the more conducive it is to building a new pattern of opening up, and the more conducive it is to forming new advantages in participating in international cooperation and competition.
Although the trend of protectionist thought is now rising in the world, we should stand on the correct side of history, adhere to deepening reform, expanding opening up, strengthen open cooperation in the field of science and technology, promote the building of an open world economy and promote the building of a community of a shared future for mankind.
The Chinese nation has experienced many tribulations in its history, but it has never been crushed. Instead, it has become more and more brave, constantly growing up in tribulations and rising up from them.
On the way forward, with the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, the remarkable advantages of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, strong mobilization ability and strong comprehensive strength, and the unity and struggle of the whole Party, the army and the people of all ethnic groups in the country, we will surely be able to overcome all difficulties and obstacles, maintain the momentum of sound economic and social development in our country, build a well-off society in an all-round way, and successfully start a new journey of building a socialist modern country in an all-round way!
Balance Bao income down "after 90" but "retaliatory" to save money?
With the decline of balance treasure income, "after 90" not only did not escape balance treasure, but began to "retaliate" to save money?
The "Balance Bao Saving Money After 90" (2020 edition) recently released by the China New Economic Research Institute in conjunction with Alipay showed that in the first half of the year, the "after 90" was more fond of saving money: The amount of money saved per capita increased by nearly 40% over 2019.
Interestingly, "after 90" is more inclined to save from a "small amount of money", with 60% of the average amount of money saved is less than 20 yuan...
Saving money with balance treasure has also become a "post-90" saving habit.
The data showed that of the 700 million balance treasure users, 134 million users are "after 90".
There are 174 million "post-90" in China, that is to say, about three out of every four "post-90" in the country are saving money with balance treasure.
At present, the seven-day annualized yield of money funds such as Balance Bao has fallen from higher than 2% at the beginning of the year to about 1.5%.
Even so, it did not affect the pace of saving money after the "90".
In the context of the improvement of the "money saving effect" of balance treasure, many young people who are used to using balance treasure have also been directly transformed into "basic people".
Alipay data showed that as of July 13, the number of new "base people" on Alipay has more than doubled year-on-year in the past month, and more and more young people are achieving "advanced" financial management on Alipay.
Some analysts believe that the flow of funds from balance treasure into the stock market is also an important reason for the clear decline in the share of the IMF in June.
The report also showed that the "90" girls are more likely to save more money, which is on average 20% higher than the amount of money saved by boys. Of the users who hold funds on the Alipay platform, 60% are men, and women tend to choose more robust financial management methods than men.
After saving money, what is the plan after "90"?
Alipay data showed that "after 90" has the habit of saving money for the goal, with the largest number of users taking travel as the goal of saving money.
Affected by the epidemic, many "after 90" saved money to prepare for travel after the epidemic. The resumption of business in cinemas also provided a new way to shift from saving money to spending.
Let a bright party flag fly high on the flood levee.
Recently, the south of China has been affected by continuous rainfall, and the flood control and flood fighting situation is very serious, resulting in disasters in 26 provinces (districts and cities), including Guizhou, Sichuan, Hunan, Guangxi, Guangdong and Hubei.
The disaster situation is the order, the disaster area is the battlefield, and in the face of the disaster, the Party flag is the war flag. Party organizations at all levels, the broad masses of Party cadres and the children and soldiers of the people resolutely implement the important directive spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping on flood control and relief work, and quickly participate in the front line of flood control, flood rescue and relief, becoming the backbone of the people in the disaster area and a fresh force in flood fighting.
The bright party flag flutters high on the flood levee, which is an expression of loyalty and a call of mission.
In the face of disasters, a party organization is a battle fortress, and a party member and cadre is a flag.
On the flood control line in various places, Party organizations at all levels and the broad masses of Party cadres demonstrate a high degree of loyalty to the Party, listen to the call of the Party Central Committee, and build a series of steel forts that cannot be broken with the action of "look at me", the pace of "follow me" and the courage of "I go first", and stand up the backbone of China that cannot be bent.
The bright party flag flutters high on the flood levee, which is the holding of the position and the trumpet of the charge.
In the face of flood and waterlogging disasters, Party organizations at all levels acted quickly to blow the "stormtrooper" of flood control and plant the bright party flag on the flood control levee. The broad masses of Party cadres and the people's children and soldiers clung to the position of flood control. With the will and actions of "the Party flag is in the position" and "the flood will never accept troops", they have become the most reassuring and trustworthy strong barrier for the people in the disaster areas.
The bright party flag flutters high on the flood levee, which is selfless dedication and responsibility.
In times of crisis, the true character of Party members is demonstrated. At a time when the lives and property of the people are seriously threatened, Party members, cadres and the people's children and soldiers give up their small families and take care of everyone, make selfless dedication and dare to take responsibility. They take winning the hard battle of flood control, flood rescue and relief as the main battleground and military parade ground for comprehensive inspection ability, style and literacy. It is this spirit of selfless dedication and responsibility that greatly inspires the confidence and determination of the people in the disaster areas to overcome the disaster situation and gathers a strong spiritual force to win flood control, flood rescue and relief.
"The supremacy of the people and the supremacy of life" is not only tested in peacetime, but also tested at critical moments.
On the flood levee, the broad masses of Party cadres and the people's children and soldiers should let the people see the bright red party flag, the figure of struggle and the voice of encouragement everywhere at any time, and brighten the party flag with the steel dam that cannot be broken by the flood, so that a bright party flag can fly high on the flood levee!

(Fight against New Crown Pneumonia) A total of 13 people from the Department of Public Information of the Philippine Presidential Palace have tested positive
ManILA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The Department of Public Information (PCOO) of the Presidential Palace of the Philippines issued a notice on July 25 that the Minister of the Ministry, Martin Andanar, tested negative for newly crowned pneumonia on July 24.
As of the afternoon of the same day, a total of 13 staff members of PCOO had tested positive. Previously, three positive persons, one died and two were still receiving treatment.
Due to contact with an infected staff member of PCOO, Andanar tested for newly crowned pneumonia with 49 PCOO staff on the 24th.
The report released on the 25th showed that 10 of the staff members tested positive.
Marvin Gatpayat, Deputy Minister of Administration and Legal Affairs of PCOO, said that the new administrative office building of the Ministry at the presidential palace was scheduled to resume office on the day President Duterte delivered his fifth State of the Union address on the 27th.
On the same day, Martin Andanar assured the public that PCOO continues to fulfill its duties to the Filipino people and ensure that important information is provided to the public in a timely manner, while strengthening contact tracking and testing to avoid further spread of the new crown pneumonia virus among PCOO staff. He prayed for the rapid recovery of the staff who tested positive.
The Ministry of Health of the Philippines announced that 2019 new cases were confirmed in the country on the same day, with a cumulative total of 78,412 cases, of which 50,763 were still suffering from the disease.

France increases military investment in space - Xinhua
French Defense Minister Florence Pali said on the 24th that France will add hundreds of millions of euros to the space defense budget and develop space military forces to guard against "unfriendly moves" that may be carried out by other countries in outer space.
Pali told the Provence newspaper on the same day that between 2019 and 2025, the expenditure budget for French space military projects will increase from the previously proposed 3.6 billion euros (about 4.2 billion U.S. dollars) to 4.3 billion euros (5 billion U.S. dollars).
According to the French Military Planning Act from 2019 to 2025 approved by the French Parliament in 2018, France is expected to update its existing observation satellites and communications satellites in the future, launch three electromagnetic listening satellites and improve the level of modernization of space surveillance radars.
French President Emmanuel Macron announced last July that a space military command and an "aviation and space force" will be established within the French Air Force.
Pali said that she will officially announce the establishment of the space force when she visits a military school in Salon, Provence region, later.
Pali said that the space force is affiliated with the Air Force and will have a strength of 500 by 2025.
"Gone is the idea that space serves the common interests of science. Today, space is a place for countries to compete for global hegemony," she said.
Pali reiterated Macron's previous statement, saying that France has no intention of provoking an arms race.
"We are by no means engaged in an arms race. But it is my responsibility to thoroughly recognize the threats we may face."
Pali recalled the surveillance of a military satellite shared by France and Italy in 2017.
She claimed that the "sneak peek" was a Russian satellite.
The Russian side denies this claim.
Pali said that France will "soon" have small patrol satellites capable of detecting and targeting "the black hands behind those unfriendly moves".
French media believe that France sought to establish a space force because US President Donald Trump asked the US Department of Defense to draft a bill to establish the Pacific Air Force last February.
Trump signed the National Defense Authorization Act last December, approving the establishment of the sixth army of the United States, the Pacific Air Force.
Some experts are concerned that these US initiatives have accelerated the pace of militarization of US space and may trigger a new round of space arms race.

Report says the shared accommodation market has picked up since March - CNN
This newspaper (reporter Yang Zhaokui) The "China Shared Accommodation Development Report 2020" (hereinafter referred to as "the Report") recently released by the Sharing Economic Research Center of the State Information Center shows that the volume of transactions in China's shared accommodation market fell by 72.1% year-on-year in the first five months of 2020 due to the impact of the epidemic.
However, the shared accommodation market has picked up since March, and the market transaction volume, order volume and the number of receptionists have gradually recovered.
According to the Report, the volume of transactions in the shared accommodation market has fallen sharply. On the one hand, due to the sharp decline in the demand for travel and accommodation under the prevention and control of the epidemic, the volume of orders has decreased sharply. The total number of orders in the first five months has fallen by 65% year-on-year and the number of receptions has fallen by 63% year-on-year. On the other hand, the weakness of demand has also led to a more pronounced decline in overnight prices, with the average overnight price falling by 16% year-on-year in the first five months.
However, in March, April and May, the volume of market transactions increased by 78%, 199% and 35%, respectively. The number of orders increased by 141%, 152% and 50%, respectively. The number of visitors increased by 81%, 112% and 28%, respectively.
The Report pointed out that the development of the shared accommodation industry has been promising for a long time, but there are still many uncertainties in the near future.
In response, Yu Fengxia, deputy director of the Sharing Economy Research Center of the State Information Center, told the Workers' Daily that the development of shared accommodation needs stronger policy support. On the one hand, it is necessary to do a good job in the implementation of policies already in place in the previous period, further strengthen policy publicity and pay attention to creating a better business environment. On the other hand, it is necessary to further strengthen policy guidance and support in terms of stimulating consumer demand, enriching the supply of tourism and residential services, innovating service methods and strengthening cooperation between the government and platform enterprises.
According to Reuters, a new crown outbreak occurred at a factory of ArcelorMittal, the world's largest steel manufacturer, located in Lhasa Luo Cardenas, Mexico, and 21 people have died so far.
It was reported that Solorio, secretary general of the local branch of the Mexican Mining and Metallurgical Workers' Union, said that the dead included employees, contractors and suppliers of the factory.

Due to the strict hygiene measures adopted at the factory, it is possible that workers may have been infected with the virus outside the factory.
The plant employs more than 7,000 people, according to the union.
As of July 25, Mexico has a cumulative total of more than 385,000 confirmed cases and more than 40,000 deaths. Mexico is the fourth highest number of new crown deaths in the world.
Xiamen, July 26 (Yang Fushan Zhang Shushan Xu Jingyi) Vascular Surgery of Shanghai Changhai Hospital of Naval Military Medical University, a famous vascular surgery center in China, signed a contract with Zhongshan Hospital, affiliated with Xiamen University, on July 25 to jointly set up a collaborative center to promote exchanges and cooperation between the two sides in the field of vascular surgery specialties, especially aortic acute and severe cases.
According to Zhongshan Hospital, affiliated with Xiamen University, after the vascular surgery of the two hospitals is formally formed into a cooperative unit, it will carry out remote consultations, formulate treatment plans for real-time online consultations with Changhai Hospital, select and send talents for further study and training, and jointly carry out weekly surgical technical exchanges and teaching and room inspection. For complex cases, Changhai experts can be invited to the hospital to perform surgery according to the needs of patients, thus realizing that patients in southwest Fujian can enjoy the top medical resources in the country without the province.
The two hospitals will also work together to carry out scientific research on surgical innovation, the popularization of aortic diseases and early screening, among other things.
A special aortic seminar sponsored by the Beijing Health Promotion Association and hosted by Zhongshan Hospital, affiliated with Xiamen University, was held in Xiamen on the same day.
At the same time, the two well-known hospitals in Shanghai and Ha held the signing ceremony of the Vascular Surgery Collaboration Center at the meeting, and announced the formation of a collaborative unit to jointly improve the level of treatment of vascular surgery-related diseases in the southwest Fujian region.
Shanghai Changhai Hospital Vascular Surgery is the only institute of vascular surgery in the army and the only clinical medical center for vascular system diseases in Shanghai. It is also the first national key discipline of vascular surgery. It has led the establishment of the intracavity vascularization professional committee of the Chinese Medical Association and is a top team with deep accumulation in the industry.
Professor Huang Xiaojin, Director of Vascular Surgery at Zhongshan Hospital, affiliated with Xiamen University, gave an interview to the media.
Vascular surgery at Zhongshan Hospital, affiliated with Xiamen University, is the first vascular surgery set up by an independent discipline in Fujian Province. It has long been committed to the diagnosis and treatment of aortic and peripheral blood tube diseases. In 2018, it was approved to build key clinical specialties at the provincial level.
In the treatment of aortic diseases, in addition to the treatment of dissection aneurysms and aortic aneurysms, he is experienced in emergency rupture aortic aneurysms.
"Vascular surgery at Zhongshan Hospital, affiliated with Xiamen University, is outstanding in the region in terms of the history of development and the breadth, difficulty and complexity of the operation. Therefore, this time, we have set up a collaborative center. In addition to the aorta, we can also carry out all-round in-depth cooperation in medicine, teaching and scientific research in the diagnosis and treatment of lower limb arteries, carotid arteries and other diseases."
Professor Feng Rui, Deputy Director of Vascular Surgery at Shanghai Changhai Hospital, said.
Zhongshan Hospital, affiliated with Xiamen University, and Shanghai Changhai Hospital signed a contract to set up the "Li Zhaoshen Famous Medical Studio" of the Department of Digestive Medicine in 2018.
Professor Huang Xiaojin, Director of Vascular Surgery at the hospital, told CNN that the hospital's vascular surgery also has a long history of exchanges with Changhai Hospital. This time, the two hospitals have formally formed a cooperative unit, bringing the cooperation and exchange between the two sides to a new level.
He said that the hospital will regularly invite Shanghai experts to the building to carry out surgical technical exchanges, teaching room inspections and difficult case discussions, while further carrying out remote consultations. At present, it plans to conduct remote consultations once a week. In addition, the department will send personnel for further study and exchange to strengthen the training and development of the subject talent team.
Reporters learned at the meeting that vascular disease is the number one cause of death in China, and the aorta, as the main channel of all organs of the human body, flows from the heart to the whole body and plays an important role.
The occurrence of aortic diseases is often accompanied by high risk, high mortality rate and high difficulty of treatment. The thickest section of the aorta is 4cm in diameter. Once hemangioma is formed, rupture occurs, or vascular endometrial rupture produces dissection, it will lead to heavy bleeding, which is very dangerous.
In recent years, with the change of people's lifestyle and the acceleration of the pace of life, China has become the largest country in the world for hypertension, and aortic diseases have also increased. Today, with the development of surgical technology and industrial materials, the treatment of aortic diseases has continued to develop in a minimally invasive, rapid and efficient direction.
Doctors can properly "change the channel" for blood flow by puncturing the thigh and placing a stent in the aorta, thus avoiding the impact on aneurysm or ruptured dissection and achieving good therapeutic results. Some operations even require only local anesthesia.
This academic seminar invited more than a dozen domestic experts to attend the seminar to discuss new advances in the treatment of aortic diseases, and to conduct cutting-edge technical training and difficult case discussions in the form of a conference salon.
Reporters learned at the meeting that with the development of surgical technology and industrial materials, the current treatment of aortic diseases continues to develop in a minimally invasive, rapid and efficient direction.
The State General Administration of Prevention continues to maintain the flood control level II response of the Yangtze and Huai rivers - Xinhua
There will be heavy rainfall from the Sichuan Basin to the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
The State General Administration of Prevention continues to maintain the flood control level II response of the Yangtze and Huai rivers.
Reporters learned from the Ministry of Emergency Management on the 25th that heavy rainfall is expected from the Sichuan Basin to the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River by the 27th. It is necessary to pay continuous attention to the impact on the flood situation of the Yangtze and Huai rivers. The embankments in some parts of the Yangtze and Huai river basins have been soaked at high water levels for a long time, and the risk of landslides, collapses and pipe surges is high.
After consultation and judgment, the State General Administration of Prevention decided to continue to maintain the flood control level II response of the Yangtze and Huai rivers.
At the meeting of the Ministry of Water Resources on the 25th, it was stressed that the main stream of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River maintains a high water level, and the flood peak of the main stream of the Huai River passes through the Bengbu section of Anhui Province. The water level of Taihu Lake has continued to exceed the police for 28 days and the protection for 9 days. The current flood control situation is still serious, and flood control work cannot be relaxed in the slightest. We should continue to do a solid job in all defense work.
At the same time, we will do a good job in preventing heavy rainfall in Southwest and North China.
The Ministry of Water Resources maintains the level II emergency response for flood and drought disaster prevention.

Aichi's "Journey" went live on July 24 and also embarked on the journey of webcasting - Xinhua
Directed by Chen Dsen and supervised by Zheng Baorui, and starring Liu Xianhua, He Rundong, Lin Chenhan and Jiang Luxia, the action adventure film "Journey" will go live on July 24.
This is also the second major production film to choose to be webcast after "My Mom".
Adapted from the online game of the same name, "Journey" tells the story of Dongyilong, a young man in Qingyuan village, and Chu Soul, a warrior of the Chu Jiajun, who embarked on the journey to participate in the selection of the Grand Marshal of the South Zhao State soldier and Horse. On the way, they met the little sister of King Kong. The three completed their mission together.
This year marks the 15th anniversary of the game "Journey", and the launch of the film of the same name is undoubtedly also a tribute to the classic game.
At the same time as the announcement of the set, the film "Journey" released the "National War" version of the set poster as well as the "Live" pilot trailer.
The excellent picture quality presents a grand picture of the national war in the journey world, portraying the profound brotherhood of the two protagonists, Dongyilong and Chu Soul.
"Journey" chooses the overhead era to build the background of the story.
In the fictional Central Plains mainland, among the ten countries, the State of South Zhao and the State of North Yan live next to each other.
In order to defend against the increasingly powerful Beiyan, Nanzhao held a martial arts conference to select generals.
The news reached the remote Qingyuan village. Villager Dongyilong wanted to become the flag bearer of the family and compete on behalf of the Qingyuan village family. However, the villagers questioned his qualifications. After some efforts, Yilong finally embarked on a journey with the warrior Chu Soul.
The total investment of the film is nearly 300 million yuan, and the proportion of special effects lenses in the film is as high as 80%.
As you can imagine, special effects have become one of the biggest points of view of Journey.
And the late special effects production team is also quite promising. It is the responsibility of MORE VFX, the special effects team that created "wandering Earth", to restore the "journey" world with imaginative visual art and top technology.
Some of these classic game scenes, Phoenix, Qingyuan Village and Beast King Valley will also appear in the film. Gamers should set off a wave of nostalgia when they arrive.
In addition to the special effects team, behind-the-scenes production is also a group of accomplished figures in the industry.
Director Chen Dsen has directed "October Siege" and "Purple Rain Storm". Supervisor Zheng Baorui has filmed "Kill the Wolf 2" and "Three dozen White Bones of Monkey King in Journey to the West". The action scenes are the responsibility of Dong Wei, the best action director of the Golden Awards and the Golden Horse Awards. Art director Mak Guoqiang is also the winner of two Golden Awards for Best American Fingers.

Chongqing, July 26 (Xinhua) -- A reporter from Han Lu learned from China Railway Chengdu Bureau Group Co., Ltd., on July 26 that the Little Three Gorges Tunnel of the Zhengwan High Speed Rail, which is about 18.9 kilometers long, was fully connected on the same day.
It is understood that the Little Three Gorges Tunnel is not only the longest high-speed rail tunnel within the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, but also the longest single-hole, two-lane high-speed rail tunnel designed to reach 350 km / h in projects currently under construction in China.
Located in the three provinces and cities of Henan, Hubei and Chongqing, the Zhengwan High Speed Rail is connected to the Beijing-Guangzhou and Xulan High Speed Rail in the north of Zhengzhou, and arrives in Chongqing on the Wanzhou Nanlian Yuwan High Speed Rail. It is an important part of the riverside passageway and HuNantong Road in China's "eight vertical and eight horizontal" high-speed railway network.
The Little Three Gorges Tunnel of the Zhengwan High Speed Rail was fully connected on the 26th.
The picture shows the scene through.
The Zhengwan high-speed railway starts in Zhengzhou City, Henan Province, and passes southwest through Pingdingshan City, Nanyang City, Xiangyang City, Hubei Province, to Wanzhou District, Chongqing City. The new line is about 818 kilometers long, with a design speed of 350 km / h, and about 184 kilometers in Chongqing.
Among them, the Zhengzhou to Xiangyang section was opened for operation in advance on December 1, 2019, and the Chongqing section is stepping up its construction.
The Little Three Gorges Tunnel, which was fully connected on the 26th, is a full-line control project of the Zhengwan High Speed Rail. The project is located at the junction of Fengjie County and Wushan County in Chongqing. It is about 18.9 km long and has a maximum burial depth of 890 m.
Construction of the tunnel began in February 2017 and will be fully connected on July 26, 2020.
According to Wang Jun, head of the design of the Zheng Wan High Speed Rail Tunnel of China China Railway Second Academy Engineering Group Co., Ltd., the survey designer, the topographic and geological conditions of the Little Three Gorges Tunnel are very complex and face risks such as karst, mud gushing and large soft rock deformation. It is a Class I high-risk tunnel, which is extremely difficult to design and construct.
"During the construction of the project, we used geological survey method, geophysical exploration method and advanced drilling method to advance geological forecasting, and adopted special design schemes for more than 30 caves of various types. For example, we designed and built bridges 24 meters long to cross large caves with a longitudinal length of more than 10 meters and a depth of more than 55 meters in the tunnel to avoid tunnel subsidence," the Royal Army said.
According to the China Railway Tunnel Bureau, the builder, the construction of the tunnel adopts a combination of diversion and blocking. By building horizontal cave flat guidance, grouting and water plugging, strengthening tunnel structural support and building sewage treatment stations, it not only ensures the orderly progress of the project, but also avoids the damage of construction drainage to the water body of the Little Three Gorges Scenic Area. At the same time, it successfully overcomes the construction problems such as adverse geology such as the large deformation of soft rock up to 7 kilometers long and the maximum daily water inrush of 157,000 cubic meters.
When the entire Zhengwan high-speed railway is completed and opened to traffic, it will become a new convenient and rapid passenger main route from the Southwest region of China to the Central Plains, North China and Northeast China. It is of great significance to improve the capacity and quality of the Northeast railway corridor in the Southwest region, improve the layout of the regional road network, accelerate the process of tourism resources development and urbanization along the route, promote the coordinated development of the region, and promote the implementation of the strategy for the development of the western region.
Experts say it is unconstitutional to collect immigration data through the United States Census for the allocation of seats in the House of Representatives.
Some civil rights organizations and several US cities and counties have sued the US federal government, saying that the Trump president's attempt to exclude undocumented immigrants from the US census is unworkable and unconstitutional.
The United States Census will determine the allocation of seats in the House of Representatives of the United States Congress.
Sarah Brannon, executive lawyer of the American Civil Rights and Freedom League, told VOA, "This will not work."
She went on to say that Trump's request to determine the citizenship of those who receive the census in the census is difficult to do and "not very reliable."
Another civil liberties organization, Common Cause, filed a lawsuit Thursday to challenge Trump's executive order.
Some cities in New Jersey and Georgia joined the lawsuit.
Virginia's Arlington County also joined the lawsuit Friday.
Garvey, chairman of Arlington County's management board, said, "The United States Constitution requires that our population be accurately counted every 10 years. We must accurately count everyone who lives in Arlington County. This illegal attempt to scare people away and reduce the number of our immigrant communities cannot be allowed to succeed."
Other organizations and individuals praised President Trump's executive order.
Alabama Attorney General Marshall called the executive order a "victory" for the state.
He said, "When allocating congressional House of Representatives seats and electoral college seats in each state, it must be based on the number of residents living in the state and the number of residents who are legally resident."
The U.S. Supreme Court last year blocked the Trump administration from including the citizenship question in the 2020 census.
President Trump signed an executive order earlier this week directing Commerce Secretary Ross, who oversees the United States Census Bureau, to submit data on the undocumented population obtained by the census so that the administration can exclude these undocumented people from the census figures of the states and thus determine whether each state will increase or reduce or maintain the number of seats in the House of Representatives.
The United States redistributes seats in the House of Representatives every 10 years according to demographic changes.
Flood control level IV emergency response was activated locally after heavy rain fell in 33 districts and counties of Chongqing -- ScienceDaily
Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, July 26 (Reporters Ke Gaoyang, Li Song) Reporters learned from the Chongqing Flood Control and Drought Control Headquarters that Chongqing has seen a new round of heavy rainfall weather process since July 25. Heavy rain has fallen in 33 districts and counties, and four small and medium-sized rivers have experienced excessive warning level floods. The local area has activated flood control level IV emergency response.
According to the monitoring of Chongqing Hydrological Monitoring Terminal, between 0800 hours on the 25th and 0800 hours on the 26th, large parts of Chongqing received heavy to heavy rain, with 33 districts and counties, including Jiangjin, Qijiang and Wulong, experiencing heavy rain, including 16 districts and counties, including Wanzhou, Yunyang and Nanchuan, experiencing heavy rain.
The heaviest daily rainfall occurred in Longshan Village, Jinshan Town, Nanchuan, at 197.5 millimeters.
Under the influence of heavy rainfall, four small and medium-sized rivers, Donkey Zi Creek in Jiangjin District, Yau River in Fuling District, Yingyang River in Kaizhou District and Tuantan River in Yunyang County, experienced excessive warning level floods. At present, the water level is still rising.
Heavy rainfall also led to landslides in Liujing Village, a land township in Wulong District, causing the disruption of village road traffic. The slippery slope slipped into the tributaries of the Wujiang River along the Canghe River, blocking the river channel to form a quake lake. The local area has urgently organized the transfer of people downstream.
In response to the rainstorm, the Chongqing Flood Control and Drought Control Headquarters issued the river flood level III warning information at 1300 hours on the 26th, and activated the flood control level IV emergency response. It requested the relevant districts, counties and units to strengthen inspection and duty, mobilize emergency rescue teams and materials in a timely manner, and evacuate and transfer the people in the threatened areas.
Respond to the situation and promote the construction of industrial projects - Viewpoint headlines - Hunan Daily Network - Hua Sheng Online
In Hunan in the height of summer, the heatwave hit the face.
And the enthusiasm released by the on-site observation meeting to promote the construction of industrial projects throughout the province overshadowed the heat of the three-volt day, and the clear orientation of "comparing strength with industry and talking about heroes with projects" encouraged Sanxiang and four waters.
The development of Hunan always depends on the construction of projects and the cultivation of industries.
In the face of a very unusual first half of the year, under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, the whole province has adhered to a game of chess and made every effort to fight the two hard battles of epidemic prevention and flood control, taking industrial projects as the "forerunner" for implementing the "six stable" and "six guarantees".
From a 1.9% year-on-year decline in GDP in the first quarter to 1.3% year-on-year growth in the first half of the year, the difficulties and great efforts during the period are self-evident.
On this valuable report card, the construction of industrial projects is the key support for Hunan to accelerate economic recovery and develop steadily for the better.
The potential is smooth and irreversible.
The construction of industrial projects should be put into the overall situation. It is not only good at accumulating momentum, building momentum and planning momentum, but also good at understanding change, seeking change and adapting to it.
Against the complex and severe background of the current international situation, in addition to painstakingly attracting investment, it is necessary to sit back and study the new characteristics of the current new situation, grasp the laws more, be more scientific and precise, and better integrate into the new development pattern with the domestic and international cycles as the main body and the domestic and international double cycles promoting each other.
More attention should be paid to enhancing the basic capacity of the industry.
In the first half of the year, a large number of heavyweight investment projects in emerging industries in our province not only broke ground and sowed hope, but also traditional superior industrial enterprises accelerated their distribution and fall in the digital, intelligent and green industrial transformation.
The Yiyang Oxconn Third Science Park project has transformed the existing production line, with the intelligent production line of high-end printed circuit boards taking the lead. The new factory area of Hunan Zhongyan Changde Cigarette Factory is committed to the process of intelligent transformation and the construction of modern factories. It is also a vivid portrayal of the "old trees and new buds"... Only by focusing on consolidating and upgrading superior industries, actively cultivating and developing new industries, and comprehensively increasing the efforts of scientific and technological innovation and domestication substitution can we continuously strengthen the basic conditions and accumulate the momentum of transformation.
More attention should be paid to cultivating and developing a new economy and new business models.
The sudden new crown epidemic has brought about the popularity of the "cloud economy", stimulated the potential of the digital economy and provided new opportunities for industrial transformation. In the first half of the year, the computer and office equipment manufacturing industry, the electronics and communication equipment manufacturing industry in our province grew by 12.6%, the online retail sales of wholesale and retail enterprises above the limit increased by 32.2% year-on-year, and the online meal income of catering enterprises increased by 35.6% year-on-year.
It is the general trend to cultivate new machines in the crisis and open up new situations in the changing situation, actively promote digital industrialization and industrial digitization, and guide the integration and development of the digital economy and the real economy.
More attention should be paid to optimizing and stabilizing the supply chain of the industrial chain.
Construction machinery is the main force of Hunan industry, but two-thirds of the supporting enterprises are outside the province, and there is still space and potential in the supporting chain.
To strengthen the thinking of the industrial chain and grasp projects, it is necessary not only to have leading enterprises continue to accumulate and achieve technological breakthroughs in key links of the industrial chain; it is also necessary for all regions to devote themselves to cultivating, stimulate the "chain" lock response with strong chain replenishment and chain extension, promote the coordinated layout of relevant supporting industries, and accelerate the construction of an independent, controllable, safe and reliable industrial chain supply chain.
To overcome difficulties and support enterprises, Hunan is still a hot and promised land with a good business environment and the emergence of market business opportunities.
All parts of the province have made frequent moves, new moves and practical measures to believe that the "reduction of the burden" of enterprise relief will lead to the "acceleration" of high-quality development; Shaoyang has implemented "shareholder style" services to do things for enterprises without prevarication, implementing policies without discount or solving problems overnight... In the process of recovering the losses caused by the epidemic, all kinds of "every effort" has been made to find the right shortcoming pain points and achieve a vivid story of turning the crisis into an opportunity.
Focusing on studying industries, cultivating industries and developing industries, and firmly optimizing the business environment, we will surely win the favor of more investors.
The wind and waves ahead are still there, but the state of riding the waves has become the norm for the whole province to focus on the construction of industrial projects and promote high-quality development.
In this critical period, we must study and implement the spirit of the series of important instructions and instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping, persevere in promoting the construction of industrial projects with the certainty of our own work, and share enthusiasm and sweat to ensure the successful conclusion of the 13th Five-Year Plan and building a well-off society in an all-round way.

Cultivating new forms of business to open up new space for employment -- ScienceDaily
New employment methods are constantly emerging, opening up new employment space, and a number of innovative service policies have been launched in succession, helping new employment patterns to thrive.
The latest data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed that the national urban survey unemployment rate was 5.7% in June, down 0.2 percentage points from May.
This is also two consecutive declines in the unemployment rate in the national urban survey since April. Behind the month-to-month decline in the unemployment rate data is the emergence of new employment opportunities in new industries.
Now the monthly salary of more than 5,000, coupled with the freshness of embracing information technology, has made Guo Mei more and more driven.
At the innovation incubation base of Shanxi Transformation and Comprehensive Reform demonstration Area, there are more than 2,300 data taggers.
It is not only data taggers. Since the beginning of this year, the state has also defined 25 occupations, including nucleic acid testers and online learning service providers, as new occupations, developing vocational skills standards and launching skills training programs to support the development of practitioners.
In view of new employment methods and new entrepreneurial paths, the state is also innovating employment services.
Recently, 13 departments, including the National Development and Reform Commission, jointly issued the Opinions on Supporting the Healthy Development of New Business Models and Activating the Consumer Market to Drive the Expansion of Employment, providing workers with a variety of employment opportunities.
Many sectors will jointly cultivate new individuals in the market and further reduce the cost of online entrepreneurship and employment for self-employed persons. They will make new business workers more secure. Policies such as the protection of the rights and interests of flexible employment and social security will be introduced in succession.

The overall stability of employment and prices shows that the economy has a "temperature" -- ScienceDaily

The overall stability of employment and prices shows that the economy has a "temperature".
Economic Daily China Economic Network reporter Lin Huocan
In the first half of this year, in the face of the impact of the Xincrown Pneumonia epidemic, China has promoted the prevention and control of the epidemic and economic and social development in an integrated manner. The situation of the prevention and control of the epidemic has continued to improve, the steady recovery of the economy has been obvious, and the performance of employment and prices, which are closely related to the people's livelihood, has been generally stable. The Chinese economy has handed over a report card on the operation of the economy with temperature.
In the first two months of this year, the survey unemployment rate rose.
In particular, in February, the production and operation activities of many enterprises were basically in a state of shutdown, the employment demand of enterprises decreased, recruitment was delayed or cancelled, and the urban survey unemployment rate rose.
With the gradual improvement of the situation of epidemic prevention and control, the production and living order of the whole society has been continuously restored.
The Central Committee of the Party adheres to the general tone of the work of steady progress, further strengthens the hedging of macro-policies, comprehensively strengthens employment priority policies, and actively promotes the work of helping to stabilize and expand employment.
China has increased its policies to hedge and stabilize jobs, played a combination of "relief and slow return compensation" policies, reduced and reduced the contributions of three social insurance units in a phased manner, allowed the postponement of the payment of social insurance premiums, expanded the benefits of the stable return of unemployment insurance for small and medium-sized enterprises, and provided absorption subsidies and trainee subsidies to enterprises to absorb the employment of key groups.
With the implementation of various stable employment policies, the employment demand of enterprises has steadily picked up, the employment situation has gradually improved, and the urban survey unemployment rate has gradually declined. In June, the survey unemployment rate was 5.7%.
Zhang Yi, Director of the Population and Employment Statistics Department of the National Bureau of Statistics, said that in the second quarter, various employment policies continued to bear fruit, and the labor force that withdrew due to the impact of the epidemic in the early period returned in succession. The urban labor force participation rate rose by about 10 percentage points in June compared with February, close to the level of the same period last year.
The data showed that the total amount of urban employment increased by more than 19% in June compared with February, and most industries reached pre-epidemic levels. The average weekly working hours of employees in enterprises reached 46.8 hours, 6.6 hours higher than in February and slightly 0.1 hours higher than in January.
Prices are also related to thousands of households.
In January this year, the CPI rose 5.4% year-on-year, a multi-year high.
Entering February, the year-on-year increase in CPI fell slightly, but it was still in the "5 range".
The year-on-year increase in CPI is at a high level, driven by consumer demand before the Spring Festival, as well as the wrong month of the Spring Festival and the low year-on-year base.
However, the impact of the new crown pneumonia epidemic on prices is particularly obvious.
Affected by the prevention and control of the epidemic, all parts of the country experienced logistics delays, untimely supply of materials and increased transportation costs of materials in January and February. Together with the hoarding and rush of some citizens, the prices of some basic necessities rose significantly.
In order to deal with the disturbance caused by the prevention and control of the epidemic to the price situation, the relevant departments have included important living materials in the scope of emergency transportation security to ensure the smooth transportation of materials.
Under the role of a series of policy measures, the supply of vegetables, melons and fruits in the market has been strongly guaranteed.
In response to the rapid rise in pork prices at the beginning of this year, after the central government issued the policy of ensuring supply and stable prices, all regions and departments quickly implemented it. The supply of pork reserves has improved markedly, pig production capacity has been restored in an orderly manner, and the order of production and marketing has gradually become normal.
Since March, pork prices have fallen continuously, driving the year-on-year increase in food prices to fall back to 10.6% in May. In June, pork prices rose slightly year-on-year due to factors such as the slowdown in hog production, the decrease in imports and the recovery of group consumer demand.
The seasonal changes in the price of fresh vegetables are obvious, with an average increase of 3.4% in the first half of the year.
Influenced by the high comparative base in the same period last year, the price of fresh fruit continued to decline year-on-year, falling by an average of 13.3% in the first half of the year.
The basic livelihood of the masses has been effectively guaranteed, and the overall economic and social situation has remained stable and orderly.
With the gradual recovery of transportation logistics, various regions have increased their efforts to guarantee supply, and the supply and demand situation in the market has improved.
Since March, the CPI has fallen year-on-year for four consecutive months, and the year-on-year increase has also fallen from 4.3% in March to 2.5% in June. The price level has generally returned to stability.
In the second half of the year, China's prices will continue to remain moderate, and the overall inflationary pressure is small, but it is still necessary to promote the restoration of production and living order on the premise of doing a good job in normalizing epidemic prevention and control.
We will effectively deal with natural disasters such as floods and droughts in major agricultural producing areas such as grain, fruits and vegetables, strengthen market supervision, and resolutely crack down on hoarding and price gouging that disrupt market order.

China News Agency, Qinghai Hainan, July 26, by wire: "Flower Sea Direct" on the banks of Qinghai Lake: "Sweet" to bring goods to help farmers increase their income
Author Hu Guilong Pan Yujie
"On the banks of Qinghai Lake in the height of summer, the eyes are full of golden flowers and thousands of bees flying. Here, the altitude is high, the temperature difference between day and night is large and the air pollution is low. The strong light breeds the most tenacious and generous bee colony, creating the characteristics of Qinghai royal jelly with high activity, high protein, rich nutritional value, low sugar and low fat."
On the 26th, Zhang Jianxun, deputy director of the Industry and Information Administration of Hainan Tibetan Autonomous prefecture in Qinghai Province, said.
On the same day, the live delivery of "concentric war epidemic spring pulp to help farmers" bee products was held on the banks of Qinghai Lake. The China Bee Products Association, representatives of entrepreneurs and bee farmers gathered to jointly promote Qinghai specialty bee products. A total of nearly 10,000 bottles of Qinghai Plateau royal jelly were sold online and offline, with a total delivery value of nearly 3.8 million yuan.
The picture shows bee farmers displaying bee products on site.
It is reported that the live delivery event uses the Beijing Houde gift bee industry chain network, fast hands, Taobao and other well-known domestic bee product retail enterprises, live streaming and e-commerce platforms to promote the exchange and cooperation of "enterprises + bee farmers + growers", and continuously issue "Qinghai Plateau Spring Pulp Consumer Vouchers" to consumers through online and offline channels. The total annual profit of enterprises is expected to be nearly 5.28 million yuan.
In response, Wuna, President of Beijing Houde Li Bee Industry Co., Ltd. thought it was "well worth it": "This move can expand the visibility of Qinghai bee products, attract more consumers to understand and like bee products without adding pure nature, and drive bee farmers to increase their income."
At present, the company has signed a production cooperation strategic agreement with Qinghai Cloud Bee Industry Co., Ltd. and Qinghai Huabao Bee Industry Co., Ltd., hoping to jointly promote the rapid development of the local bee industry in Qinghai.
The picture shows the sea of rapeseed on the banks of Qinghai Lake.
This spring, road traffic checkpoints were set up in various places due to the need for epidemic prevention and control, and the journey of bee farmers to "chase flowers and honey" was blocked. Many bees died because they missed the flowering period and lacked food, seriously affecting the income of bee farmers.
"All year round, bee farmers follow the flowering period and move all the way north from Yunnan and Sichuan to the Northwest Territories. They sleep rough and have no fixed abode, which is very hard.
As a business, we have a responsibility to help them, "he said.
Wuna said.
"Small bees are 'environmental scouts', and bees in heavily polluted areas cannot survive," said Zhao Xiaochuan, Executive Vice President of the China Bee Products Association. Bee Pollination is an important link in the ecological chain and plays an irreplaceable role in protecting plant diversity and improving the ecological environment.
At the same time, bee Pollination can increase crop production and improve quality, especially in areas with widespread planting and poor management conditions, and Pollination is of greater significance.
Research data show that Pollination can increase the production of canola by about 15% to 30%.

"The economic, ecological and social benefits created by bee Pollination far outweigh the value of bee products themselves. The bee industry has great potential in human health, crop production, vegetation reproduction and ecological protection, which people have always known little about."
Zhao Xiaochuan said.
Today, the number of beekeepers is becoming less and less. In addition to the bee farmers who travel away all year round, there are still many poor households with mobility problems who choose to take a stake in the cooperative with beehives.
"The state has financial support, and we contact technicians to help guide. Bee farmers lack understanding and judgment on the market environment. To open up sales, they also need the help and coordination of the government, enterprises and industry associations."
Zhao Xiaochuan said.
"I hope you will pay more attention to and help beekeeping groups in the future," Wuna said. "Our bee products are also screened and controlled in strict accordance with national standards to ensure quality and protect the rights and interests of consumers while helping bee farmers."

Liu Yunlong, an old face of espionage dramas, plays a stuttering leading actor - Xinhua
Produced by Liu Yunlong and directed by Yin Fei, and starring Liu Yunlong, Su Qing, Liang Guanhua and Li Liqun, the large-scale espionage drama "The Wins" landed on Guangdong Television's "Vitality Theater" at 7: 30 p.m. on July 16.
The play tells the story of Tang Fei (Liu Yunlong), an underground member of the Communist Party of China lurking in the Japanese pseudo-police station, who joined forces with Soviet agents to assassinate the leader of the Japanese agent and crush the startling plot of the Japanese army.
"The Wins" is based on historical facts and the material is taken from the dusty Soviet military archives for many years.
During the defense of Moscow, the elite of the Soviet Red Army in the Far East advanced westward to help. At this time, the "northward advance faction" of the Japanese Guandong Army believed that there was an opportunity to take advantage of it and intended to send troops.
In order to solve the danger of suffering from the enemy, the Communist Party of China and the intelligence personnel of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union jointly implemented the "Mudanullah" plan.
According to this historical background, Deng Yuan, a well-known screenwriter, has been polished several times, making the plot twists and turns burn his brain.
Liu Yunlong served as both producer and leading actor in "The Wins" this time.
In the play, he plays Tang Fei, the Chief of the Criminal Section of the Linhe Police Department. He is a stuttering policeman with a lot of joy and even a little riffraff. His true identity is an underground member of the Communist Party of China.
Cai Meng, the heroine who staged the opposite play, is the head of the Linhe Security Bureau. She is deeply appreciated by her Japanese boss Fukuhara. There is a delicate relationship with Tang Fei that is also friends and foes and ambiguous.
Su Qing has tried many different types of characters in recent years, from Lu Ruowen in "We Were Young in Those Years" to Erqing in "Yanxi Tackle", all of which impressed the audience and were recognized for their acting skills.
This time, Su Qing and Liu Yunlong are the first partners. The stuttering sheriff is paired with the charming policewoman setting, which is quite interesting and innovative.
In addition to the two protagonists, "The Wins" is joined by a large number of powerful actors, including Liang Guanhua, Li Liqun, Qian Bo, Lei Han and Shin Junyi. The old drama is also one of the points of view of the play.
It is understood that "The Wins" is also very well produced, with the crew filming nearly 2,000 kilometers across Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Liaoning provinces.
In order to restore the bizarre urban features of the Northeast Japanese period, the cast of art and props rushed to work day and night to carefully polish every detail of the scene construction and props, making the scene picture exquisite and rich in historical texture.

In addition, dozens of houses in the northern part of Hodeida Province and the southern part of Haje Province were destroyed by the flood, and some roads and farmland were also damaged to varying degrees.
The military conflict, which lasted for several years, caused the health system in Yemen to nearly collapse.
According to the statistics of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, since 2017, the number of people infected with cholera in Yemen has exceeded 1 million and the death toll has exceeded 2,000.
Yemeni medical institutions are concerned that the continued floods will lead to the renewed spread of the cholera epidemic.
"Jedi Strike" is released to fight a dream life in the boxing ring - Xinhua
Directed by young director Gao Zhuangzhuang and starring William Liao, Dongyu, Yang Xinran and Wang Yibo, the online film "Jedi Strike" was officially released at Aichi Art.
The film tells the story of fallen fighter Venus returning to the ring and fighting for dignity, showing a warm-blooded and presumptuous dream journey.
Driven by Thailand as the main plot, the film "Jedi Strike" takes "Muay Thai" as the starting point for Venus, the fallen boxing champion, to pursue her dreams. The whole story is carried out under the adaptation of traditional Chinese cultural values. Whether Venus made up her determination to fight fake boxing for her master in the early period or her efforts to rejuvenate her fight for dignity in the later period with the support of her friends and lovers, it shows the pursuit and great love of family and dreams by men in traditional Chinese culture.
Combining with the classic Hollywood sports film story model and the strong joint efforts of the professional teams of China and Thailand, "Jedi Strike" not only presents an international effect, but will also impress different types of audiences.
At the same time, "Jedi Strike" shows a large number of the plot of Muay Thai combat and training, and the intensity and blood of the scene.
In the film, Zhang Xiaoliang, a game designer played by Dongyu, helps Venus, played by William Liao, return to the ring and take the crown through fighting games. It combines novel and interesting high technology with warm-blooded competitive competition. It also shows the brotherhood of Zhang Xiaoliang and Venus, which seem to be "different" and actually have the same goal.
In addition, the long stream of love between Venus and Jingjing is also very moving. Jingjing's silent support for Venus and Venus' firm commitment to Jingjing have made the audience see the "iron man tenderness" in Venus and added a lot of human feeling to the fallen boxing champion.

Greenfield Opens a New Round of Mixing Reform of Shanghai State Capital to Transfer 17.5% Shares - Economic Watch Network? Professional Financial News Website
On July 26, Rao Xianjun, a reporter for the Economic Watch Network, Greenfield Holdings (600606.SH) issued the "Indicative Notice on the Proposed Transfer of Some Shares of the Company and Resumption of Trading by State-owned Shareholders through public solicitation of transferees".
The contents of the announcement show that in order to further deepen the reform of state-owned enterprises, optimize the restructuring of the layout of state-owned capital and improve the ownership structure of Greenfield, Shanghai Real Estate (Group) Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Shanghai Real Estate") and Shanghai CityInvestment (Group) Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Shanghai CityInvestment") intend to transfer some of their shares of the company by agreement through public solicitation of transferees. The total proportion of shares to be transferred does not exceed 17.5% of the total share capital of Greenfield.
The price of the shares to be transferred shall not be lower than the higher of the following two: The arithmetic average of the daily weighted average price for the first 30 trading days of the indicative announcement date (July 27, 2020); and the audited net asset value per share of the company in the most recent fiscal year.
At present, the new strategic investors in Greenfield are still inconclusive. According to the announcement information, the new strategic investors will need to pay about 14 billion yuan to take down the 17.5% equity transferred by Greenfield in this mixed reform.
It is worth noting that after the completion of this share transfer, it is expected that Greenfield will still have no controlling shareholders and actual controllers, but the control structure may change significantly.
Since its inception, Greenfield Holdings has carried out a number of institutional and institutional reforms: From 1992 to 1997, it operated in accordance with market-oriented rules under the purely state-owned system; from 1997 to 2013, it established and continuously improved the joint-stock system of state-owned holding and employee ownership; from 2013 to 2015, it introduced strategic investors to form a mixed ownership of cross-shareholding and integration of state-owned and non-public capital; and from 2015 to the present, it has been listed as a whole and has become a public company.
The current mixed reform plan of Greenfield is similar to that of Gree. In December 2019, high-level capital led Zhuhai Mingjun to take over the 15% stake of Gree Electric (000651.SZ) for 41.662 billion yuan. Gree Group took a back seat as a minority shareholder. After completing the mixed reform, Gree Electric implemented modern enterprise management methods such as executive incentive plan and unreal control structure.
Shanghai Real Estate and Shanghai City Investment are both state-owned enterprise groups wholly owned by the Shanghai SAC. Zhang Yuliang, Chairman and President of Greenfield Holdings, said that Greenfield's move is an important measure for Shanghai to promote the comprehensive reform of state-owned enterprises and accelerate the reform of state-owned enterprises in the new phase in accordance with the requirements of the Party Central Committee. It fully demonstrates new reform ideas adapted to local conditions and tailored. By introducing new excellent strategic shareholders to listed companies, it supports enterprises to further improve the degree of marketization, enhance the freedom of management and accelerate the all-round release of reform vitality.
Cross-provincial travel resumes the opening of the first special train for cross-provincial train tourism in the country - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, July 25 (Reporter Li Ping) At 12: 20 on July 25, more than 200 Shanghai tourists who took the D771 train successfully arrived in Lanxi City, Zhejiang Province. This is also the first special train for cross-provincial train tourism in the country since the Ministry of Culture and Tourism resumed cross-provincial (district, city) group tours on July 14.
Lanxi City, located in the central and western parts of Zhejiang Province, has beautiful scenery. It is home to many scenic spots such as Zhuge Gossip Village, Underground Changhe and Zhiyan Ancient Village. During the two-day and overnight trip, more than 200 Shanghai tourists will appreciate each of these attractions.
Li Li, deputy general manager of Shanghai Railway International Tourism (Group) Co., Ltd., said that in accordance with the latest policies, the company kept a close eye on the demand for cross-provincial travel, communicated with Lanxi City at the first time, and carefully launched the "Shanghai to Lanxi" and "Summer Appreciation Day Tour" products. The products sold out less than a week after their launch.
Aunt Sun, from Shanghai, said that because of the epidemic, she has not gone out this year.
"I have been at home for a long time. As soon as I see a group tour, I immediately share the news with my friends to sign up together. I have never been to Lanxi before. I am very much looking forward to this trip," Aunt Sun said.
It is understood that in September last year, Lanxi City signed a strategic cooperation agreement with Shanghai Railway International Tourism (Group) Co., Ltd. for the "High Speed Rail Tour Lanxi" project, and plans to run 12 special high-speed rail tourism trains from Zhejiang, Shanghai and Anhui to Lanxi within one year.

White House adviser 'bites back' states to resume work too early - CNN
White House adviser 'bites back' states to resume work too early
On July 23, local time, the number of confirmed cases of New Crown Pneumonia in the United States exceeded 4 million, accounting for 30% of global cases.
Over the past few months, US President Donald Trump has repeatedly asked states across the country to resume work and school. Only recently did he change his attitude and take the initiative to wear masks in public. His advisers have "bitten back" that some state governments have resumed work too early.
On the 22nd, White House presidential adviser Kellyanne Conway said at a press conference that some state governments did not abide by the standards for the resumption of work and restarted bars and other places prematurely.
Conway also mentioned that the previous claim that the president has the "absolute power" to decide on the resumption of work in the states is a misinformed rumor.
"The president is a federalist. He believes that all states have autonomy."
She defended Trump.
However, the "rumor" that Conway called was personally uttered by Trump at the White House outbreak briefing on April 13.
This self-punching operation was ridiculed by netizens as "rewriting history".
Kellyanne Conway wants to rewrite history. She is a liar.
Trump called Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer a dictator because she followed medical guidelines and insisted on a work stoppage.
Trump wants to push for the resumption of work so he can hold a rally.
This isn't the first time Kellyanne Conway has courted controversy.
In an interview with Fox News on April 15, Conway blurted out, "This is COVID-19, and it is not COVID-1, friends!"
She seemed to understand "19" as a version number, which was frantically teased by netizens: Read the newspaper without common sense!
Is it reasonable for a 3-year-old child to be smashed playing in the college playground to sue the university authorities after receiving compensation?
2020-07-26 05: 01: 11 Source: Legal Daily Author: Wang Sisuo Responsible Editor: Wang Sisuo
The playground was smashed, and the child sued the school authorities after receiving compensation.
Zhao Yifan, Correspondent of this newspaper
Three-year-old Xiaowen was playing in a university playground when he was accidentally hit in the head by Chen Mou of the softball team while pitching.
After Chen made compensation, Xiaowen's father, Mr. Wen, as Xiaowen's legal representative, sued the school to the court, demanding that the school where the playground where the incident was located make an apology and pay a total of 20,000 yuan for medical expenses and compensation for moral damage.
Recently, after hearing the case, the Haidian District People's Court of Beijing held that the school had set up a protective net in the playground at the time of the incident, and had fulfilled its appropriate safety and security obligations, and Chen had made compensation. According to the judgment, the plaintiff's claim was rejected.
Mr. Wen claimed that during the summer vacation in 2019, he took Xiaowen to play in the school playground, when the softball team was training in the playground.
In order to avoid the risks caused by this, Xiaowen, Mr. Wen and many other children and parents are active in the safe area designated by the softball team.
However, after that, Chen Mou, a member of the softball team, got rid of the ball while pitching, causing the softball to fly over the net to the above-mentioned safe area and hit Xiaowen in the back of the head.
Mr. Wen immediately took Xiaowen to the hospital for treatment and was diagnosed with head trauma.
Mr. Wen believed that the facilities of the school stadium did not comply with the relevant safety regulations and did not effectively manage the team and related facilities.
The fault of the school led to the occurrence of the above incident, which led to great physical and mental suffering to Xiaowen, as well as great suffering to his family, for which the school should bear legal responsibility.
In this regard, the school argued that the school had set up a protective net in the playground and posted management regulations and training notices, informing it that it was necessary to maintain a safe distance from the training ground and remind it to pay attention to its own safety when entering the playground. The plaintiff could not prove that the school had "failed to fulfill its safety and security obligations", so it did not agree to compensation.
After hearing the case, the court held that the venue of the incident was a venue open to the public free of charge by the university involved. Although the school has a safety and security obligation for the management of the playground, this safety and security obligation only needs to meet the general duty of care.
At the time of the incident, the school set up a protective net in the playground and has fulfilled its appropriate safety and security obligations. Chen also compensated Xiaowen for more than 2,000 yuan for medical expenses, transportation expenses and other losses in accordance with the compensation agreement reached before. The two parties agreed to resolve the dispute in one go.
Afterwards, Xiaowen's parents once again claimed compensation from the school, which was unfounded in the law. The court ruled against all the plaintiff's claims.
After the sentencing, neither party appealed, and the judgment has now entered into force.
According to Article 37 of China's Tort Liability Law, the school, as the manager of a public place, has the obligation of safety and security. In the case of damage caused by the behavior of a third party, the third party shall bear the tort liability, while the manager of a public place who fails to fulfill the obligation of safety and security shall bear the corresponding supplementary liability.
According to the judge, because as the manager of a public place, he is most likely to understand the actual situation of the whole place and foresee the dangers and damage that may occur, so he is most likely to take necessary measures to prevent the occurrence of losses or mitigate the degree of damage, and the cost of avoiding and mitigating the occurrence of damage is the lowest. Therefore, the law stipulates that he shall bear the corresponding safeguard obligations for engaging in social activities.
In this case, for unspecified entrants in the playground open to the public free of charge, the safety and security obligations of the school should be appropriate to the social activities they engage in. Specifically, they should mainly take basic safety measures and have the obligation to inform them of hidden dangers.
In judicial practice, it is not appropriate to impose excessive safety and security obligations on the managers of public places.
If the school has adopted the establishment of a protective net and fulfilled its obligation to inform, it may be concluded that the school is not at fault and should not bear legal responsibility.
In addition, for the infringement of a third party, even if the managers of public places such as schools fail to fulfill their safety and security obligations, their liability is used as a supplement to damages. According to the newly promulgated Civil Code, the managers may also recover compensation from the third party after assuming the supplementary liability.
Therefore, in such accidents, the victim should no longer expand the scope of the claim after he has received compensation from the direct infringer.
Under the normalization of epidemic prevention and control, people are enthusiastic about exercise and fitness.
With the gradual liberalization of cross-provincial tourism business, the tourism market is about to usher in a recovery.
Fujian Province resumed cross-provincial tourism business from July 21. On the first weekend after the opening, Xiamen, a popular tourist destination, ushered in a peak in passenger flow.
As a popular tourist destination city, many tourists arrive in Xiamen on weekends.
Xiamen Railway Station is expected to send 3.7 million passengers in the summer transportation, while the airport passenger flow is dominated by students, tourism and family visits.
The tourism market has gradually picked up. In July, Xiamen Airport operated an average of 440 flights a day, and domestic flights have returned to 80% of the pre-epidemic level.
Airlines have encrypted the air express lines from Xiamen to major cities such as Shanghai, Beijing, Kunming and Xi 'an to seize the recovered tourism market.
At present, a number of travel agencies in Xiamen have successively launched a number of summer domestic cross-provincial travel products, and the team itinerary is mainly dominated by outdoor attractions.
In response to the summer passenger peak at railway stations and airports, relevant units have deployed additional personnel to channel areas where personnel are easy to gather, such as check-in counters and security passageways. Fujian has also optimized and upgraded the "Ba Min Health Code", realizing health data sharing and mutual recognition with 31 provinces, and promoting the orderly recovery of the tourism market.
Can Andy Lau Liu Qingyun "tear down" new sparks - Xinhua
"Bomb Demolition Expert 2" recently announced that it will be released on December 24, becoming the first film to be scheduled for the New Year.
The second film is still directed by Qiu Litao and supervised by and starring Andy Lau. It unfolds with a brand new story.
It is reported that the addition of the "nuclear bomb" element in the second part has also made the challenge faced by the bomb disposal experts more difficult. Several startling shots in the preview have been hanging by a thread. The mushroom cloud of the big explosion and the airport engulfed by fire are quite shocking.
Three years ago, "Bomb Demolition Expert", produced by the original cast, won the May Day box office championship of the year and won seven nominations at the Hong Kong Film Awards. Qiu Litao x Andy Lau also became the gold medal partner in the minds of the audience.
This time, "Bomb Demolition Expert 2" also once again makes people look forward to whether this trump duo can spark a new spark.
"Bomb Demolition Expert 2" tells a brand new story: Pan Zhifeng (Andy Lau), a former bomb disposal expert, fainted at the scene of the bombing and was listed as a suspect by the police.
In order to find the truth, he had to ask Dong Zhuowen (Liu Qingyun), a close friend who was also a bomb disposal expert, for help.
The female superintendent, who was eager to solve the crime, and Pang Ling (Ni Ni), who was also Pan's ex-girlfriend, was also involved.
He is still a bomb disposal expert, but the complexity of Andy Lau's new role can be felt from the preview of the fixed file: He broke a leg and put on a prosthetic limb. He was hunted by Liu Qingyun, who is also a bomb disposal expert, while being directed by his ex-girlfriend Ni Ni.
What is the relationship between the three, what Andy Lau did at the Xiangdao Hotel, what kind of cases he was involved, and what ups and downs his career as a bomb disposal expert has experienced. All kinds of mysteries are curious.
It is understood that the highlight of the film is to take a field view of Hong Kong's world landmarks. Together with the top special effects production team, it brings a shocking and realistic visual impact.

Chongqing, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The Chongqing Development and Reform Commission announced on July 26 that the city has so far returned 4,404 fishermen, accounting for 42.54% of all fishermen involved.
Li Daiguo, 53, told CNN that his grandfathers caught fish in the Longxi River. From the age of 11, he followed his father to fish, rocked a boat and made his way along the Longxi River. He went up to Liangping, Chongqing, and went down to live a long life. He left home for ten days and a half months at a time to support his family by fishing.
However, since 1997, as the rural population has gradually poured into the town, there are more and more residents in the town of Gao'anchang, and the environmental pollution caused has become more and more serious.
Paper mills, chemical plants and farms have been built along the Longxi River, which also pollutes the river.
By 2007 and 2008, the Longxi River had become a stinking ditch.
"All the scales caught are black, and they are also black inside after dissection."
Li Daiguo said that it is becoming more and more difficult to fish after the pollution of the river.
The local area began to make great efforts to control the pollution of the Longxi River, including floating, river patrol and the management and protection of aquatic resources.
Li Daiguo also returned from fishermen to production and became a member of the river patrol team to manage aquatic resources.
From January 1, 2020, the Chongqing Aquatic Biological Reserve and the relevant waters of the main urban area have implemented a total ban on fishing.
According to the data of the Chongqing Development and Reform Commission, up to now, Chongqing has returned a total of 3,403 fishing vessels and 4,643 fishing vessels have signed return agreements, accounting for 63.3% and 86.3% of the total three-year tasks, respectively.
4,404 fishermen have been returned, accounting for 42.54% of all fishermen involved.
Of the 4,404 people who have been returned, 4,267 have been employed, accounting for 96.89% of the fishermen who have been returned.
The pension insurance guarantee covered 2,691 people, accounting for 61.10% of the returning fishermen.
In the next step, Chongqing will carry out in-depth special remediation actions, accelerate the cleaning and remediation of projects for the utilization of the Yangtze River main stream shoreline, complete a new round of survey of sewage outlets into the Yangtze River and carry out corresponding remediation actions, basically complete the task of rectifying the "three phosphorus" (referring to phosphate mines, phosphorus chemicals and phosphogypsum depots) and cleaning and rectifying small hydropower, promote special afforestation actions on both sides of the Yangtze River, strengthen the construction of green mines, consolidate the achievements of the special remediation of illegal wharves and illegal sand mining in the Yangtze River main stream, and further promote the work of banning and returning fishing in the Yangtze River basin.
Israel has strengthened the prevention and control of repeated outbreaks -- ScienceDaily

Israel has strengthened the prevention and control of repeated outbreaks
In the early days of the outbreak of Xincrown Pneumonia, the results of Israel's prevention and control measures were obvious.
However, with the gradual lifting of the ban on prevention and control measures, the number of diagnoses of newly crowned pneumonia in Israel has increased significantly recently. The Israeli government has taken urgent measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic on many occasions.
On February 28, the first case of newly crowned pneumonia was confirmed in Israel, so that it quickly took measures to close all entry and exit ports, suspend non-essential industries, change schools to online teaching, restrict public transport and non-essential social activities, block cities with serious outbreaks, and jointly maintain prevention and control measures by military and police.
This series of measures quickly achieved positive results. By mid-May, the new confirmed cases of newly crowned pneumonia in Israel fell back to single digits in a single day.
With the control of the epidemic, all prevention and control measures in Israel have been fully unsealed. Since June, the number of new diagnoses of Xincrown Pneumonia has gradually rebounded.
In particular, after entering July, the spread of the epidemic has been accelerating.
In recent days, there have been more than 1,500 new cases in Israel per day for eight days. As of the time of writing on July 25, there were 916 new cases on the same day.
As of July 25, there were 59,745 confirmed cases and 448 deaths in Israel.
In the face of the rapid rebound of the epidemic, the Israeli government has repeatedly taken urgent measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic.
On July 6, after the number of confirmed cases exceeded 30,000, the Israeli government closed public entertainment places such as gyms, swimming pools, bars and nightclubs. At the same time, it issued a policy of restricting public transport, stipulating that the maximum number of passengers per bus should not exceed 20.
On the 17th, the Israeli government announced a series of new restrictions, including the implementation of "city closure" on weekends, stipulating that "city closure" will be implemented between 17: 00 every Friday and 5: 00 every Sunday.
During this period, people can go out, but places such as shops, shopping malls, barbershops, beauty salons, libraries, zoos, museums, exhibition halls, swimming pools and tourist attractions will be closed, while basic service places such as supermarkets and pharmacies will remain open.
At the same time, gatherings of more than 10 people will be prohibited on all dates and time periods, gyms, studios and other places will be closed, restaurants and cafes will be prohibited from eating, and only takeaway services will be allowed.
At the same time, the Israeli people did not pay enough attention to the seriousness of the epidemic and failed to form a joint effort with the government in combating the epidemic.
After the recurrence of the epidemic in Israel, many people took to the streets to protest and march because the government's prevention and control measures affected their own economic interests.
On July 11, tens of thousands of people held a demonstration in Tel Aviv, arguing that the anti-epidemic policy affected the economy.
On the evening of the 21st, thousands of protesters gathered in front of the residence of Prime Minister Netanyahu in Jerusalem to protest against the promulgation by Prime Minister Netanyahu of preventive and control measures such as banning restaurants and coffee hall food without giving corresponding compensation.
In addition, many people do not abide by the regulations of wearing masks and maintaining a two-meter safe social distance when outdoor activities. In order to avoid being fined by the police for not wearing masks, many people only wear masks on their chins or hang them on their wrists.
During the repeated epidemic, the school was a serious disaster area for the spread of the new crown virus. According to a reporter's recent visit to the kindergarten, neither teachers nor students of the kindergarten wore masks as required by the government, nor did they maintain a two-meter safe social distance from each other, laying hidden dangers for a large number of teachers and students to be infected with the virus.
Professor Elie Waxman, a member of the expert advisory group of the National Security Council of Israel to combat the epidemic, believes that Israel is moving towards a "dangerous situation", pointing out that the current epidemic prevention and control measures taken by Israel are not enough. All leisure and recreational places and summer schools should be closed to control the further spread of the epidemic.
Waxman said that Israel lacks an overall plan to combat the epidemic, and the parliament and all government departments should abandon their respective interests as soon as possible, reach an agreement on the issue of combating the epidemic, and formulate clear steps including relevant restrictions in different departments.
Tel Aviv, July 25 (UPI) -- Wang Jiong, reporter of this newspaper in Tel Aviv,
Wu Fengfang, a farmer in Guyuan, Ningxia, could not help his old companion Dai Tianfu. The two men arrived at Liangyun Cultural Compound from their home 20 miles away in a car.
Despite the inconvenience of his legs and feet in the past two years, Dai Tianfu, 77, still expects to "come here every other day and become addicted to drama".
This is an unremarkable yard in Yuanzhou District of Guyuan City. Unlike the general farmyard, the melodious Qin cavity often comes out of the yard, as well as brilliant shadow puppetry, embroidery works, traditional Qin cavity, eyebrow Hu opera, etc.
The owner of the compound, named Liang Yun, was a former carpenter.
More than 10 years ago, he, who loved shadow and singing, began to plan to build a cultural compound.
With the Liangyun Cultural Compound, the villagers' cultural life has become rich and colorful.
The reporter has not yet entered the Liangyun Cultural Compound, and the tunes of the Qin cavity have been passed on.
It is Pak Lixiang, a villager in a neighboring village, who is singing a selection of Qin passages for the villagers.
She has loved the Qin cavity since she was a child, and now she has a small reputation in the local area. As long as she has free time, she will come to the cultural compound to perform programs for the villagers.
Recently, Berry also played live webcasting.
Berry said, "It is a very happy thing to have a stage for more people to see themselves perform."
On the stage, the singer is one-size-fits-all and the player plays one tune. Although he is an amateur, his enthusiasm is undiminished.
Just like the pristine style of the farmyard, outside the Qin cavity, the "grassroots" art and non-sequitur culture in the Liangyun Cultural Courtyard have come to the fore.
The compound also has a collection of more than 300 pieces of farming utensils of different ages, traditional and handmade tile sculptures, paper-cutting, embroidery, shadow and other objects.
Liang Yun led the reporter into the exhibition hall in the courtyard, which showed his collection of old objects, old wine jugs, three strings, spinning trucks, etc.
Why did an ordinary farmer build a cultural compound?
"Shadow puppetry is my family craft. I have been learning this craft since I was 15 years old."
Founded in 2012, Liangyun Cultural Compound has become the first rural "intangible cultural heritage exhibition hall" in Ningxia and a demonstration compound for the protection of intangible cultural heritage in Guyuan City.
In addition to the Liangyun Cultural Compound, more than 120 cultural compounds and 79 folk performance groups have sprung up in Yuanzhou District of Guyuan City. Among them, there are more than 50 cultural compounds of a certain size, such as the Shenjiahe Cultural Compound, the Wang Yonghong Cultural Compound and the Yang Lang Cultural Compound, covering all townships and streets in Yuanzhou District, with more than 5,000 participants.
These grassroots artists are active in the fields, enriching the cultural life of the masses and meeting their spiritual needs.
"As life gets better and better, traditional culture cannot be left behind in this way."
"Liu's Impossible War Drama" returns to "The Wins" to see Liu Yunlong Li Liqun's opponent "play" - Xinhua
The 40-episode Impossible War drama "The Wins" will land on Beijing Television from July 16.
"The Wins" is based on real historical facts and is based on the dusty Soviet military archives that have been introduced for the first time for many years.
Liu Yunlong, an actor known to the audience for his "espionage drama", broke through his image in the play and challenged a happy "stuttering agent".
In recent years, the popularity of plays such as "Pretender", "Mask" and "Kite" has proved that espionage genre dramas have vigorous vitality.
Unlike previous espionage works, "The Wins" looks around the world and extends the background of the story to the battlefield in the Far East of the Soviet Union.
Set in the final stage of the War of Resistance Against Japan in 1944, it tells the story of Tang Fei (Liu Yunlong), a secret intelligence worker of the Communist Party of China, who, under the leadership of the Secretary of the Linhe Provincial Committee of the Chinese Underground Party and the Director of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Bureau, carried out the "Mudanullah" strategic operation of the Far East Intelligence Bureau of the Soviet Army.
In many espionage dramas, the actor, as a senior spy, appears as a perfect image of handsome, highly intelligent and mature.
But in Liu Yunlong's view, such a person is not suitable to be a spy. "Spies should be the kind of person who cannot be found at all in the pile of people. If they appear, they are the kind of very handsome image. I wish everyone should pay attention to you, can they still lurk? There is a line in" Kite ",' If you do not come to catch me, I forget that I am a Kuomintang ', and spies should be de-elitized."
So in "The Wins", Liu Yunlong ingeniously designed his protagonist, Tang Fei, as a "stuttering agent" with a sense of joy.
The other camp in "The Wins" is supported by the joint efforts of Fukuhara, a Japanese played by Liang Guanhua, and Fang Shibao, the director of the police department played by Li Liqun.
Two powerful opera bones, one south and one north, have added a lot of master's tricks to the whole play.
Director Yin Fei used the word "racing" to describe the opposite play between Li Liqun and Liu Yunlong in the play. "It is definitely a racing play. The two of them have a particularly tacit understanding. This tacit understanding in them is very impactful to me. Many times their plays are 'hanging now'. For example, we only write half a page in length. I can continue to play them without calling a stop when filming."
The masters do not rob the play, and the director does not stir up the play. When the actors are in the role and ensure the state of their characters, they can not only shape the character from the point of view of the characters, but also bring more viewing possibilities to the audience. Yin Fei said that such a play is brilliant enough.
In the play, you can also see many familiar faces in the "Liushi Impossible War Drama". The famous and majestic "Mountain City F4" in "Kite" also gathered three people in "The Wins".
Hou Yu and Liu Mingyang, who played Song Xiaoan and Zhao Jianzhi, once again played Tang Fei's right-hand man.
Director Yin Fei introduced, "There is no inferiority in these two people. They just went with the flow in that era and that environment."
Liu Yunlong also offered, "We should have a human feeling. This human feeling means that the people around me must have good and bad, and the bad people are the enemy, but we should also develop them and our team should also grow."
The ending of these two men in the play was also carefully designed by Liu Yunlong, who believed that he would hand in a satisfactory answer to the audience.

Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury of the Hong Kong SAR Government, Xu Zhengyu, said that Hong Kong's financial market remains active and operating in an orderly manner.
He expressed optimism about Hong Kong's financial stability and economy.
Xu Zhengyu said at a webinar jointly organized by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Toronto and the Hong Kong-Canada Chamber of Commerce (Canadian Federation) on the 24th (Toronto time) that Hong Kong is experiencing difficult conditions due to the "amendment storm" and the new crown pneumonia epidemic.
The exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar is stable and biased towards the exchange guarantee level of the strong side.
There is no obvious sign of capital outflow in the banking system. On the contrary, more than US$11 billion has flowed in since June.
The total amount of deposits of banks has also continued to increase in the past few months. The stock market has had a series of public offering and capital raising activities, and market transactions have repeatedly risen.
Xu Zhengyu said that the Xincrown Pneumonia epidemic has put pressure on the global economy and financial markets, but Hong Kong's basic advantages remain unchanged.
Hong Kong has a number of advantages, including geography, the rule of law, high-speed communication, the free flow of information and capital, as well as a simple and low tax system, which make Hong Kong continue to become a leading international financial center.
Xu Zhengyu pointed out that the SAR Government has set aside HK$6 billion in the "Epidemic Prevention and Anti-epidemic Fund" to create about 30,000 time-limited jobs in the public and private sectors in the next two years, covering people with different skills and academic qualifications.
In order to support the development of financial technology, the SAR Government has also launched the "Thousand People Scheme" to subsidize local financial technology companies, start-ups and other enterprises with financial technology-related business, with a view to creating 1,000 new jobs, hiring local talent and enriching Hong Kong's financial technology talent pool.
Looking ahead, Xu Zhengyu expressed optimism about Hong Kong's financial stability and economy.
He encouraged Canadian enterprises to make good use of Hong Kong's advantages and its position as an international financial center, an international asset and wealth management center and a global offshore renminbi business hub to develop and invest in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and nearby areas.
The Lancet article praised China's anti-epidemic efforts to encourage all countries to learn from their experiences -- ScienceDaily
According to an article published in The Lancet magazine on the 25th, China, as a country with a population of 1.4 billion and similar in size to Europe or the United States, has effectively controlled the new crown epidemic at this stage, without widespread transmission, and has largely controlled the domestic epidemic.
The article said that in the past decade or so, China has made a lot of investment in domestic research and public health construction, which makes China's preparation for the new crown much more adequate than that of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) that year.
The authors said that when SARS broke out in 2002, China was ill-prepared at first, especially the pathogen could not be determined.
When the new crown virus was discovered in December 2019, Chinese scientists were soon able to identify the virus species and shared genome sequencing data with the international community on January 11, 2020.
By the end of January, doctors from mainland China and Hong Kong had clarified the clinical characteristics of the virus and warned the world of the threat of the new crown virus through research papers published in The Lancet.
China has also been at the forefront of vaccine research. Under the declaration of a state of emergency, through close cooperation at home, such research has been carried out very quickly and rigorously. In May and July, the results of the progress made in the early trial of the new crown vaccine developed by China were published in The Lancet, respectively.
China's experience shows that it is very important to invest in the national health and research system and effectively improve laboratory capacity.
This is the basis for the country to respond quickly and effectively to health emergencies and global health security.
For other countries, especially low-income and middle-income countries, it is well worth learning from and learning from.
In addition, China's experience has proved that on the basis of strong research, it is necessary to have a strong senior level to make correct decisions decisively on the basis of scientific basis, so that the new crown epidemic can be effectively controlled.
The article stressed that the government and its leaders must respect science, understand the value of science and take action against it in a way that is most beneficial to society.
In the early days of the outbreak, the National Health and Construction Commission of China sent three groups of infectious disease experts to Wuhan to investigate the risk and spread of the new crown virus. Their suggestions provided a basis for the decision to "seal the city" in Wuhan on January 23. When experts raised the necessity and urgency of building a square cabin hospital, the government quickly made a decision and implemented it quickly. At the same time, the broad participation of the community and the masses also enabled the epidemic to be controlled quickly and effectively.
At the end of the article, it is stressed that in response to global health emergencies, all countries need to strengthen global cooperation and jointly respond to them.

A two-year-old child in the room suffered only minor injuries and was safely rescued.
The rest of the occupants of the house were not injured in the accident, but their mood has not calmed down.
Footage of the scene reported by the German news agency showed smoke billowing from the house involved in the accident at one point. After firefighters extinguished the fire, they could see that the house was badly damaged.
At present, the cause of the crash is not yet clear.
The Rhine Post reported, citing police accounts, that there are clues that the plane may have disintegrated before crashing into residential buildings.

Foreign workers account for the vast majority of the new crown infected people in Singapore.
According to statistics, 200,000 foreign workers live in 43 special dormitories for foreign workers in Singapore, while about 100,000 foreign workers live in other types of dormitories.
The Singapore Anti-epidemic Interdepartmental Working Group recently said that the Singapore government is stepping up testing of the last few special dormitories for foreign workers with high new crown infection rates.
After completing the testing of all special dormitories, the vast majority of foreign workers will be able to resume work, but they will still have to carry out regular new crown testing.
Director Dapeng's "Good Luck" was shortlisted for the Golden Jue Award - Xinhua
On July 18, the 23rd Shanghai International Film Festival announced the official list of films selected for the Golden Jue Award.
The first realistic film directed by Dapeng, "Good Luck", was successfully shortlisted for the Golden Jue Award at this festival, while the film officially released its first poster.
Poster square picture
The film "Good Luck" is the first realistic work directed by Dapeng and his second tie with the Golden Jue Award.
The film tells the story of a comedy director who returned to his hometown in rural Northeast China on a whim, hoping to make a literary and artistic film on how his family celebrated the Chinese New Year, only to encounter a series of accidents.
The family members who gathered for making the film completed the final party.
In the film poster released today, Wang Jixiang, a member of the family, the "third uncle", sits in the center of the picture smoking a cigarette. The background is the black land of Northeast China dressed in silver. The foreground is the red lantern that the Chinese must hang during the holidays.
The red lantern, which symbolizes festivity and reunion, is in great contrast to Wang Jixiang, who is lonely, and seems to reveal the complexity and entanglements in the relationship between the extended family.
It is reported that in the film, except for the daughter of "Third Uncle" Wang Jixiang, who is played by actor Liu Lu, the rest of the play is completed by the real director's family. The experimental audio-visual style of the film breaks the boundary between drama and truth and brings the audience a new immersive viewing experience.
According to director Dapeng, the creation of "Good Luck" originated from "a providence". A series of sudden changes in the family during the filming period forced the original filming plan to be changed accordingly. Life without a script was eventually recorded as a film, but it released tension beyond the design.
How on earth does director Dapeng face this "providence" and how should he continue to meet the changes brought about by this providence?
There is no doubt that "Good Luck" is full of experiments. The almost all-vegetarian lineup and innovative audio-visual style turn life in front of the camera into a film. Under the package of real images, the audience will also find the shadow of themselves and their families from the family presented in the film. With the end of this family gathering in the film, it evokes a series of thoughts.
NeWS. GOV.MO: Enquiry Hotline Statistics of the New Coronavirus Infection Response Coordination Center (08H00 on July 25 - 08H00 on July 26)

At the Balao Zhuokang sentry post, platoon commander Yu Wang and a soldier stood guard on duty.
In this place, where the average annual temperature is more than a dozen degrees below zero, a row of simple barracks stand at the mountain pass. A national flag flutters in the wind not far from the barracks. The soldiers stand guard in the wind every day. At the same time, they need to regularly patrol higher elevations.
The soldiers climbed the steep slope of the rocky pile and needed to use their hands and feet.
It was late July, when flowers and plants were lush in low-altitude areas, while in Balao Zhuokang, only the gully behind the barracks had relatively dense green.
Gao Peng, a soldier who has been stationed at the post for six years, pointed to the gully and said that this is their back garden. Only in July and August each year can the grass be seen growing slowly. Soon after, it all turns yellow and is covered with snow.
The foot patrol may take about nine hours.
Under the harsh plateau environment, the soldiers stationed here are accompanied by snow-capped mountains and glaciers all year round. They also regularly patrol mountain passes at higher elevations.
A few days ago, a patrol composed of eight soldiers, led by instructor Liang Yixin, once again embarked on the patrol road.
Each soldier carried a weight of about 30 jin and headed for the target point early in the morning.
On the way, a soldier turned against him, and his comrades made emergency rescue.
In addition to the patrol mission, the soldiers at the Balao Zhuokang sentry post conduct tactical and physical training every day.
Time passes by, the altitude is rising, the oxygen content is getting lower and lower, and the physical strength is constantly overdrawn. These factors test the will of the patrol members.
They clenched their teeth and insisted, crossing several landslides and crossing several urgent and dangerous beaches one after another.
At about 1600 hours, it was lunchtime for the patrol members. They took out their own dry food and sat on the spot at an altitude of more than 5,700 meters. With sleet and snow, they replenished their strength with food.
The soldiers at the Balao Zhuokang sentry post conducted tactical and physical training.
During the break, they will play cards together, and the loser will do push-ups, which can both entertain and exercise physical fitness.
After a short rest in the cold wind, they climbed to the position of the target point of the patrol, took out the national flag on the mountain pass and made a solemn oath.
Behind them are snow-capped mountains, and in front of them are dozens of kilometers of no man's land. They are the safest guardians of the country.
Beijing's consumption season restarts - Xinhuanet
Beijing has restarted all activities of the Beijing consumption season in accordance with the principle of "comprehensive reboot, key planning, orderly promotion and strict organization".
On July 26, 1.5 million government and enterprise consumer vouchers were issued, including 1 million offline catering vouchers and 500,000 smart product vouchers. Consumers can collect them at the Jingdong APP.
Liu Mei Ying, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Commerce, said at a media briefing held on the 25th that the restarted consumption season will further reduce the allocation of capital by enterprises on the basis of maintaining the existing preferential subsidies for consumer coupons and card packages.
Starting from the first half of August, the current 1: 1 allocation of government and enterprise contributions will be adjusted to 2: 1. For example, if the original consumer receives a card bag to spend in the store, he or she will enjoy a discount of 120 yuan, of which 60 yuan will be subsidized by the government and 60 yuan will be granted by enterprises. After the adjustment, the government will subsidize 80 yuan and 40 yuan will be granted by enterprises.
During the consumption season, the three major operators will subsidize traffic and terminals around 5G consumption, further promoting Beijing's new 5G infrastructure and new 5G consumption.
Chen Maobo pointed out that Hong Kong's economy was hit by another outbreak of the epidemic and urged all sectors of the community to share the difficulties -- ScienceDaily
China News Agency, Hong Kong, July 26 (UPI) -- The Financial Secretary of the Hong Kong SAR Government, Chen Maobo, said on July 26 that Hong Kong is facing the impact of the new wave of the new crown pneumonia epidemic. Business exchanges and economic activities, which had seen slight signs of recovery, have also been hit.
The SAR Government once again called on major small owners to reduce their rents and share the difficulties with retailers, restaurants and small and medium-sized enterprises.
Chen Maobo published an article entitled "The rugged road to recovery" online on the same day.
He said that the recent number of confirmed cases of Xincrown Pneumonia in Hong Kong is high, and the situation is serious, affecting the people's livelihood and plaguing the economy.
When the epidemic is repeated, the first priority is to strictly prevent imported cases and deal with and interrupt the virus transmission chain as quickly as possible. When the epidemic is controlled, economic activities should be resumed accordingly in due course.
He pointed out that in the face of the impact of the new wave of epidemic, business exchanges and economic activities, which had seen slight signs of recovery, have also been hit.
For the business community, in addition to the spirit of the contract, social responsibility is equally important, especially those groups that have received large government subsidies in the "Employment Protection Scheme".
He mentioned that Hong Kong's economic situation was still very severe in the second quarter of this year, but the contraction seemed to slow down slightly.
On the export side, he believes that the peripheral situation in Hong Kong is still serious.
Chen Maobo said that the development of Hong Kong over the past few decades shows that each crisis hides new opportunities, and each difficulty hides the key to future development.

In the coming week, it is still not ruled out that there will be aftershocks of magnitude 4 or above.
Marinichev said that the change in value is affected by the devaluation of the ruble and the epidemic.
"The cost of services is increasing," he said.
Because of the epidemic, people began to spend more time on the Internet, "he said.

"The Chinese Doctor" prepares to pay tribute to anti-epidemic heroes - Xinhua
Recently, with the respect of Chinese filmmakers in the fight against the epidemic, Yu Dong, Chairman of Boehner Pictures Group, and Liu Weiqiang, Director (pictured left) held a talk and exchange with Academician Zhong Nanshan on the filming and production of the anti-epidemic film "The Chinese Doctor" in Guangzhou.
Boehner Pictures hopes to use "The Chinese Doctor" to pay tribute to all the medical and epidemic prevention workers who are fighting on the front line of epidemic prevention and control!
In 2021, the film will be released nationwide as a tribute film to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China.
At present, under the arrangement and deployment of the Ministry of Propaganda and the National Film Bureau, and with the support of the Guangdong Provincial Film Bureau and the Hubei Provincial Film Bureau, Boehner Pictures is organizing the original cast of the film "Captain China" to prepare the film "The Chinese Doctor", which is a film that reflects the unity of the people of the whole country in fighting the Xincrown Pneumonia epidemic under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee.
Focusing on the Wuhan anti-epidemic line, the film will take Wuhan medical staff and the medical teams of various provinces and cities to help Hubei as the background. From the point of view of human nature, it will use a unique narrative, as well as highly impactful camera language, to show the moving story of the Chinese medical staff full of dedication and sacrifice on the anti-epidemic line in a panoramic view.
It is understood that at the first time on the day of the unsealing of Wuhan, Boehner overcame many difficulties and sent a filming team to go deep into the front line of the epidemic to exchange and understand and collect information with hundreds of medical workers face to face. At present, it has interviewed the white angels at the forefront of the anti-epidemic front, including Academician Zhong Nanshan himself, the first person in Guangzhou to help Wuhan, the Guangdong medical team to help Hubei, as well as Wuhan Jintan Hospital, Wuhan Union Hospital, Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital and Wuhan Central Hospital, and captured a large number of valuable first-hand video materials.
Academician Zhong Nanshan also raised expectations and hopes for the filming of the film at the symposium: "I am looking forward to it. I hope you will not only visit some experts who have made more public appearances, but also interview more medical personnel who have worked hard on the front line. They are the majority."
He said that he had seen "Me and My Motherland" and "Captain China" before and thought that the method of telling the story of the big pattern from the perspective of ordinary people was very good.
"At present, some foreign friends still have some misunderstandings about China."
When talking about the spread of the film, Academician Zhong Nanshan said that at present, some people abroad like to label the virus as politicized. He hoped that the film would impress the audience from the point of view of human nature: "In addition to being shown in China, it is best for this film to be shown abroad as well. It is necessary to impress the audience with a true humanistic spirit in a way that audiences at home and abroad can understand."
Academician Zhong Nanshan also fondly recalled the 1980s film "Middle-aged". "After all these years, it was" Middle-aged "that I was most impressed by the film after the reform and opening up. At that time, my doctors and friends abroad cried. If" Chinese Doctor "could play such a role, it would be remarkable."
Academician Zhong Nanshan said that if "The Chinese Doctor" can resonate with foreign audiences, it will be very successful.
During the discussion and exchange, Academician Zhong Nanshan also shared his opinions and suggestions on the prevention and control of the current international epidemic. "I believe that people will always be smarter than viruses."
Academician Zhong Nanshan said that although the virus is difficult to predict, human beings have overcome many difficulties and risks since primitive society. Today, modern society has developed medical science, technology and social management measures. Together with the fact that medical personnel and even the common people all over the world have a basic understanding of the scientific response to the Xincrown Pneumonia epidemic, people will no longer be as passive as before. "Next, we should pay attention to two aspects of work, one is to study how to strengthen cooperation in the world and the other is to pay attention to soothing people's hearts."

Hunan Daily New Hunan client reporter Jiang Rui Correspondent Xiao Yan
Jiaxing Red Boat Mold, Shaoshan Mao Zedong Bronze Statue, Yan 'an Budui Flower Crafts, Xiangxi Yongshun Bacon... On July 25, the 2020 Hunan Red Tourism and Culture Festival opened in Shaoshan.
As one of the main activities, the first Red Cultural Industry Expo in Xiangtan was launched at the Shaoshan Regional Tourism Advisory and Distribution Center.
The exhibition area is full of red creative products and local products in the old revolutionary areas, attracting tourists from all over the world to buy them.
"This Red Fair is not only a display of the achievements of the national red cultural industry, but also an important platform for exhibitors and enterprises to exchange experiences and explore development paths."
According to the relevant person in charge of the Executive Committee of the First Red Fair in Xiangtan, the Red Fair, with the theme of "Promoting red culture to promote the warming of cultural tourism", has a total exhibition area of nearly 3,000 square meters. An atmosphere creation area, a scenic exhibition area and an online shopping experience area for red cultural travel online games have been set up.
Eight provincial cities, including Jiaxing in Zhejiang Province, Zunyi in Guizhou and Yan 'an in Shaanxi Province, as well as 137 enterprises and units in Changsha, Zhuzhou, Yueyang and Chenzhou in our province, were invited to participate in the exhibition. A total of 768 exhibits were on display, including red cultural relics, handicrafts, food specialties, tourism routes, red training courses and red creative products.
The exhibition and sales area will be displayed until July 29.
As the host of the Red Fair, the Xiangtan Exhibition Area is full of bright spots.
The person in charge of the exhibition area introduced that the Xiangtan exhibition area is divided into two parts: Red industry and the development of red cultural industry.

The cumulative number of confirmed cases in Xinguan, Japan, exceeds 30,000 - Xinhua
According to statistics, there were 239 new confirmed cases in Tokyo on the 26th, with more than 200 new cases in a single day for six consecutive days, with a cumulative total of 11,214.
In addition, there were 141 new confirmed cases in Osaka prefecture, 90 new cases in Fukuoka prefecture and 80 new cases in Aichi prefecture.
In the first half of the year, telecom network fraud crimes rose by 70%. The summary characteristics of the highest inspection -- ScienceDaily
On July 26, according to the website of the Supreme Inspection, in the first half of this year, procuratorial organs across the country prosecuted a total of 5,8101 people for fraud crimes, an increase of 35% year-on-year.
In particular, among the crimes against the prevention and control of the epidemic, fraud crimes are frequent, and the number of fraud crimes prosecuted by procuratorial organs accounts for 43.4% of the total number of crimes against the prevention and control of the epidemic.
The Supreme People's Procuratorate has carried out targeted guidance. Of the ten batches of typical cases involving epidemic prevention and control that have been issued at present, a total of 9 have involved the crime of fraud.
From the handling of cases by the procuratorial organs in the first half of the year, there are a wide variety of fraud crimes involved, ranging from the national macro policy to the food, clothing and housing of the common people, including epidemic fraud, "medical care" fraud, "health products" fraud, "enrollment intermediary" fraud, "routine loan" fraud, fraudulent state subsidy fraud, national asset thawing fraud, and so on. They continue to "innovate", covering education, medical care, employment, old age, social security, land requisition and demolition, precise poverty alleviation, financial credit and other areas, which not only cause economic losses to the victims, but also seriously affect economic and social development.
In particular, some telecom network frauds break through the restrictions of national borders, regions and personnel, and have the characteristics of stakeholders, cross-border, remote and electronic payment. There are many unspecified victims, which is very harmful.
For example, some set up special companies, rent high-end office buildings, set up multiple departments or posts, use legitimate online platforms to publicize and recruit, train and evaluate recruiters, adopt enterprise operation model management, wear a "legal cloak" and are more beguiling.
It is incumbent upon the procuratorial organs to punish and prevent crimes in accordance with the law and issue early warnings to the public and relevant departments in a timely manner.
In judicial cases, the procuratorial organs conscientiously perform their duties, not only insisting on maintaining a high-pressure situation against fraud crimes, but also refining various law enforcement measures in a targeted manner, and promoting social governance through the production and issuance of procuratorial recommendations.
The procuratorial organs strictly control the facts, evidence, procedures and application of the law in the arrest and prosecution of fraud cases, taking the facts as the basis and taking the law as the criterion, so as to ensure that they are not wrong.
In particular, for the crime of telecom network fraud, we should pay attention to the central role of electronic data in the determination of facts, and strive to build a chain of mutually corroborating evidence between electronic data, verbal evidence and documentary evidence.
For example, in an epidemic fraud case handled by the Yinzhou District Procuratorate of Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province, the procuratorial organ intervened in advance at the first time. It took only five days from the occurrence of the case to the conclusion of the case, reflecting the attitude and determination to handle the case quickly and strictly and maintain the stability of the overall social situation.
In the process of examining arrest and examining prosecution, we should pay attention to the prosecution of missed offenders in cases, correct the missed arrest of 733 people by the public security organs, and correct the omission of the examination and prosecution of 1,113 accomplices by the public security organs.
In the first half of the year, procuratorial organs throughout the country issued 298 procuratorial recommendations against fraud crimes, promoting joint efforts to prevent fraud crimes and promoting deep governance.
For example, in response to the loopholes in the supervision of telecommunications networks by communication enterprises, banks and intermediary organizations found in the handling of cases, the Guangzhou Municipal Procuratorate of Guangdong Province and the Dongguan Municipal Procuratorate promptly put forward procuratorial recommendations, urging the relevant units to strengthen supervision and improve the mechanism, so as to promote the construction of a long-term system.
Fourth, we should make every effort to do a good job in the recovery and recovery of stolen goods and losses.
Local procuratorial organs have grasped the important links such as intervening in the investigation and guiding the collection of evidence, examining and prosecuting, urged the investigating organs to actively recover the stolen money, cooperate with the relevant departments to do a good job in pursuing the stolen goods and recovering the damage, and strive to minimize the economic losses caused by the crime of fraud to the people.
For example, the Lin Mou routine loan case handled by the Beijing Municipal Procuratorate involved 22 properties waiting to be seized. In the case that the property may be disposed of first by other cases, the first "Suspension Letter" was issued and served on the relevant court in a timely manner. It was recommended that the previous seizure court suspend the execution of the property involved and deal with it uniformly after the facts of the crime were ascertained, so as to make its best efforts to recover the property involved and recover the losses of the victims.
The prosecutor reminded everyone to be very vigilant against fraud crimes, not to expect "pie in the sky", nor to be credulous if they think it is cheap, and keep their "pocketbook" well.
Astana Town, Weining County, Guizhou Province: Short apple trees widen the road to poverty eradication -- ScienceDaily

In the heat and heat, a reporter from the Economic Daily - China Economic Network walked into Zhonghai Village, Astana Town, Weining County, Guizhou Province.
Against the scorching sun, villager Li Yuanzhong weeded in the base. Although his face was red, he hummed a few ditties in his mouth from time to time.
In Weining County, where Astana Town is located, because of its low latitude, high altitude, abundant light and large temperature difference between day and night, the apples produced have high sugar content and good taste. They have a certain reputation in the surrounding area. However, they have not been able to sell a good price and form an industrial scale because of their small size and many spots.
Astana Town was once a poor township with "Baogu potato for spring and autumn". Ten years ago, the incidence of poverty in the area was as high as 25.8%.
In the critical period when the fight against poverty enters the decisive battle, it is urgent to change traditional planting habits, adjust the industrial structure and increase farmers' income.
After many visits, Chen Chao, party secretary of Astana Town, and a group of people in the town believed that industrial development could no longer follow the old path.
To this end, the town of Astana has introduced leading enterprises and grown apples in a modern way.
Hou Jianwen, deputy general manager of Weining Beyond Agriculture Co., Ltd. came to Astana Town from Shaanxi in 2015 to investigate. He saw the local planting conditions at a glance and has been planting apple trees in the local area since 2016.
At first, the village mobilized Li Yuanzhong to transfer the land to plant apple trees. Li Yuanzhong and his wife muttered to themselves, "After planting apples for so many years, they did not see who grew apples in the village to make a fortune."
"All apples grown are dwarfed apples and will not make the apple tree grow too high."
To Li Yuanzhong's surprise, a new method was used for apple cultivation this time. Irrigation pipes were spread under each apple tree, and water and fertilizer were poured together to the roots of the tree. When the fruit was harvested in autumn, the tractor drove directly into the orchard and could pick the fruit standing.
At present, the Apple base has gradually entered a period of high production, and the market is as expected by Hou Jianwen. Apple is not worried about selling and is popular with consumers in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and other cities.
The growing apple industry has brought about new changes in Li Yuanzhong's life. Although he is still farming, he has a new source of income.
Li Yuanzhong's family has more than 9 acres of land transferred to the Apple base. In addition to the guaranteed land transfer fee, there are profit dividends after hanging up the fruit each year. The couple usually work in the base. "One person gets 80 yuan a day and has work all year round".
Li Yuanzhong told reporters that last year, he received more than 2,800 yuan in profit dividends. Together with the land transfer fee and the working income of the couple, the family earned more than 80,000 yuan. "There is no worry about food and clothing, and a well-off life has been lived".
"At present, it has begun to bear fruit. The annual output value of one acre of apples exceeds 15,000 yuan, about 10 times that of growing corn."
Chen Chao told reporters that at present, 20,000 mu of apples have been planted in the whole town of Astana, with 6,000 mu in Zhonghai Village alone, covering 4,056 households and 172,000 farmers, including 656 poor households and 2,952 people who have built file cards, with wages of more than 6 million yuan a year. This has truly realized that the base is built on the doorstep and does not have to go out to work.
Li Yuanzhong, whose pockets are bulging day by day, also began to realize his "wish".
This Lunar New Year, Li Yuanzhong bought an SUV and now drives his car to and from work every day. "There are still more than a dozen acres of land in his family. When the next step is to expand the scale of the Apple base and transfer it all to them, his income will be more."

Membrane separation technology helps crack the "greenhouse effect" -- ScienceDaily
Membrane separation technology helps crack the "greenhouse effect"
A schematic diagram of the preparation technology of new mixed matrix membranes
Shang Rui, a reporter for this newspaper, reported that a few days ago, the atmospheric environment and bioenergy team of Tianjin University made significant progress in the "membrane separation method to capture carbon dioxide", and successfully developed a new mixed matrix film preparation technology, greatly improving the carbon dioxide capture performance of membrane materials.
The relevant results have been published as the cover article of the international journal Greenhouse Gas: Science and Technology.
The "greenhouse effect" is a major environmental problem that perplexes human development, while carbon dioxide emissions are the culprit of the "greenhouse effect".
How to efficiently capture and utilize the carbon dioxide emitted by humans is the focus of scientists.
The "membrane separation method" is an emerging carbon dioxide capture technology. It separates carbon dioxide gas with the help of membrane materials, which has the characteristics of high efficiency, energy conservation and simple operation.
How to make membrane materials "breathe deeply" and improve the efficiency of gas separation is the bottleneck difficulty of using membrane separation method to capture and collect carbon dioxide.
The research team of Tianjin University innovated its ideas and explored the influence of different solvents on the separation performance of membrane gas through repeated experiments.
The experimental results show that using N-methylpyrolactone as the preparation solvent, the distribution of carbon nanotubes in the produced membrane materials is more uniform and "more breathable", effectively improving the gas separation efficiency and rate of the membrane materials.
The carbon dioxide separation performance of mixed matrix membranes prepared with this new technology is close to the current theoretical separation upper limit of such membrane materials.
"The new technology provides a new idea for the membrane separation method to capture and collect carbon dioxide."
Li Run, a member of the atmospheric environment and bioenergy team of Tianjin University, said: "We hope that this technology can provide strong support for the treatment of flue gas by coal-fired power plants and chemical enterprises in the future, and play a major role in controlling greenhouse gas emissions and other areas."
Understand what professional grade difference is before volunteering to fill in - CNN

Understand what professional grade difference is before volunteering to fill in
Every year, when they volunteer for the college entrance examination, some students or parents do not understand the nouns involved in the voluntary filing, which in turn affects the voluntary filing.
This year, five universities, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing University of Science and Technology, Beijing University of posts and Telecommunications, Beijing Forestry University and Beijing University of Chemical Technology, jointly issued enrollment policies for 2020, eliminating professional grade differences.
What does professional grade difference mean and what is the significance in voluntary filing?
There are three rules for the allocation of specialties.
Experts reminded that before filling in the volunteer, it is important to read the Admissions Charter of the desired school in detail and understand the admission rules of colleges and universities, including the proportion of transfers and the rules for the allocation of specialties.
The rules for the allocation of specialties mean that after the transfer of colleges and universities, there are three main ways for professional admission: Professional priority, grade priority and professional grade difference.
The specific method used by colleges and universities will be made clear in the Admissions Charter.
However, the admission principle of some colleges and universities is that the total score is preferred, and there is no grade difference between majors.
That is to say, candidates within the scope of admission will be queued according to the total score. When the score does not reach the voluntary admission score line for the first major, it depends on whether they have reached the voluntary admission score line for the second major, and so on until they are admitted to the last professional volunteer. There is no grade difference between the volunteers for each major.
The so-called "professional grade difference" means that when arranging candidates' majors, institutions determine the admission majors of volunteer candidates in different specialties according to one or more score values published in the admission charter. This score value is the "professional grade difference".
That is, the difference between the scores of institutions when admitting candidates who volunteer for the first major and those who do not volunteer for the first major, and the grade difference between volunteers for each major, such as 3 points, 2 points, 1 point, etc.
For example.
Assuming that Xiaoming, a student, applied for the A university and scored 560 points in the examination, his professional volunteers are: Computer, international trade, automation, mechanical engineering and e-commerce. The professional admission of A colleges and universities is based on the method of professional grade difference, which is divided into 2, 1, 1 and 0.
If Xiaoming meets the requirements of the first major, Xiaoming will be admitted to the "computer" major when the major meets the balance of the first major admission plan. If the computer is not accepted, his score will be subtracted by two points, and the score will be ranked with that of the candidates who volunteered for the "international trade" examination in the first major to determine whether he meets the professional admission conditions. If he still cannot be met, the score will be subtracted by one point (i.e. 557 points) for the voluntary "automation" of the third major. If he still cannot be satisfied, the score will be subtracted by one point (i.e. 556 points) for the admission of the fourth major. If the subsequent major still cannot meet his professional volunteer, the score will not be reduced, and so on.
The professional grade difference setting of different universities is different.
With the popularization of parallel volunteering, many colleges and universities have now eliminated professional grade differences, but some colleges and universities still retain this method this year. From the Admissions Charter published by each university, more than 20 universities have set up professional grade differences this year.
For example, Sichuan Agricultural University, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Heilongjiang University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Jiangxi Normal University, Chengdu Medical College, Northeast Electric Power University, Jimei University, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing University of Technology, Ningxia University, Shandong University of Technology, China Civil Aviation Flight Institute, etc.
In these colleges and universities, the professional grade difference set up by each university is different.
Some colleges and universities have grade differences in each major. For example, Ningxia University. Candidates whose files have been submitted to the university will be admitted in order of scores after decreasing by one point according to the order in which candidates fill in their professional volunteers.
And some universities have set up different professional grade differences between different specialties.
For example, at Jimei University, the total professional volunteer grade difference is 4 points, that is, the grade difference between the first professional volunteer and other professional volunteers is 3 points. There is no grade difference between other professional volunteers, which is regarded as parallel volunteers. The professional grade difference between other professional volunteers and transfer professional volunteers is 1 point.
When volunteering, candidates and parents must carefully read the admission policy of the reported school to see if there is any professional grade difference and what is the form of the grade difference. While taking full account of the score, they should also rationally analyze the proposed school and major. If the institution explicitly adopts the grade difference method for admission in the admission charter, candidates should pay attention to the gradient between the specialties and improve the admission odds when choosing the major.

The first Atlantic hurricane of the year made landfall in Texas, which was hit hard by the outbreak.
The National Hurricane Center of the United States announced that morning that Hurricane Hannah reached 145 km / h and is expected to cause heavy rainfall to southern Texas and northeastern Mexico until next Monday, which in turn will trigger rapid flooding.
At present, with the gradual advance to land, customs have weakened. Despite local power outages, there are no statistical reports of casualties for the time being.
Some local officials in Texas are preparing for tornadoes that are likely to occur along the coast.
President Donald Trump tweeted that the office is closely monitoring the dynamics of Hurricane Hannah and Hurricane Douglas in Hawaii, and called on the public to listen to the emergency management information of the local government and protect families and property.
At the same time, the new crown epidemic in Texas is also worsening sharply, with the number of infections soaring, with a cumulative total of more than 390,000 confirmed infections and more than 5,000 deaths.
When this hurricane hits, the government will face the double problem of sheltering the homeless while preventing the epidemic from worsening again.

Belgian 3-year-old girl dies of new crown virus infection - Xinhua
The Belgian health department said on the 24th that a 3-year-old girl died of the new crown virus infection, making her the youngest patient to die of the new crown disease in the country.
Budwin Katri, a spokesman for the Belgian health department, said that the girl had other serious diseases before she was infected with the new crown virus. In addition to the girl, an 18-year-old man recently died of the new crown virus infection.
Katri said that last week, 85% of the new crown diagnoses in Belgium were under the age of 60.
He reminded healthy and younger people not to take it lightly.
"Although it is relatively rare for young people to die of new crown virus infection, no one is now immune."
Last week, the number of new confirmed cases of the new crown in Belgium increased by 89% over the previous week, with an average of 2.9 people dying of the new crown virus infection per day, up from the daily average of 1.7 the previous week.
During the peak of the epidemic in Europe, the proportion of people infected with the new crown virus in the Belgian population was "among the highest" in Europe.
Belgium has a population of more than 11 million.
The latest data show that a total of 64,847 people in Belgium have been infected with the new crown virus.
Katri warned earlier this week that people must take action before the snowball rolls bigger and bigger, eventually causing an "avalanche".
In order to curb the rebound of the epidemic, Belgian Prime Minister Sophie Wilmes announced on the 23rd that the relevant regulations on people wearing masks in public places will be stricter, and the implementation of the plan to further lift restrictive measures in August will also be suspended.

Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development of the Hong Kong SAR Government, Qiu Tenghua, said on July 25 that all APEC member economies should act in unison to jointly fight the epidemic and promote economic recovery, and should avoid erecting unnecessary trade barriers in accordance with the rights and obligations stipulated by the World Trade Organization.
Qiu Tenghua made the remarks when he participated in the video conference of trade ministers to combat the Xincrown Pneumonia epidemic held by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) on the 25th.
During the meeting, the participating ministers exchanged views on the substantive plans that APEC can take to deal with the impact of the new crown pneumonia epidemic and promote the economic recovery of the region.
Qiu Tenghua said that the public health and economic crisis triggered by the epidemic has had an unprecedented and far-reaching impact on society and economy.
"We are in a double battle. We must overcome the epidemic before we can save the economy.
We should have a clear goal. The virus is our common enemy. Only by cooperation can we win. On the contrary, we will only fail. "
Qiu Tenghua said that the series of trade restrictions caused by the Xinguan pneumonia epidemic did not help to control the epidemic.
Trade is the key solution to the current problem and should not be regarded as the problem.
He condemned all discriminatory and divisive policy measures and urged all economies to keep their borders open at this critical moment, maintain the smooth operation of supply chains, avoid erecting trade barriers or adopting irrational trade policies.

Chengdu people piled up to watch the US Consulate Police stopped people from 'looking too happy'
In response to the closure of the Chinese Consulate General in Houston by the United States, China announced the closure of the United States Consulate General in Chengdu this Friday.
On Saturday, the badge of the US Consulate was removed, and on Sunday, a dark glass car drove away from the consulate amid boos from passers-by.
On Sunday, many Chengdu people piled up in front of the US Consulate to take photos. Those who had not come also came to see them driven by curiosity about current affairs.
A reporter from AFP Chengdu Station also went to the vicinity of the US Consulate in Chengdu to observe, and sent back the news that there was a steady stream of visitors. There were also many parents who took their children to come for a walk to watch the consulate, take photos of the building or take selfies.
The consulate was surrounded by guards, and the police occasionally "corrected" the behavior of the people. They did not seem to allow any outrageous behavior to appear: A woman was stopped just after she was ready to sing a red song, and a guard confiscated a banner.
However, residents of a nearby residential building successfully pulled up a giant Chinese flag on their balcony and shouted slogans in support of China.
The Chengdu American Consulate was opened in 1985 and covers all consul-related affairs of the United States in southwestern China, especially the Tibet Autonomous Region.
A reporter from AFP Chengdu Station said that the Chinese government's response to the United States was relatively restrained: Many Chinese asked the government to close the US Consulate in Hong Kong online, but the official only said that "the closure of the US Consulate in Chengdu is a necessary and legal response to the unreasonable behavior of the United States".
At present, in addition to Chengdu, the United States also has consulates in Guangdong, Shanghai, Shenyang, Wuhan and Hong Kong in China.
Large-scale financial media action "Walking the Village Live to See Poverty Alleviation" Departure - Highlights of the Day - Hunan Daily Network - Hua Sheng Online
Hunan Daily New Hunan Client July 25 (our reporter) On July 25, a large-scale integrated media action, "Walking the Village Live to See Poverty Alleviation", sponsored by the Financial Program Center of the Central Radio and Television Station, set off from Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province. Two caravans carrying 5G new media mobile cloud broadcasting systems slowly drove out of the scene under the eyes of live guests.
General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out that "2020 is a landmark year. We will build a well-off society in an all-round way and achieve the first century-old goal. 2020 is also a decisive year in the decisive battle against poverty".
The large-scale integrated media action "Walking the Village Live to See Poverty Alleviation" is an important measure for the Financial Program Center of the Central Radio and Television Station to do a good job in publicizing the fight against poverty in line with this major theme.
The action will enter poverty eradication villages in more than 20 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the Central Government throughout the country, excavate vivid poverty eradication stories, directly attack the great changes in the appearance of villages and villages, and show how villagers can break through the dilemma of survival and development and move towards the road of becoming rich.
The operation will last for more than three months.
The reporter set out from Xuzhou, and the soldiers took the Southwest Line in two ways, passing through Anhui, Hubei, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangxi, Guizhou, Sichuan, Chongqing, Yunnan and Tibet. On the other hand, they took the Northwest Line, passing through Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi and Hebei, covering more than 10,000 kilometers.
In the form of reporting, "Walking the Village Live to See Poverty Alleviation" is boldly integrated.
The economic development of the villages visited by the caravan will be broadcast through the CCTV Finance and Economics Channel of the Central Radio and Television Station, CCTV Economic Voice, China Traffic Broadcasting and CCTV Finance New Media.
Among them, the live television broadcast will be mainly completed in the midday news program "World Finance" of CCTV Finance and Economics Channel (premiere time: Monday to Sunday 12: 00 - 13: 00), and the golden news section of CCTV Finance and Economics Channel, "Economic Information Network", will open a poverty eradication report column (premiere time: Monday to Sunday 20: 30-21: 30).
At the same time, the caravan will broadcast each village it visits live on the CCTV financial client for up to one hour. Viewers can watch the live broadcast and participate in the raffle by downloading the CCTV financial APP.
In the application of technology and studio design, "Walking the Village Live to See Poverty Alleviation" has made a breakthrough and pioneered the "Outfield New Media Caravan".
The vehicle carries a new 5G media mobile cloud broadcasting system and uses 5G + 4K / 8K + AI technology to realize the organic combination of online and offline, large screen small screen and television broadcasting.
A three-news broadcast area is equipped. The broadcast area is converted from a container. It is 12 meters long, 2.55 meters wide and 3.98 meters high. The box uses a hydraulic automatic expansion structure, which can be turned up to 120 degrees.
The broadcast area can also be automatically expanded and connected to the external expansion platform, with an area of more than 50 square meters, which can meet the scene requirements of most programs.
At present, the Dongchuan District of Kunming City is already hot in summer, and what is hotter than the weather is the poverty alleviation workshop next to the relocation and resettlement site.
Lu Ling, an employee of Kunming Aisford Electronics Technology Company, said, "Now, as soon as you leave your home, you enter the factory door and make money to take care of your family, thanks to the free vocational skills training of trade union organizations."
Walking into the poverty alleviation workshop for the processing of electronic components in Tongdu Street, Dongchuan District, a busy picture of the heat of the day came into view.
Lu Ling, who is in her 40s, is a single mother who takes her children alone and also takes care of her elderly parents.
In her most difficult time, the Dongchuan District General Trade Union helped come up with ideas and find ways to "give relief in the snow" after she was busy before running.
Since 2018, Lu Ling has enjoyed assistance policies such as housing, schooling, social security and employment, as well as assistance funds issued by trade unions at all levels.
This year, her children have successfully graduated and taken up employment. She herself has a job and income after taking part in skills training. She got out of trouble at the end of April.
It is reported that the special skills training project of the Dongchuan District General Organization to help combat poverty is part of the skills training work of the Yunnan Provincial General Trade Union.
In the light of the characteristics of the workers in difficulty in the relocation and resettlement sites for poverty alleviation in the district, the district has conducted an in-depth investigation to understand the training needs and determined the training jobs. In the near future, it plans to train a total of 450 electricians, welders and noodle teachers.
Recently, Li Yi, an employee of the Yunnan Menglian County branch of the Agricultural Bank, wrote a sincere thank-you letter to the county general trade union.
In her letter, she sincerely thanked the golden autumn student aid given to her by the union between August 2013 and January 2017 to help her complete her studies.
In 2004, Li Yi's father died in a car accident, and her mother was included in the file of workers in difficulty. Since then, she has been enjoying the care of the policy of building a file card.
With the help of the local trade union, Li Yi successfully completed her studies.
Since 2016, 3809 households have been lifted out of poverty through institutional guarantees and precise assistance.
The successful relief of the Lu Ling family and Li Yi is a microcosm of the Yunnan trade union promoting the relief and relief work of workers in difficulty.
According to Duan Kaiyuan, a staff member of the Law and Rights Protection Work Department of the Yunnan General Trade Union, the province has strengthened the dynamic management of the files of workers in difficulty, promoted the normalization of the filing work, and included workers in difficulty who meet the conditions for the establishment of files in the assistance system in a timely manner. It has broadened the application channels for workers in difficulty and used WeChat to open an online service platform for applying for the establishment of files of workers in difficulty, so as to facilitate the timely and voluntary declaration of workers in difficulty.
During the epidemic period, it was difficult to go out to work. In order to help workers in difficulty ease the living pressure, Yunnan Province allocated a total of more than 13 million yuan in warm funds. In accordance with the standards of 2,000 yuan per household for workers in difficulty at the national level and 1,500 yuan per household for workers in difficulty at the provincial level, special warm and condolence activities were carried out for more than 6,000 families at the national level and more than 1,000 workers in difficulty at the provincial level.
At the same time, the provincial general docked with various Internet recruitment platforms such as the human society department and Zhilian recruitment to push recruitment information to workers in difficulty and provide employment consultation, employment guidance and other services.
