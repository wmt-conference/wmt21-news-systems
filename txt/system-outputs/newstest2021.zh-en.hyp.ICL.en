Xinhua Commentary: Making Excellent Returning Migrant Workers a New Force for Rural Revitalization - Xinhua News Agency
Talent is the key to rural revitalization.
Where can I find talent?
The group of outstanding returning migrant workers is an indispensable new force.

(Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 26) Topic: Make outstanding returning migrant workers a new force for rural revitalization
The 34-year-old Zhang Xiong family is in Orchard Village, Meishan City, Sichuan. In 2010, he quit his job in Beijing with a salary of tens of thousands a month and returned home to start a business.
After several years of hard work, he now runs a grape-growing family farm with an annual income of more than one million yuan, has become a well-known rich leader, and has also been selected into the team of the " two committees " of the village.
In recent years, inspired by a series of policies to support and benefit farmers, such as poverty alleviation and rural revitalization, more and more outstanding migrant workers like Zhang Xiong have chosen to return home to start their own businesses, activating a pool of spring water in the countryside.
Sichuan, a populous province in western China and a major labor-exporting province, has implemented the " Excellent Migrant Workers Return Training Project. " In 2019 alone, more than 8,000 village Party branch secretaries were generated from among the outstanding migrant workers, cultivating 61,000 village reserve forces and developing more than 20,000 Party members, thus providing a strong guarantee for winning the fight against poverty and implementing the rural revitalization strategy.
Well-off is not well-off, the key depends on the villagers.
Since the reform and opening-up, a large number of young and middle-aged rural workers have gone out to work to increase their income, and some have set up their own enterprises through hard work.
However, objectively, it has also led to the emergence of " hollowing out " in rural areas to varying degrees. In particular, rural grass-roots organizations have been weakened, and the secretary of the village Party branch and the team of Party members have shown the characteristics of " one old and one low, " namely, the age is old, the educational qualifications are low, the team of leaders of the village Party organization is not strong and the problem is outstanding.
If rural talents and other factors have been flowing one way to the city, and the countryside is in a state of " blood loss " and " anemia " for a long time, revitalization is an empty word.
Attract back those rural migrant workers who have the ability, consciousness and ambition to serve their hometown, guide them to return home and start their own businesses to become rich leaders, train them to become Party members and village cadres on the basis of merit, and enrich the ranks of grass-roots cadres. This is the fundamental solution to the lack of contact between the ranks of rural Party members and grass-roots Party organizations.
Excellent migrant workers can be brought back, and they should be allowed to stay and do well.
In recent years, Sichuan has started by paying close attention to the Party building of rural migrant workers and, on the basis of strict selection criteria, has established institutional mechanisms such as targeted referral, service guarantee, training and ability enhancement, selection and use of outstanding rural migrant workers, so that they can improve their ability, have job security, have expectations in life, truly take root in rural areas, and officials have a sense of achievement in starting a business.
This year is the final year of the decisive battle against poverty. Talent is the key factor to make a good connection between poverty alleviation and rural revitalization.
Governments at all levels of the Party should attach great importance to this group of outstanding returning migrant workers and, through comprehensive measures, turn them into a task force and a new force that can stay, fight and take away, so as to provide a strong organizational guarantee and talent support for rural poverty alleviation, prosperity, development and revitalization.
Because of the epidemic, this year's college graduates is a very special session. On the evening of July 11, the bilibili summer graduation song will bring a special live online performance for the graduates. Old Wolf, Park Shu, Li Yuchun, Mao Yi and other musicians send songs and blessings to the recent graduates.
Well-known up master SealWu Yifan also brought a song " Wild Grass, " which is a rap song based on Lu Xun's collection of prose poems of the same name, which is very popular among young people.
As a result of the epidemic, many graduates did not experience the ritual sense of picking ears and awarding degree certificates on the spot, so they transferred the ritual sense to the line.
The data showed that the 2.5-hour concert had a peak live popularity of more than 35 million.
" Follow your own heart, seize the opportunity, regardless of the consequences, sometimes there will be unexpected gains. "
Although it is a graduation concert, many songs also moved non-fresh graduates.
" Looking at the whole scene, I really want to cry. Everyone's youth is full of beauty and regret, but they are worth remembering, and we should go on bravely. "

The natural ecology of the capital continues to improve to attract wildlife cities to " settle "
There are more than 500 species of wild animals in Beijing
Xinhua News (Reporter Wang Bin) Beijing Youth Daily reporter learned from the Municipal Landscaping Bureau that in recent years, with the continuous improvement of the natural and ecological environment of the capital, the variety and number of wild animals have also continued to increase.
At present, the number of terrestrial vertebrate wildlife living in Beijing has increased to more than 500 species, including national-level protected animals such as brown horse chicken and black stork, as well as national-level protected animals such as gazelle, swan, grey crane and mandarin duck.
Whether the urban forests planted everywhere in the Second Ring, or the small and micro wetlands embedded between buildings, not only bring the wild interest of nature to the citizens of the capital, but also attract wild animals to " settle " in the city.
In the middle of summer, the Songshan National Nature Reserve, located in the Yanshan Mountains in the northwest of Yanqing District, is full of vitality.
A raccoon played leisurely by the mountain stream, while two badgers quarreled with each other.
In retrospect, a wild boar could not resist the " scratch " on his body and was rubbing hard against the bark. Hu Qiaoli, director of the administrative department of Songshan National Nature Reserve, said that as of the end of 2019, in this green sea with a total area of more than 6,200 hectares, there were 178 species of wild animals, including national-level protected animals gold carving, national-level protected animals spoon chicken and gazelle, and nearly one third of the city's wildlife species can be seen here.
" In Songshan, wild animals are the real' masters', and our staff can only be regarded as people's' bodyguards' at best. "
Hu Qiaoli said that in order to understand the situation of wild flora and fauna in the protected area on the ground, more than 30 professional patrol members patrol along 16 carefully formulated protection routes every day, and there will be a " big circle " every month, going through almost the entire protected area in a full day.
" During the inspection, we should not only check and record biodiversity, but also check and install artificial nests, rescue injured wild animals, install infrared cameras in the field, and so on. "
More than 200 infrared cameras have been installed in the Songshan National Nature Reserve to record the living conditions of wildlife in the forest.
Hu Qiaoli introduced that with the continuous enrichment of biodiversity in the protected areas in recent years, more and more wild animals appear in the camera, leopard cats, dragons and pig badgers have become " permanent guests, " and the " mirror rate " of the gazelle, a second-class national protected animal, is also increasing.
Zhang Zhiming, Director of the Wildlife and Wetland Protection Department of the Beijing Parks and Landscaping Bureau, said that the number of terrestrial vertebrate wildlife in Beijing has increased from 461 species in 1994 to more than 500 at present, and the species and number of wildlife in Beijing have continuously increased in recent years.
Wild animals are becoming more and more common in cities, which is closely related to the continuous upgrading of greening in the capital city in recent years.
In particular, the new round of afforestation construction of one million mu, which began in 2018, proposes to reshape the urban ecological environment, enhance the ecological function of forestland and green areas, and highlight the concept of " near nature. "
The planning strives to achieve interconnection and interaction with the surrounding green areas, making it easier for wild animals to " visit relatives and friends, " and the trees planted are also favorite honey and food plants for animals.

This technology makes seedling planting more uniform, maximizes the utilization of sunlight and arable land resources, and saves labor costs of 16 yuan per acre.
The farm experimented with new technologies such as informatization and intelligence in agricultural production, forming the largest group of agricultural machinery in China from the ground to the sky.
According to statistics, the total number of farm agricultural machinery is 49,000 units (pieces), and the rate of comprehensive mechanization in the field is 99.8%.
Agricultural machinery operation to achieve GPS satellite navigation 100%, dry field precision seeding 100%, dry field high-horsepower locomotive operation 100%.
" Green agriculture, smart agriculture and digital agriculture are the exploration direction of agricultural modernization. "
Friendship farm director Liu Hualien said.
The key to agricultural modernization lies in scientific and technological progress.
Agricultural reclamation in Heilongjiang, represented by farms, has played a demonstration and leading role in modern large-scale agriculture " aircraft carrier " in recent years, and has initially established a modern agro-industrial system dominated by large-scale cultivation, standardized production and industrial management.
On the outskirts of Friendship County, there is an agricultural machinery exhibition park covering an area of 350,000 square meters.
There is a concentrated exhibition of more than 140 agricultural tools that have been introduced and used in agricultural reclamation in Heilongjiang over the years.

Church fire in Nantes, France: Diocesan volunteers admit that arson is usually good and silent - NEWS
July 26 (Reuters) According to foreign media reports, on July 18, the famous Cathedral of St. Peter and St. Paul, a treasure of religious and historical buildings in Nantes, France, was severely damaged in a fire and the large organ was completely destroyed.
On the 26th local time, the prosecutor of Nantes announced that a parish volunteer responsible for protecting the cathedral had been charged with " arson and destruction. "
He had admitted that he had set fire to the church.
According to the report, local prosecutor Senas said that the 39-year-old parish volunteer from Rwanda admitted that he had set fire to three places in the cathedral at night.
The man's lawyer said the arsonists now regret doing this.
This man entered France by way of refuge a few years ago, took refuge in the parish where the fire occurred, and was admitted in the church.
The prosecution pointed out that he had recently tried to renew his visa and was in dialogue with the police about it.
But the church said it still couldn't believe that the normally kind, smiling, but untalkative believer would destroy the church he loved so much.
On the day of the fire on July 18, the volunteer had been questioned and investigated by the police because of illogical problems in the narrative, but he was later released.
The picture shows firefighters carrying out rescue at the scene.
On the evening of the 25th, the man was summoned again after professional engineers from the laboratory of the Paris Central Police obtained new evidence.
This time, the man admitted to arson.
It was reported that if convicted of intentional arson and destruction, the suspect could face 10 years' imprisonment and a fine of 150,000 euros.
It was reported that the fire caused serious damage to the Cathedral of St. Pierre and St. Paul. The organ in the church was completely burned down and the colored glass windows behind the organ were also severely damaged.
Brunet, the chief architect of France's historic buildings, believes that conservative estimates suggest that the restoration of Nantes Cathedral will take at least three years.
Comprehensive news: US unilateralism undermines bilateral relations International public opinion supports China's countermeasures against the US - Xinhua News
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26 - An overseas correspondent from Xinhua News Agency reported: On the morning of July 24, the Chinese Foreign Ministry informed the US Embassy in China that China had decided to revoke the permission for the establishment and operation of the US Consulate General in Chengdu and put forward specific requirements for the Consulate General to stop all business and activities.
International public opinion believes that the unilateral measures taken by the United States have caused serious distress to China-US relations. It is legitimate and necessary for China to respond to the unreasonable provocations of the United States and to take countermeasures.
Andrés Bolx, director of the China Research Center of the Institute of International Studies of the University of Chile, said that the unilateral measures taken by the United States have damaged the bridge of understanding between the two peoples and caused a crisis in the relations between the two major countries.
China's notification to the United States of the closure of its Consulate General in Chengdu is a countermeasure to the unilateral measures taken by the United States and is in line with diplomatic practice.
Patricio Giusto, a professor at the Catholic University of Argentina and director of the Center for Arab-China Studies, believes that China's above-mentioned decision is a legitimate and necessary countermeasure against the previous provocations of the United States and is not aimed at ordinary Americans.
The United States is trying to divert the attention of the American public by pressuring China to cover up its inability to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic.
Bambang Suryono, chairman of the Asian Innovation Research Center, an Indonesian think tank, said that the provocative diplomatic posture taken by the United States has caused serious distress to China-US relations and bilateral relations are facing serious challenges.
China's notification to the United States of the closure of its Consulate General in Chengdu is a normal countermeasure and conforms to diplomatic practice. It not only reflects China's principled position of resolutely safeguarding its own interests, but also reflects the reasonableness, advantages and justice of China's diplomacy.
Tanzanian current affairs commentator Francis Semwinza said that China's above-mentioned decision is a legitimate and necessary response to the US provocation.
For China-US relations to return to normal, the US should proactively improve its relations with China and stop interfering in China's internal affairs.
The United States should focus on how to achieve win-win economic and political results with China and how to benefit the two peoples and the international community as a whole.
Ali Yusuf, executive director of the Federation of Arab-China Friendship Associations headquartered in Sudan, said that the countermeasures that China was forced to take are a legitimate and necessary response to the unreasonable actions of the US, in line with international law and the basic norms governing international relations, as well as diplomatic practice.
Earlier, the US demanded the closure of the Chinese Consulate General in Houston in serious violation of international law and the basic norms governing international relations.
We hope that the US can rescind its previous decision and create the necessary conditions for the return of bilateral relations to normal.
Singapore's Lianhe Zaobao said in an editorial that the greater strategic intention of the United States is to contain China and prevent China from continuing to rise.
In the face of the gradual pressure from the United States, although China is very reluctant to see China-US relations continue to deteriorate, it has to take countermeasures.

Poland to withdraw from the European Treaty on the Prevention of Violence against Women
Poland's Ministry of Justice said Saturday that Poland will take steps next week to withdraw from the European treaty on the prevention of violence against women.
Poland's right-wing government cabinet says the treaty requires schools to teach students gender issues, trampling on the rights of students' parents.
Polish Justice Minister Gioblo said at a press conference that his Ministry of Justice will submit a request to the Ministry of Labour and Family on Monday to begin withdrawing from the treaty.
That treaty is also known as the Istanbul Convention.
" The treaty contains elements of a meaning-form nature that we consider to be harmful, " Gioblo said.
Poland's ruling PiS and its coalition partners have a close alliance with the Roman Catholic Church and advocate a conservative social agenda.
Polish President Duda made hostility to gay rights one of the main topics during his successful re-election campaign this month.
On Friday, thousands of Poles, mostly women, protested against withdrawal from the Convention in Warsaw and other cities.
Lempat, one of the organizers of the protest, said during a protest march in Warsaw that " the purpose of withdrawing from the treaty is to legalize domestic violence. "
Some protesters held banners that read " PiS is a hell for women. "
PiS has long complained about the Istanbul Convention.
Poland's previous centrist government ratified the Convention in 2015.
The PiS government said the treaty did not respect religion and required liberal social policies to be taught in schools.
So far, however, the party has not decided to withdraw from the convention.

It is reported that, compared with the Ka-52, the Ka-52M will partially adopt new protective materials that will not increase weight, and its pilot cockpit will be reinforced and equipped with new equipment to resist missile attacks, thus increasing the probability of battlefield survival; it will be equipped with more powerful generators to power more complex airborne electronic equipment; the photoelectric system will be upgraded to detect and identify more distant battlefield targets; the new light multi-purpose missile equipped with the main attack armoured fighting vehicles and reinforced concrete fortifications will have a range of up to 20 kilometers, which is about one times higher than the range of similar missiles used in active service in Russia; and its defense weapons and communication equipment will be used to the maximum extent with Mi-28NM armed helicopters that can attack air targets, thus making related maintenance simple and economical.
In addition, the Ka-52M will have more advanced electronic guidance system, weapon targeting system and navigation equipment.
Russian experts also said that it is noteworthy that the Ka-52M will be equipped with communication equipment to communicate with drones in order to obtain real-time information transmitted by nearby drones in the air, such as displaying images taken by drones on the cockpit screen of the helicopter.
According to the plan, Ka-52M pilots will be able to directly control their UAVs, thus improving pilots' understanding of the battlefield situation and guidance of long-range missiles.
According to Russian media reports, Russian Deputy Defense Minister Krivoruchko said last December that the Russian Defense Ministry plans to purchase more than 110 Wuzhika-52Ms by 2027.

Engine may shut down FAA urgent investigation of 2000 Boeing airliners - Xinhua News
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an emergency airworthiness directive on the 24th, requiring an emergency inspection of about 2,000 Boeing 737NG and 737Classic aircraft registered in the United States, because the corrosion of the aircraft's air check valve may cause the engine to stop in the air.
The Federal Aviation Administration said that it has so far received four reports of air parking of the engines of the 737NG and 737Classic aircraft, so it has made an emergency inspection request for the passenger aircraft that have been parked continuously for seven days or more and the passenger aircraft that have flown less than 11 times so far after returning to flight.
The Federal Aviation Administration warned that if the fifth-stage check valves of all two engines were corroded, they could get stuck in the open position, causing the aircraft to completely lose power and unable to restart the engine.
The aviation regulator ordered that if the check valve was found to be corroded, air operators must replace the key component before the aircraft was put into service again.
Boeing responded later that day that the COVID-19 pandemic had reduced travel demand, and many passenger planes had been sealed or used less, making " check valves more vulnerable to corrosion. "
Boeing also said that it has advised air operators to inspect the passenger aircraft covered by the directive, and if problems are found, Boeing will provide assistance in repairing and replacing check valves.
The Associated Press reported that airliners owned by major US air carriers usually fly multiple times a day, but a large number of airliners were grounded after the COVID-19 outbreak. With the recent slow growth in passenger travel demand, some airliners have returned to operation.
The FAA did not release details of the four air parking reports.
Alaska Airlines disclosed one of the incidents later on the 24th.
The airline operator said in a statement that on its way from Seattle, Washington, to Austin, Texas, on July 15, one of its engines suddenly failed, and the plane finally made a successful emergency landing at Austin Airport.
Alaska Airlines said it had replaced the aircraft's engines and had checked the engines of six aircraft in accordance with FAA instructions.
American Airlines, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines respectively said on the 24th that their aircraft had no engine failure associated with the air check valve.
Four American Airlines aircraft will be inspected, and 28 United Airlines aircraft will be inspected.
Delta Air Lines said it would inspect its 20 aircraft, but did not say if there had been any engine failure.
Several media reported that the FAA emergency airworthiness directive was another impact on Boeing.
Indonesian Lion Airlines and Ethiopian Airlines each crashed a Boeing 737MAX in October 2018 and March 2019, respectively, killing 346 people.
The series was subsequently grounded around the world, ceased production in January and resumed production in May.
FAA Director Steve Dixon admitted in June that the FAA had " made a mistake " in regulating Boeing with regard to the 737MAX.

" Nutrition Agent " in the History of the Party and the History of New China - New News
2020-07-26 17: 37: 29 Source: People's Forum Author: Zhu Yanjing Editor: Zhu Yanjing
Recently, when visiting the Siping Campaign Memorial Museum, General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed that " 1.4 billion people and more than 90 million Party members, especially leading cadres at all levels, should learn the history of the Communist Party of China and the history of New China well. "
Conscientiously studying the history of the Party and the history of the new China is a compulsory course for Party members and cadres to forget their original aspirations and keep in mind their mission. They should draw rich nourishment from them, cultivate the feelings of the country and the country, and follow the Long March road of the new era.
A magnificent history of the Party and the history of New China records the hard work and glorious course of the Communist Party of China since its birth, demonstrating the faith and loyalty forged by the Communists with their lives and blood, and their original intention and mission to stick to forever.
History is the best textbook. For Party members and cadres, the history of the Party and the history of New China are the most brilliant chapters in this textbook.
Every Party member should constantly strengthen the historical thinking of taking history as a guide and moving towards the future, build on the new journey and new mission, pick up the " baton " of the times, and follow the Long March road of the present generation.
Cast the soul with history and stick to the original mission in studying the history of the Party and the history of New China.
The opening of the history of the Party and the history of New China is full of the Chinese Communists' immutable original mission and rock-solid faith, demonstrating the simple feeling that the Communists will always be with the people.
To get a close understanding of the important events, meetings and important figures in the history of the Party and the history of New China is not only an intuitive spiritual shock and ideological baptism, but also to understand the connotation of the initial faith from the depths of the soul and know the weight of the mission.
For Party members and cadres, if they want to constantly strive for their original mission and always maintain their advanced character, they must find the origin of our departure and the fulcrum of our original intention from the history of the Party and the history of New China, maintain a sober understanding and firm position, arouse the strength to work hard for the country and the people, and ensure that the red mountains laid down by the revolutionary ancestors with their blood and lives are passed on from generation to generation.

These great spirits precipitated by history have provided a strong spiritual incentive for our Party to overcome various risks and challenges on its way forward. They are valuable spiritual wealth that cannot be broken down, washed away or stolen.
The process of studying the history of the Party and Chinese history is the process of reliving and shaping these spirits. We should consciously take the lofty spirit of the revolutionary ancestors as a mirror, stick to the spiritual homeland of the Communists, build a solid spiritual base for advancing the great cause and realizing the great dream, inherit and carry forward these spirits and radiate the light of the new era.
Reading history for introspection, and constantly maintaining rectification and dispel evil spirits in studying the history of the Party and the history of New China.
For Party members and cadres, there has never been any history that can bring more profound warning, enlightenment and reference than the history of the Party and the history of New China.
In the history of the Party and the history of New China, we can see not only the great deeds of the older generation of revolutionaries who were determined to devote themselves to their faith and worked tirelessly to achieve the set goals, but also the profound lessons of some figures who were shaken by their ideals and beliefs and went to the opposite of the revolution, enlightening and warning us that we will never stagnate or slacken with firm determination and will, always maintain a rich and tenacious spirit of struggle, constantly purify the Party character and cultivate ourselves and discipline ourselves.
To truly become a firm believer and faithful practitioner of the lofty ideals of Communism, we need to brush off the ideological " dust " and prevent the " dirt " from dyeing the body. The history of the Party of the Party and the history of New China should become the basis for every Party member to examine himself and warn himself.
Knowledge of history is inspiring, and bravely take the important responsibilities of the times in studying the history of the Party and the history of New China.
General Secretary Xi Jinping once pointed out, " Studying the history of the Party and national history is a compulsory course for adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics and advancing the various undertakings of the Party and the State. "
Looking back at the history and asking the initial heart, in order to continue the glory and move towards the future.

We will continue to take the advanced deeds of the older generation of revolutionaries as reference and guidance, constantly polish the political character of the Communists, maintain the struggle posture of striving only for the day and making great efforts, and the struggle spirit of moving forward as the more difficult and dangerous, and write a brilliant stroke of our own in the vast journey of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
" Sealing up to Jiangnan " in pursuit of the poetic " Yellow River Dream " - New News
(China's Poverty Reduction Story) " Sealing up to Jiangnan " in pursuit of the poetic " Yellow River Dream "
China News Service, Yinchuan, July 26 (Yang Di) " Jiuqu Yellow River thousands of miles of sand, waves and wind from the horizon. "
The Yellow River, which has aroused the pride of countless scholars, has given birth to the beautiful and rich Ningxia Plain. Today, Ningxia, which has the reputation of " Shangjiang Jiangnan, " is adhering to the concept of " ecological priority and green development " and pursuing the poetic " Yellow River Dream. "
River Shimizu Show's " Bibo Dream "
" The Yellow River is rich in Ningxia. " The Yellow River flows through Ningxia for 397 kilometers and is the " mother river " for raising one side.
However, with the rapid progress of industrialization and urbanization, the development, utilization, management and protection of rivers and lakes are unbalanced, and disturbances such as excessive sewage discharge, surrounding lakes to build fields, and encroaching on water areas have become prominent, leading to black and stinking water bodies, excessive water quality, dirty environment and ecological degradation.
Now, Ningxia is promoting the diverse restoration of water ecology and making efforts to return the Yellow River to show the river clear.
Water management should start from the source.
In Yinchuan, Ningxia, by adopting the method of " bidding + pollution control + strict control, " all sewage from industrial parks has been centrally treated, all urban sewage treatment plants have achieved Class A standard discharge, black and stinking water bodies in built-up urban areas have been basically eliminated, and the third batch of black and stinking water demonstration cities in China has been successfully declared.
In addition, Ningxia fully implemented the river and lake long system in 2017, and now it has achieved full coverage of the five-level river and lake long responsibility system in districts, cities and villages, and river and lake long river crossing has become the norm.
64-year-old Gu Jincheng, who lives in a village near the Yellow River, witnessed the changes of the Yellow River: " There was a foul smell in the water before, but the foul smell disappeared after remediation. "
Gu Jincheng said that the ecological environment is better and his life is more comfortable. Now he often goes for a walk along the Yellow River with his family to feel the blue water and blue sky.
The " Wetland Dream " of Sha Gu Xiang Collection
Flying birds, green trees, walkways, turquoise water... The beauty of Fan Zhongyan's " Sand Gull Xiang Collection " has become a reality in the Yellow River Wetland Park in Yinchuan, Ningxia.
The Yellow River flows through Ningxia and has formed a variety of wetlands such as river wetlands, lake wetlands and swamp wetlands along the way, which plays an important role in promoting the rational utilization of water resources and water ecological balance. It has also become an important international migration channel for birds.
Since 2009, relevant departments in Ningxia have cumulatively invested about 3.45 billion yuan in wetland protection projects. At present, Yinchuan has a wetland area of 192 million hectares, with a wetland protection rate of 78.5%. There are nearly 200 natural lakes and swamp wetlands, five national wetland parks, one national urban wetland park, six autonomous region-level wetland parks and eight municipal parks.
Lu Jinhu, deputy director of Yinchuan Wetland Protection Center, told reporters that wetland protection has increased biodiversity, which is particularly evident in birds. " The remnant gull is an endangered bird. There are only more than 20,000 birds in the world, of which more than 2,000 live in the Yinchuan wetland. "
Meanwhile, in accordance with the law, Ningxia has delineated a 500-meter red line for the wetland protection area on both sides of the Yinchuan section of the Yellow River, stipulating that no unit or individual may carry out development, construction and business activities within the scope of protection except for public welfare projects.
Zhao Shaoyong, deputy director of the Yinchuan Water Conservancy Service Center, said that through the control of pollution sources, the comprehensive management of river and lake ecology and the construction of terminal wetlands, the water quality of the nine main yellow drainage ditches in Ningxia has now reached 100% of the Class IV standard. " Now the water is clear, the fish swim and the flowers bloom. "
Pu Huiminsheng's " Drinking Water Dream "
Yinchuan City, Ningxia, once had the title of " embarrassment ": the only city along the Yellow River that " keeps the Yellow River short of water. "
Since 2010, Yinchuan has been facing a persistent problem of water shortage during the peak summer season. The " pain of water shortage " in the past decade has become a painful summer experience for many high-rise residents. However, under the current situation that the major water sources are at the limit of overmining and a large area of groundwater overmining funnel has been formed underground in urban areas, water-based water shortage has become a difficult problem besetting Yinchuan.
Thanks to the improvement of the water quality of the Yellow River, drinking the purified Yellow River has become a good solution to the drinking water problems of local residents.
Ding Ming, deputy director of the Yinchuan City Water Bureau, introduced that in order to improve the living and production water demand of urban and rural residents in Yinchuan, Ningxia started the water supply project on the urban and rural western line of the Yinchuan metropolitan area in due time, replacing the original underground water source with high-quality Yellow River.
" On December 29, 2019, the water supply project officially provided water to the three districts of Yinchuan City. In 2020, residents of Minning Town and Helan County also drank the Yellow River. "
Ding Ming said that the water conservancy department of Yinchuan will give overall consideration to the transformation of the regional integration of rural drinking water and urban water supply. " In the next step, we will integrate all the rural decentralized water supply points into the Western Line water supply project, and it is expected to basically realize the urban-rural integrated water supply in Yinchuan by the end of this year. "
Compaction responsible departments to strengthen flood prevention and disaster relief work - New News
Compaction responsible departments to strengthen flood prevention and disaster relief work
CCTV News (CCTV News): According to the news from the Ministry of Water Resources, at 12 o'clock today (July 25), the river section below Wangjiaba in the main stream of the Huaihe River exceeded the warning level of 0.64 to 3.31 meters, and the river section below Sha City in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the two lakes exceeded the warning level of 0.05 to 2.02 meters.
Taihu Lake has lasted for 28 days since it exceeded the warning level on June 28.
At 12 o'clock today, the average water level of Taihu Lake was 4.67 meters, exceeding the guaranteed water level by 0.02 meters.
Today, after consultation and judgment, the General Administration of National Defense decided to continue to maintain the second-level flood control response in the Yangtze River and Huaihe River, requiring all localities to compact their responsibilities and further implement the work of flood control and disaster relief.
Today, the State Prevention Office and the Emergency Management Department urgently dispatched professional drainage vehicles from Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Fujian to help Jiangxi solve local urban waterlogging problems caused by heavy rainfall.
The United States launched its first countervailing investigation against China with " RMB exchange rate undervalued "
In response to the recent announcement by the United States Department of Commerce, it decided to launch an anti-dumping countervailing investigation on tie (harness) products originating in China, and to launch an investigation on the project of " RMB exchange rate undervaluation. "
China's Ministry of Commerce pointed out that this is the first time that the United States has opened an investigation into the so-called " undervaluation of the RMB exchange rate " in a countervailing case, which China firmly opposes.
China's Ministry of Commerce issued a special press release on the evening of the 23rd, saying that China implements a managed floating exchange rate system based on market supply and demand and adjusted with reference to a basket of currencies, and the market plays a decisive role in the formation of the exchange rate.
The press release stressed that, on the whole, the RMB exchange rate is at a reasonable equilibrium level and has not been underestimated.
Since 2005, the RMB has appreciated by more than 17% against the US dollar.
According to data released by the Bank for International Settlements, from early 2005 to May 2020, the RMB nominal effective exchange rate appreciated by 38% and the real effective exchange rate by 49%, making it the strongest currency among the G20 economies and one of the most appreciated currencies in the world.
The Ministry of Commerce pointed out that the exchange rate issue is beyond the competence of members to conduct countervailing investigations in accordance with the rules of the World Trade Organization.
The United States amended its regulations in February this year to conduct countervailing investigations on other countries' exchange rates, which has been suspected of violating WTO rules and has been opposed by many parties.
The press release said that even in accordance with US regulations, the content of the applicant's complaint contained a large number of errors and did not have the necessary countervailing elements such as financial support, grant of benefits and exclusivity.
China urges the US to abide by existing international rules and stop conducting countervailing investigations into the so-called " undervaluation of the RMB exchange rate. "
Affected by the further rise in tensions between China and the US, the offshore and onshore RMB depreciated sharply against the US dollar on the 22nd day, and both fell below the threshold of RMB 7.0 against the US dollar.
Whether the US Department of Commerce's move is intended to push up the RMB deserves attention.
The spot exchange rate of RMB against the US dollar rose above the 7.0 mark on the 23rd and closed at 6.9961.
The official-regulated midpoint rate of the RMB against the US dollar was lowered by 17 basic points on the 24th, at 6.9938.

Venezuelan Foreign Minister accuses the United States of fabricating lies to unprovoked attack on China - Xinhua
Areassa said that the US government has recently put constant pressure on China in politics, diplomacy, economy and public opinion, which is a baseless attack on a sovereign state.
Arreaza forwarded a tweet posted by Chinese Ambassador to Venezuela Li Baorong on his personal account earlier that day and made the above comments.
Li Baorong said in his tweet that China strongly condemns the US for forcibly entering the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, which is a serious violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and the China-US Consular Treaty, and China will make a legitimate and necessary response to this.
Venezuelan Vice President Rodríguez Rodríguez, Vice Foreign Minister in charge of North American Affairs Carlos Long and other government officials, public figures and mainstream media journalists also relayed Li Baorong's tweets, condemning the actions of the United States as a serious violation of international law.
On the 26th, the day before Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte delivered his fifth State of the Union Address (SONA) in office, more than 80,000 cases of COVID-19 pneumonia were confirmed in the Philippines, of which the number of confirmed cases by the staff of the Presidential Information Department (PCOO) and its directly affiliated institutions increased to 25.
To this end, PCOO has specially prepared a working group that has not contacted the confirmed staff to cooperate with President Duterte's press release of SONA.
PCOO Minister Martin Andanal said in an interview with DZBB Radio on the 26th that he had prepared two sets of plans for President Duterte's release of SONA.
According to Plan A, Duterte will release the SONA at the Batasang Pambansa building in Quezon City on the afternoon of the 27th.
Due to the epidemic, only 50 seats were arranged for some government cabinet members and legislators, and a special video conference room was set up for other cabinet members and local government officials to watch.
All participants passed a quick test to enter the Capitol building on the same day.
Once one of the participants tested positive, Plan B was launched, in which President Duterte announced the SONA at the Malacanan Palace of the Presidential Palace, and fewer seats were arranged for the hearing.
As is customary, SONA will broadcast live to the Philippines in real time.
As of the time of writing, the President of the Philippines has not confirmed whether Duterte's family will attend SONA.
Andanal said that President Duterte's SONA will highlight how the government will lead the Philippines to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic and restore social and economic life. It will also mention his commitment when he took office, namely anti-government corruption, anti-illegal drugs and poverty reduction.
Duterte will also explain other plans of the current administration, including creating more jobs, revitalizing the economy, promoting education, and helping overseas Filipino workers suffering from the epidemic.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26 (reporter Hu Lu) On July 26, the third flood of the Yangtze River in 2020 formed.

Lewis Family: John Lewis is a soldier " fighting for the weakest "
Congressman John Lewis, a civil rights fighter, was remembered as " fighting for the weakest " at a memorial service for him on Saturday (July 25).
Lewis's public memorial service has been held in Alabama since Saturday.
There were two memorial services on the first day.
At a public memorial service at the University of Troy in Alabama on Saturday, Lewis's five brothers and sisters and a nephew spoke of him as a loving, fearless, family-oriented man.
" He devoted his life to helping others, " Lewis's youngest brother, Henry " Grant " Lewis, said at the meeting.
Samuel Lewis said his mother had warned John " not to get into trouble, not to get into trouble. "
He added that John did not heed his mother's warning, saying, " We all know that John is always going to get into trouble, always getting into trouble, but that's because he insists on the right thing, and that's a good trouble. "
Lewis's brothers and sisters reminded people at the memorial service that John's most famous argument was to create " good trouble, " that is, not to avoid provoking trouble for the sake of justice.
John applied to Troy University in Troy, Alabama, where he was born, but Troy University, then an all-white school, rejected his application.
John Lewis, who preached the Gospel to chickens on his farm as a child, eventually earned a degree in religion and philosophy from Fisk University.
Years later, the University of Troy awarded Lewis an honorary doctorate.
Senator Doug Jones from Alabama said the current protesters were " protesting peacefully and non-violently, " as Lewis did in the civil rights movement.
Jones said: " Even if President Trump hit a boat and described all the protesters as a mob, he was wrong.
The protesters are patriots who want the United States to move towards a more egalitarian country. "
A six-day series of events to commemorate Lewis will culminate this week at a funeral in Georgia.
Lewis's coffin was parked at a public memorial service at the University of Troy on Saturday to pay tribute to the civil rights pioneer.
Later Saturday, a private ceremony paid tribute to him in a chapel in Selma, Alabama, followed by a public memorial service.
On Sunday, Lewis's body will pass through the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma.
In 1965, he and protesters demanding black voting rights were severely beaten in front of the bridge by Alabama police, who also fired tear gas at protesters.
Lewis was almost killed at the time.
This day later became known as " Bloody Sunday. "
Lewis's body will be transported to Montgomery, the capital of Alabama.
Mayor Steven Reed encouraged people to line up on the sidewalk to complete the final journey with Lewis.
Meanwhile, officials asked the public to wear face masks and maintain social distance when participating in the activities.
Alabama Governor Kay Ivey ordered the flag to be flown at half-mast on Saturday and Sunday in honor of Lewis.
During the nearly week-long commemoration, Lewis's body will be placed at the Alabama State Capitol in Montgomery, the Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta, and the United States Capitol in Washington.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced last week that people could come to the United States Capitol on Monday and Tuesday to pay tribute to Lewis.
A public event in memory of Lewis will be held outdoors due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The standard was improved to build a battle fortress.
Grass-roots Party organizations are not only an important part of the grass-roots governance system, but also an important carrier to demonstrate governance ability.
To promote the standardized construction of grass-roots Party organizations, we should start by grasping the regulations on the work of Party branches, focus on issues such as the weakening and nullification of Party leadership, and consolidate the foundation, complement each other and promote development by establishing an up-and-down linkage mechanism, innovating the form of setting up branches, normalizing and rectifying the weak and weak, establishing and improving the decision-making and deliberation mechanism, and serving the masses.

Koxili Tibetan antelope enters the migration season - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, July 25 (Reporter Wang Jinjin) The reporter learned from the Wudaoliang Protection Station of the Kao Xili Management Office of the Changyuan Park of the Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration that the monitoring showed that the Tibetan antelope who had migrated to the Zhuonai Lake area in the hinterland of Kao Xili were gradually ending giving birth and began to bring their babies back to their original habitat.
Surveillance footage near the Wudaoliang Protection Station shows that on July 25, about 40 female Tibetan antelope and three Tibetan antelope cubs passed through 3002 km of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway and the Wudao Liangbei Bridge of the Qinghai-Tibet Railway. The Tibetan antelope has begun to move back.
According to experts, in recent years, the number of Tibetan antelope cubs in the migrating sheep accounted for one-quarter to one-fifth of the total Tibetan antelope population.
Lian Xinming, an associate researcher at the Institute of Northwest Plateau Biology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said, " At the beginning of the migration, the Tibetan antelope faces a higher risk of being hunted, so the number of cubs in the sheep will be relatively small, and there may even be no cubs. "
According to the statistics of the Koxili Management Office of the Changyuan Park of the Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration, the overall number of Tibetan antelope migrations is increasing year by year, and the number of Tibetan antelope migrations in 2019 was 4,860, an increase of 338 over 2018.
Lian Xinming said: " It is expected that the return migration of Tibetan antelope will end in early September this year, and the number of Tibetan antelope is still expected to continue to increase. "
The Tibetan antelope is a protected animal at the national level.
At the end of May every year, Tibetan antelopes from Sanjiangyuan in Qinghai, Qiangtang in Tibet and AlJinshan in Xinjiang go to Zhuonai Lake in the hinterland of Koxili to lay lambs.
Wu Xiaomin, an expert on the protection of the Tibetan antelope in China and a researcher at the Shaanxi Provincial Zoological Research Institute (Northwest Institute of Endangered Animals), said, " The migration of the Tibetan antelope is a process in which the female Tibetan antelope returns to their habitat with their cubs after giving birth. At first, the returning population leaving the breeding site is relatively large, but then the Tibetan antelope will return to their respective habitats according to different geographical populations and along different paths. "
In order to ensure the safe relocation of the Tibetan antelope population, the reporter learned that the Koxili Management Office of Changyuan Park of the Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration has arranged staff to continuously carry out video monitoring and district patrols in the main relocation areas.
If a herd of Tibetan antelope is found trying to cross the road, the mountain patrol team will carry out temporary traffic control at the first time to allow the sheep to pass safely through the wildlife passage, so as to ensure that they are subject to as little human interference as possible on the way back.
So, how to relieve the heat in daily life?
Experts suggest that going out in the summer should try to avoid the hot time, and it is best not to walk or work in the hot sun around noon, because the sun is strongest during this period and the possibility of heatstroke is higher.

Clothes should try to choose cotton, hemp and silk textures with light color and good air permeability, and wear less chemical fiber clothing, so as to avoid timely heat dissipation when sweating a lot, causing heatstroke.
In hot and sultry weather, you should prepare enough water to drink, drink it in time, and do not wait until you are thirsty to drink water, because once you feel thirsty means that your body is already short of water, drink water from 150 ml to 200 ml each time, drink warm water, do not drink ice water.
According to the temperature, ordinary people drink 1.5 to 2 liters of water per day, while high-temperature workers drink 3 to 5 liters of water per day.
Sweat more can be appropriate to supplement some salt water to make up for the loss of salt due to sweat.
In addition, the human body is prone to potassium deficiency in summer, which makes people feel tired and tired. Potassium-containing tea is an excellent summer drink.
Eat more fruits and vegetables with high water content in summer, such as lettuce, cucumbers and tomatoes; fresh fruits, such as peaches, apricots, watermelon and melon, have a water content of 80% to 90%, which can be used to replenish water; dairy products can both replenish water and meet the nutritional needs of the body.
In addition, people working in a high temperature environment should properly supplement drinks containing elements such as potassium and magnesium.
Summer days and nights are short, the temperature is high, human metabolism is strong, consumption is also large, easy to feel fatigue.
Adequate sleep can relax the brain and body systems, which is not only conducive to work and study, but also a measure to prevent heatstroke.
Experts say that the best time to go to bed is from 22: 00 to 23: 00 and the best time to get up is from 5: 30 to 6: 30.
When sleeping, be careful not to lie under the air-conditioning outlet and electric fan, so as not to suffer from air-conditioning disease and hot cold.
Experts suggest that people who are outdoors or working at high temperatures can carry anti-heat drugs such as ten drops of water, Rendan, Patchouli Zhengqi water or Patchouli Zhengqi pills with them, or place them in nearby workplaces for use at any time to prevent heatstroke.

Australian University to develop a new drug is expected to be used to treat vascular blockage caused by COVID-19 - Xinhua News
Xinhua News Agency, Sydney, July 26 (Reporter Chen Yu) Researchers at Monash University in Australia are developing a new drug to help prevent heart disease and stroke and hope it can be used to treat blood vessel blockages caused by the COVID-19 virus.
The researchers found that an enzyme in platelets accelerates platelet clotting before a heart attack or stroke.
As a result, they developed a drug that can temporarily inhibit platelet coagulation, thus avoiding blockage of blood vessels and preventing heart disease and stroke.
Researchers say the drug only inhibits the clotting effect of platelets when there are signs of a heart attack or stroke.
As studies have shown that similar vascular blockage is one of the main causes of death in COVID-19 patients, the researchers hope the drug can be used to treat such patients in the future.
At present, the drug has achieved good results in animal model experiments, and the researchers are preparing for the next phase of human clinical trials.
The research results have been published in the American journal Science and Translational Medicine.
He became the first audience to enter the CBA League replay to allow spectators to watch the game live.
On the same day, during the second phase of the 2019-2020 Chinese Men's Basketball Professional League (CBA) replay (Laoshan Division) held in Qingdao, Shandong Province, medical staff, teachers and members of the public security front entered to watch the match between Shanghai Jiushi Team and Shandong Xiwang Team after completing the relevant procedures including nucleic acid testing through the official ticketing platform.
During the viewing period, spectators are required to wear masks throughout the process, sit in the right number, and strictly keep their seats one meter apart.
When leaving the scene, the audience should leave the scene in order to keep the " one-meter line " social distance in an orderly manner.
Xinjiang Deeply Develop " Sunflower Field " and Use Clean Energy - NEWS
2020-07-26 15: 43: 42 Source: China News Network Author: Chen Haifeng Executive Editor: Chen Haifeng
China News Service, Xinjiang Hami, July 26 - Question: Xinjiang deeply cultivate " sunflower fields " to use clean energy
More than 6,000 pentagonal heliostats, each of 48 square meters, are neatly arranged in a circle, such as a silver " sunflower field, " which rotates with the sun and reflects sunlight to a heat absorption tower more than 200 meters high in the center to generate electricity.
On the 25th, the reporter saw this scene at the Hami molten salt tower photothermal power station of the CLP project in Maohu Town, Yiwu County, Hami City, Xinjiang.
" The so-called molten salt tower photothermal power generation is to centrally reflect sunlight through the mirror to the heat absorption tower to form thermal energy, and then convert thermal energy into electrical energy through traditional power generation technology. "
Zhang Yong, deputy general manager of CLP Hami Solar Thermal Power Co., Ltd, said that the design principle is similar to the solar stoves used in rural areas in northwest China.
The power plant started construction in October 2017 and was connected to the grid at the end of last year, covering an area of 6,600 acres, with a total of 14,500 heliostats planned to be installed.
" Compared with traditional solar power generation technology, its biggest advantage is that it can store the accumulated heat energy and generate electricity at night. "
Zhang Yong said that the 13-hour heat storage system configured in the project can enable the generator set to maintain continuous and stable operation without being affected by light changes. It can also quickly participate in power grid peak regulation according to the peak and valley demand of power grid load.
When fully completed, the project will generate 198 million degrees of electricity per year, save more than 60,000 tons of standard coal per year, reduce emissions by more than 60 tons of sulphur dioxide, more than 60 tons of nitrogen oxides, about 20 tons of soot and more than 150,000 tons of carbon dioxide, and provide a steady stream of clean energy for the region.
In addition, there is another silver " sunflower field " in the Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park in Hami City.
The Hamifer Solar Photovoltaic Power Station covers an area of more than 2,300 hectares. The 714 power generation equipment that has been built also rotates with the sun, always keeping the sunlight at a 90-degree right angle with the concentrated panel.
" We adopt two-axis tracking concentrated power generation technology. Through unified integrated control, all power generation equipment will adjust the angle according to the solar height to maintain power generation efficiency. "
Duan Mengqi, headmaster of the power station, said that under well-lit weather conditions, the power generation technology can increase the efficiency of traditional photovoltaic power generation by about 20%.
In the first half of this year, the power station has generated more than 7 million degrees of electricity, supplementing local electricity demand.
Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park is currently a photovoltaic industry demonstration park with the largest single unit and the most complete types of photovoltaic modules in Xinjiang, with a total of 38 photovoltaic power generation projects with a total installed capacity of 820,000 kilowatts.
More than 110 million kilowatts of electricity were generated in the first half of this year, an increase of 6% over the same period in 2019.
Hami is one of the best solar energy resources in China.
The annual average total solar radiation is more than 6,200 megajoules per square meter, with about 3,200 hours of sunshine throughout the year.
In recent years, the city has vigorously developed the photovoltaic industry and planted " sunflower fields. "
A solar power generation scale with an installed capacity of more than 2.5 million kilowatts has been built, and the city's photovoltaic power generation exceeded 1.4 billion degrees in the first half of this year, a year-on-year increase of about 14%.
At present, there are more than 330 grid-connected photovoltaic power stations in Xinjiang, with an installed capacity of over 10 million kilowatts.
Photovoltaic power generation is expected to reach 15 billion degrees this year, which can replace more than 6 million tons of standard coal.
Police report that " female university students travel to Qinghai missing " details of the search and rescue work continues - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, July 26 (Reporter Wang Jin Zhou Zhe) Recently, " a female university student lost contact after traveling to Golmud, Qinghai Province " attracted the attention of netizens.
The Public Security Bureau of Germu City, Haixi Mongolian and Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, reported on the 26th that Huang Yue, a student of a university in Nanjing, is still missing, and many police officers are going deep into the areas along which Huang Yue lost contact and actively searching for work.
On July 10, 2020, the Public Security Detachment of the Public Security Bureau of Golmud City, Haixi Province received notification from superiors that a certain Huang, a student from a university in Nanjing, took the Z164 train from Nanjing to Golmud on July 5. On July 9, his mobile phone was shut down and lost contact in the southwest area of Qingshui River, Sonandajie Protection Station, Qumalai County, Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province.
According to the investigation by the Golmud City Public Security Bureau, Huang entered the territory of Qinghai Province at 19: 54 on July 6 and arrived in Golmud City at 4: 00 on July 7.
At 8: 00 on the same day, the missing person Huang took a taxi from the Yellow River Hotel in Golmud City towards the G109 National Road, and arrived at Koxili Sonandajie Protection Station at 12: 00. The taxi driver returned alone. Huang went to the Qingshui River area near Dasonandajie Protection Station at 15: 00 on the 7th until he was shut down in the area at 18: 00 on the 9th.
In further investigation, the police found that Huang had passed through the Naijigou checkpoint at 17: 07 on July 13.
The Naijigou Checkpoint is a checkpoint set up by Nagqu City of the Tibet Autonomous Region at the South Pass of Golmud City. Since there is no video surveillance at the checkpoint, it is impossible to determine the information of himself and the vehicle he is travelling on, the police can only search by car along the way, and coordinate that if Huang is found at all checkpoints along the way in Tibet, they should immediately contact the Golmud City Public Security Bureau.
According to the latest information, at 1: 00 a.m. on July 26, the Golmud City Public Security Bureau organized rescue forces to carry rescue equipment to search for the frozen spring protection station and Sonandajie protection station along the Qinghai-Tibet Highway, and actively contacted the Sichuan police, the Tibet police and the Nanjing police to carry out joint work. At present, the search and rescue work is still continuing.
The local police hope that the majority of netizens and people from all walks of life will provide relevant clues to the Golmud police and the Nanjing Jiangning police in a timely manner, so as to find the missing person Huang Yue as soon as possible.
At the same time, relevant experts suggested that tourists should be standardized, rational and civilized in outdoor activities, always pay attention to roadside warning signs, do not risk entering no man's land, encounter unexpected situations, and call the police in a timely manner.
The news media uncovered the truth that the US unjustifiably demanded that China close its Consulate General in Houston - Xinhua News

The news media uncovered the truth that the US unjustifiably demanded that China close the Consulate General in Houston
On the 24th, the Chinese Foreign Ministry informed the US Embassy in China that China decided to revoke the permission for the establishment and operation of the US Consulate General in Chengdu and put forward specific requirements for the Consulate General to stop all business and activities, as a countermeasure to the sudden request of the US to close the Chinese Consulate General in Houston on the 21st.
This behavior of the US government has attracted a lot of attention, and its political motives have been questioned by foreign media and scholars.
Why ask China to close the Consulate General?
Several foreign media said that it was not clear why the United States would choose the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, but as to the purpose of the move, the foreign media said bluntly: for the sake of the general election.
CNN reported on August 23 that the move of the US to ask China to close the Consulate General in Houston has raised questions about its political motives.
The article said that the US government's disastrous response to the COVID-19 pandemic caused President Donald Trump's low support in public opinion polls before the election.
White House officials said privately that the tough strategy against China was to save Trump's approval ratings and to shift responsibility for the failure of the White House's response to the epidemic.
The article argued that the Chinese Consulate General in Houston was a " politically driven and very cautious " target chosen by the United States, and that the US government chose it " to create a tough attitude while avoiding the risk of causing major conflict. "
The BBC also believes that as the US election season approaches and the US economy is severely hit by the epidemic, Trump believes that " playing the' China card' has a political advantage. "
The current situation is " a spiral and tit-for-tat struggle, " which is partly driven by the US government from the perspective of domestic considerations and will only worsen the tensions between China and the United States.
CBS reported that Trump's prospects for re-election were under pressure because of the outbreak, and he repeatedly blamed China for the outbreak.
Almost every day, the United States takes new action against Trump's absurd claim that " China is exploiting the United States. "
" The Consulate General of Houston is very important in establishing ties between the two countries "
The Associated Press commented that the US demand for China to close its Consulate General in Houston has heightened tensions between the world's two largest economies.
If the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is closed, in addition to the diplomatic influence, Chinese citizens located in the southern United States face difficulties in obtaining consular services, as do US citizens seeking visas and other services.
A business group in Houston expressed regret over the US request that China close the Consulate General in Houston, saying that the Consulate General has played an important role in establishing trade, investment and cultural ties between the two countries.
The Associated Press believes that this reflects the importance of China's economy.
According to the US Foreign Policy magazine website, the US move " is part of a series of provocative measures that will only worsen China-US relations. "
Reuters quoted Jonathan Pollack, an expert on East Asia at the Brookings Institution, an American think tank, as saying that he could not think of any move comparable to the US action against the Chinese Consulate General in Houston since the United States and China established full diplomatic relations in 1979.
Hong Kong's South China Morning Post reported that the US move was unprecedented in more than 40 years of diplomatic relations between China and the United States.
Analysts believe that this move could cause lasting damage.
The Chinese Consulate General in Houston was established in 1979 and is the first Chinese Consulate General to open in the United States.
At present, China has one embassy and five consulates in the United States.

Spokesperson of the Embassy in the UK: The Chinese government is a staunch defender of cyber security - New News
Xinhua News (July 26) According to the website of the Chinese Embassy in the UK, the spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in the UK answered questions on the wrong remarks about cyber attacks on July 25.
The spokesman stressed that the Chinese government is a staunch defender of cyber security and has always firmly opposed and cracked down on any form of cyber attacks and cybercrime.
A reporter asked: According to the media, hacker organizations related to China have interfered with the network system of a British company, attacked Anglo-American technology companies with patent data, and invaded the government networks of EU countries.
The spokesman said that the Chinese government is a staunch defender of cyber security and has always firmly opposed and cracked down on any form of cyber attacks and cybercrime.
Cyberspace is highly virtual, difficult to trace, and has a variety of actors. Adequate evidence should be produced when investigating and characterizing cyber incidents, and there should be no unwarranted speculation.
The spokesman said that a series of incidents such as the " Prism Gate " in the past proved that the United States has been conducting the largest cyber theft operation in the world.
Maintaining peace and stability in cyberspace serves the common interests of all countries.
The speaker pointed out that China's achievements in scientific and technological innovation were not stolen or stolen, but were achieved through self-reliance and hard work.
In 2019, China filed about 59,000 patent applications through the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), with an annual growth rate of 10.6%.
China has become a major country in innovation and intellectual property rights.
According to data from the Urumqi Central Branch of the People's Bank of China, in the first half of the year, new loans to agriculture and small and micro enterprises in Xinjiang exceeded the full-year increase in 2019.
In the first half of this year, the Urumqi central branch of the People's Bank of China used a variety of monetary policy tools to guide the banking industry to continuously increase its lending efforts, providing sufficient funds for epidemic prevention and control and the resumption of production.
Free Nucleic Acid Testing in Urumqi Most districts have basically completed secondary testing in high-risk areas - New Network
Xinhua News, Urumqi, July 26 (Reporter Sun Tingwen Zhao Yamin) Zhang Wei, director of the National Health Commission of Urumqi, said in his briefing on the latest epidemic and nucleic acid testing in Urumqi on July 26 that, at present, the free nucleic acid testing work in most districts of Urumqi has been basically completed.
The expert group of the State Council and experts from the autonomous region and Urumqi are further assessing the development of the epidemic based on the results of nucleic acid detection and epidemiological survey.
The Press Office of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region held a press conference on the 26th to report on the epidemic and prevention and control situation in Xinjiang.
According to him, from 00: 00 to 24: 00 on July 25, Urumqi added 22 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 pneumonia (including 5 cases of asymptomatic patients) and 38 new cases of asymptomatic patients.
As of 2400 hours on July 25, there were 135 confirmed cases and 147 asymptomatic cases in Urumqi.
The new asymptomatic infections on the 25th were basically screened through the city's free nucleic acid testing and active screening.
Zhang Wei, director of the National Health Commission of Urumqi, said on the 26th that the free nucleic acid testing work in most districts of Urumqi has been basically completed.
He also said that from the experience of other regions in China, there are many factors that affect the nucleic acid test results, such as the sensitivity of the detection reagent, the infection time and detoxification time of the tested person, the cooperation of the tested person when the specimen is taken (the poor cooperation degree may lead to the specimen not being taken in place), as well as the testing environment and the operational proficiency of the inspectors.
Nucleic acid tests also show false negative results for a variety of reasons.
The so-called false negative means that the person tested is indeed infected, but the nucleic acid test result is negative.
In addition, people who have been in close contact with confirmed and suspected cases usually need two nucleic acid tests to be ruled out.
For people who have been to high-risk areas in the epidemic, if they have fever and respiratory symptoms, one negative nucleic acid test may be false negative, so two nucleic acid tests are needed to rule out.
He said that in view of the above situation, and for the sake of the physical health of the people of all ethnic groups in the city, from today, Urumqi will conduct two free nucleic acid tests in key areas such as Tianshan District and Shaibak District.
It is reported that Tianshan District and Shaibak District are high-risk epidemic areas.

White House epidemic expert Forge: cautiously optimistic about the development of a vaccine in early 2021
Forge made the above remarks at an online video conference hosted by the International Leadership Foundation on the 25th.
He warned that it is not clear how the COVID-19 pandemic will develop in autumn and winter, or what the final impact of the epidemic will be. " The only way to end all this is for each of us to choose to be part of the solution. "
According to the data of Johns Hopkins University, as of 21: 00 on the 25th, there were 4,176,000 confirmed cases and 146,000 deaths in the United States.
Forge said that some parts of the United States are struggling with the rebound epidemic.
Although local epidemics are different and local response plans are needed, diversified strategies to combat the epidemic do not mean that there is no close connection between regions.
An outbreak in one region will eventually affect other regions.
" This is not the time for complacency, " Forge said. " Our work is not finished. We must intensify our efforts and remain vigilant about the uncertainty of the future. "
He Dayi, a Chinese-American medical expert and founder of " cocktail therapy " for the treatment of AIDS, pointed out at the meeting that the US COVID-19 pandemic has not yet reached its peak.
" Each of us must do our part to slow the spread of the virus. "
He called on the public to use their own practical actions to buy time for scientists to step up research and development of COVID-19 therapeutic drugs and vaccines.
The International Leadership Foundation is a non-profit organization that aims to promote international exchange activities in the United States and the Asia-Pacific region. It is committed to enhancing the status of Asia-Pacific Americans and cultivating international young leaders.
On the same day, US Secretary of Transportation Zhao Xiaolan, US Representative Meng Zhaowen and Founding President of the International Leadership Foundation Dong Jiling spoke at the meeting respectively.
They paid special tribute to the Asia-Pacific medical workers and volunteers on the front line in the fight against the epidemic, and called on the American public to continue to adhere to epidemic prevention guidelines such as " social distance " to curb the spread of the epidemic.

Brazilian study shows that hydroxycloquinine is ineffective in the treatment of mild and moderate COVID-19 pneumonia.
Recently, a Brazilian study showed that hydroxychloroquine was ineffective in patients with mild and moderate COVID-19 pneumonia.
The study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
Researchers in Pakistan divided 667 patients from 55 hospitals across the country into three groups and conducted clinical trials. They mainly compared the therapeutic effects of hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with other antibiotics azithromycin, and analyzed whether it could help improve the condition of patients with mild and moderate COVID-19 pneumonia.
The results show that hydroxychloroquine not only has no therapeutic effect, but may have damaging side effects on organs.
The study was carried out jointly by several authoritative Brazilian hospitals such as Hospital Israel Albert Einstein, Heart Hospital (HCor), Hospital Sírio-Libanês, the Brazilian Clinical Institute (BCRI) and the Brazilian Intensive Care Research Network (BRICNet).
On the 25th local time, Brazilian President Bossonaro announced through social networking platforms that the fourth nucleic acid test result was negative.
Bossonaro has been taking hydroxychloroquine during the infection and has been actively promoted several times.

On the 25th, the 2020 Hunan Red Tourism Culture Festival and the first Xiangtan Red Cultural Industry Expo opened in Shaoshan.
In recent years, the demand for red tourism has gradually increased.
However, the development of red tourism industry also faces difficulties such as a small number of young groups, homogeneity of tour projects and a single commercial channel.
In particular, this year's outbreak has caused a serious setback to the national cultural and tourism industry, and red tourist attractions are also facing serious challenges.
For example, the use of scientific and technological means such as drone shooting and VR immersion experience can meet the tourist needs of tourists who " people have not arrived and the scenery has arrived "; the introduction of live webcasting means to promote the famous and special products of the red scenic spots can directly enhance the economic benefits of red tourism; the introduction of " cloud " technology to create a boutique exhibition with prominent themes, clear orientation and rich connotation to fully demonstrate and enhance the propaganda and educational function of the red scenic spots; innovate the mode of dissemination of red culture to make revolutionary cultural relics " alive, " make red tourism popular, let the red genes pass on, and enhance the attractiveness of the red scenic spots.
This cultural festival uses the popular method of " special promotion of county and county (district) leaders + professional anchors " to promote red cultural tourism products, and uses 5G technology to provide real-time viewing and smart city demonstration services to promote red cultural tourism attractions. These are all attempts to insert smart wings for red tourism, and expect Hunan red tourism to become more and more prosperous.
Representatives of China-US trade talks met in August
On the 25th, Hong Kong's South China Morning Post quoted an anonymous person familiar with the matter as reporting that the head of China's trade negotiation team, Vice Premier Liu He of the State Council, and the co-leader of the US team and trade representative Lai Haizhe are expected to hold formal talks in August to assess the implementation of the first phase of the China-US trade agreement.
The report said that although China has significantly increased its purchases of US agricultural products in the past few months, due to factors such as the virus epidemic, China's purchases are still some distance from the amount promised in the trade agreement.
Analysts say the recent US-China closure of each other's consulates, along with other disputes, could undermine any progress in trade between the two sides.
The first phase of the China-US trade agreement came into effect one month after it was signed on January 15. The agreement stipulates that the high-level trade framework group of the two sides should meet every six months.
People familiar with the matter said the meeting would be " an important turning point " for both sides to assess the progress of the agreement.
However, this person also said that if tensions between the US and China lead to a lack of willingness for talks at this time, the two sides may agree that the conference call between Lai Haizhe and Liu He on May 8 has already met the semi-annual terms of the trade agreement.
Since the beginning of this year, China-US relations have deteriorated rapidly, with disputes between the two sides including the origin of the COVID-19 virus, trade, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, the South China Sea and ideology.
US President Donald Trump boasted about his achievements in the first phase of the agreement at the beginning of the year, but his attitude has changed recently.
He said at the White House press conference on August 23 that although China has recently purchased a record number of American corn in one day and bought a lot of soybeans, " this trade agreement is not as meaningful to me as it was when it was reached. "
An anonymous Beijing government adviser also said that a new round of trade talks is unlikely due to the poor relationship between China and the US, and that " trade issues have lost weight in China-US relations. "
However, he revealed that China's economic and trade-related units still met on the 23rd to discuss a series of issues, including how to increase imports from the United States. " We have tried our best to buy, so any additional purchases will be difficult. "
Peng Jining, vice-president of the National Committee on US-China Trade, said that maintaining the momentum of the first phase of the agreement was " more important than ever " and said that China had made progress in further opening up its financial markets to US companies this year.
An analyst at Plenum, an independent research firm, said: " It's better to talk than not to talk, although it may only be seen as routine. "
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26 (Reporter Wei Yukun) The reporter learned from the Emergency Management Department on July 26 that the State Crime Prevention Office and the Emergency Management Department, together with the State Food and Material Reserve Bureau, once again urgently dispatched 1.35 million woven bags, 1.2 million square meters of woven fabric, 130,000 square meters of geotextiles and other six types of central reserve flood control materials to Anhui to support the anti-flood rescue and rescue work in Anhui.
According to the relevant person in charge of the emergency management department, at present, the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the Huaihe River basin maintain high water level fluctuations, and the " Yangtze River 2020 No. 3 flood " formed in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River on the 26th, increasing risks in some areas.
The meteorological department expects heavy rainfall in Chongqing, Guizhou and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in the next three days, and the flood control situation remains severe and complex.
According to reports, since the onset of the flood, the emergency management department has deployed national comprehensive fire and rescue teams to pre-position professional rescue forces in key flood control areas, participated in 10,364 anti-flood rescue and rescue cases, dispatched more than 130,000 soldiers, 17,778 fire trucks and 11,887 boats, rescued 37,777 people in distress, and evacuated and transferred more than 107,000 trapped people.
Hao Yusheng, chief representative of NASDAQ China: Now is the best time for Chinese companies to IPO in the US
Zhang Bin, a reporter from the Economic Observer Network, because of the coffee fraud incident, the US market has imposed stricter supervision on CPC stocks, coupled with the long-term pressure on valuation and the pressure on CPC stocks listed in the United States, NetEase, Jingdong and other CPC stocks have recently started their journey back to Hong Kong for listing.
And the recent shell, ideal car and other companies, the enthusiasm for listing in the United States is high.
Under the epidemic and the stock crisis, is this the best time for Chinese companies to list in the United States?
" With regard to the recent IPO cases and the subsequent listing of companies in the United States, the IPO in the United States has not been affected in essence. Instead, the market is very good now, and even now this time is the best time for Chinese companies to IPO in the United States in the past 10 years. "
Hao Yusheng, China's chief representative of the NASDAQ Stock Exchange, said at the " 2020 Listed Companies Leaders Summit " hosted by Snowball.
In April this year, the US Securities and Futures Commission (SEC) and the US Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) issued a " Statement on Audit Quality and the Important Role of Regulatory Access to Audit and Other International Information - A Discussion on the Current Challenges of Access to Information for US Listed Companies with Large Business in China. "
The statement said that despite the significant increase in international cooperation and coordination in recent years, the US regulatory authorities still have problems in obtaining information, and the SEC and PCAOB still face legal and practical challenges. In contrast to the document, the PCAOB website provides a detailed list of listed companies that have encountered auditing obstacles and their auditing institutions, with a large number of medium-sized stock companies listed.
In addition, in May this year, the US Senate passed the Foreign Corporate Accountability Act, which imposes additional information disclosure requirements on the listing of foreign companies in the US.
In Hao Yusheng's view, the Zhongbao stock crisis did not affect the appetite of investors.
" When the news first came out, it caused panic among everyone, and everyone was asking whether they could go to the US for listing in the future, but later we found out that these issues were not a matter for investors. Investors might ask these questions during the recent US IPO roadshow, or even become a standardized issue, but this was not taken by investors as an important factor in investing in or not investing in a Chinese company.
It is suggested that everyone should try to look at the current situation with an ordinary mind.
Of course, this may appear to be the most serious situation in the past two years, but in terms of investors' appetite, it has not been affected.
So the upsurge of IPOs in the US will continue between now and the end of this year or before the US general election. "
On May 9 this year, Jinshan Cloud was officially listed on the NASDAQ, becoming the first Chinese company to make an IPO in the United States after the outbreak.
" The listing of Jinshan Cloud gives great confidence to the Chinese companies that are preparing for an IPO. "
Hao Yusheng said.
The overall stock data report released by Snowball in the first half of 2020 shows that in the first half of this year, a total of 20 Chinese companies made IPOs in the United States, an increase of 17.6% compared to the same period last year. Judging from the total initial fund-raising, 20 companies raised a total of 2.725 billion yuan, an increase of more than 52.4% compared to the same period last year. In terms of industry distribution, the number of IPOs in the healthcare industry was outstanding in the first half of this year, an increase of 100% compared to the same period last year.
According to Hao Yusheng, the Chinese companies that IPO in the United States in the first half of this year are of high quality, and high-quality companies with strong fundamentals and growth will be more favored by investors.
In the short, medium and long term, Hao Yusheng continues to be optimistic about Ming China's IPO in the United States.
" In the short term, the upsurge of IPOs in the United States is still going on; in the medium term, Chinese companies have more choices, A shares, Hong Kong stocks and U.S. stocks, and everyone will take the US election and China-US relations as consideration factors in market choice and timing; in the long run, everything will return to normal, and market fluctuations are cyclical, with both political and economic cycles, and will eventually return to the normal stage, and the stock market has always been volatile. "
Hao Yusheng also said, " There are many uncertain factors this year, but for high-quality companies, whether the market is good or bad, as long as they are solid and have growth that investors can see, other factors are relatively secondary. Investors need to invest in excellent Chinese companies. "

Commentator of People's Daily: Concentrate on Doing Your Own Business to Build New Advantages for Future Development--On Learning and Implementing the Important Speech by General Secretary Xi Jinping at the Entrepreneurs' Symposium - Xinhua News
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 25 - People's Daily, July 26 Commentator's article: Focus on doing your own things well and build new advantages for future development
At present, the global epidemic and the world economic situation remain grim and complex, and the challenges facing China's development are unprecedented.
Maintaining strategic concentration, enhancing winning confidence and concentrating on doing our own things well is the key for us to cope with various risks and challenges.
At the entrepreneurs' symposium held recently, General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed that under the current external environment of rising protectionism, the world economic downturn and the shrinking global market, we must concentrate our efforts on doing our own things well, give full play to the advantages of the domestic ultra-large-scale market, gradually form a new development pattern with the domestic big cycle as the main body and the domestic and international double loop mutually reinforce each other, raise the modernization level of the industrial chain supply chain, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation, speed up the research of key core technologies, and create new advantages for future development.
He who examines the situation is wise, and he who controls the situation wins.
Under the external environment of the in-depth development of economic globalization, the market and resources have played an important role in China's rapid development.
Now, the world under the impact of the epidemic is undergoing profound changes, facing more unstable and uncertain factors, and economic globalization is encountering headwinds and back waves.
Make ideological and work preparations to cope with the changes in the external environment for a long time, and promote China's economy to take advantage of the wind and waves and make steady progress. An extremely important aspect is to take expanding and meeting domestic demand as the strategic basis for development, give full play to its own advantages, add impetus to China's economic development and drive the recovery of the world economy by flourishing the domestic economy and unimpeded domestic circulation.
We should deeply realize that building a complete domestic demand system is related to China's long-term development and long-term stability.
The CPC Central Committee took stock of the situation and made clear the firm implementation of the strategy of expanding domestic demand, which is the need to cope with the impact of the epidemic, to maintain the long-term sustained and healthy development of China's economy, and to meet the growing and better life of the people.
The advantage of large economies is that they are internally recyclable.
With the world's most complete and largest industrial system, strong production capacity and perfect supporting capabilities, China has more than 100 million market players and more than 170 million talents with higher education or various professional skills, as well as an ultra-large-scale domestic demand market formed by 1.4 billion people, including more than 400 million middle-income groups, and is at the stage of rapid development of new-type industrialization, informatization, urbanization and agricultural modernization, with great potential for investment demand.
Public ownership is the main body, the economy with multiple forms of ownership develops together, distribution according to work is the main body, and various forms of distribution coexist. The socialist basic economic system, such as the socialist market economic system, cannot only stimulate the vitality of various market players, emancipate and develop social productive forces, but also promote the organic unity of efficiency, fairness and continuously achieve common prosperity.
We should firmly grasp the strategic base point of expanding domestic demand, make production, distribution and circulation rely more on the domestic market to achieve a virtuous circle, clarify the strategic direction of supply-side structural reform, and promote a dynamic balance between total supply and aggregate demand at a higher level.
We should accelerate the construction of a complete domestic demand system, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation and innovation in other areas, accelerate the promotion of strategic emerging industries such as the digital economy, smart manufacturing, life and health, and new materials, form more new growth points and growth poles, and gradually form a new development pattern with the domestic big cycle as the main body and the domestic and international double loop mutually reinforce each other.
Opening-up brings progress, and closure is bound to lag behind.
General Secretary Xi Jinping has repeatedly stressed that China's open door will not be closed, but will only open wider and wider.
Taking the domestic cycle as the main body is not to operate behind closed doors, but to achieve stronger and more sustainable development by giving full play to the potential of domestic demand, better connecting domestic and international markets, and making better use of both international and domestic markets and resources.
At the same time, there is no contradiction between expanding domestic demand and opening-up. The smoother the domestic cycle, the more conducive it is to building a new pattern of opening-up and forming new advantages in participating in international cooperation and competition.
Although the trend of protectionism is on the rise in the world, we should stand on the right side of history, deepen reform and opening-up, strengthen open cooperation in the field of science and technology, promote the building of an open world economy and promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.

Balance treasure income down " after 90 " but " revenge " to save money?
With the balance treasure income down, " after 90 " not only did not escape the balance treasure, but began to " revenge " to save money?
The " Report on Saving Money after Balance Bao 90 " (2020 edition) recently released by the China Institute of New Economic Research and Alipay shows that in the first half of the year, " after 90 " prefer to save money: the amount of money saved per capita is nearly 40% higher than in 2019.
Interestingly, " after 90 " is more inclined to save from a single piece of " small money, " and 60% of the average amount of money saved is less than 20 yuan...
Saving money with balance treasure has also become a " post-90 " saving habit.
The data show that out of the 700 million balance treasure users, 134 million users are " after 90. "
There are 174 million " post-90 " in China. In other words, about three out of every four " post-90 " in China are saving money with their balance.
At present, the 7-day annualized yield of Balance Bao and other IMF funds has fallen to about 1.5% from above 2% at the beginning of the year.
Even so, it did not affect the pace of saving money " after 90. "
Under the background of the improvement of the " saving effect " of balance treasure, many young people who are accustomed to using balance treasure are also directly transformed into " basic people. "
Alipay data show that as of July 13, the number of new " basic people " on Alipay has more than doubled year on year in the past month, and more and more young people have achieved " advanced " financial management on Alipay.
Some analysts believe that the flow of funds from the balance treasure into the stock market was also an important reason for the clear decline in the IMF share in June.
The report also shows that " post-90 " girls are more likely to save more money, on average 20% more than boys. Among the users who hold funds on the Alipay platform, 60% are men, and women tend to choose a more stable way of financial management than men.
After saving money, what are the plans for " After 90 "?
Alipay data show that " after 90 " has the habit of saving money for the target, with the largest number of users taking travel as the target of saving money.
Affected by the epidemic, many " post-90 " saved money to prepare for travel after the epidemic. The reopening of cinemas also provided a new way to move from saving money to consumption.

On the same day, Martin Andanal assured the public that PCOO would continue to perform its duties to the people of the Philippines, ensure the timely provision of important information to the public, and strengthen contact tracking and detection in order to avoid further spread of the COVID-19 virus among PCOO staff.

France increases military investment in space - Xinhuanet
French Defense Minister Florence Palley said on the 24th that France will increase its space defense budget by hundreds of millions of euros and develop space military forces in order to prevent " unfriendly moves " that other countries may make in outer space.
Palley told Le Provence on the same day that between 2019 and 2025, the expenditure budget for French space military projects will increase from the previously proposed 3.6 billion euros (about 4.2 billion US dollars) to 4.3 billion euros (5 billion US dollars).
According to the French Military Planning Act 2019-2025, approved by the French Parliament in 2018, France is expected to upgrade its existing observation and communication satellites, launch three electromagnetic listening satellites, and improve the modernization of its space surveillance radar.
French President Emmanuel Macron announced last July that a military space command and an " aviation and space force " would be established within the French Air Force.
Palley said she would officially announce the establishment of the space force later when she visited a military academy in Salon, Provence.
Palley said the space force is part of the Air Force and will have 500 personnel by 2025.
" The idea that space served the common interests of science is gone forever. Now space is a place where countries compete for global hegemony, " she said.
Palley reiterated Macron's previous statement that France has no intention of provoking an arms race.
" We are by no means engaged in an arms race, but it is my responsibility to fully understand the threats we may face. "
Palley recalled the surveillance of a military satellite shared by France and Italy in 2017.
She said that " peeping " was a Russian satellite.
Russia denies this claim.
Palley said France would " soon " have small patrol satellites capable of detecting and targeting " the black hands behind those unfriendly moves. "
French media believe that France seeks to establish a space force because US President Donald Trump asked the US Department of Defense to draft a bill on the establishment of the Pacific Air Force last February.
Trump signed the National Defense Authorization Act last December, approving the establishment of the Pacific Air Force, the sixth military force in the United States.
Some experts are concerned that these measures by the US have accelerated the pace of US space militarization and may trigger a new round of space arms race.

The total number of orders in the first five months decreased by 65% year on year, and the number of reception visits decreased by 63% year on year. On the other hand, the weakness of demand also led to a marked decline in night prices, with the average night price in the first five months falling by 16% year on year.

The occurrence of aortic diseases is often accompanied by high risk, high mortality and high difficulty of treatment. The thickest section of the aorta is up to 4cm in diameter. Once a hemangioma is formed, rupture occurs, or the rupture of the intima of the blood vessels produces a dissection, it will cause large bleeding, which is very dangerous.
In recent years, with the change of people's lifestyle and the acceleration of the pace of life, China has become the largest country in the world with high blood pressure, and aortic diseases have also increased. Today, with the development of surgical technology and industrial materials, the treatment of aortic diseases has continued to develop in the direction of minimally invasive, rapid and efficient.
Doctors can puncture from the thigh and place a stent in the aorta to properly " change the channel " of the blood flow, so as to avoid the impact of the aneurysm or ruptured dissection, and achieve good therapeutic results. Some operations even require local anesthesia.
The symposium invited more than 10 domestic experts to discuss the new progress in the treatment of aortic diseases, and conducted cutting-edge technical training and difficult case discussions in the form of a conference salon.
The reporter learned at the meeting that with the development of surgical technology and industrial materials, the treatment of aortic diseases continues to develop in the direction of minimally invasive, rapid and efficient.

" Journey " chose the overhead era to set the background of the story.
In the fictional mainland of Central China, among the ten countries, the state of Southern Zhao and the state of Northern Yan live side by side.
In order to defend against the increasingly powerful Northern Yan, Southern Zhao held a martial arts conference to select generals.
The news reached the remote Qingyuan village. Villager Dong Yilong wanted to become the flag bearer of the family and compete on behalf of the Qingyuan village family, but the villagers questioned his qualifications. After some efforts, Yilong finally embarked on a journey with the samurai Chu soul.
The total investment of the film was nearly $300 million, with special effects shots accounting for up to 80% of the film.
Predictably, the special effects have become one of the biggest highlights of Journey.
And the late special effects production team is also quite original, led by the special effects team MORE VFX, who created " Wandering Earth, " to restore the " journey " world with imaginative visual arts and cutting-edge technology.
Some of the classic game scenes, Phoenix, Qingyuan Village and Beast King Valley, will also appear in the film. Players should set off a wave of nostalgia.
In addition to the special effects team, behind-the-scenes production is also a group of successful people in the industry.
Director Chen Dsen directed " October Siege, " " Purple Rain Storm, " and producer Zheng Baorui filmed " Kill the Wolf 2, " " Sun Wukong's Journey to the West, " and so on. The action scenes were handled by Dong Wei, the best action director of the award and the Golden Horse Award, and art director Mai Guoqiang was also the winner of the two awards.

Xinhua News, Chongqing, July 26 (Reporter Han Lu) The reporter learned from China Railway Chengdu Group Co., Ltd. on July 26 that the Zheng-Wan High-Speed Railway Small Three Gorges Tunnel, with a total length of 18.9 kilometers, was fully completed on the same day.
It is understood that the Small Three Gorges Tunnel is not only the longest high-speed railway tunnel in the Three Gorges reservoir area, but also the longest single-hole double-track high-speed railway tunnel designed to reach a speed of 350 km / h among the projects currently under construction in China.
The Zheng-Wan high-speed railway is located in the territory of the three provinces of Henan, Hubei and Chongqing. It connects the Beijing-Guangzhou and Xu Lan high-speed railway to the north of Zhengzhou and reaches Chongqing in the south of Wanzhou. It is an important part of the Yangtze River passageway and Huantong Road in China's " eight vertical and eight horizontal " high-speed railway network.
The Zheng-Wan High-Speed Railway Small Three Gorges Tunnel was completed on the 26th.
The picture shows going through the scene.
The Zheng-Wan high-speed railway starts in Zhengzhou, Henan Province, and runs southwest through Pingdingshan City, Nanyang City, Xiangyang City, Hubei Province to Wanzhou District, Chongqing. The new line has a total length of 818 km, with a design speed of 350 km / h, and about 184 km in Chongqing.
Among them, the section from Zhengzhou to Xiangyang was put into operation on December 1, 2019, and the Chongqing section is stepping up construction.
The Small Three Gorges Tunnel, which runs through the entire line on the 26th, is a control project for the entire line of the Zheng-Wan high-speed railway. The project is located at the junction of Fengjie County and Wushan County in Chongqing, with a total length of 18.9 kilometers and a maximum depth of 890 meters.
Construction of the tunnel began in February 2017 and was completed on July 26, 2020.
According to Wang Jun, head of the Zheng Wan high-speed railway tunnel design of China Railway Eryuan Engineering Group Co., Ltd., the survey designer, the topography and geological conditions of the location of the Small Three Gorges Tunnel are very complex and face risks such as karst, mud inrush and large deformation of soft rock. It is a Class I high-risk tunnel, and the design and construction of the tunnel is extremely difficult.
" During the construction of the project, we made advance geological forecasts by means of geological survey, geophysical exploration and advanced drilling, and adopted special design plans for more than 30 karst caves of various types. For example, a bridge with a length of 24 meters was designed and built to cross large karst caves with a longitudinal length of more than 10 meters and a depth of more than 55 meters in the tunnel to avoid tunnel subsidence, " the Royal Army said.
According to the China Railway Tunnel Bureau, the construction party of the tunnel adopted a combination of diversion and blockage during the construction of the tunnel, which not only ensured the orderly progress of the project, but also avoided the damage caused by construction drainage to the water bodies of the Small Three Gorges Scenic Area. At the same time, it successfully overcome construction problems such as unfavorable geology such as large deformation of soft rock up to 7 kilometers, and multi-mud flooding with a maximum daily inrush of 157,000 cubic meters.
When the entire line of the Zheng-Wan high-speed railway is completed and opened to traffic, it will become a new convenient and fast passenger route from southwest China to Central China, North China and Northeast China, which is of great significance for improving the capacity and quality of the southwest-northeast railway route, improving the layout of the regional road network, accelerating the development of tourism resources and urbanization along the route, promoting coordinated regional development and promoting the implementation of the western development strategy.
Experts say collecting immigration data through the US census for the allocation of seats in the House of Representatives is unconstitutional
Some civil rights organizations and several U.S. cities and counties have filed lawsuits against the US federal government, claiming that Trump's presidential attempt to exclude undocumented immigrants from the US census is unworkable and unconstitutional.
The United States Census will determine the allocation of seats in the United States House of Representatives.
" This won't work, " Sarah Brandon, an executive attorney for the American Civil Rights and Freedom League, told VOA.
She went on to say that Trump's request to determine the citizenship of people surveyed in the census was difficult and " not very reliable. "
Another civil liberties group, Common Cause, filed a lawsuit Thursday challenging Trump's executive order.
Several cities in New Jersey and Georgia joined the lawsuit.
Arlington County, Virginia, joined the suit Friday.
Garvey, chairman of the Arlington County Management Board, said, " The United States Constitution requires an accurate count of our population every 10 years. We must accurately count everyone living in Arlington County. We must not allow this illegal attempt to scare people away and reduce the number of our immigrant community to succeed. "
Other organizations and individuals praised President Trump's executive order.
Alabama Attorney General Marshall called the executive order a " victory " for the state.
" The allocation of seats in the House of Representatives and Electoral College in each state must be based on the number of residents residing in each state and the number of residents legally residing, " he said.
The US Supreme Court last year prevented the Trump administration from including citizenship issues in the 2020 census.
Earlier this week, President Trump signed an executive order directing Commerce Secretary Ross, who oversees the US Census Bureau, to submit census data on undocumented people so that the administration can exclude these undocumented people from state census figures and determine whether each state will increase or reduce or maintain seats in the House of Representatives.
The United States redistributes seats in the House of Representatives every 10 years according to demographic changes.

Move in response to the situation and promote the construction of industrial projects - View Headline - First Generation Network - China News Online
Heat waves hit Hunan in the middle of summer.
However, the enthusiasm released by the on-site observation meeting to promote the construction of industrial projects in the province exceeded the heat of three days, and encouraged Sanxiang and four waters under the clear direction of " comparing the strength of the industry and the hero of the project. "
The development of Hunan always depends on building projects and cultivating industries.
In the face of the very unusual first half of the year, under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core, the whole province adhered to a game of chess, made every effort to fight the two hard battles of epidemic prevention and flood control, and took industrial projects as the " first chess " for the implementation of " two-digit " and " two-digit. "
From a 1.9% year-on-year decline in GDP in the first quarter to a 1.3% year-on-year increase in the first half of the year, it is self-evident that the difficulties and efforts during the period are enormous.
In this precious report card, the construction of industrial projects is the key support for Hunan's accelerated economic recovery and stable development.
The situation is smooth and irreversible.
The construction of industrial projects should be put into the general trend of the overall situation. They should not only be good at accumulating, accumulating and planning, but also be good at understanding, seeking and adapting to change.
Against the background of the current complex and severe international situation, in addition to painstaking efforts to attract investment, we need to calm down to study the new characteristics of the current new situation, better grasp the law, be more scientific and accurate, and better integrate into the new development pattern with the domestic big cycle as the main body and the domestic and international double loop mutually reinforce each other.
Pay more attention to improving the basic capabilities of the industry.
In the first half of the year, our province not only had a large number of heavyweight investment projects in emerging industries breaking ground and sowing hope, but also traditional competitive industry enterprises speeded up their deployment and flying in the digital, intelligent and green industrial transformation.
The Yiyang Oskang Third Science Park project will transform the existing production line, and the intelligent production line of high-end printed circuit boards will seize the first opportunity. The new factory of Hunan Zhongyan Changde Cigarette Factory is committed to intelligent transformation and the construction of a modern factory. It is also a vivid portrayal of " old trees and new buds "... Focusing on the major national strategy and " two new and one heavy, " efforts will be made to consolidate and upgrade competitive industries, actively cultivate and develop emerging industries, and comprehensively increase scientific and technological innovation and domestic substitution, so as to continuously consolidate the basic conditions and save the kinetic energy of transformation.
More attention should be paid to cultivating and developing new business models of the new economy.
The sudden COVID-19 pandemic brought the popularity of the " cloud economy, " stimulated the potential of the digital economy and provided new opportunities for industrial transformation. In the first half of the year, our province's computer and office equipment manufacturing and electronic and communication equipment manufacturing grew by 12.6%, the online retail sales of wholesale and retail enterprises above the quota increased by 32.2% year on year, and the online meal income of catering enterprises increased by 35.6% year on year.
It is the general trend to cultivate new machines in times of crisis, open new offices in times of change, actively promote digital industrialization and industrial digitalization, and guide the integrated development of the digital economy and the real economy.
Pay more attention to optimizing and stabilizing the industrial chain supply chain.
Construction machinery is the main force of Hunan industry, but two-thirds of the supporting enterprises are outside the province, and there is still space and potential in the supporting chain.
To strengthen the thinking of the industrial chain and grasp the project, it is necessary not only to have the head enterprises continuously accumulate and achieve technological breakthroughs in the key links of the industrial chain; it is also necessary for all localities to cultivate, stimulate the " chain " lock response with strong chain supplementation and extension, promote the coordinated layout of relevant supporting industries, and accelerate the construction of an independent, controllable, safe and reliable industrial chain supply chain.
To overcome difficulties and support enterprises, Hunan is still a hot and happy land with a good business environment and the emergence of market business opportunities.
All parts of the province have made frequent calls, new calls and practical calls, believing that the " burden reduction " of enterprise relief will lead to the " acceleration " of high-quality development; Shaoyang implements a " shareholder-style " service to do business for enterprises without prevarication, the implementation of policies without discounts, and the resolution of problems without overnight... In the process of recovering the losses caused by the epidemic, all kinds of " make every effort " to identify the short board pain points and achieve a living story of turning danger into opportunity.
Focusing on researching, cultivating and developing industries and earnestly optimizing the business environment will surely win the favor of more investors.
The wind and waves are still ahead, but taking advantage of the wind and waves has become the norm for the whole province to seize the construction of industrial projects and promote high-quality development.
During this critical period, we must learn well and implement the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's series of important instructions and instructions, use the certainty of our own work to effectively address external uncertainties, persistently promote the construction of industrial projects, share enthusiasm and sweat, and ensure the successful conclusion of the 13th Five-Year Plan and the building of a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way.

The overall stability of employment and prices highlights the " temperature " of the economy - New News

The overall stability of employment and prices shows that the economy has a " temperature "
Economic Times · China Economic Network Journalist Lin Fo Chan
In the first half of this year, in the face of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, China coordinated the work of epidemic prevention and control and economic and social development. The epidemic prevention and control situation was constantly improving, the steady economic recovery was evident, the performance of employment and prices closely related to people's livelihood was generally stable, and the Chinese economy handed over a warm economic performance report card.
The surveyed unemployment rate rose in the first two months of this year.
In particular, in February, the production and business activities of many enterprises were basically shut down, the demand for employment by enterprises was reduced, recruitment was delayed or cancelled, and the surveyed unemployment rate in cities and towns increased.
As the epidemic prevention and control situation has gradually improved, the production and living order of the whole society has been continuously restored.
The CPC Central Committee adheres to the general tone of the work of steady progress, further strengthens macro-policy hedging, comprehensively strengthens employment priority policies, and actively promotes the work of assisting and stabilizing jobs and expanding employment.
China has stepped up its policy of hedging and stabilizing jobs, launched a combination of policies of " reduction, reduction and slow return compensation, " phased reduction and reduction of the contributions paid by three social insurance units, allowed the postponement of the payment of social insurance premiums, expanded the scope of benefits from the unemployment insurance and job-for-work training policy for small and medium-sized enterprises, and provided absorption subsidies and internship subsidies to enterprises to absorb the employment of key groups.
With the implementation of various stable employment policies, the demand for employment by enterprises has steadily picked up, the employment situation has gradually improved, and the urban survey unemployment rate has gradually decreased. In June, the survey unemployment rate was 5.7%.
Zhang Yi, director of the Department of Population and Employment Statistics of the National Bureau of Statistics, said that in the second quarter, various employment policies continued to take effect, and the labor force who withdrew due to the impact of the epidemic gradually returned. The urban labor force participation rate in June increased by about 10 percentage points compared with February, which is close to the level of the same period last year.
The data show that the total number of urban employment in June increased by more than 19% compared with February, and most industries reached the pre-epidemic level. The average working hours of employees in enterprises reached 46.8 hours per week, 6.6 hours higher than in February and 0.1 hours higher than in January.
Prices also affect thousands of households.
In January, the CPI rose 5.4% year on year, a multi-year high.
In February, although the year-on-year increase in CPI fell slightly, it was still in the " 5 range. "
The year-on-year increase in CPI is at a high level, not only the pull factors of consumer demand before the Spring Festival, but also the wrong month of the Spring Festival and the lower year-on-year base.
However, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on prices is particularly obvious.
Affected by the prevention and control of the epidemic, logistics delays, untimely material supplies and increased material transportation costs occurred in all parts of the country in January and February. In addition to some citizens hoarding and buying, the prices of some basic necessities increased significantly.
In order to cope with the disturbance caused by epidemic prevention and control to the price situation, the relevant departments have included important living materials in the scope of emergency transportation to ensure the smooth transportation of materials.
Under the effect of a series of policy measures, the supply of vegetables, melon and fruit market has been strongly guaranteed.
In order to cope with the rapid rise in pork prices at the beginning of this year, after the Central Government issued the policy of stabilizing prices, various regions and departments quickly implemented the policy, the supply of pork reserves was significantly improved, the production capacity of pigs was restored in an orderly manner, and the order of production and marketing was gradually normal.
Pork prices have fallen continuously since March, and the year-on-year increase in food prices fell to 10.6% in May. In June, pork prices rose slightly due to factors such as the slowdown in the number of pigs, the reduction of imports and the recovery of group consumption demand.
The price of fresh vegetables has obvious seasonal characteristics, with an average increase of 3.4% in the first half of the year.
Affected by the relatively high comparative base of the same period last year, the price of fresh fruit continued to decline year on year, with an average decline of 13.3% in the first half of the year.
The basic livelihood of the masses has been effectively guaranteed, and the overall economic and social situation has remained stable and orderly.
With the gradual recovery of transportation logistics, various places have increased their efforts, and the market supply and demand situation has improved.
Starting in March, the CPI fell for four consecutive months, and the year-on-year increase also fell from 4.3% in March to 2.5% in June.
In the second half of the year, China's prices will continue to remain moderate, and the overall inflationary pressure is low, but we still need to promote the restoration of production and living order on the premise of normalizing epidemic prevention and control.
Effectively deal with natural disasters such as floods and droughts in major agricultural production areas such as grain, fruits and vegetables, strengthen market supervision, and resolutely crack down on acts that disturb market order, such as hoarding and pushing up prices.

But Reuters reported that Harry and Megan had disassociated themselves from the book, saying they had not been interviewed by the author and had not provided any content.
The Sunday Times reported that the new book quoted sources as saying that when Harry and Megan were dating before marriage, Prince William wanted to confirm whether Megan, a former Hollywood actress, had ulterior motives for Harry.
According to the source, William said to Harry at the time, " You don't feel the need to rush. "
You can take the time to get to know this girl. "
It was reported that when Harry heard William describe Megan as " this girl, " he felt arrogant snobbery in his brother's tone, and he thought he no longer needed a reminder.
Harry and Megan announced in January that they plan to live a more independent life and support themselves.
After they officially stepped down as senior members of the royal family in March, they are now living with their son Archie in Los Angeles to pursue a new career.
Harry and Megan married in May 2018.
At the time, the marriage was seen as injecting Hollywood splendor and a new era into the British royal family, making them one of the most watched celebrity couples in the world.

Xinhua News, Qinghai, Hainan, July 26 - Question: Qinghai Lake " Huahai Studio ": " Sweet " with goods to help farmers increase income
Author Hu Guilong Pan Yujie
" In the middle of summer, the lake of Qinghai is full of golden flowers and thousands of bees flying. It has a high altitude, a large temperature difference between day and night and less air pollution. The strong light has bred the most tenacious and generous bee colony, creating the characteristics of Qinghai royal jelly with high activity, high protein, rich nutritional value, low sugar and low fat. "
On the 26th, Zhang Jianxun, deputy director of the Industry and Information Administration of Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, said.
On the same day, the live broadcast of bee products of " concentric war epidemic spring pulp to help farmers " was held on the shores of Qinghai Lake. The China Bee Products Association, representatives of entrepreneurs and bee farmers gathered to jointly promote Qinghai characteristic bee products. A total of nearly 10,000 bottles of Qinghai Plateau royal jelly were sold online and offline, for a total amount of nearly 3.8 million yuan.
The picture shows bee farmers showing bee products on the spot.
It is reported that the live broadcast event promoted the exchange and cooperation of " enterprises + bee farmers + growers " with the help of the Beijing Houde bee chain network, QiQi, Taobao and other well-known bee products retail enterprises, live broadcast and e-commerce platforms, and continued to issue " Qinghai Plateau spring pulp consumption vouchers " to consumers through online and offline channels. The total annual benefit of enterprises is expected to be close to 5.28 million yuan.
In this regard, Wu Na, president of Beijing Houde Li Bee Industry Co., Ltd. said that it was " well worth it ": " This move can expand the visibility of Qinghai bee products, attract more consumers to understand and like bee products without adding pure nature, and drive bee farmers to increase their income. "
At present, the company has signed a production cooperation strategic agreement with Qinghai Cloud Bee Industry Co., Ltd. and Qinghai Huabao Bee Industry Co., Ltd. in order to jointly promote the rapid development of the local bee industry in Qinghai.
The picture shows the cauliflower sea on the shores of Qinghai Lake.
This spring, due to the need to set up road checkpoints for epidemic prevention and control, the way of bee farmers to " chase flowers for honey " was blocked. Many bees died due to missing flowering and lack of food, and the income of bee farmers was seriously affected.
" Throughout the year, the bee farmers traveled long distances following the flowering period, moving all the way north from Yunnan and Sichuan to the northwest. They ate, slept in the open, lived nowhere, and worked very hard.
As companies, we have a responsibility to help them. "
Wu Na said.
" Small bees are' environmental scouts', and bees cannot survive in heavily polluted areas. " Zhao Xiaochuan, Executive Vice President of the China Bee Products Association, said that bee pollination is an important link in the ecological chain and plays an irreplaceable role in protecting plant diversity and improving the ecological environment.
At the same time, bee pollination can increase crop production and improve quality, especially in areas with wide varieties and poor management conditions, pollination is of greater significance.
Research data show that pollination can increase rape production by about 15% to 30%.
The picture shows the introduction of Qinghai bee products by Zhao Xiaochuan, Executive Vice President of China Bee Products Association (right).
" The economic, ecological and social benefits created by bee pollination are far greater than the value of bee products themselves. The bee industry has great potential in terms of human health, crop production, vegetation reproduction and ecological protection, and people always know little about this. "
Zhao Xiaochuan said.
Today, there are fewer and fewer beekeepers. In addition to the bee farmers who travel all year round, many poor families with limited mobility choose to invest in cooperatives with beehives.
" The state has financial support, and we contact technical personnel for help and guidance. Bee farmers lack understanding and judgment of the market environment. To open the market, they also need the help and coordination of the government, enterprises and industrial associations. "
Zhao Xiaochuan said.
" I hope you will pay more attention to and help beekeeping groups in the future, " Wu Na said. " Our bee products are also screened and controlled in strict accordance with national standards to ensure quality and protect the rights and interests of consumers while helping bee farmers. "

" Victory " is based on historical facts, and the material is taken from the dusty Soviet military archives for many years.
During the defense of Moscow, the elite of the Soviet Red Army from the Far East advanced to the west to help. At this time, the " Beijin faction " of the Japanese Kanto Army thought it was possible to take advantage of it and wanted to send troops.
In order to solve the danger of facing the enemy, the Chinese Communist Party and Soviet intelligence personnel jointly implemented the " Mudanula " plan.

Liu Yunlong served as both producer and lead actor in " Winning Calculation. "
In the play, he plays Tang Fei, the head of the criminal section of the Linhe Police Department, is a very happy and even a bit ruffian stammer policeman, and his real identity is an underground member of the Chinese Communist Party.
Cai Meng, the heroine of the opposite play, is the head of the Linhe Security Bureau. He is deeply appreciated by Japanese boss Fukuhara, and there is an ambiguous and delicate relationship with Tang Fei.
Su Qing has tried many different types of characters in recent years, from Lu Ruowen in " Those Years We Are Young " to Erqing in " Jubilee Guide, " all impressed the audience and the acting was recognized.
This time, Su Qing and Liu Yunlong are partners for the first time, and the setting of the stammer police chief with a charming policewoman is quite interesting and innovative.

It is understood that the production of " Winning Calculation " is also very excellent, with the crew shooting nearly 2,000 kilometers across the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Liaoning.
In order to restore the bizarre urban style of the Northeast during the Japanese period, the art props group of the production crew worked day and night to carefully polish every detail of the scene construction and props, so that the scene picture is exquisite and rich in historical texture.

Green Park opens a new round of Shanghai state-owned assets to transfer 17.5% of shares - Economic Observer Network - Professional financial news website
Economic observation network reporter Rao Xianjun on July 26, Greenfield Holdings (600606.SH) released the " indicative announcement on the state-owned shareholders to transfer part of the company's shares and resume trading through public solicitation of transferees. "
The contents of the announcement show that in order to further deepen the reform of state-owned enterprises, optimize the layout and structural adjustment of state-owned assets, and improve the ownership structure of green space, Shanghai Real Estate (Group) Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as " Shanghai Real Estate ") and Shanghai City Investment (Group) Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as " Shanghai City Investment ") intend to transfer some of the shares held by the company by agreement through public solicitation of transferees, and the total proportion of shares to be transferred shall not exceed 17.5% of the total share capital of green space.
The price of the shares to be transferred shall not be lower than the higher of the following: the arithmetic average of the daily weighted average price for the 30 trading days prior to the indicative announcement date (July 27, 2020); and the audited net asset value per share of the company in the most recent fiscal year.
At present, the new strategic investors in Green Park are still inconclusive. According to the information published in the announcement, it is estimated that the new strategic investors will need to pay about 14 billion yuan to take 17.5% of the shares transferred in Green Park.
It is worth noting that after the completion of the share transfer, it is expected that Greenbelt still has no controlling shareholder or actual controller, but the control structure may change significantly.
Since its inception, Greenfield Holdings has carried out a number of institutional and institutional reforms: from 1992 to 1997, it operated in accordance with market-oriented rules under a purely state-owned system; from 1997 to 2013, it established and continuously improved the joint-stock system of state-owned holding and employee shareholding; from 2013 to 2015, it introduced strategic investors to form mixed ownership with cross-shareholding and mutual integration of state-owned and non-public capital; and since 2015, it has been listed as a whole and has become a public company.
Green's current plan is similar to that of Gree. In December 2019, high-level capital led Zhuhai Mingjun to take over the 15% stake in Gree Electric (000651.SZ) with 41.662 billion yuan. Gree Group retired as a minority shareholder. After the completion of the plan, Gree Electric implemented modern enterprise management methods such as executive incentive plan and non-real controller structure.
Shanghai Real Estate and Shanghai City Investment are state-owned enterprise groups wholly owned by Shanghai SASAC. Zhang Yuliang, chairman and president of Greenbelt Holdings, said that Greenbelt's move is an important measure for Shanghai to promote the comprehensive reform of state-owned state-owned state-owned state-owned enterprises and accelerate the reform of state-owned state-owned state-owned enterprises at a new stage in accordance with the requirements of the CPC Central Committee. It fully demonstrates the new ideas of reform tailored to local conditions, and supports enterprises to further improve the degree of marketization, enhance the freedom of operation and management, and accelerate the full release of reform vitality by introducing new outstanding strategic shareholders to listed companies.

White House advisers " bite back " states to resume work too early
On July 23, local time, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 pneumonia in the United States exceeded 4 million, accounting for 30% of global cases.
Over the past few months, US President Donald Trump has repeatedly asked all states to resume work. It was only recently that he changed his attitude and took the initiative to wear a mask in public, while his advisers said that some state governments were too early to resume work.
On the 22nd, White House presidential adviser Killian Conway said at a press conference that some state governments failed to comply with the standards for returning to work and reopened bars and other places prematurely.
Conway also noted that the previous claim that the president had " absolute power " to decide the states to resume work was a false rumor.
" The President is a federalist and he believes that all states have autonomy. "
She defended Trump.
However, Conway's " rumor " was made by Trump himself at the White House outbreak briefing on April 13.
This self-face operation was derided by netizens as " rewriting history. "

Is it reasonable for a 3-year-old child to sue the school after the college playground was damaged?
2020-07-26 05: 01: 11 Source: Legal Daily Author: Wang Sishuo Executive Editor: Wang Sishuo
The playground was smashed and the children sued the school after receiving compensation
Zhao Yifan, correspondent of this newspaper
3-year-old Xiao Wen was accidentally hit in the head by Chen of the softball team while playing on a university playground.
After Chen's compensation, Xiao Wen's father, Mr. Wen, as Xiao Wen's legal representative, sued the school to the court, demanding that the school where the playground was located make an apology and pay medical expenses and compensation for mental damage totalling 20,000 yuan.
Recently, after hearing the case, the Beijing Haidian District People's Court held that the school had set up a protective net in the playground at the time of the incident and had fulfilled its proper safety and security obligations, and that Chen had made compensation, and accordingly rejected the plaintiff's claim.
Mr. Wen complained that he took Xiao Wen to play on the school playground during the summer of 2019, when the softball team was training on the playground.
In order to avoid the risks, Xiao Wen, Mr. Wen and many other children and parents moved in the safe area designated by the softball team.
But then softball team member Chen dropped off while throwing the ball, causing the softball to fly over the net to the above-mentioned safe area and hit Xiao Wen in the back of the head.
Mr. Wen immediately took Xiao Wen to the hospital for treatment and was diagnosed with a head injury.
Mr. Wen believed that the facilities of the school stadium did not comply with the relevant safety regulations and did not effectively manage the team and related facilities.
The negligence of the school led to the above-mentioned incident, which caused Xiao Wen to suffer great physical and mental suffering, but also brought great suffering to his family, for which the school should bear legal responsibility.
In this regard, the school argued that the school had set up a protective net in the playground and posted management regulations and training notices, informing them that entering the playground must maintain a safe distance from the training site and remind them of their own safety. The plaintiff could not prove that the school had " failed to fulfill its safety and security obligations, " so it did not agree to compensation.
After the hearing, the court held that the site of the incident was a site open to the public free of charge by the university involved. Although the school has a security obligation for the management of the playground, this security obligation only needs to meet the general duty of care.
At the time of the incident, the school set up a protective net in the playground and had fulfilled the appropriate security obligations, and Chen also compensated Xiao Wen more than 2,000 yuan for medical expenses, transportation expenses and other losses in accordance with the compensation agreement reached before. The two sides agreed to resolve the dispute at one time.
Later, Xiao Wen's parents again claimed the school compensation, which had no basis in the law, and the court decided to reject all the plaintiff's claims.
Following the judgement, neither party appealed, and the judgement has now entered into force.
According to the provisions of Article 37 of China's Tort Liability Law, schools, as administrators of public places, have the obligation of safety and security; if the actions of the third party cause damage to others, the third party shall bear the tort liability, while the administrators of public places who fail to fulfill the obligation of safety and security shall bear the corresponding supplementary liability.
The judge said that since, as the manager of a public place, he is most likely to know the actual situation of the whole place, foresee the danger and damage that may occur, and thus is most likely to take necessary measures to prevent the occurrence of the loss or mitigate the extent of the damage, and the cost of avoiding and mitigating the occurrence of the damage is the lowest, the law stipulates that he shall bear the corresponding guarantee obligation to engage in social activities.
In this case, for the non-specific people entering the playground open to the public free of charge, the school's safety and security obligations should be commensurate with its social activities. Specifically, it should take basic safety measures and have the obligation to inform of hidden dangers.
In judicial practice, it is also inappropriate to impose excessively high security obligations on the managers of public places.
If the school has set up a protective net and fulfilled its notification obligation, it can be concluded that the school is not at fault and should not bear legal responsibility.
In addition, for the infringement by a third party, even if the administrators of schools and other public places fail to fulfill their safety and security obligations, their liability is as a supplement to compensation for damages. According to the newly promulgated Civil Code, the administrators can also recover compensation from the third party after assuming the supplementary liability.
Therefore, in such accidents, the victim should not expand the scope of the claim after having received compensation from the direct infringer.
Under the normalization of epidemic prevention and control, people's enthusiasm for sports and fitness is high.
With the gradual liberalization of inter-provincial tourism business, the tourism market is also about to usher in a recovery.
Fujian Province resumed its inter-provincial tourism business from July 21. On the first weekend after its opening, Xiamen, a popular tourist destination, ushered in a passenger flow peak.
As a popular tourist destination, many tourists arrive in Xiamen on weekends.
Xiamen Railway Station is expected to send 3.7 million passengers during the summer transport, while the airport's passenger flow will be dominated by students, tourism, and family visits.
The tourism market has gradually picked up. In July, Xiamen Airport operated 440 flights per day, and domestic flights have returned to 80% of the pre-epidemic level.
The airline encrypted the air express line from Xiamen to major cities such as Shanghai, Beijing, Kunming and Xi'an to seize the recovering tourism market.
At present, a number of travel agencies in Xiamen have launched a number of summer domestic inter-provincial tour products, and the team itinerary is mainly outdoor attractions.
In response to the summer passenger transport peak at railway stations and airports, the relevant units have deployed additional manpower to provide guidance in areas where people can easily gather, such as check-in counters and security checkpoints. Fujian has also optimized and upgraded the " Labuan Health Code, " realizing health data sharing and mutual recognition with 31 provinces, and promoting the orderly recovery of the tourism market.
Can Andy Lau Liu Qingyun " dismantle " the new spark - Xinhuanet

The second part is still directed by Qiu Litao, produced and starring Andy Lau, with a brand-new story.
It is reported that the addition of the " nuclear bomb " element in the second part also makes the challenge faced by the bomb demolition experts even more difficult. Several stunning shots in the preview have caught the heart, the mushroom cloud of the big explosion and the airport engulfed by fire, the scene is quite shocking.
Three years ago, " Bomb Demolition Expert, " produced by the original team, won the first prize at the May Day box office that year, and won seven nominations at the Hong Kong Film Awards. Qiu Li-tao × Andy Lau also became the gold medal partner in the eyes of the audience.

The female inspector eager to solve the case, and Pang Ling (Ni Ni), who is also Pan's ex-girlfriend, is also involved.

Israel Strengthens Prevention and Control of Repeated Epidemics - NEWS

Israel strengthens prevention and control of repeated outbreaks
At the beginning of the SARS outbreak, Israel's prevention and control measures achieved remarkable results.
However, with the gradual lifting of prevention and control measures, the number of people diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia in Israel has increased significantly recently, and the Israeli government has repeatedly taken urgent measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic.
On February 28, the first case of COVID-19 pneumonia was confirmed in Israel, which quickly took measures to close all entry and exit ports, suspend non-essential industries, switch schools to online classes, restrict public transportation and non-essential social activities, block epidemic-hit cities, and the military and police jointly maintain prevention and control measures.
This series of measures quickly achieved positive results. By mid-May, the number of new confirmed cases of COVID-19 pneumonia in Israel fell to the single digits.
As the epidemic has been brought under control, Israel's prevention and control measures have been completely unblocked, and the number of newly diagnosed cases of COVID-19 pneumonia has gradually rebounded since June.
Especially since the beginning of July, the spread of the epidemic has been accelerating.
In recent days, there were more than 1,500 new cases per day in Israel for eight days, and as of the time of writing on July 25, there were 916 new cases on that day.
As of July 25, Israel had 59,745 confirmed cases and 448 deaths.
Faced with the rapid rebound of the epidemic, the Israeli government has repeatedly taken urgent measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic.
On July 6, after the number of confirmed cases exceeded 30,000, the Israeli government closed gymnasiums, swimming pools, bars, nightclubs and other public entertainment venues, and introduced a policy of restricting public transportation, stipulating that the maximum number of passengers per bus should not exceed 20.
On the 17th, the Israeli government announced a series of new restrictive measures, including the implementation of the " economic reform " on weekends, stipulating that the " economic reform " will be implemented from 17: 00 every Friday to 5: 00 every Sunday.
During this period, people can go out, but places such as shops, shopping centers, barber shops, beauty salons, libraries, zoos, museums, exhibition halls, swimming pools and tourist attractions will be closed, while basic service places such as supermarkets and pharmacies will remain open.
At the same time, gatherings of more than 10 people will be banned on all dates and hours, gymnasiums, studios and other places will be closed, restaurants and cafes will be banned from eating, and only take-out service will be allowed.
Meanwhile, the Israeli people did not pay enough attention to the seriousness of the epidemic and failed to join forces with the government in fighting the epidemic.
After repeated outbreaks in Israel, many people took to the streets to protest because the government's prevention and control measures affected their own economic interests.
On July 11, tens of thousands of people held a demonstration in Tel Aviv, arguing that the anti-SARS policy affected the economy.
On the evening of the 21st, thousands more protesters gathered in front of Prime Minister Netanyahu's official residence in Jerusalem to protest that Prime Minister Netanyahu banned restaurants, coffee halls and other prevention and control measures without compensation.
In addition, many people do not observe the regulations on wearing masks and maintaining a safe social distance of two meters when outdoors. In order to avoid being fined by the police for not wearing masks, many people only wear masks on their chin or hang them on their wrists.
During the repeated epidemic, the school was the hardest-hit area for the spread of the COVID-19 virus. According to the reporter's recent visit to the kindergarten, the teachers and students of the kindergarten did not wear face masks as required by the government, nor did they maintain a safe social distance of two meters from each other, laying hidden dangers for a large number of teachers and students infected with the virus.
Professor Elie Waxman, a member of the Expert Advisory Group on Combating the Epidemic of the Israeli National Security Council, believes that Israel is moving towards a " dangerous situation, " pointing out that the current epidemic prevention and control measures taken by Israel are not enough and that all leisure and recreational places and summer schools should be closed in order to control the further spread of the epidemic.
Waxman said that Israel lacks an overall plan to combat the epidemic. The parliament and all government departments should abandon their respective interests as soon as possible, reach agreement on combating the epidemic and formulate clear steps including relevant restrictive measures in different departments.
Tel Aviv, July 25 - Tel Aviv correspondent Wang Jiong
Ningxia Guyuan farmer Wu Fengfang, but the old companion Dai Tianfu, two people in the car, from their home 20 miles away, to the Liangyun Cultural Compound.
Despite the inconvenience of his legs and feet in the past two years, 77-year-old Dai Tianfu still hopes to " come here every five minutes and get addicted to drama. "
This is an unremarkable courtyard in the Yuanzhou District of Guyuan City. Unlike the general farm yard, there is often a melodious Qin cavity in the courtyard, as well as wonderful shadow plays, embroidery works, traditional Qin cavity, Mei Hu opera and so on.
The owner of the compound was Liang Yun, who was once a carpenter.
More than 10 years ago, he, who loved shadow and singing, began planning the construction of a cultural compound.
With the Liangyun Cultural Compound, the cultural life of the villagers has become rich and colorful.
The reporter has not yet entered the Liangyun Cultural Compound, and the tune of the Qin cavity has been spread out.
The person who is singing the Qin cavity selection for the villagers is the neighboring village villager Pai Lixiang.
She loved Qin cavity since she was a child, and now she is well-known in the local area. As long as she has free time, she will come to the cultural compound to perform programs for the villagers.
Recently, Persia also played live webcasts.
" It is a very happy thing to have a stage for more people to see their performance, " said Perissa.
On the stage, the singer is one by one, the player is one by one, although they are amateurs, but the enthusiasm is undiminished.
Just like the rustic style of the farmhouse, outside the Qin cavity, the " grass-roots " art and non-heritage culture of the Liangyun cultural courtyard came face to face.
The compound also has a collection of more than 300 items such as agricultural tools from different ages, traditional and hand-made tiles, paper-cuts, embroidery and shadows.
Liang Yun led the reporter into the exhibition hall in the courtyard, which displayed his collection of old objects, old wine pots, three strings, spinning wheels and so on.
Why does an ordinary farmer build a cultural compound?
" Shadow play is my family craft, and I have been learning it since the age of 15. "
Liangyun Cultural Compound was established in 2012 and became the first rural " exhibition hall of intangible cultural heritage " in Ningxia. It is also a demonstration compound for the protection of intangible cultural heritage in Guyuan.
In addition to the Liangyun Cultural Compound, more than 120 cultural compounds and 79 folk performance groups have emerged in the Yuanzhou District of Guyuan City. Among them, there are more than 50 cultural compounds of a certain scale, such as the Shenjiahe Cultural Compound, the Wang Yonghong Cultural Compound and the Yang Lang Cultural Compound, covering towns and streets in the Yuanzhou District, with more than 5,000 participants.
These grassroots artists are active in the fields, enriching the cultural life of the masses and satisfying their spiritual needs.
" As life gets better and better, traditional culture can't just be left behind. "
" Liu's Spy War Drama " returns again " Winning Calculation " to see Liu Yunlong Li Liqun's opponent " flying play " - Xinhua
The 40-episode spy battle drama " Victory " will be launched on Beijing TV on July 16.
" Victory Calculation " is based on real historical facts and is based on the dust-sealed military archives of the Soviet Union for the first time.
Actor Liu Yunlong, who is well known for the " spy drama, " broke through his image in the play and challenged a very happy " stuttering agent. "
In recent years, the popularity of dramas such as " The Pretender, " " The Mask " and " The Kite " has proved that spy dramas have a strong vitality.
Unlike previous espionage works, " Victory " looks around the world and extends the background of the story to the Soviet Far East.
Against the background of the final phase of the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression in 1944, it tells the story of the CCP secret intelligence worker Tang Fei (Liu Yunlong), who carried out the " Mudanula " strategic operation of the Soviet Army's Far East Intelligence Service under the leadership of the Linhe Party Secretary of the Chinese Underground Party and the Director of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Service.
In many spy dramas, the leading actor, as a senior spy, appears as a handsome, high IQ and mature perfect image.
However, in Liu Yunlong's view, such a person is not suitable to be a spy. " The spy should be the kind of person who can't be found in the pile of people. If the first appearance is that kind of very handsome image, I wish everyone should pay attention to you, can you still lurk? There is a line in " Kite, "' If you don't come to catch me, I forget that I am a Kuomintang'. The spy wants to be elitist. "
So in " Winning Calculation, " Liu Yunlong creatively designed his hero Tang Fei as a " stuttering agent " with a sense of joy.
The other camp in " Victory " was supported by the Japanese Fukuhara, played by Guanhua Liang, and Police Commissioner Fang Shibao, played by Li Liqun.
One south and one north of the two powerful actors, for the whole play added a lot of master tricks to the point.
Director Yin Fei used the term " fast play " to describe the opposite play between Li Liqun and Liu Yunlong in the play. " It is absolutely fast play. The two of them have a special tacit understanding. This tacit understanding on them has a great impact on me. Many times their plays are' hanging now'. For example, we only wrote the length of half a page, and when I don't stop shooting, they can continue to play. "
The masters do not grab the play, and the director does not stir up the play. When the actors are in the characters and ensure their character status, they cannot only shape the characters from the perspective of the characters, but also bring more viewing possibilities to the audience. Yin Fei said that such a play is brilliant enough.
In the play, you can also see many familiar faces in " Liu's spy war drama, " and the famous and majestic " Mountain City F4 " in " Kite " also gathered three people in " Winning Calculation. "
Hou Yu and Liu Mingyang, who played Song Xiaoan and Zhao Jianzhi, once again played Tang Fei's left and right arm.
Director Yin Fei said, " These two people have no bad roots. They just followed the tide in that era and in that environment. "
Liu Yunlong also took the initiative, " We should have a human face. This human face means that the people around me must have good and bad, and the bad people are enemies, but we should also develop them and our team should grow. "
The ending of the two men in the play was also carefully designed by Liu Yunlong, who believed he would deliver a satisfactory answer to the audience.

Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, July 25 - Xu Zhengyu, Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury of the HKSAR Government, said that Hong Kong's financial market remains active and orderly.
He expressed optimism about Hong Kong's financial stability and economy.
At a webinar jointly organized by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Toronto and the Hong Kong-Canada Chamber of Commerce (Canadian Federation) on the 24th (Toronto time), Mr Hui said that Hong Kong was experiencing a difficult situation due to the " legislative reform storm " and the COVID-19 pandemic.
The exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar is stable and biased towards the strong exchange guarantee level.
There are no clear signs of capital outflows from the banking system; on the contrary, there have been more than $11 billion in capital inflows since June.
Total bank deposits have also continued to increase in the past few months. There have been a series of public offering fund-raising activities in the stock market.
Mr Hui said that the SARS pandemic has put pressure on the global economy and financial markets, but Hong Kong's basic advantages remain unchanged.
Hong Kong's many advantages, including geography, the rule of law, high-speed communications, the free flow of information and capital, and a simple and low tax system, make Hong Kong a leading international financial centre.
Mr Hui pointed out that the HKSAR Government has set aside HK $6 billion in the SARS Epidemic Prevention Fund to create about 30,000 time-bound jobs in the public and private sectors in the next two years, covering people with different skills and educational qualifications.
To support the development of fintech, the HKSAR Government has also launched the " One-thousand Plan " to subsidize local fintech companies, start-ups and other enterprises with fintech-related business in order to create 1,000 new jobs, hire local talent and enrich Hong Kong's fintech talent pool.
Looking ahead, Mr Hui expressed optimism about Hong Kong's financial stability and economy.
He encouraged Canadian companies to take full advantage of Hong Kong's strengths and its position as an international financial centre, an international asset and wealth management centre and a global offshore RMB business hub to develop and invest in the Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area and nearby regions.
The Lancet published an article praising China's efforts to combat the epidemic and encouraging countries to learn from their experiences - NEWS
The Lancet published an article on the 25th that, as a country with a population of 1.4 billion and a size similar to that of Europe or the United States, the COVID-19 pandemic has been effectively controlled at this stage, but there has been no large-scale spread, and the domestic epidemic has been controlled to a large extent.
The article said that over the past 10 years, China has invested heavily in domestic research and public health construction, which has made China much better prepared for the COVID-19 pandemic than for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).
The author said that at the time of the SARS outbreak in 2002, China was initially poorly prepared, especially the pathogen could not be identified.
When the COVID-19 virus was discovered in December 2019, Chinese scientists were quickly able to identify the type of virus and shared genome sequencing data with the international community on January 11, 2020.
By the end of January, doctors from mainland China and Hong Kong had clarified the clinical characteristics of the virus and warned the world of the threat of the COVID-19 virus through research papers published in The Lancet.
China has also been at the forefront of vaccine research. When the state declared a state of emergency, such research was carried out very quickly and rigorously through close domestic cooperation. The results of the progress made in the early trials of the COVID-19 vaccine developed by China were published in The Lancet in May and July respectively.
China's experience shows that it is very important to invest in national health and research systems and effectively improve laboratory capabilities.
This is the basis for a rapid and effective national response to health emergencies and global health security.
Other countries, especially low- and middle-income countries, are well worth learning from.
In addition, China's experience has proved that, on the basis of strong research, strong high-level officials must resolutely make correct decisions based on scientific evidence, so that the COVID-19 pandemic can be effectively controlled.
The article emphasizes that the government and its leaders must respect science, understand its value and act on it in the most beneficial way for society.
At the beginning of the outbreak, China's National Health Construction Committee sent three groups of infectious disease experts to Wuhan to investigate the risk and spread of the COVID-19 virus. Their recommendations provided the basis for the decision of the " financial crisis " in Wuhan on January 23. When experts raised the necessity and urgency of building a shelter hospital, the government quickly made the decision and implemented it quickly. At the same time, the extensive participation of the community and the masses also made the epidemic quickly and effectively controlled.
Finally, the article emphasizes that in response to global health emergencies, countries need to strengthen global cooperation and joint response.

Dapeng director " auspicious luck " shortlisted for the Golden Goblet Award - Xinhuanet
On July 18, the 23rd Shanghai International Film Festival announced the official list of films selected for the Golden Goblet Awards.
Dapeng's first realistic theme film, " Good Luck, " was successfully shortlisted for the Golden Goblet Award at the last Film Festival, and the film officially released its first poster.
Poster Photo
The film " auspicious " is the first realistic theme work directed by Dapeng. It is also his second bond with the Golden Goblet Award.
The film tells such a story: a comedy film director had a whim and returned to his hometown in the northeast countryside, hoping to turn his family into a literary film for the Chinese New Year. As a result, he encountered a series of accidents.
The family members who gathered for the film finished the final party.
In the film poster released today, Wang Xiangxiang, a member of the family, is sitting in the middle of the screen smoking a cigarette. The background is the black land of Northeast China dressed in silver, and the prospect is the red lantern that Chinese people must hang during the holidays.
The red lantern, which symbolizes celebration and reunion, is in great contrast to the lonely Wang Xiangxiang, which also seems to reveal the complexity and entanglement in the relationship between this large family.
It is reported that in the film, except that the daughter of " Three Uncle " Wang Xiangxiang was played by actor Liu Lu, the rest of the scenes were completed by the real director's family. The experimental audio-visual style of the film broke the boundary between drama and reality and brought the audience a new immersive viewing experience.
According to director Dapeng, the creation of " auspicious luck " originated from " a providence of God. " A series of sudden changes in the family during filming forced the original filming plan to change accordingly. Life without a script was eventually recorded as a film, but released the tension beyond the design.
Director Dapeng how to face this " providence " and how to continue to meet the changes brought about by this providence?
There is no doubt that " auspicious " is full of experimentation. The almost all-amateur lineup and innovative audio-visual style turn the life in front of the camera into a film. Under the package of real images, the audience will also find the shadow of themselves and their families from the families presented in the film. With the end of this family gathering in the film, it evokes a series of thoughts.

Balong Zhuokang sentry post, platoon commander Yu Wang and a soldier were on duty.
In this place, where the average annual temperature is ten degrees below zero, a row of simple barracks stands at the mountain pass. Not far from the barracks, a national flag is flying in the wind. The soldiers are on duty in the wind every day. At the same time, they need to regularly patrol places at higher altitude.
The soldiers had to use both hands and feet to climb the steep slope.
It was late July, when flowers and plants were flourishing in low-altitude areas, and in Balong Zhuokang, there was only a relatively dense green in the ravine behind the barracks.
The soldier Gao Peng, who had been stationed at the outpost for six years, pointed to the ravine and said that this was their back garden. Every year, the grass grew slowly only in July and August. Soon after, all turned yellow and covered with snow.
A foot patrol may take about nine hours.
Under the harsh plateau environment, the soldiers stationed here are always accompanied by snowy mountains and glaciers. They also regularly patrol the mountain passes at higher elevations.
A few days ago, a patrol composed of eight soldiers, led by instructor Liang Yixin, took the patrol road again.
Each soldier carried a load of about 30 kilograms and advanced to the target point early in the morning.
On the way, a soldier turned high, comrades-in-arms emergency rescue.
In addition to patrol duties, the soldiers at the Patong Zhuokang sentry post conduct tactical and physical training every day.
The passage of time, rising altitude, lower and lower oxygen content, and continuous physical overdraft test the will of the patrol members.
They clenched their teeth, crossed several landslide points and crossed several difficult and dangerous beaches.
At 16: 00, it was lunch time for the patrol members. They took out their own dry food and sat on the ground at an altitude of more than 5,700 meters, accompanied by sleet and supplemented their strength with food.
The soldiers at the Patong Chokang sentry post conducted tactical and physical training.
During the break, they will play cards together, and the losers will do push-ups for both entertainment and physical exercise.
After a short break in the cold wind, they climbed to the target point of the patrol, took out the national flag on the mountain pass and took a solemn oath.
Behind them are snow-capped mountains, and in front of them are dozens of kilometers of no-man's land. They are the safest guardians of the country.

Beijing will restart the activities of the Beijing consumption season in accordance with the principle of " comprehensive restart, key planning, orderly promotion and strict organization. "
On July 26, 1.5 million government and enterprise consumption vouchers were issued, including 1 million offline catering and shopping vouchers and 500,000 smart product vouchers, which consumers can collect at the Jingdong APP.
Liu Meiying, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Commerce, introduced at the media ventilation conference held on the 25th that the restarted consumption season will further reduce the allocation of funds to enterprises on the basis of maintaining the existing preferential subsidies for consumer coupon cards.
From the beginning of August, the current 1: 1 allocation of funds funded by the government and enterprises will be adjusted to 2: 1. For example, if the original consumers receive a card bag for store consumption, they can enjoy a discount of 120 yuan, including 60 yuan for government subsidies and 60 yuan for enterprises; 80 yuan for government subsidies and 40 yuan for enterprises after the adjustment.
During the consumption season, the three major operators will subsidize traffic and terminals around 5G consumption, further promoting Beijing's new 5G infrastructure and 5G consumption.
Chen Maobo said Hong Kong's economy was hit by another outbreak of the epidemic and urged all sectors of the community to share the difficult times - NEWS
China News Service, Hong Kong, July 26 - Chen Maobo, Financial Secretary of the HKSAR Government, said on July 26 that Hong Kong is facing the impact of a new wave of COVID-19 pneumonia, and business exchanges and economic activities that had seen signs of recovery have also been hit.
The HKSAR Government once again called on major small business owners to reduce rent and share the difficult times with retailers, restaurants and small and medium-sized enterprises.
Chen Maobo published an article entitled " The rugged road to recovery " online on the same day.
He said that the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 pneumonia in Hong Kong is high and the situation is serious, affecting people's livelihood and disturbing the economy.
When the epidemic is repeated, the first priority is to prevent the import of cases, and handle and interrupt the virus transmission chain as quickly as possible. When the epidemic is under control, economic activities should be resumed in a timely and appropriate manner.
He pointed out that in the face of the impact of the new epidemic, business exchanges and economic activities that had seen signs of recovery had also been hit.
Beyond the spirit of contract, social responsibility is equally important for the business community, especially those groups that receive large government subsidies under the Employment Protection Scheme.
He noted that Hong Kong's economic situation was still very grim in the second quarter of this year, but the contraction seemed to have slowed slightly.
On the export side, he believes that the peripheral situation of Hong Kong is still grim.
Chen Maobo said that the development history of Hong Kong in the past few decades shows that every crisis hides new opportunities, and every difficulty hides the key to future development.

" Chinese Doctors " to pay tribute to the heroes of fighting the epidemic - Xinhua
Recently, with the respect of the heroes of Chinese filmmakers fighting the epidemic, Bona Film Group chairman Yu Dong and director Liu Weiqiang (left) held discussions and exchanges with Academician Nanshan in Guangzhou on the filming and production of the anti-SARS film " Chinese Doctor. "
Bona Film hopes to use " Chinese Doctor " to pay tribute to all the medical and epidemic prevention workers who are fighting on the front line of epidemic prevention and control!
In 2021, the film will be released nationwide as a tribute film to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China.
At present, under the arrangement and deployment of the Central Propaganda Department and the National Film Bureau, and with the support of the Guangdong Provincial Film Bureau and the Hubei Provincial Film Bureau, Bona Film is organizing the original crew of the film " Captain of China " to prepare the film " Chinese Doctor, " which reflects the unity of the Chinese people in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee.
Focusing on the front line of the fight against the epidemic in Wuhan, the film will take the medical staff in Wuhan and the provincial and provincial medical teams as the background. From the perspective of human nature, using a unique narrative and high-impact camera language, the film will provide a panoramic view of the touching stories of the Chinese medical staff who are full of dedication and sacrifice.
It is understood that at the first time on the day of the unblock in Wuhan, Bona Company overcame many difficulties and sent a photography team deep into the front line of the epidemic to exchange understanding and collect data face-to-face with hundreds of medical workers. At present, it has interviewed academician Nanshan himself, the first person in Guangzhou to help Wuhan, the Guangdong Wu medical team, as well as white angels at the forefront of the fight against the epidemic, such as Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan Union Hospital, Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital and Wuhan Central Hospital, and captured a large number of valuable first-hand video materials.
In this symposium, Academician Nanshan also raised expectations and hopes for the shooting of the film: " I look forward to it. I hope you will not only visit some experts who make more appearances, but also interview more medical personnel who work hard on the front line. They are the majority. "
He said that he had read " Me and My Motherland " and " Captain of China " before and thought it was a good way to tell large-scale stories from the perspective of ordinary people.
" Now some foreign friends still have some misunderstandings about China. "
When talking about the dissemination of the film, Academician Nanshan said that at present some people in foreign countries like to put the virus on a politicized label. He hoped that the film could impress the audience from the perspective of humanity: " In addition to being shown in China, this film should also be shown abroad. We should impress the audience with a true humanistic spirit in a way that can be understood by both domestic and foreign audiences. "
Academician Nanshan also deeply recalled the film " People to Middle Age " in the 1980s. " After so many years, what impressed me most about the film after the reform and opening-up was " People to Middle Age. " At that time, my friends of doctors abroad watched and cried. If " Chinese Doctor " could play such a role, it would be remarkable. "
Academician Nanshan said that if " Chinese Doctor " could arouse the resonance of foreign audiences, it would be very successful.
During the discussion and exchange, Academician Nanshan also shared his views and suggestions on the current international epidemic prevention and control. " I believe that people will always be smarter than viruses. "
Academician Nanshan Zhongshan said that although the virus is difficult to predict, mankind has passed thousands of difficulties and dangers since the primitive society. Now the modern society has developed medical technology and social management measures. In addition to the fact that medical personnel and even ordinary people all over the world have a basic understanding of the scientific response to the COVID-19 pandemic, people will no longer be as passive as before. " Next, we should pay attention to two aspects of work, one is to study how the world can strengthen cooperation and the other is to pay attention to the comfort of people's hearts. "

New Hunan Client Journalist Jiang Rui correspondent Xiao Yan
Jiaxing red boat mold, Shaoshan Mao Zedong bronze statue, Yan'an cloth pile flower crafts, Xiangxi Yongshun cured meat... July 25, 2020 Hunan Red Tourism Culture Festival opened in Shaoshan.
As one of the main activities, the first Xiangtan Red Cultural Industry Expo was held in the global tourism consulting and distribution center of Shaoshan.
There are a wide variety of red creative and creative products in the exhibition area and local products in the old revolutionary areas, attracting tourists from all over the world.
" This Red Expo is not only a demonstration of the achievements of the national red cultural industry, but also an important platform for exhibitors and enterprises to exchange experiences and explore development paths. "
The relevant person-in-charge of the Executive Committee of the First Xiangtan Red Expo introduced that the theme of the Red Expo was " Promoting Red Culture to Boost the Heating of Cultural Tourism, " with a total exhibition area of nearly 3,000 square meters, setting up an atmosphere creation area, a scenic exhibition area and an online shopping experience area for red cultural tourism.
Eight provincial cities, including Jiaxing in Zhejiang, Zunyi in Guizhou and Yan'an in Shaanxi, as well as 137 enterprises and units in Changsha, Zhuzhou, Yueyang and Chenzhou, were invited to take part in the exhibition. A total of 768 kinds of exhibits were displayed, including red cultural relics, handicrafts, special food products, tourist routes, red training courses, red creative and creative products, etc.
The exhibition area will be on display until July 29.
As the host of the Red Expo, the Xiangtan exhibition area has many bright spots.
The person in charge of the exhibition area introduced that the Xiangtan exhibition area is divided into two parts: red industry and the development of red cultural industry.
The Red Industry Exhibition Area displays 31 exhibits from six enterprises, including Hualing Xiang Steel, Hualing Cable and Xiang Electric Power, and the Red Cultural Industry Development Exhibition Area displays nearly 200 products from 27 units, including red series books, red series food and red series creative products.

Telecommunication network fraud crime rose by 70% in the first half of the year - New News
In the first half of this year, procuratorial organs nationwide prosecuted 58,101 people for fraud crimes, an increase of 35% compared with the previous year, according to the website of the Supreme People's Court.
In particular, among the crimes impeding epidemic prevention and control, fraud crimes are frequent, and the number of fraud crimes prosecuted by the procuratorial organs accounted for 43.4% of the total number of crimes impeding epidemic prevention and control.
The Supreme People's Procuratorate has carried out targeted guidance. At present, of the ten batches of typical cases involving epidemic prevention and control that have been issued, there are nine cases involving fraud.
Judging from the handling of cases by the procuratorial organs in the first half of the year, there are a wide variety of crimes involving fraud, ranging from national macroeconomic policies to food, clothing and housing for ordinary people, including epidemic fraud, " medical care " fraud, " health care products " fraud, " recruitment intermediary " fraud, " routine loan " fraud, fraud of state subsidies, fraud of unfreezing of national assets, etc. They are constantly " new and new, " covering a wide range of fields such as education, medical care, employment, pensions, social security, land acquisition and demolition, precision poverty alleviation, and financial credit, which not only cause economic losses to the victims, but also seriously affect economic and social development.
In particular, some telecommunication network frauds break through the limitations of national borders, regions and personnel, and have the characteristics of stakeholders, cross-border, remote and electronic payments.
For example, some set up specialized companies, rent high-grade office buildings, set up multiple departments or posts, use legitimate network platforms to publicize and recruit, train and assess recruiters, adopt enterprise operation mode management, wear a " legal cloak " and are more confusing.
It is incumbent upon the procuratorial organs to punish and prevent crimes in accordance with the law and issue timely early warning to the public and relevant departments.
In handling judicial cases, the procuratorial organs conscientiously perform their duties, not only maintain high pressure on the crime of fraud, but also refine various law enforcement measures in a targeted manner, and promote social governance by formulating and issuing procuratorial recommendations.
The procuratorial organs strictly control the facts, evidence, procedures and the application of the law in the arrest and prosecution of fraud cases, based on the facts and the law as the criterion.
In particular, for the crime of telecommunication network fraud, we pay attention to the central role of electronic data in the identification of facts, and strive to build a chain of evidence that corroborates each other between electronic data, verbal evidence and documentary evidence.
For example, in response to an epidemic-related fraud handled by the People's Procuratorate of Yinzhou District, Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province, the procuratorate intervened at the first time in advance, and it took only five days from the occurrence to the completion of the case, reflecting the attitude and determination to handle it quickly and rigorously and maintain the overall social stability.
In the course of the examination of arrest and prosecution, attention was paid to the prosecution of missing offenders in cases, correcting the omission of 733 arrests by the public security organs, and correcting the omission of 1,113 co-offenders in the prosecution and prosecution by the public security organs.
In the first half of the year, procuratorial organs nationwide issued 298 procuratorial recommendations on fraud crimes, promoting joint efforts to prevent fraud crimes and promoting in-depth governance.
For example, in response to the loopholes found in the supervision of telecommunication networks by telecommunications enterprises, banks and intermediary organizations in handling cases, the People's Procuratorate of Guangzhou City of Guangdong Province and the People's Procuratorate of Dongguan City put forward procuratorial recommendations in a timely manner, urging relevant units to strengthen supervision, improve mechanisms and promote the construction of a long-term system.
Fourth, make every effort to recover assets and save losses.
The local procuratorial organs have seized important links such as intervention in investigation and guidance in the collection of evidence, prosecution and prosecution, urged the investigative organs to actively recover the stolen money, cooperate with the relevant departments in the recovery of assets and losses, and strive to minimize the economic losses caused by the crime of fraud to the people.
For example, in the case of a certain Lin routine loan handled by the Beijing People's Procuratorate, the case involved 22 sets of properties waiting to be seized. In the case that the property might be dealt with in advance by other cases, the first company issued a " letter of suspension of execution, " which was sent to the relevant court in a timely manner, recommending that the previously sealed-up court suspend the execution of the property involved and deal with it uniformly after the facts of the crime have been ascertained, so as to make the best efforts to recover the property involved and recover the losses of the victims.
Prosecutors reminded everyone that they should be highly alert to the crime of fraud, do not expect " pie in the sky, " do not think cheap to be credulous, and keep their own " money bag. "
Yina Town, Weining County, Guizhou Province: Short Apple Tree Widens the Road to Poverty Alleviation - NEWS
2020-07-26 11: 42: 58 Source: China Economic Network Author: Zhu Yanjing Editor: Zhu Yanjing
The scorching heat, the Economic Times-China Economic Network reporter walked into Zhonghai Village, Yina Town, Weining County, Guizhou Province.
Under the scorching sun, villager Li Yuanzhong was mowing grass in the base. Although his face was red, he hummed a few small songs from time to time.
Weining County, where the town is located, is well-known in the surrounding area because of its low latitude, high altitude, plenty of light and large temperature difference between day and night. However, because of its small size and many spots, it has not been able to sell at a good price and has not been able to form an industrial scale.
Yina Town was once a poor township of " Baogu potato in the spring and autumn, " and the incidence of local poverty was as high as 25.8% 10 years ago.
In the critical period when poverty alleviation is entering the decisive battle, it is urgent to change the traditional planting habits, adjust the industrial structure and increase farmers' income.
Yina Town Party Secretary Chen Chao and a group of people in the town believed that industrial development could no longer follow the old path after many visits.
To this end, the town introduced leading enterprises and planted apples in a modern way.
Hou Jianwen, deputy general manager of Weining Beyond Agriculture Co., Ltd. came to Yina Town from Shaanxi Province for research in 2015. He kept an eye on the local planting conditions and began planting apple trees in 2016.
At first, the village mobilized Li Yuanzhong to transfer the land to plant apple trees. Li Yuanzhong and his wife muttered in their hearts: " After planting apples for so many years, I didn't see who planted apples in the village made a fortune. "
" The apples grown are dwarf apples and won't make the apple tree grow too high. "
What Li Yuanzhong did not expect was that a new method was adopted for apple planting. Irrigation pipes were laid under each apple tree, and water and fertilizer were poured into the root of the tree. When the fruit was harvested in autumn, the tractor drove directly into the orchard and could pick the fruit standing.
At present, the Apple base has gradually entered a productive period, and the market is just as Hou Jianwen expected. Apple does not worry about selling and is deeply loved by consumers in cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.
The growing apple industry has brought new changes to Li Yuanzhong's life. Although he is still farming, he has a new source of income.
Li Yuanzhong's family has more than 9 acres of land transferred to the Apple base. Every year, in addition to the guaranteed land transfer fee, there is a profit dividend after hanging fruit. The couple usually work in the base. " One person can get 80 yuan a day and have work all year round. "
Li Yuanzhong told reporters that last year's profit dividend was more than 2,800 yuan. Together with the land transfer fees and the couple's working income, the family earned more than 80,000 yuan. " I don't have to worry about food and clothing, and the days of well-off have passed. "
" At present, initial results have been achieved. The annual output value of one acre of apple exceeds 15,000 yuan, which is about 10 times that of growing corn. "
Chen Chao told reporters that at present, 20,000 mu of apples have been planted in the whole town, and 6,000 mu have been planted in Qinghai Village alone, covering 4,056 rural households and 172,000 people, including 656 poor households and 2,952 people, with a salary of more than 6 million yuan a year.
The increasingly bulging pockets of Li Yuanzhong also began to realize his " wish. "
This year's lunar Spring Festival, Li Yuanzhong bought an off-road vehicle and now drives a car to and from work every day. " There are still more than a dozen acres of land at home. When the next step is to expand the scale of the Apple base and transfer it all to them, the income will be more. "

Membrane separation technology helps crack the " greenhouse effect "
Schematic diagram of a new type of mixed matrix membrane preparation technology
Xinhua News reporter Shang Rui reported: Recently, the atmospheric environment and bioenergy team of Tianjin University has made significant progress towards " carbon dioxide capture by membrane separation " and successfully developed a new type of mixed matrix membrane preparation technology, greatly improving the carbon dioxide capture performance of membrane materials.
Relevant results have been published as the cover article of the international journal Greenhouse Gases: Science and Technology.
The " greenhouse effect " is a major environmental problem besetting human development, and carbon dioxide emissions are the main culprit of the " greenhouse effect. "
How to efficiently capture and utilize the carbon dioxide emitted by humans is the focus of scientists.
" Membrane separation method " is a new carbon dioxide capture technology. It separates carbon dioxide gas with the help of membrane material. It has the characteristics of high efficiency, energy saving and simple operation.
How to make the membrane material " breathe deeply " and improve the efficiency of gas separation is the bottleneck to capture carbon dioxide by membrane separation method.
The scientific research team of Tianjin University has innovative ideas to explore the influence of different solvents on the gas separation performance of the membrane through repeated experiments.
Experimental results show that using N-methylpyrrolidone as the preparation solvent, the carbon nanotubes are more evenly distributed and " more breathable, " effectively improving the gas separation efficiency and rate of the membrane material.
The carbon dioxide separation performance of the mixed matrix membrane prepared by this new technology is close to the theoretical separation limit of this kind of membrane material.
" The new technology provides new ideas for capturing carbon dioxide by membrane separation. "
Li Run, a member of the atmospheric environment and bioenergy team of Tianjin University, said, " We hope that this technology can provide strong support for the future treatment of flue gas by coal-fired power plants and chemical enterprises, and play an important role in controlling greenhouse gas emissions.

Experts reminded that before volunteering, you must carefully read the Admission Regulations of your favorite schools and understand the admission rules of colleges and universities, including the adjustment ratio, professional allocation rules, etc.
Speciality allocation rules mean that after the adjustment of grades in colleges and universities, there are three main ways for professional admission: professional priority, score priority and professional grade difference.
The specific method used by colleges and universities will be specified in the Admission Regulations.
However, the admission principle of some colleges and universities is that the total score is preferred, and there is no grade difference between majors.
In other words, candidates within the admission range will be queued according to the total score. When the score does not reach the voluntary admission line for the first major, it will see whether the voluntary admission line for the second major has been reached, and so on until the last professional volunteer is admitted, there is no grade difference between the professional volunteers.
The so-called " professional grade difference " means that institutions, when arranging candidates' specialties, determine the admission specialties of volunteer candidates for different specialties according to one or more points published in the admission regulations. This score value is the " professional grade difference. "
That is, the difference between the scores of the first professional volunteer and the non-first professional volunteer in the admission of candidates by colleges and universities, and the difference between the grades of volunteers in each major, such as 3, 2, 1, etc.
For example.
It is assumed that student Xiaoming applied for A University and scored 560 points, and his professional volunteers are as follows: computer, international trade, automation, mechanical engineering and e-commerce. The professional admission of A University adopts the method of professional grade difference, and the grade difference is divided into 2, 1, 1 and 0.
At the time of professional allocation, if Xiaoming's volunteer for the first major meets the professional admission requirements and the major has a planned balance, then Xiaoming will be admitted to the " computer " major; if the computer is not accepted, his score will be reduced by 2 points, and the score of 558 points will be ranked with the candidates who volunteer for the " international trade " of the first major to determine whether they meet the professional admission requirements; if they still cannot be met, the score will be reduced by 1 point (i.e. 557 points) for the voluntary " automated " admission of the third major; if they still cannot be met, the score will be reduced by 1 point (i.e. 556 points) for the admission of the fourth major, and if the subsequent major is still unable to meet their professional volunteers, the score will not be reduced, and so on.
Different professional grade differences in different universities
With the popularization of parallel volunteering, many colleges and universities have now eliminated the professional grade difference, but some universities have retained this method this year. Judging from the Admissions Regulations published by each university, more than 20 universities have set up the professional grade difference this year.
For example, Sichuan Agricultural University, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Heilongjiang University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Jiangxi Normal University, Chengdu Medical College, Northeast Electric Power University, Jimei University, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing University of Technology, Ningxia University, Shandong University of Technology, China Civil Aviation Flight Academy, etc.
In these universities, each university has a different professional grade difference.
Some colleges and universities have grade differences in each major, such as the University of Ningxia. The candidates whose files have been submitted to the university are admitted according to the order in which the candidates submit their professional volunteers by one point and then admitted according to the order of scores.
Some universities have set different professional grades between different majors.
For example, at Jimei University, the total grade difference between professional volunteers is 4 points, that is, the grade difference between first professional volunteers and other professional volunteers is 3 points, there is no grade difference between other professional volunteers, which is regarded as parallel volunteers, and the professional grade difference between other professional volunteers and transfer professional volunteers is 1 point.
When volunteering, candidates and their parents must carefully read the admission policies of the reported schools to see if there is any professional grade difference and what the form of grade difference is. While giving full consideration to the scores, they should also make a reasonable analysis of the schools and majors to be selected. If institutions clearly adopt the method of grade difference in their admission rules, candidates should pay attention to the gradient between the various majors and improve the chances of admission.

People in Chengdu gather to watch the US consulate police stop people from " looking too happy "
In response to the US closure of the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, China announced the closure of the US Consulate General in Chengdu on Friday.
The US consulate's badge was removed on Saturday and a dark glass car left the consulate amid the boos of passers-by on Sunday.
On Sunday, many people from Chengdu gathered to take photos in front of the US Consulate. Those who had not come also came to see them because of current affairs curiosity.
A reporter from the Agence France Presse Chengdu station also made an observation near the US Consulate in Chengdu and sent back the news that there was a steady stream of curious people, and many parents took their children for a walk to watch the consulate, take pictures of the buildings, or take photos of themselves.
The consulate was surrounded by guards, and the police " corrected " people's behavior from time to time. They did not seem to allow any unusual behavior: a woman was stopped as soon as she was ready to sing a red song, and a guard confiscated a banner.
But residents of a nearby residential building successfully pulled up a giant Chinese flag on their balcony and shouted slogans in support of China.
The US Consulate in Chengdu opened in 1985 and covers all US consular-related affairs in southwestern China, especially the Tibet Autonomous Region.
A reporter from AFP Chengdu said that the Chinese government's response to the United States was relatively restrained: many Chinese online asked the government to close the US consulate in Hong Kong, but the official only said that " the closure of the US consulate in Chengdu is a necessary and legitimate response to the unreasonable behavior of the United States. "
At present, besides Chengdu, the United States also has consulates in Guangdong, Shanghai, Shenyang, Wuhan and Hong Kong in China.

At present, the Dongchuan District of Kunming is already hot in summer, and what is hotter than the weather is the pro-poor workshop next to the relocation settlement.
Lu Ling, an employee of Kunming Esford Electronic Technology, said, " Now, when you leave home, you enter the factory door and make money to take care of your family, thanks to the free vocational skills training provided by the trade union organization. "
Walking into the Dongchuan District Tongdu Street electronic components processing poverty alleviation workshop, a lively busy picture came into sight.
Lü Ling, in her 40s, is a single mother with her children alone and takes care of her elderly parents.
In her most difficult time, the Dongchuan District Federation of Trade Unions helped to come up with ideas and ways to " deliver coal in the snow " after running busy.
Since 2018, Lü Ling has enjoyed assistance policies such as housing, schooling, social security and employment, as well as assistance funds granted by trade unions at all levels.
This year, her child has successfully graduated and found employment. She also got a job and income after taking part in skills training, and was released from poverty at the end of April.
It is reported that the Dongchuan District General Organization's special skills training project to help alleviate poverty is part of the skills training work of the Yunnan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions.
Taking into account the characteristics of the difficult workers in the pro-poor relocation and resettlement sites in the area, the District General Administration has conducted an in-depth investigation to understand the training needs and determine the types of training. In the near future, it plans to train a total of 450 electricians, welders, face decorators, etc.
Recently, Li Yi, an employee of the Agricultural Bank of Yunnan Menglian County Branch, wrote a sincere thank-you letter to the County Federation of Trade Unions.
In her letter, she sincerely thanked the trade union for giving her golden autumn education money from August 2013 to January 2017 to help her complete her studies.
In 2004, Li Yi's father died in a car accident, and her mother was included in the files of workers in difficulty. Since then, she has enjoyed the care of the policy.
With the help of the local trade union, Li Yi successfully completed her studies.
Since 2016, 3,809 households have been lifted out of poverty through institutional guarantees and precise assistance.
The successful relief of Lü Ling's family and Li Yi is a microcosm of the work of Yunnan trade unions to promote the relief of workers in difficulty.
According to Duan Kaiyuan, a staff member of the Legal and Human Rights Work Department of the Yunnan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the province has strengthened the dynamic management of the files of workers in difficulty, promoted the normalization of file-building work, and promptly integrated the workers in difficulty who meet the conditions for file-building into the assistance system; broadened the application channels for workers in difficulty, and opened an online file-building service platform for workers in difficulty using WeChat to make it easier for workers in difficulty to declare on their own initiative in a timely manner.
During the epidemic, it was difficult to go out to work. In order to help workers in difficulty alleviate the pressure of their lives, Yunnan Province arranged a total of more than 13 million yuan to send warm funds, and carried out special warm sympathy activities to more than 6,000 households at the national level and more than 1,000 households at the provincial level, in accordance with the standards of 2,000 yuan per household for workers in difficulty at the national level and 1,500 yuan per household for workers in difficulty at the provincial level.
At the same time, the Provincial General Administration connects with various Internet recruitment platforms such as social security departments and smart union recruitment, pushes recruitment information to workers in difficulty, and provides employment consultation, employment guidance and other services.
