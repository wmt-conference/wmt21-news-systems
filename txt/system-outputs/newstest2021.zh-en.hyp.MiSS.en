Where to find talents?
Outstanding returning migrant workers are an indispensable new force.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 26 th: Turning outstanding returning migrant workers into a new force for rural revitalization
Zhang Xiong, 34, lives in Guoyuan Village, Meishan City, Sichuan Province. In 2010, he quit his job in Beijing with a monthly salary of tens of thousands and returned home to start a business.
After several years of hard work, the annual income of the grape growing family farm he runs now exceeds one million yuan, and he has become a well-known leader in getting rich. He has also been selected into the "two committees" of the village.
In recent years, inspired by a series of policies to support agriculture and benefit agriculture, such as national poverty alleviation and rural revitalization, more and more outstanding migrant workers like Zhang Xiong have chosen to return home to start businesses, activating a pool of spring water in the countryside.
Sichuan, a province with a large population in western China and a large labor export province, has implemented the "Excellent Migrant Workers' Return Training Project" according to the situation. In 2019 alone, more than 8000 village party branch secretaries were produced from the returned outstanding migrant workers, 61,000 village reserve forces were cultivated, and more than 20,000 party members were recruited, providing a strong guarantee for winning the battle against poverty and implementing the rural revitalization strategy.
Whether a well-off society is not well-off depends on the villagers.
Since the reform and opening up, a large number of young and middle-aged laborers in rural China have gone out to work to increase their income, and some have set up their own enterprises through hard work.
However, objectively, it also leads to the emergence of "hollowing out" in rural areas to varying degrees, especially the weakening of rural grass-roots organizations. The village party branch secretaries and party members all show the characteristics of "one old and one low", that is, aging, low academic qualifications, weak leaders of village party organizations, and outstanding problems.
If rural talents and other factors have been flowing to cities in one direction, and the countryside has been in a state of "blood loss" and "anemia" for a long time, revitalization is empty talk.
Attracting those migrant workers who are capable, conscious and interested in serving their hometown, guiding them to return home to start businesses and become rich leaders, training them into party members and rural cadres on the basis of merit, and enriching the ranks of grassroots cadres is the fundamental solution to the problem that the ranks of rural party members and grassroots party organizations are green and yellow.
Excellent migrant workers can be attracted back, but they must be retained and done well.
In recent years, Sichuan has started with paying close attention to the party building of migrant workers, and on the basis of strict candidate criteria, established institutional mechanisms such as directional introduction, service guarantee, training and promotion, selection and use of outstanding migrant workers, so that they can improve their abilities, have security in their work, have hope in their lives, truly take root in the countryside, and have a sense of accomplishment in starting a business.
This year is the final year of the decisive battle against poverty. Talent is the key factor in the connection between poverty alleviation and rural revitalization.
Party committees and governments at all levels should attach great importance to the group of outstanding returning migrant workers, and through comprehensive measures, turn them into a task force and a new force that can be retained, fight and cannot be taken away, so as to provide strong organizational guarantee and talent support for rural poverty alleviation and development and revitalization.
Because of the epidemic, this year's college graduates are very special. On the evening of July 11, bilibili Summer Graduation Song Club brought a special live online performance to the graduates. Musicians such as Lao Lang, Pu Shu, Li Yuchun and Mao Buyi sent songs and blessings to the fresh graduates.
Well-known up host SealWu Wu Yifan also brought a "Wild Grass", which is a rap song adapted and created by him based on Lu Xun's prose poems of the same name, and is very popular among young people.
Due to the epidemic situation, many graduates failed to experience the ritual sense of picking ears and awarding degree certificates on the spot, so they transferred the ritual sense to the online.
Data show that the 2.5-hour concert has a peak popularity of more than 35 million live broadcasts.
"Follow your heart, seize the opportunity, regardless of the consequences, sometimes there will be unexpected gains."
Although it is a graduation song meeting, many songs also move non-fresh graduates.
"I really want to cry when I look at the whole game. Everyone's youth is full of beauty and regret, but it is worth remembering and must go on bravely."

The capital's natural ecology continues to improve, attracting wildlife cities to "settle down"
There are more than 500 species of wild animals in Beijing
(Reporter Wang Bin) Beijing Youth Daily reporter learned from the Municipal Bureau of Landscaping and Greening that in recent years, with the continuous improvement of the capital's natural ecological environment, the species and quantity of wild animals have also continued to increase.
At present, the number of terrestrial vertebrate wild animals inhabiting Beijing has increased to more than 500 species, including brown pheasant, black stork and other national first-class protected animals, as well as impala, swan, grey crane, mandarin duck and other national second-class protected animals.
Whether planted in urban forests everywhere in the Second Ring Road or embedded in small and micro wetlands between buildings, it not only brings the wild interest of nature to the citizens of the capital, but also attracts wild animals to "settle" in the city.
In midsummer, Songshan National Nature Reserve, located in Yanshan Mountains in the northwest of Yanqing District, is full of vitality.
A raccoon dog is playing leisurely by the mountain stream, while two badgers are fighting with each other.
Looking back, a wild boar couldn't help scratching against the bark. Hu Qiaoli, director of the Songshan National Nature Reserve Management Office, said that by the end of 2019, in this green sea with a total area of more than 6,200 hectares, there are 178 kinds of wild animals, including the national first-class protected animal golden eagle and the national second-class protected animal spoon chicken and impala, and nearly one-third of the wild animal species in the city can be seen here.
"In Songshan, wild animals are the real 'masters', and our staff can only be regarded as other people's' bodyguards' at best."
Hu Qiaoli said that in order to understand the situation of wild animals and plants in the reserve on the spot, more than 30 professional patrol members patrol along 16 carefully formulated protection routes every day, and there will be a "big circle" every month, spending a whole day almost all over the reserve.
"During inspections, we should not only check and record biodiversity, but also check and install artificial bird nests, rescue injured wild animals, install field infrared cameras, and so on."
More than 200 infrared cameras have been installed in Songshan National Nature Reserve to record the living conditions of wild animals in the forest.
Hu Qiaoli introduced that with the continuous enrichment of biodiversity in the reserve in recent years, more and more wild animals appear in the camera, leopard cats, raccoons and pig badgers have become "resident guests", and the "appearance rate" of the national second-class protected animal Impala is also getting higher and higher.
Zhang Zhiming, director of the Wildlife and Wetland Protection Division of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Landscaping and Greening, said that the number of terrestrial vertebrate wild animals in Beijing has increased from 461 in 1994 to more than 500 now, and the species and quantity of wild animals in Beijing have continued to increase in recent years.
Wild animals are becoming more and more common in cities, which is closely related to the continuous upgrading of greening in the capital city in recent years.
In particular, the new round of afforestation and greening construction of one million mu starting in 2018 proposes to reshape the urban ecological environment, enhance the ecological function of forest land and green space, and highlight the concept of "near nature".
The planning strives to realize interconnection and interaction with the surrounding green space, so as to facilitate wild animals to "visit relatives and friends". The trees planted are also honey and food plants that animals like.
Black Land "Grows" Agricultural Modernizatio - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 26 th: Black land "grows" agricultural modernization
In midsummer, two pesticide spraying planes passed by the 10,000-mu high-yield demonstration field in the second operation station of the fifth management area of Friendship Farm, forming two white lines. The big characters "the first field in the world" planted with black rice seedlings in the green fields were particularly eye-catching.
Kong Lingqiang, the stationmaster of this operation station, said that this kind of plane can spray chemicals on more than 6,000 mu of cultivated land a day, and its efficiency is about 8 times that of unmanned aerial vehicles and hundreds of times that of manual work.
This farm is located in Youyi County, Heilongjiang Province, the largest grain-producing province in China. From the sound of rice cutting in the past to the sound of motors rumbling now, traditional Chinese farming and farms have transformed in this black soil belt.
In addition to airplanes, satellites are also used in the modern agricultural production of Friendship Farm.
Kong Lingqiang introduced that on the one hand, they use satellite remote sensing technology to achieve accurate fertilization, reduce agricultural investment and reduce pollution; on the other hand, satellite navigation technology can improve the standardized operation level of agricultural machinery in the field.
In this year's rice production process, the farm expanded the operating area of satellite navigation unmanned transplanting technology from 3,000 mu last year to 30,000 mu.
This technology makes seedling planting more uniform, maximizes the utilization of sunlight and cultivated land resources, and saves labor costs of 16 yuan per mu.
Farms try new technologies such as informatization and intelligence in agricultural production, forming the largest agricultural machinery group in China from the ground to the sky.
According to statistics, at present, the total number of agricultural machinery on the farm is 49,000 units (pieces), and the comprehensive mechanization rate in the field reaches 99.8%.
Agricultural machinery operations achieve 100% GPS satellite navigation, 100% precision sowing in dry fields, and 100% high-horsepower locomotive operations in dry fields.
"Green agriculture, smart agriculture and digital agriculture are the exploration directions of agricultural modernization."
Liu Hualian, director of Friendship Farm, said.
The key to agricultural modernization lies in scientific and technological progress.
In recent years, Heilongjiang Land Reclamation, represented by farms, has played a demonstration and leading role in modern large-scale agriculture "aircraft carrier", and initially established a modern agricultural industrial system dominated by large-scale planting, standardized production and industrial management.
In the suburb of Youyi County, there is an agricultural machinery Expo Park covering an area of 350,000 square meters.
More than 140 sets (pieces) of agricultural machinery introduced and used by Heilongjiang Land Reclamation over the years are on display here.
These agricultural machinery and farms have witnessed the development of China's agricultural modernization.

Xinhua News Agency reporters Chen Shangying, Wang Liwu and Liu Xiacun
At 4 o'clock in the afternoon on July 25, Fu Kunbao, wearing rubber shoes covered with mud, went from the front room to the back room and was busy packing things back and forth with his wife Zhou Yan.
"I received a call from the village cadre to transfer, and I was still weeding in the field."
Fu Kunbao said that he has transferred more than 60 mu of land and planted rice, and now he is growing well. "I also took medicine yesterday, and the tools have not been cleaned up."
Fu Kunbao pointed to the pesticide sprayer placed in the corner. "No one wants their home to be flooded, so let's give up the small home for everyone."
In order to cope with the continuous high water level pressure and possible heavy rainfall in Chaohu Lake, Hefei City, Anhui Province is preparing to open the flood diversion and storage of Jiangkou River Lianwei where Fu Kunbao's family is located on the 26th.
Jiangkou River Lianwei is located in Feixi County, close to Chaohu Levee.
There are thousands of villagers involved in Yandian Township and Sanhe Town who need to be transferred.
As of 16:00 on the 25th, the water level of Chaohu Lake, China's fifth largest freshwater lake, remained at a high level of 13.2 meters, exceeding the guaranteed water level by 0.7 meters.
Fu Kunbao's kitchen is clean, with a pot of pumpkin head vegetables on the table, eggs and some stewed vegetables in the refrigerator.
"I didn't expect to move. The water in Jiangkou River looks good at present."
Zhou Yan said that the home is a bungalow, and some large objects have not been decided where to put them yet.
"Pack up your valuables first. Large items such as refrigerators and televisions can be temporarily placed in high-lying neighbors or relatives."
Wang Liwen, a village cadre, gave Fu Kunbao advice.
Wang Liwen is responsible for the transfer and resettlement of 13 villagers, notifying and confirming each person's resettlement plan.
The nearest resettlement site from Fu Kunbao's home is Su Primary School in Yandian Township, about 2 kilometers away.
In addition to the big items, Fu Kunbao and his wife also had a headache of more than 1,000 catties of grain and some newly bought furniture.
"Food is ready to be dragged to relatives' homes, and furniture can't be moved."
As soon as the couple discussed, they put a stool under the newly bought bed and raised the bed by about half a meter.
At 6 pm, Fu Kunbao began to transport things to relatives' homes by tricycle, and Zhou Yan continued to clean up at home.

Zhang Jike Lin Xiaozhai Team Supports Muscular Teenager - Xinhuanet
Sports Youth Hot-blooded Competition Show "Sports Bar Youth" officially landed on Hunan Satellite TV on July 11.
Zhang Jike, the sports leader, and Lin Xiaozhai, the sports assistant, cross the border on the same stage. Lin Dan and Fu Yuanhui commented on each other with their own styles, and the hard core of the "monster" like power pulling device came on stage, which made the program "burning".
In the first episode, 11 sports teenagers appeared on the power track, and their appearance amazed the audience. At the same time, the "strong conflict", "strong confrontation" and "strong heart" on the arena also attracted attention.
Among them, the "strong conflict" comes from Qiao Wenyi, a super A sports student. Before the competition, he openly challenged Xu Zhibin, who is known as "beautiful boy" on the track, choking that Xu Zhibin's appearance conditions should sing and dance programs, and even released the vicious words of "Don't cry your makeup if you lose".
Some remarks made the teenagers and sports leaders on the court gasp.
The "strong confrontation" is more like a fairy fight. Sun Jianqi, known as the "Great Demon King", meets Zhang Xindong, who is also strong, and staged a strong confrontation.
Their identities are also unexpected. Sun Jianqi is an actor who loves fitness, while Zhang Xindong is a retired special operations member and a three-time winner of the Warrior Medal.
At the beginning of the competition, the two teenagers tried their best to pull out the small pole quickly, and the lasting confrontation on the big pole made the audience sweat for them.
Under the tense competition conditions, Zhang Jike, as one of the sports leaders of "Sports Bar Youth", also watched the game carefully.
In the comment session, he was also very careful, patiently encouraging the teenager who lost the game and helping every mistake in the process of resuming the game.
Lin Xiaozhai, a sports assistant, is a fancy assist, and she makes no secret of her appreciation for the teenagers who are online.
When learning about the overloaded daily training of sports teenagers, they are even more admired.
Lin Dan and Fu Yuanhui, who are also sports leaders, have their own styles. One is a calm "prophet", and the other is a "wild girl" who dispels tension with a smile.
In addition, Ji Ke Junyi and Liu Ye, as sports assistants, have also created many hilarious topics around sports teenagers.
Church fire in Nantes, France: parish volunteers admit arson is usually kind and taciturn
BEIJING, July 26 According to foreign media reports, on July 18, the famous Cathedral of St. Peter and St. Paul, a treasure of religious and historical buildings in Nantes, France, was seriously damaged in a fire, and the grand organ was completely destroyed.
On the 26th local time, Nantes prosecutors announced that a parish volunteer in charge of security work in the cathedral had been charged with "arson and destruction".
He has admitted that he started the fire in the church.
According to the report, local prosecutor Senas said that the 39-year-old parish volunteer from Rwanda admitted that he set fire to three places in the cathedral at night.
The person's lawyer said that the arsonist now regrets doing such a thing.
This person entered France through asylum a few years ago, was sheltered in the parish where the fire occurred and taken in in the church.
Prosecutors pointed out that recently, he tried to renew his visa and was in dialogue with the police station.
However, the church said it still couldn't believe that this usually very kind, smiling but quiet believer would destroy the church he loved so much.
On the day of the fire on July 18, the volunteer had already been questioned and investigated by the police because of illogical problems in the narrative, but he was later released.
The picture shows firefighters rescuing at the scene.
On the evening of the 25th, because professional engineers in the laboratory of the Paris Central Police Department obtained new evidence, this person was arraigned again.
This time, the man admitted his arson.
According to reports, if convicted of deliberate arson and destruction, the suspect may face 10 years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros.
According to the report, the fire caused serious losses to St. Pierre and St. Paul's Cathedral. The organ in the church was completely burned down, and the stained glass window behind the organ was also seriously damaged.
Brunet, chief architect of French historic buildings, believes that it is conservatively estimated that the restoration of Nantes Cathedral will take at least three years.
Comprehensive news: US unilateralism undermines relations between the two countries. International public opinion supports China's countermeasures against the United State - Xinhuanet.
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26-Comprehensive Xinhua News Agency reporters abroad reported: On the morning of July 24, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the US Embassy in China that China had decided to revoke the establishment and operation license of the US Consulate General in Chengdu, and put forward specific requirements for the Consulate General to stop all business and activities.
International public opinion believes that the unilateral measures taken by the United States have caused serious troubles to Sino-US relations, and it is legitimate and necessary for China to respond to the unreasonable provocation of the United States and take countermeasures.
Andrés Borquez, director of the China Studies Center of the Institute of International Studies of the University of Chile, said that the unilateral measures of the United States have destroyed the bridge of understanding between the Chinese and American peoples and caused a crisis in the relations between the two major powers.
China's notification to the United States to close its Consulate General in Chengdu is a countermeasure to the unilateral measures taken by the United States and is in line with diplomatic practice.
Patricio Giusto, a professor at the Catholic University of Argentina and director of the Arab-Chinese Research Center, believes that the above decision by China is a legitimate and necessary countermeasure to the previous provocation of the United States, and is not aimed at ordinary Americans.
The United States tried to use pressure on China to cover up its ineffective response to the COVID-19 epidemic and divert the attention of the American people.
Bambang Suryono, chairman of the Asian Innovation Research Center, an Indonesian think tank, said that the provocative diplomatic stance adopted by the United States has caused serious troubles to Sino-US relations, which are facing severe challenges.
China's notification to the United States to close its Consulate General in Chengdu is a normal countermeasure and conforms to diplomatic practice. It not only reflects China's principled position of resolutely safeguarding its own interests, but also reflects the rationality, advantages and restraint of China's diplomacy.
Francis Semwenza, a commentator on current affairs in Tanzania, said that China's above decision is a legitimate and necessary response to the provocation of the United States.
Sino-US relations should return to normal, and the US side should take the initiative to improve relations with China and stop interfering in China's internal affairs.
The United States should focus on how to achieve win-win economic and political results with China and how to benefit the two peoples and the entire international community.
Ali Yusuf, executive director of the Sudan-based Federation of Arab-Chinese Friendship Associations, said that the countermeasures China was forced to take were a legitimate and necessary response to the unreasonable actions of the United States, in line with international law and the basic norms of international relations, and in line with diplomatic practice.
Earlier, the US request to close the Chinese Consulate General in Houston seriously violated international law and the basic norms of international relations.
It is hoped that the US side will rescind its previous relevant decisions and create the necessary conditions for bilateral relations to return to normal.
Singapore's Lianhe Zaobao published an editorial saying that the greater strategic intention of the United States is to contain China and prevent China from continuing to rise.
Facing the pressure of the United States, although China is very reluctant to see Sino-US relations continue to deteriorate, it has to take countermeasures.

Hurricane "Hannah" makes landfall in Texas or causes river surge and flash flood - Chinanews.com
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -According to comprehensive foreign media reports, Hurricane "Hannah" landed in Texas at 5:00 p.m. local time on the 25th, which will bring strong winds and torrential rain, soaring river water and possibly life-threatening flash floods to Texas.
The National Hurricane Center said Hurricane Hannah is expected to carry heavy rain across parts of southern and northeastern Texas, which may cause some streams to surge and life-threatening flash floods.
According to the report, the area most seriously affected by Hurricane Hannah is from the south of Corpus Christi to the mouth of the Rio Grande River, and large-scale flash floods may break out in the Rio Grande Valley.
Texas Governor Abbott said on the 25th: "Any hurricane is a huge challenge."
Thirty-two counties in the state entered a disaster emergency because of the hurricane.
Corpus Christi, a city with a population of more than 320,000, has closed libraries and museums, and residents are waiting.
Abbott also said that at a time when Texas is being hit hard by the COVID-19 epidemic, the hurricane cannot be allowed to bring more casualties to Texas.
According to reports, rainfall in southern Texas is expected to reach 6 to 12 inches on the night of the 26th, and 3 to 5 inches of rainfall will also occur in northern Texas and coastal areas of Louisiana.
Due to global warming and other factors, "Hannah" formed earlier than the previous Atlantic hurricane season.
Under normal circumstances, the first hurricane in the Atlantic usually does not form until mid-August.
Poland to withdraw from European treaty to prevent violence against women
Poland will take steps next week to withdraw from the European Treaty on the Prevention of Violence against Women, the Polish Ministry of Justice said Saturday.
Poland's right-wing government cabinet said the treaty required schools to teach students about gender issues, trampling on the rights of students' parents.
Polish Justice Minister Joblo held a press conference and said that his Ministry of Justice will ask the Ministry of Labor and Family to begin withdrawing from the treaty on Monday.
That treaty is also known as the Istanbul Convention.
Giobro said, "The treaty contains some elements that we think are harmful."
Poland's ruling Law and Justice Party and its ruling coalition partners have a close alliance with the Roman Catholic Church and advocate a conservative social agenda.
Polish President Duda made hostility to gay rights one of the main issues during his successful re-election campaign this month.
On Friday, thousands of Poles, most of them women, protested against withdrawal from the convention in Warsaw and other cities.
"The purpose of withdrawing from the treaty is to legalize domestic violence," Lempat, one of the organizers of the protest, said in a protest march in Warsaw.
Some protesters held banners that read "Law and Justice Party is a hell for women."
The Law and Justice Party has long complained about the Istanbul Convention.
Poland's previous centrist government ratified the convention in 2015.
The Law and Justice Party government said the treaty does not respect religion and requires liberal social policies to be taught in schools.
But so far the party has not decided to withdraw from the convention.

At present, the first two upgraded Wuzhika-52M are undergoing transformation and replacement at the Far East Helicopter Manufacturing Plant of Russia's "Progress" Aerospace Corporation, and its national testing and improvement work will be completed before October 2022.
According to Russian experts familiar with the above upgrade work, Wuzhika-52, the "predecessor" of "Super Alligator", was officially installed in November 2011. Some weaknesses were exposed in the use of this model, and this transformation and upgrade is just to "fill the shortcomings".
The report said that compared with the Ka-52, the Ka-52M will partially use new protective materials that will not increase weight, and its pilot cockpit will be strengthened and equipped with new equipment to resist missile attacks, thus increasing the probability of battlefield survival; assemble more powerful generators to power more complex airborne electronic equipment; upgrade the photoelectric system to be able to detect and identify battlefield targets farther apart; equipped with mainly attacking armored combat vehicles and reinforced concrete fortifications, the new light multi-purpose missile has a range of 20 kilometers, which is about twice the range of similar missiles used by Russia's active military forces; its defense weapons and communication equipment will be used to the greatest extent with Mi-28NM helicopter gunships that can attack air targets, thus making related maintenance simple and economical.
In addition, the Ka-52M will have more advanced electronic guidance systems, weapon targeting systems and navigation equipment.
Russian experts also said that it is worth paying attention to that the Ka-52M will be equipped with communication equipment to communicate with unmanned aerial vehicles, so as to obtain information transmitted by nearby unmanned aerial vehicles in real time in the air, such as displaying images taken by unmanned aerial vehicles on the cockpit screen of the helicopter.
According to the plan, the pilots of the Ka-52M can directly control the unmanned aerial vehicles that cooperate with them, thus improving the pilots' mastery of the battlefield situation and guidance of long-range missiles.
According to Russian media reports, Russian Deputy Defense Minister Krivoruchko said in December last year that the Russian Defense Ministry plans to purchase more than 110 Wuzhika-52Ms by 2027.

Xinhua News Agency, Shijiazhuang, July 26 (Reporter Wang Kun) The reporter learned from the Hebei Provincial Water Resources Department that since the beginning of this year, Hebei Province has made overall use of river diversion water and local reservoir water, and successively implemented ecological water replenishment to 28 rivers such as Hutuo River, Tanghe River and Juma River and Baiyangdian Lake, completing a total of 1.75 billion cubic meters of ecological water replenishment for rivers and lakes.
Hebei Province firmly grasped the favorable opportunity of increasing the flow of water in the Middle Route of South-to-North Water Transfer Project, and implemented ecological water replenishment to Tanghe River, Shahe River, Zhulong River and other rivers by using river diversion water.
At the same time, nine large and medium-sized reservoirs such as Xidayang and Dongwushi and Baiyangdian Lake have been used to replenish ecological water to Fuyang River, Qinglong River and other rivers, forming a cumulative water surface area of more than 90 square kilometers.
In order to do a good job in ecological water replenishment, Hebei Provincial Water Resources Department actively organized the investigation of hidden dangers of water replenishment rivers, remediation and reinforcement, and river cleaning, refined practical measures, and strengthened inspection, management and protection.
Through supervision and inspection and centralized unannounced visits, various problems were solved in time to ensure the safety and order of river water replenishment.
According to the relevant person in charge of Hebei Provincial Water Resources Department, the orderly implementation of ecological water replenishment of rivers and lakes has effectively restored the ecological environment of rivers and lakes in Hebei Province, promoted the replenishment and conservation of groundwater along the coast, and greatly improved the living environment and economic development environment along the line. It is of great significance to realize the river and lake management and protection goal of "clear water, green bank, smooth river and beautiful scenery".
(Deutsche Welle Chinese Network) In the past two weeks, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Spain has risen sharply, with thousands of new cases in many days.
The British government temporarily decided on Saturday night (July 25) to remove Spain from the safe travel list from 0:00 local time on the 26th, and people entering the UK from Spain must be quarantined for 14 days.
British tourists on vacation in Spain expressed surprise, worry and even anger when they heard of the decision, because the news came suddenly and caught people off guard.
According to reports, British Transport Secretary Grant Shapps is also on vacation in Spain.
Before Britain issued the quarantine measures, Norway had also announced that people returning to Norway from Spain would be quarantined for 10 days.
France and Belgium have advised their residents to abandon their plans for a holiday in Barcelona and surrounding areas ahead.
The beaches in these areas are overcrowded and people cannot keep social distance. At one time, the police needed to take measures to reduce the number of beach tourists.
Tourism is an important pillar industry in Spain
Spain: It's safe here
In response to the British decision, the Spanish Foreign Ministry said on Sunday that the epidemic situation in the country was under control.
Spanish Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya stressed to the media: "Spain is safe, not only for Spaniards, but also for tourists."
The Spanish government will try to persuade the British government to exclude the Balearic Islands and Canary Islands from the quarantine measures.
The reason is that the infection rate in these two tourist resorts is far lower than that in Britain.
In order to prevent the spread of the epidemic, Spain's Catalonia region has also restarted the "grounded order".
Tourism is an important pillar industry in Spain, and Spain is one of the most popular holiday destinations for British tourists.
The British decision is expected to greatly affect Spain's tourism industry.

Engine may stall FAA urgently ordered to check 2,000 Boeing airliner - Xinhuanet
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an emergency airworthiness directive on the 24th, requiring an emergency inspection of about 2,000 Boeing 737NG and 737Classic passenger planes registered in the United States, because the corrosion of the air check valves of the above-mentioned passenger planes may cause the engines to stop in the air.
The FAA said that so far, it has received four reports of engine parking of 737NG and 737Classic passenger aircraft in the air, so it has made emergency inspection requirements. The inspection targets are passenger aircraft parked continuously for 7 days or more and passenger aircraft that have flown less than 11 times so far after re-entering the flight.
The FAA warned that if the level 5 check valves of all two engines of the passenger plane are corroded, they may get stuck in the open position, causing the passenger plane to completely lose power and unable to restart the engine.
The aviation regulator ordered that once the check valve is found to be corroded, the airline operator must replace this key component before the passenger plane is put into use again.
Boeing responded later in the day that the COVID-19 outbreak reduced travel demand, resulting in many passenger planes being sealed or used less, and "check valves are more likely to be corroded."
Boeing also said that it has advised airline operators to inspect the passenger planes involved in the instructions, and if problems are found, Boeing will provide assistance in overhauling and replacing check valves.
The Associated Press reported that passenger planes owned by major US airlines usually fly multiple times a day, but after the COVID-19 outbreak, a large number of passenger planes were grounded; with the slow growth of passenger travel demand recently, some passenger planes have been put into operation again.
The FAA did not release the details of the four air parking reports.
Alaska Airlines disclosed one of the incidents later on the 24th.
The airline operator said in a statement that one of its passenger planes was en route from Seattle, Washington to Austin, Texas on July 15 when an engine suddenly stalled and the passenger plane finally made an emergency landing at Austin Airport.
Alaska Airlines said it had replaced the engine of the passenger plane and had inspected the engines of six passenger planes in accordance with FAA instructions.
American Airlines, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines said on the 24th that their passenger planes did not have engine flameout associated with air check valves.
Four American Airlines passenger planes will be inspected, and 28 United Airlines passenger planes will be inspected.
Delta Air Lines said it would inspect its 20 passenger planes, but did not say whether there had been engine flameout.
Many media reported that the FAA's emergency airworthiness directive is another impact on Boeing.
A Boeing 737MAX passenger plane of Indonesian Lion Airlines and Ethiopian Airlines crashed in October 2018 and March 2019 respectively, killing 346 people in total.
This series of passenger planes were subsequently grounded worldwide, stopped production in January this year and resumed production in May.
FAA Director Steve Dixon admitted in June that the FAA had "made a mistake" in regulating Boeing with regard to the 737MAX passenger plane.

"Blocking the South of the Yangtze River" Pursuing the Poetic "Yellow River Dream" - Chinanews.com
(China's Poverty Reduction Story) "Blocking the South of the Yangtze River" Pursuing the Poetic "Yellow River Dream"
China News Service, Yinchuan, July 26 (Yang Di) "The Jiuqu Yellow River is full of thousands of miles of sand, and the waves and winds are bumping from the end of the world."
The Yellow River, which aroused the lofty feelings of countless literati, gave birth to the beautiful and rich Ningxia Plain. Nowadays, Ningxia, which has the reputation of "blocking the south of the Yangtze River", is adhering to the concept of "ecological priority and green development" and pursuing the poetic "Yellow River Dream".
River Qingshui Xiu's "Blue Wave Dream"
"The Yellow River in the world is rich in Ningxia", and the Yellow River flows through Ningxia for 397 kilometers, which is the "mother river" for raising one side.
However, with the rapid advancement of industrialization and urbanization, the development, utilization, management and protection of rivers and lakes are out of balance, and chaos such as excessive sewage discharge, reclamation of lakes and encroachment on water areas are highlighted, resulting in black and smelly water bodies, excessive water quality, dirty environment and ecological degradation.
Now, Ningxia is promoting the diversified restoration of water ecology and striving to make the Yellow River beautiful and clear.
Water control should start from the source.
In Yinchuan, Ningxia, the local government adopted the method of "standard raising + pollution control + strict management". All sewage in the industrial park was treated centrally, all urban sewage treatment plants were discharged according to Class A standard, and black and smelly water bodies in urban built-up areas were basically eliminated. The third batch of China's black and smelly water demonstration cities were successfully declared.
In addition, Ningxia fully implemented the river and lake length system in 2017, and now it has achieved full coverage of the five-level river and lake length system in districts, cities, counties and villages, and river and lake length patrol has become the norm.
Gu Jincheng, 64, lives in a village by the Yellow River. He witnessed the changes of the Yellow River: "The water used to smell bad, but after remediation, the smell disappeared."
Gu Jincheng said that the ecological environment is better and his life is more comfortable. Now he often goes for a walk along the Yellow River with his family to feel the clear water and blue sky.
Sha Ou Xiangji's "Wetland Dream"
Birds, green trees, plank roads, clear water... The beautiful scenery of Fan Zhongyan's "Sha Ou Xiangji" has become a reality in the Yellow River Wetland Park in Yinchuan, Ningxia.
The Yellow River flows through Ningxia, forming river wetlands, lake wetlands, marsh wetlands and other wetlands along the way, which plays an important role in promoting the rational utilization of water resources and water ecological balance, and has also become an important bird migration channel in the world.
Since 2009, relevant departments in Ningxia have invested about 3.45 billion yuan in wetland protection projects. At present, Yinchuan wetland covers an area of 19,200 hectares, with a wetland protection rate of 78.5%. There are nearly 200 natural lakes and swamp wetlands, with 5 national wetland parks, 1 national urban wetland park, 6 autonomous region-level wetland parks and 8 municipal parks.
Lu Jinhu, deputy director of Yinchuan Wetland Protection Center, told reporters that wetland protection has increased biodiversity, especially in birds. "The gull is an endangered bird, with only more than 20,000 in the world, of which Yinchuan Wetland is inhabited. More than 2,000."
At the same time, Ningxia has demarcated a red line of 500 meters for the wetland protection area on both sides of the Yinchuan section of the Yellow River according to law, stipulating that no unit or individual is allowed to carry out development, construction and business activities within the scope of protection except for public welfare projects.
Zhao Shaoyong, deputy director of Yinchuan Water Conservancy Service Center, said that through pollution source control, comprehensive improvement of river and lake ecology, and terminal wetland construction, the water quality of nine main drainage ditches in Ningxia has reached Class IV standard by 100%. "Now the water is clear, the fish are swimming, and the flowers are blooming."
The "Drinking Water Dream" of Inclusive People's Livelihood
Yinchuan City in Ningxia once had an "embarrassing" title: the only city along the Yellow River that "guards the Yellow River and lacks water to drink".
Since 2010, Yinchuan City has been facing the problem of persistent water shortage at the peak of summer. The "pain of water shortage" in the past ten years has become a painful summer experience for many high-rise residents. However, under the current situation that major water sources are at the limit of over-exploitation and a large area of groundwater over-exploitation funnel area has been formed underground in the urban area, water shortage from water sources has become a difficult problem that puzzles Yinchuan City.
Thanks to the improvement of the water quality of the Yellow River, drinking purified Yellow River water has become a good way to solve the drinking water problem of local residents.
Ding Ming, deputy director of Yinchuan Water Affairs Bureau, said that in order to improve the living and production water demand of urban and rural residents in Yinchuan, Ningxia started the water supply project on the west line of urban and rural areas in Yinchuan metropolitan area in due course, replacing the original underground water
"On December 29, 2019, the water supply project officially supplied water to the three districts of Yinchuan City. In 2020, residents of Minning Town and Helan County also drank the Yellow River water."
Ding Ming said that the Yinchuan water resources department will consider the transformation of the integration of regional rural drinking water and urban water supply as a whole. "In the next step, we will integrate all the scattered water supply points in rural areas and connect them to the western water supply project. It is expected that the integrated urban and rural water supply in Yinchuan will be basically realized by the end
Compaction responsibility departments strengthen flood control and disaster relief wor - Chinanews.com
Compaction responsibility departments strengthen flood control and disaster relief work
CCTV news (news broadcast): According to the news from the Ministry of Water Resources, at 12:00 today (July 25), the super-warning water level in the reach below Wangjiaba, the main stream of Huaihe River, was 0.64 ~ 3.31 meters, and the super-warning water level in the reach below Shashi, the main stream of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the two lakes was 0.05 ~ 2.02 meters.
Taihu Lake has lasted for 28 days since it exceeded the warning water level on June 28.
At 12 o'clock today, the average water level of Taihu Lake was 4.67 meters, exceeding the guaranteed water level by 0.02 meters.
Today, after consultation and judgment, the National Defense General decided to continue to maintain the Class II response to flood control in the Yangtze River and Huaihe River, requiring all localities to compact their responsibilities and further implement various flood control and disaster relief work.
Today, the National Defense Office and the Emergency Management Department urgently dispatched professional drainage vehicles from Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Fujian to help Jiangxi solve the local urban waterlogging problems caused by heavy rainfall.
For the first time, the United States launched a countervailing investigation against China with "undervalued RMB exchange rate"
In response to the recent announcement by the US Department of Commerce that it has decided to launch an anti-dumping and countervailing investigation on cable ties (cable ties) products originating in China and an investigation on the "undervalued RMB exchange rate" project.
China's Ministry of Commerce pointed out that this is the first time the United States has filed an investigation into the so-called "undervalued RMB exchange rate" project in a countervailing case, which China firmly opposes.
China's Ministry of Commerce issued a special press release on the evening of the 23rd, saying that China implements a managed floating exchange rate system based on market supply and demand, adjusted with reference to a basket of currencies, and the market plays a decisive role in the formation of the exchange rate.
The press release stressed that on the whole, the RMB exchange rate is at a reasonable and balanced level and has not been underestimated.
Since 2005, the RMB has appreciated by more than 17% against the US dollar.
According to data released by the Bank for International Settlements, from the beginning of 2005 to May 2020, the nominal effective exchange rate of the RMB appreciated by 38% and the real effective exchange rate appreciated by 49%, making it the strongest currency in the G20 economy and one of the currencies with the largest appreciation in the world.
The Ministry of Commerce pointed out that the exchange rate issue is beyond the authority of members to conduct countervailing investigations in accordance with World Trade Organization rules.
The United States amended its laws and regulations in February this year to conduct countervailing investigations on other countries' exchange rates, which has been suspected of violating WTO rules and has been opposed by many parties.
According to the press release, even in accordance with US regulations, there are a large number of errors in the content of the applicant's complaint, which does not have the necessary countervailing elements such as financial assistance, benefit granting and specificity.
China urges the US to abide by existing international rules and stop conducting countervailing investigations into the so-called "undervalued RMB exchange rate".
Affected by the further rising tension in Sino-US relations, the offshore and onshore RMB exchange rates against the US dollar fell sharply in intraday trading on the 22nd, both falling below the 7.0 yuan mark against the US dollar.
Whether the US Department of Commerce's move is intended to push up the RMB is worth paying attention to.
The spot exchange rate of RMB against the US dollar rose above the 7.0 mark on the 23rd to close at 6.9961.
The official central parity of the RMB against the US dollar was lowered by 17 basis points to 6.9938 on the 24th.
With the gradual improvement of the epidemic situation, the film and television industry, which has been silent for nearly half a year, has gradually returned to normal.
A few days ago, the Organizing Committee of the 26th Shanghai TV Festival announced the shortlist of this Magnolia Award.
In terms of best actor and actress, powerful Mesozoic actors have an absolute advantage. Lei Jiayin, Chen Baoguo, Zhang Ruoyun, Sun Honglei and Huang Lei will compete for best actor, while Hai Qing, Ma Yili, Qin Hailu, Sun Li and Yan Ni will compete for best actress.
The results will be officially announced on August 7.
From the current point of view, starting from the topic of college entrance examination, the realistic educational TV series "Little Joy" depicting "Chinese Family" won a total of 6 nominations for "Best Chinese TV Series", "Best Director", "Best Screenwriter", "Best Actress" and "Best Supporting Actor / Actress".
The award of "Best Actor and Actor" has always been one of the focuses of attention from the outside world. This year's competition is also extremely fierce. The shortlisted actors and actresses are all powerful people. Chen Baoguo, Huang Lei, Lei Jiayin, Sun Honglei and Zhang Ruoyun will compete for "Best Actor".
Chen Baoguo, Huang Lei and Sun Honglei are all Mesozoic actors with profound qualifications. Lei Jiayin, 37, is also a powerful actor. Zhang Ruoyun, 32, is the youngest finalist.
In 2016, 34-year-old Hu Ge won the Magnolia Award for Best Actor for "Langya List", becoming the youngest emperor in the award. If Zhang Ruoyun can beat several other predecessors this year, it will set a new record.
The competition for the best actress was finally fixed among the mainstay actresses in the film and television industry, such as Hai Qing, Ma Yili, Qin Hailu, Sun Li and Yan Ni, and none of them were shortlisted.

The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology reported that in accordance with laws and regulations such as the Network Security Law, Telecommunications Regulations, and Regulations on the Protection of Personal Information of Telecommunications and Internet Users, third-party testing agencies have recently been organized to inspect mobile phone application software and urge enterprises with problems to make rectification.
The problems existing in these 58 apps include private collection of personal information, collection of personal information beyond the scope, frequent application for permission, excessive request for permission, difficulty in account cancellation, private sharing to a third party, and denial of permission.
The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology requires that 58 APP should complete the rectification and implementation work before July 30. If the rectification is not carried out within the time limit, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology will organize and carry out relevant disposal work in accordance with laws and regulations.
Zhongxin Jingwei reporter combed and found that behind the 58 apps notified, more than a dozen US stocks, Hong Kong stocks and A-share listed companies were involved.
For example, "Fangduoduo" is a product of Fangduoduo, a listed company in the United States. There are five major problems: collecting personal information privately, collecting personal information beyond the scope, sharing it with third parties privately, forcing users to use directional push function, and frequently applying for permission.

Lewis family: John Lewis is a soldier who fights for the weakest
John Lewis, a US congressman and civil rights fighter, was remembered as a soldier "fighting for the weakest" at a memorial service for him on Saturday (July 25).
Lewis's public memorial service has been held in Alabama since Saturday.
There were two memorial services on the first day.
At a public memorial service at Troy University in Alabama on Saturday, Lewis's five siblings and a grandnephew talked about him as a loving, fearless, family-oriented man.
Henry "Grant" Lewis, Lewis's youngest brother, said at the meeting: "He devoted his life to helping others."
Samuel Lewis said his mother had warned John "Don't make trouble, don't make trouble."
He added that John did not heed his mother's warning. He said: "We all know that John always gets into trouble, always gets into trouble, but that's because he insists on the right thing, which is a good trouble."
Lewis's brothers and sisters reminded the people at the memorial service that John's most famous argument was to create "good trouble", that is, to stir up trouble as long as it is for the sake of justice.
John applied to Troy University in Troy, Alabama, where he was born, but Troy University, an all-white school at the time, rejected his application.
John Lewis, who preached the gospel to chickens on his farm as a child, eventually received a degree in religion and philosophy from Fisk University.
Years later, the University of Troy awarded Lewis an honorary doctorate.
Senator Doug Jones from Alabama said that the current protesters are "protesting peacefully and non-violently", just as Lewis did in the civil rights movement.
Jones said: "Even if President Trump knocked over a boat of people and described all the protesters as thugs, he was wrong.
The protesters are patriots who want the United States to move towards a more equal country. "
A six-day series of activities in memory of Lewis will culminate in a funeral in Georgia this week.
Lewis's coffin was parked at a public memorial service at the University of Troy on Saturday, and people came to pay tribute to the pioneer of the civil rights movement.
Later Saturday, a private ceremony paid tribute to him in a chapel in Selma, Alabama, followed by a public memorial service.
On Sunday, Lewis's body will pass the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma.
In 1965, he and demonstrators demanding black voting rights were severely beaten by Alabama police in front of this bridge, and the police also fired tear gas on the demonstrators.
Lewis was almost killed.
This day will be called "Bloody Sunday" in the future.
Lewis's body will be transported to Montgomery, the capital of Alabama.
Mayor Steven Reed encouraged people to line up on the sidewalk to complete the final journey with Lewis.
At the same time, officials require the public to wear masks and keep social distance when participating in activities.
Alabama Governor Kay Ivey ordered flags to be flown at half-mast on Saturday and Sunday in memory of Lewis.
During the nearly week-long commemoration, Lewis's body will be placed in the Alabama Capitol in Montgomery, the Georgia Capitol in Atlanta, and the U.S. Capitol in Washington for public mourning.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced last week that people can come to the U.S. Capitol on Monday and Tuesday to pay tribute to Lewis.
Due to the coronavirus epidemic, a public event to mourn Lewis will be held outdoors.

Recently, General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized during his inspection tour in Jilin Province that it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of the Party, promote the extension of Party organizations to the grass-roots level, improve the working system of grass-roots Party organizations, and provide a strong guarantee for the governance of urban and rural communities.
Adhering to the leadership of party building and implementing the party's leadership in all fields and links of grass-roots governance is the directional and fundamental requirement for doing a good job in grass-roots governance.
To improve the level of grass-roots governance, we must adhere to the leadership of party building, and promote the transformation of the party's political advantages, organizational advantages and mass work advantages into governance advantages by strengthening political leadership, building battle fortresses, and gathering red forces, so as to transmit the party's strength and propositions to the "nerve endings" and "the last kilometer".
Pay attention to calcium supplement and soul casting, and strengthen political guidance.
To strengthen the political guidance of grass-roots governance, we must implement the project of "supplementing calcium and casting soul" well.
It is necessary to thoroughly understand Xi Jinping's socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era as the primary task, take "Do not forget your initiative mind, keeping in mind the mission" as the eternal topic of party building and the lifelong topic of party members and cadres, strengthen the understanding of the principles of reading the original texts, and continue to promote the armed forces of the party's innovative theories to be practical through special training, batch training, discussion and exchange, holding lecture halls, etc., and promote party members and cadres to further enhance the "four consciousnesses", strengthen the "four self-confidences", achieve the "two maintenance", and better perform their duties and responsibilities.
Through the combination of online and offline learning methods, broaden the channels of learning and education, and guide grass-roots party organizations and party members and cadres to truly integrate learning and education into daily life and pay attention to it frequently.
Pay attention to practical training, in the process of resolving key and difficult problems in the field of grass-roots governance, solve the troubles and troubles that the masses are concerned about, and temper party spirit and ability.
Grasp the improvement of standards and build a fighting fortress.
Grass-roots party organizations are not only an important part of the grass-roots governance system, but also an important carrier for the demonstration of governance ability.
To promote the standardization construction of grass-roots party organizations, we should start with grasping the working regulations of the party branch, focus on the weakening and blurring of the leadership of the party organization, and consolidate the foundation, make up for shortcomings and promote development by establishing a linkage mechanism between the upper and lower levels, innovating the form of branch setting, normalizing and rectifying weakness and laxity, establishing and improving the decision-making and deliberation mechanism and serving the masses mechanism.
In rural areas, we should strengthen the standardization construction of village-level party organizations, standardize organizational forms, learning activities and management mechanisms in accordance with the standardization construction standards of party branches, and earnestly promote the detailed implementation of the system of "three meetings and one lesson" and thematic party day activities.
In cities, pay attention to street communities, explore innovative branch setting forms, focus on weak areas, "blocking points" and "pain points", and actively build urban party building alliances to achieve effective coverage of the party's work.
At the same time, establish and improve the governance system and mechanism of grass-roots governance, improve the decision-making and deliberation mechanism led by grass-roots party organizations, improve the mechanism for party members and cadres to contact and serve the masses, gather the hearts and minds of the people in serving the people, enhance the sense of gain, happiness, honor and pride of party members and the masses, and make grass-roots governance more warm.
Play a vanguard role and gather red power.
Grass-roots party members and cadres are the foundation stone of grass-roots governance.
To improve the governance ability at the grass-roots level, we should focus on improving the governance ability of grass-roots party members and cadres, giving full play to the exemplary and leading role of "red cells" in grass-roots governance, and gathering red forces at the forefront of contacting and serving the masses.
It is necessary to take the improvement of governance ability as a compulsory course for grass-roots party members and cadres, constantly strengthen ideological refinement, professional training and practical training, carry forward the spirit of responsibility in their posts and urgent, difficult and dangerous tasks, and lay a solid foundation and contribute to the modernization of the national governance system and governance ability.
It is necessary to extensively carry out the activities of "community whistle blowing and party members reporting for duty", and participate in community construction, management and service by participating in thematic party day activities, contacting people in difficulty, determining service items, claiming micro wishes, and putting forward reasonable suggestions, so that party members can play a role in community governance.
It is necessary to give full play to the role of unemployed party members in rural areas, and guide the majority of grassroots party members to actively participate in poverty alleviation, ecological construction, letters and visits to maintain stability, straw burning ban and other work by setting up vanguard posts for unemployed party members and setting up task forces for unemployed party members, so as to better integrate the red forces and serve the people.
If the foundation is solid, the building is firm.
Grass-roots party organizations are the foundation of the ruling building.
Only by insisting on strengthening the relationship between the party and the masses, increasing the well-being of the people, and taking the leadership of party building as the fundamental way to promote the innovation and development of grass-roots governance, can we build a solid foundation, let grass-roots party organizations pull out and stand up, and grass-roots party members and cadres catch up and rush up, and promote grass-roots governance to be "soul", orderly, powerful and effective.

Hoh Xil Tibetan antelope enters migration seaso - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, July 25 (Reporter Wang Jinjin) The reporter learned from the Wudaoliang Protection Station of the Hoh Xil Management Office of the Yangtze River Source Park of the Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration that monitoring showed that Tibetan antelopes that had migrated to the Zhuonaihu area in the hinterland of Hoh Xil were gradually ending their litter and began to return to their original habitat with their cubs.
Monitoring images near Wudaoliang Protection Station show that on July 25, about 40 female Tibetan antelopes led three Tibetan antelope cubs through 3002 kilometers of Qinghai-Tibet Highway and Wudaoliang North Bridge on Qinghai-Tibet Railway, and Tibetan antelopes have begun to move back.
According to expert analysis, in recent years, the number of Tibetan antelope cubs in the relocated sheep herd accounts for one quarter to one fifth of the total number of Tibetan antelope herds.
Lian Xinming, an associate researcher at the Northwest Plateau Institute of Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, said: "In the early stage of migration, Tibetan antelopes face a higher risk of being preyed, so the number of cubs in the flock will be relatively small, and there may even be no cubs."
According to the statistics of Hoh Xil Management Office of Yangtze River Source Park of Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration, the number of Tibetan antelopes has been increasing year by year. In 2019, the number of Tibetan antelopes was 4,860, an increase of 338 over 2018.
Lian Xinming said: "It is expected that this year's migration of Tibetan antelopes will end in early September, and the number of Tibetan antelopes is expected to continue to increase."
Tibetan antelope is a national first-class protected animal.
At the end of May every year, Tibetan antelopes from Sanjiangyuan in Qinghai, Qiangtang in Tibet, Altun Mountain in Xinjiang and other places go to Zhuonaihu in the hinterland of Hoh Xil to give birth to lambs.
Wu Xiaomin, an expert on Tibetan antelope protection in China and a researcher at Shaanxi Institute of Zoology (Northwest Institute of Endangered Animals), said: "The migration of Tibetan antelopes is a process in which female Tibetan antelopes return to their habitats one after another after giving birth. At first, the returning population leaving the litter site is relatively large, but then Tibetan antelopes will return to their respective habitats along different paths according to different geographical populations."
In order to ensure the safe relocation of the Tibetan antelope herd, the reporter learned that the Hoh Xil Management Office of the Yangtze River Source Park of the Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration has arranged staff to continuously carry out video monitoring and patrol in the main relocation areas.
If Tibetan antelopes are found trying to cross the highway, the mountain patrol team will carry out temporary traffic control as soon as possible to let the sheep pass through the wildlife passage safely and ensure that they are as little disturbed by human beings as possible on the way back.
So, how to relieve the summer heat in daily life?
Experts suggest that when going out in summer, try to avoid the high temperature period, and it is best not to walk or work in the hot sun around noon, because the sunshine is the strongest during this period, and the possibility of heatstroke is higher.
If you must go out at this time, you must do a good job of protection, such as playing a sunshade, wearing a sunshade hat, and wearing sunglasses. If conditions permit, it is best to apply sunscreen to prevent sunburn.
Clothes should be made of light-colored cotton, hemp and silk with good air permeability as far as possible, and chemical fiber clothing should be worn less, so as not to dissipate heat in time when sweating a lot and cause heatstroke.
In hot and sultry weather, prepare enough water to drink in time, and don't wait for thirst to drink water, because once you feel thirsty, your body is already short of water, and each time you drink 150 ml to 200 ml of water, drink warm boiled water, and don't drink ice water.
According to the temperature, the average person drinks 1.5 liters to 2 liters of water every day, while high-temperature workers drink 3 liters to 5 liters of water every day.
When sweating more, some salt water can be added appropriately to make up for the salt lost by sweating.
In addition, the human body is prone to potassium deficiency in summer, which makes people feel tired and tired. Potassium-containing tea is an excellent summer drink.
Eat more fruits and vegetables with high water content in summer, such as lettuce, cucumber, tomatoes, etc.; Fresh fruits, such as peaches, apricots, watermelons, melons and other water content is 80% to 90%, can be used to supplement water; Dairy products can not only replenish water, but also meet the nutritional needs of the body.
In addition, people working in high temperature environment should appropriately supplement drinks containing potassium, magnesium and other elements.
In summer, the days are long and the nights are short, the temperature is high, the metabolism of the human body is vigorous, the consumption is also large, and it is easy to feel tired.
Adequate sleep can relax all systems of the brain and body, which is not only conducive to work and study, but also a measure to prevent heatstroke.
Experts say the best time to go to bed is from 22:00 to 23:00, and the best time to get up is from 5:30 to 6:30.
Be careful not to lie under the air conditioning outlet and electric fan during sleep, so as not to suffer from air conditioning diseases and hot colds.
Experts suggest that people who are engaged in outdoor activities or high-temperature operations can carry heatstroke prevention drugs such as ten drops of water, Rendan, Huoxiang Zhengqi Water or Huoxiang Zhengqi Pills, or place them in the nearest workplace and use them at any time to prevent heatstroke.
Graduate Art Exhibition Moved into Shopping Mall Public Welfare Exhibitio - Xinhuanet
In the "cloud graduation" season of colleges and universities, a rare offline graduate art exhibition opened warmly last weekend.
However, it is neither in the art museum nor on campus, but in the public space of Chaoyang Joy City, which is open to the public free of charge and will last until August 23.
The reporter learned that this 2020 Graduate Art Exhibition collected 50 pieces / groups of works by 57 young artists from the Central Academy of Fine Arts, Communication University of China and Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts. The exhibition space extended from the second floor to the sixth floor, and made full use of the light box in the building to display graphic works, maximizing the artistic atmosphere of the graduation season.
Under the epidemic situation, the significance of this exhibition is particularly special.
Ge Ping, head of Meichen in Chaoyang Joy City, said frankly: "We have chosen to bring the graduation exhibition to the 'cloud' back to the offline space again. We also hope that more people can see young people's exploration of themselves and understanding of the world, and enlarge the healing power of art for society and the soul."
She revealed that the works exhibited this time were collected from graduates of several major art colleges, and selected from them suitable for commercial space display. The forms of the works range from traditional easel painting and sculpture to new media installations, interactive animation and VR panorama, with the highest volume and richness in history.
Among them, Li Yunxiao expressed his feelings in the epidemic through a mixture of mechanical and manual creative language in "The First Battle of 2020"; Liu Jiaying discussed the themes of "encrypted currency", "credit creation" and "transaction" through the work "Sound Money" created by the Ethereum blockchain; Zhang Jiaqi's "Cat Forest" and Qiu Daqiang's "Ji" show animals that are often accompanied by human beings, from which we can see young artists' understanding of the relationship between human beings and animals; Zhu Zhongyu's work "Winter of Faith-Gift" reminds growing young people, "When one day your career is successful, Do not forget your initiative mind, remember that simplicity and sincerity."
Among the few graduates who personally arranged the exhibition was Li Jingyin from the Sculpture Department of Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts.
"I came to Beijing on July 7. At that time, I was actually a little worried about the epidemic. I also did a nucleic acid test three days in advance. I brought alcohol cotton and test reports to the exhibition."
His work "Yesterday is a Mystery" has a complicated structure and must be done by himself.
At the same time, he also undertakes the task of helping his classmates repair damaged works.
"The exhibition was arranged until 4:30 in the morning, and then it was repaired. The time was very tight. I forgot to take a picture with the work, which was also a bit regrettable."
He hopes that when the epidemic situation is more stable, he and his classmates will come to Beijing to see his work exhibition.

Reward 50,000 yuan Hubei Enshi praised Shaziba landslide as "the first person to warn" - Chinanews.com
Hubei Daily News (Reporter Lin Jing) On July 26, Enshi City announced the praise of Chen Guangming, a geological disaster site monitor who made important contributions to the early warning of Shaziba landslide, and sent him a bonus of 50,000 yuan.
At the same time, party members and cadres in the city are called on to learn from his spirit of conscientious duty, daring to take responsibility, taking the initiative and being willing to give.
On July 21, a landslide occurred in Shaziba, Mazhe Village, Tunpu Township, Enshi City, which led to the formation of a barrier lake in the main stream of Qingjiang River. Chen Guangming, 58, was the first person to warn of the landslide.
On the afternoon of July 17, Chen Guangming learned that the walls of the villagers' homes were cracked and immediately went to the scene to check.
As soon as he walked five or six hundred meters from his home, he saw the village road split four or five centimeters, extending along the road to the corn field, about 50 meters in length.
Chen Guangming was suddenly alert and immediately sent photos of highway cracking to the township "geological disaster monitor contact group".
After on-site inspection and judgment by the relevant person in charge of Tunpu Township Natural Planning Institute, the possibility of landslide was very high, and the decision to evacuate the masses was made immediately.
Chen Guangming's timely warning won 36 hours of precious time for the safe evacuation of 1,339 people from 315 households in the affected area.
No one was killed or injured in this major geological disaster.
Chen Guangming's serious and responsible professionalism was praised by the masses.
In the face of praise, he said: "There is no one to save, this is my responsibility."
New drugs developed by Australian universities are expected to be used to treat vascular blockage caused by COVID-1 - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Sydney, July 26 (Reporter Chen Yu) Researchers at Monash University in Australia are developing a new drug that can help prevent heart disease and stroke, and hope that this drug can be used to treat vascular blockage caused by Novel Coronavirus.
Researchers have found that an enzyme in platelets accelerates platelet clotting before a heart attack or stroke.
Therefore, they developed a drug that can temporarily inhibit platelet coagulation, thus avoiding blood vessel blockage and preventing heart disease and stroke.
Researchers say the drug will only inhibit the clotting effect of platelets when there are signs of heart disease or stroke.
As studies have shown that similar vascular blockage is one of the main causes of death in severe patients in COVID-19, researchers hope that this drug can be used in the treatment of such severe patients in the future.
At present, the drug has achieved good results in animal model experiments, and researchers are preparing for the next stage of human clinical trials.
The research results have been published in the American journal Science Translational Medicine.
He became the first spectator to enter the CBA league after allowing spectators to watch the match live.
On the same day, in the second stage (Laoshan Division) of the 2019-2020 Chinese Men's Basketball Professional League (CBA) semi-finals held in Qingdao, Shandong Province, medical staff, teachers and public security front personnel entered the field to watch the match between Shanghai Jiushi Team and Shandong Xiwang Team after completing the relevant procedures including nucleic acid testing through the official ticketing platform.
During the watching period, spectators must wear masks all the way, take their seats according to the numbers, and keep their seats at a strict interval of one meter.
When exiting, the audience must leave the venue in an orderly manner, keeping the "one-meter line" social distance in the order from back to front, first on both sides and then in the middle.
Xinjiang deeply cultivates "sunflower fields" and makes good use of clean energ - Chinanews.com

China News Service, Hami, Xinjiang, July 26 th: Xinjiang deeply cultivates "sunflower fields" and makes good use of clean energy
More than 6,000 pentagonal heliostats, each 48 square meters, are arranged neatly in a circle, such as a silver "sunflower field", which rotates with the sun and reflects the sunlight to a heat absorption tower more than 200 meters high in the center to realize power generation.
The reporter saw this scene on the 25th at Hami Molten Salt Tower Photothermal Power Plant of CLP Project in Naomaohu Town, Yiwu County, Hami City, Xinjiang.
"The so-called molten salt tower photothermal power generation is to reflect sunlight through the mirror to the heat absorption tower to form heat energy, and then convert the heat energy into electric energy through traditional power generation technology."
Zhang Yong, deputy general manager of CLP Hami Solar Thermal Power Generation Co., Ltd., said that its design principle is similar to that of solar cookers used in rural areas in northwest China, which should gather sunlight.
The power plant started construction in October 2017 and was connected to the grid at the end of last year, covering an area of 6,600 mu. A total of 14,500 heliostats are planned to be installed.
"Compared with traditional solar power generation technology, its biggest advantage is that it can store the accumulated heat energy and generate electricity at night."
Zhang Yong said that the 13-hour heat storage system configured in the project can keep the generator set running continuously and stably without being affected by light changes; It can also quickly participate in power grid peak shaving according to the peak and valley demand of power grid load.
After the project is fully completed, it can achieve annual power generation of 198 million kWh, save more than 60,000 tons of standard coal, reduce emissions by more than 60 tons of sulfur dioxide, more than 60 tons of nitrogen oxides, about 20 tons of soot, and more than 150,000 tons of carbon dioxide, providing a steady stream of clean energy for the local area.
In addition, there is another silver "sunflower field" in Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park in Hami City.
Hami Fuguang Solar Photovoltaic Power Station covers an area of more than 2,300 mu, and 714 power generation equipment that have been built also follow the sun, always keeping the sunlight at a 90-degree right angle to the concentrating plate surface.
"We adopt dual-axis tracking concentrating power generation technology. Through unified integrated control, all power generation equipment will adjust the angle according to the height of the sun to maintain power generation efficiency."
Duan Mengqi, the stationmaster of the power station, said that under good weather conditions, the power generation technology can improve the efficiency of traditional photovoltaic power generation by about 20%.
In the first half of this year, the power station has generated more than 7 million kilowatt-hours of electricity, supplementing local electricity demand.
Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park is currently a photovoltaic industry demonstration park with the largest single scale and the most complete types of photovoltaic modules in Xinjiang. There are 38 photovoltaic power generation projects with a total installed capacity of 820,000 kilowatts.
In the first half of this year, the power generation exceeded 110 million kWh, an increase of 6% over the same period in 2019.
Hami is one of the regions with the best solar energy resources in China.
The annual average total solar radiation is more than 6,200 megajoules per square meter, and the annual sunshine hours are about 3,200 hours.
In recent years, the city has vigorously developed the photovoltaic industry and planted "sunflower fields".
More than 2.5 million kilowatts of solar power have been installed. In the first half of this year, the city's photovoltaic power generation exceeded 1.4 billion kWh, an increase of about 14% year-on-year.
At present, there are more than 330 grid-connected photovoltaic power stations in Xinjiang, with an installed capacity of over 10 million kilowatts.
It is estimated that photovoltaic power generation will reach 15 billion kWh this year, which can replace more than 6 million tons of standard coal.
Police report details of "female college students lost contact when traveling to Qinghai", search and rescue work continue - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, July 26 (Reporter Wang Jinjin, Zhou Zhe) Recently, "a female college student lost contact after traveling to Golmud, Qinghai" attracted netizens' attention.
The Public Security Bureau of Golmud City, Haixi Mongolian and Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province reported on the 26th that Huang Moumou, a student from a university in Nanjing, is still in a state of losing contact, and police in many places are going deep along the route where Huang Moumou lost contact and actively carrying out search work.
On July 10, 2020, the Public Security Detachment of Golmud Public Security Bureau in Haixi Prefecture received a notice from its superior that Huang Moumou, a student from a university in Nanjing, took the Z164 train from Nanjing to Golmud on July 5 and turned off his mobile phone and lost contact at the southwest area of Qingshui River in Sonandajie Protection Station, Qumalai County, Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province on July 9, asking for assistance in finding it.
According to the investigation of Golmud Public Security Bureau, Huang entered Qinghai Province at 19:54 on July 6 and arrived in Golmud at 4:00 on July 7.
At 8:00 on the same day, Huang Moumou, a missing person, took a taxi from the Yellow River Hotel in Golmud City to G109 National Highway, and arrived at Hoh Xil Sonandajie Protection Station at 12:00. The taxi driver returned alone. Huang Moumou arrived at Qingshui River area near Sonandajie Protection Station at 15:00 on the 7th and shut down in the area at 18:00 on the 9th.
In further investigation, the police found that Huang had passed the Naijigou checkpoint at 17:07 on July 13.
Naijigou checkpoint is a checkpoint set up by Nagqu City, Tibet Autonomous Region at Nanshankou, Golmud City. Because there is no video surveillance at the checkpoint, it is impossible to determine the information of myself and the vehicle. The police can only drive along the way to find and coordinate with the checkpoints along Tibet. If Huang Moumou is found, immediately contact Golmud Public Security Bureau.
According to the latest situation, at 1:00 a.m. on July 26, Golmud Municipal Public Security Bureau organized rescue forces to carry rescue equipment to search for the unfrozen spring protection station and Sonandajie protection station along the Qinghai-Tibet Highway, and actively contacted Sichuan police, Tibet police and Nanjing police to jointly carry out the work. At present, the search and rescue work is still continuing.
The local police hope that netizens and all sectors of society will provide relevant clues to Golmud police and Nanjing Jiangning police in time, so as to find the missing person Huang Moumou as soon as possible.
At the same time, relevant experts suggest that tourists should be standardized, rational and civilized in outdoor activities, pay attention to roadside warning signs at any time, do not venture into no man's land, and call the police in time in case of emergencies.
The US media uncovered the truth that the US unreasonably asked China to close its Consulate General in Housto - Chinanews.com

The US media uncovered the truth that the US unreasonably asked China to close its Consulate General in Houston
On the 24th, the Chinese Foreign Ministry informed the US Embassy in China that China had decided to revoke the license for the establishment and operation of the US Consulate General in Chengdu, and put forward specific requirements for the Consulate General to stop all business and activities, as a countermeasure to the US sudden request on the 21st that China close the Consulate General in Houston.
This behavior of the US government has aroused many concerns, and its political motives have been questioned by foreign media and scholars.
Why do you ask China to close the Consulate General?
Many foreign media said that it is not clear why the United States chose the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, but for the purpose of this move, the foreign media said bluntly: for the general election.
CNN reported on the 23rd that the US request for China to close its Consulate General in Houston has aroused public doubts about its political motives.
According to the article, the US government's disastrous response to the COVID-19 epidemic has caused President Trump's poll support rate to be relatively low before the election.
White House officials said privately that the tough strategy against China was to save Trump's approval rating, and at the same time to shift the responsibility of the White House's failure to deal with the epidemic.
The article believes that the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is a "politically driven and very cautious" target chosen by the United States, and the US government chose it "to create a tough attitude while avoiding the risk of major conflicts".
The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) also believes that at a time when the US election season is approaching and the US economy is severely hit by the epidemic, Trump believes that "playing the 'China card' has a political advantage".
The current situation is "a spiral and tit-for-tat struggle", which is driven by the US government from the perspective of domestic considerations to a certain extent, and will only worsen the tension between China and the United States.
CBS reported that Trump's re-election prospects are under pressure due to the outbreak, and he has repeatedly accused China of the epidemic.
Almost every day, the United States takes new actions against Trump's absurd argument that "China exploits the United States".
"The Consulate General of Houston is very important in establishing ties between the two countries."
The Associated Press commented that the United States' request for China to close its Consulate General in Houston has increased tensions between the world's two largest economies.
If the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is closed, in addition to diplomatic influence, Chinese citizens in the southern United States will face difficulties in obtaining consular services, as will American citizens seeking visas and other services.
A Houston business group expressed regret over the US request for China to close its Consulate General in Houston, saying that the Consulate General has played an important role in establishing trade, investment and cultural ties between the two countries.
The Associated Press believes that this reflects the importance of China's economy.
The website of US Foreign Policy magazine believes that the US move "is part of a series of provocative measures, which will only worsen US-China relations".
Reuters quoted Jonathan Pollack, an expert on East Asia issues at the Brookings Institution, a US think tank, as saying that since the establishment of comprehensive diplomatic relations between the United States and China in 1979, he could not think of any move comparable to the US action against the Chinese Consulate General in Houston.
Hong Kong's South China Morning Post reported that the US move was unprecedented in more than 40 years of diplomatic relations between China and the United States.
Analysts believe that this move may cause lasting damage.
The Chinese Consulate General in Houston, established in 1979, is the first Chinese Consulate General in the United States.
At present, China has an embassy and five consulates general in the United States.

On the same day, the Russian North Sea, Baltic Sea, Black Sea, Caspian Sea and Pacific Fleet held military parades in the waters where their respective bases were located, with 15,000 soldiers, 219 ships of various types and 71 military aircraft participating.
Russian President and Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces Putin attended the military parade of the Baltic Fleet.
About 4,000 soldiers, 46 ships and more than 40 fighter planes participated in the local military parade.
Putin first inspected the ship formation in the waters of the Kronstadt naval base in the Baltic Sea.
After that, he arrived in the waters of the Neva River in the center of St. Petersburg by speedboat and landed to watch the military parade held on the Neva River.
Putin said in a speech at the military parade that the modern technical level of Russian naval equipment has continued to improve in recent years, and the Russian navy will receive a total of about 40 new ships equipped with unique hypersonic strike systems in 2020.
In addition, Russian Navy Commander-in-Chief Yevmenov said in an interview with Red Star, the official newspaper of the Russian Ministry of Defense, that Russia's plan to build ships has been effectively implemented, and the number of new ships that the Russian Navy plans to receive in 2020 is relatively large in recent years.
In 1696, Tsar Peter the Great set out to form a maritime fleet, creating the history of the Russian navy.
The last Sunday in July every year is the Russian Navy Day.
In view of the new changes in epidemic prevention and control work, since July 17, trade unions at all levels in Xinjiang have responded to the call of the Autonomous Region Federation of Trade Unions and actively participated in epidemic prevention and control work.
Trade union cadres, workers and model workers from the north and south of Tianshan Mountains walked into street communities and residents to carry out activities such as delivering vegetables and medicines, disinfecting and sterilizing, and publicizing epidemic prevention knowledge, so as to serve the workers and demonstrate the "hard core power" of trade unions with practical actions.
Recently, the condolence group of Tianshan District Federation of Trade Unions in Urumqi sent a batch of urgently needed living materials for epidemic prevention and control to the staff of 12 isolation points.
After the outbreak of the epidemic, Tianshan District invested more than 1.05 million yuan at the first time, which was urgently allocated to 23 grass-roots trade unions directly under it.
After receiving the company's notice on epidemic prevention and control, Zhao Xiangguo, deputy secretary of the Party Committee and chairman of the trade union of China Construction Xinjiang Construction Engineering First Construction, volunteered to stay on duty in the unit to escort the employees.
He sent cooking utensils, food and daily necessities to the dormitory and new employees, and organized personnel to send them daily necessities every two days.
"Starting from July 21, cadres and workers who stick to the front line of the war 'epidemic' will be thoroughly investigated, and online orders will be placed and merchants will deliver goods to their homes. First, 704 front-line workers and masses in Urumqi will be supplemented with epidemic prevention supplies and daily necessities."
The person in charge of the Xinjiang Transportation Trade Union told reporters that in the face of a sudden epidemic, they made every effort to ensure epidemic prevention and control services, steadily promoted various work in the development of transportation, and created a strong atmosphere for fighting the "epidemic" together.
At present, it is high in summer, and trade unions at all levels keep a close eye on front-line workers in key areas for epidemic prevention and control, and put the care of "sending coolness" into practice.
On July 19, the Urumqi County Federation of Trade Unions launched a condolence activity of "sending coolness" to front-line workers in epidemic prevention and control, and police stations, card points and health systems in the county received condolences such as drinks and fruits.
"Trade union cadres should further improve their political positions, strengthen their responsibilities, warm people's hearts with care, and inspire morale with actions.
It is necessary to give full play to the role of trade union organizations in rallying and uniting workers, do a good job in epidemic prevention and control services, actively safeguard the health rights and interests of workers, and send care to front-line workers. "
The relevant person in charge of the Autonomous Region Federation of Trade Unions said.

Spokesperson of the Embassy in the UK: The Chinese government is a staunch defender of cyber securit - Chinanews.com
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) According to the website of the Chinese Embassy in the UK, on the 25th, a spokesman of the Chinese Embassy in the UK answered a reporter's question on false remarks about cyber attacks.
The spokesman stressed that the Chinese government is a staunch defender of cyber security and has always resolutely opposed and cracked down on any form of cyber attacks and cyber crimes.
A reporter asked: According to the media, hacker organizations related to China once interfered with the network system of a British company, launched attacks on British and American technology companies with patent data, and invaded the government networks of EU countries.
The spokesman said that the Chinese government is a staunch defender of cyber security and has always resolutely opposed and cracked down on any form of cyber attacks and cyber crimes.
Cyberspace is virtual, difficult to trace, and diverse actors. When investigating and characterizing network events, sufficient evidence should be produced, and unprovoked speculation should not be allowed.
The spokesman said that a series of incidents such as the "Prism Gate" in the past proved that the United States has been carrying out the world's largest cyber theft operation.
Maintaining peace and stability in cyberspace is in the common interest of all countries.
The spokesman pointed out that China's achievements in scientific and technological innovation were not stolen or robbed, but obtained through self-reliance and hard work.
In 2019, China submitted about 59,000 patent applications through the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), with an annual growth rate of 10.6%, making it the country with the largest number of international patent applications.
China has become a big country in innovation and intellectual property rights.
According to data from Urumqi Central Sub-branch of the People's Bank of China, in the first half of the year, new loans for agriculture-related and small and micro enterprises in Xinjiang exceeded the annual increase in 2019.
In the first half of this year, Urumqi Central Sub-branch of the People's Bank of China used a variety of monetary policy tools to guide the banking industry to continuously increase loan investment, providing sufficient financial guarantee for epidemic prevention and control and resumption of work and production.
Most areas of free nucleic acid testing in Urumqi have basically completed secondary testing in high-risk area - Chinanews.com
Chinanews.com, Urumqi, July 26 (Reporter Sun Tingwen, Zhao Yamin) Zhang Wei, director of the Urumqi Municipal Health Commission, reported the latest epidemic situation and nucleic acid testing in Urumqi on the 26th, saying that at present, free nucleic acid testing in Urumqi has been basically completed in most districts.
The expert group of the State Council and experts from autonomous regions and Urumqi are making further assessments of the development of the epidemic based on the results of nucleic acid testing and epidemiological investigations.
The Information Office of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region held a press conference on the 26th to report the epidemic situation and prevention and control in Xinjiang.
According to him, from 00:00 to 24:00 on July 25, there were 22 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Urumqi (including 5 cases of asymptomatic infection transferred to confirmed cases) and 38 new asymptomatic infection.
As of 24:00 on July 25, Urumqi had 135 confirmed cases and 147 asymptomatic infections.
The new asymptomatic infected persons on the 25th were basically screened out through free nucleic acid testing and active screening in the city.
Zhang Wei, director of Urumqi Health and Health Commission, said on the 26th that free nucleic acid testing in Urumqi has been basically completed in most districts.
He also said that from the experience of other regions in China, there are many factors that affect the nucleic acid test results, such as the sensitivity of the test reagent, the infection time and detoxification time of the tested personnel, the cooperation of the tested personnel when taking samples (poor cooperation may lead to the samples not being taken in place), the testing environment, the operation proficiency of the inspectors, and so on.
For various reasons, false negative results will also appear in nucleic acid testing.
The so-called false negative means that the tested person is indeed infected, but the nucleic acid test result is negative.
In addition, people who have had close contact with confirmed cases and suspected cases usually need two nucleic acid tests to be excluded.
For people who have been to high-risk areas in the epidemic, if fever and respiratory symptoms occur, a negative nucleic acid test may have a false negative, so two nucleic acid tests are needed to rule out.
He said that in view of the above situation, for the health of the people of all ethnic groups in the city, starting today, Urumqi will conduct secondary free nucleic acid testing in key areas such as Tianshan District and Shayibak District, and at the same time carry out "checking and filling in leaks".
It is reported that Tianshan District and Shayibak District are high-risk areas of the epidemic.

White House epidemic expert Fauci: cautiously optimistic about the development of a vaccine in early 2021
Fauci made the above remarks at an online video conference hosted by the International Leadership Foundation on the 25th.
He reminded that it is not clear how the COVID-19 epidemic will develop in autumn and winter, or what the ultimate impact of the epidemic will be, "and the only way to end this is for each of us to choose to be part of the solution."
According to data from Johns Hopkins University in the United States, as of 21:00 on the 25th, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the United States has reached 4.176 million, with 146,000 deaths.
Fauci said that some parts of the United States are struggling to fight the rebounding epidemic.
Although the epidemic situation varies from place to place and needs to be responded to according to local conditions, diversified anti-epidemic strategies do not mean that there is no close connection between regions.
An epidemic in one area will eventually affect other areas.
"Now is not the time for complacency," Fauci said. "Our work has not been completed. We must step up our efforts and be vigilant against the uncertainty in the future."
He Dayi, a Chinese American medical expert and founder of "cocktail therapy" for AIDS, pointed out at the meeting that the COVID-19 epidemic in the United States has not yet reached its peak.
"Each of us must do our part to slow down the spread of this virus."
He Dayi called on the public to buy time for scientists with their own practical actions to step up the research and development of COVID-19 therapeutic drugs and vaccines.
The International Leadership Foundation is a non-profit organization with the purpose of promoting international exchange activities in the United States and the Asia-Pacific region. It is committed to promoting the status of Asian-Pacific Americans in the United States and cultivating international young leaders.
On the same day, US Secretary of Transportation Zhao Xiaolan, US Congressman Meng Zhaowen and Dong Jiling, founding president of the International Leadership Foundation, spoke at the meeting respectively.
They paid special tribute to Asian-Pacific medical workers and volunteers who fought the epidemic on the front line, and called on the American public to continue to adhere to epidemic prevention guidelines such as "social distance" to curb the spread of the epidemic.

Brazilian study shows that hydroxychloroquine is ineffective in the treatment of mild and moderate COVID-19
Recently, a Brazilian study showed that hydroxychloroquine is ineffective in patients with mild and moderate COVID-19.
The research report was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
Pakistani researchers divided 667 patients from 55 hospitals across the country into three groups and conducted clinical trials; This paper mainly compares the therapeutic effects of hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with other antibiotics azithromycin, and analyzes whether it is helpful to improve the condition of mild and moderate COVID-19 patients.
The results show that hydroxychloroquine not only has no therapeutic effect, but may have damaging side effects on organs.

Representatives of US-China Trade Talks met in August
Hong Kong's South China Morning Post quoted an anonymous insider on the 25th as saying that Liu He, head of China's trade negotiation team and Vice Premier of the State Council, and Lai Haizhe, co-leader of the US team and trade representative, are expected to hold formal talks in August to assess the implementation of the first-stage trade agreement between China and the United States.
The report said that although China has greatly increased its purchases of US agricultural products in the past few months, due to factors such as the novel coronavirus epidemic, China's purchases are still some distance from the amount promised in the trade agreement.
Analysts say the recent closure of each other's consulates by the United States and China, coupled with other disputes, may undermine any progress on trade between the two sides.
The first phase of the Sino-US trade agreement came into effect one month after it was signed on January 15. The agreement stipulates that the high-level trade framework group of the two sides should hold talks every six months.
According to informed sources, the meeting will be "an important turning point", allowing both sides to assess the progress of the agreement.
However, this person also said that if the tension between the United States and China leads to a low willingness to talk at this time, the two sides may agree that the conference call between Lai Haizhe and Liu He on May 8 has already met the terms of the semi-annual talks in the trade agreement.
Since the beginning of this year, Sino-US relations have deteriorated rapidly, and disputes between the two sides include a series of issues such as the origin of Novel Coronavirus, trade, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, South China Sea and ideology.
Although US President Trump boasted about his achievements in the first phase of the agreement at the beginning of the year, his attitude has changed recently.
He said at a White House press conference on the 23rd that although China has recently purchased a record amount of US corn in a single day and bought a lot of soybeans, "this trade agreement is not as meaningful to me as it was when it was reached."
An anonymous Beijing government adviser also believes that due to poor US-China relations, a new round of trade negotiations is unlikely to take place, and "trade issues have lost weight in Sino-US relations".
However, he revealed that China's economic and trade related units still met on the 23rd to discuss a series of issues, including how to increase imports from the United States. "We have tried our best to buy, so any additional purchases will be difficult."
Peng Jiening, vice president of the US-China Business Council, said that it is "more important than ever" to maintain the momentum of the first phase of the agreement, and pointed out that China has made progress in further opening its financial markets to US enterprises this year.
Analysts at Plenum, an independent research company, said: "It is better to talk than not to talk, although it may only be regarded as routine."
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26 (Reporter Wei Yukun) The reporter learned from the Emergency Management Department on the 26th that the National Defense Office and the Emergency Management Department, together with the State Grain and Material Reserve Bureau, once again urgently dispatched 1.35 million woven bags, 1.2 million square meters of woven cloth, 130,000 square meters of geotextiles and other six types of central reserve flood control materials to Anhui to support flood fighting and rescue work in Anhui.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Emergency Management Department, at present, the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the Huaihe River Basin maintain high water level fluctuations, and the "No.3 Flood of the Yangtze River in 2020" formed in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River on
The meteorological department predicts that there will be heavy rainfall in Chongqing, Guizhou and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in the next three days, and the flood control situation is still grim and complicated.

Hao Yusheng, Chief Representative of Nasdaq China: Now is the best time node for Chinese companies to go to the United States for IPO-Economic Observation-Professional Financial News Website
Zhang Bin, a reporter from Economic Observation Network, has implemented stricter supervision on Chinese stocks in the US market because of the Ruixing Coffee fraud incident. Coupled with the long-term pressure on valuations, Chinese stocks listed in the United States are under pressure. Recently, Chinese stocks such as Netease and JD.com have started their journey back to Hong Kong for listing.
Recently, companies such as Shell and Ideal Auto are enthusiastic about listing in the United States.
Under the epidemic situation and the crisis of Chinese stocks, is it the best time for Chinese enterprises to list in the United States?
"As far as the recent IPO cases and the companies that are going to go public in the United States are concerned, the IPO in the United States has not been affected in essence. On the contrary, the market is very good now. Even now this time point is the best time point for Chinese companies to go to the United States for IPO in the past 10 years."
Hao Yusheng, chief representative of Nasdaq Stock Exchange in China, said at the "2020 Listed Company Leaders Summit Chinese Stock Branch" hosted by Snowball.
In April this year, the U.S. Securities Regulatory Commission (SEC) and the U.S. Public Company Accounting Regulatory Board (PCAOB) issued the "Statement on Audit Quality and the Important Role of Regulatory Access to Audit and Other International Information-Discussion on the Current Challenges of Information Access for U.S. Listed Companies with Large Businesses in China".
The statement said that although international cooperation and coordination have increased significantly in recent years, the problems of US regulatory authorities in obtaining information still exist, and the SEC and PCAOB still face legal and practical challenges; Corresponding to this document, the PCAOB website lists in detail the list of listed companies that have encountered audit obstacles and their audit institutions, and a large number of Chinese stock companies are listed.
In addition, in May this year, the U.S. Senate passed the Foreign Company Accountability Act, which puts forward additional information disclosure requirements for foreign companies to list in the United States.
In Hao Yusheng's view, the crisis in Chinese stocks has not affected investors' appetite.
"When the news first came out, it caused everyone's panic. Everyone was asking whether they could go public in the United States in the future, but later we found that these problems were not a problem for investors. Investors may ask these questions during the recent IPO roadshow in the United States, and even become standardized questions, but this is not regarded by investors as an important factor in whether to invest in a Chinese company.
It is suggested that everyone treat the current situation with a normal heart as much as possible.
Of course, this may seem to be the most serious situation in the past two years, but as far as investors' appetite is concerned, it has not been affected in any way.
So from now until the end of this year or before the US election, the upsurge of IPO in the United States will continue. "
On May 9 this year, Jinshan Cloud officially listed on Nasdaq in the United States, becoming the first Chinese company to go to the United States for an IPO after the epidemic.
"The listing of Jinshan Cloud gives Chinese companies preparing for IPOs very much confidence."
Hao Yusheng said.
According to the data report of Chinese stocks released by Snowball in the first half of 2020, in the first half of this year, there were 20 IPO Chinese companies in the United States, an increase of 17.6% over the same period last year; Judging from the total amount of initial fundraising, 20 companies raised a total of 2.725 billion yuan, which rebounded compared with the same period last year, up more than 52.4%; In terms of industry distribution, the number of IPOs in the health care industry in the first half of
According to Hao Yusheng, Chinese companies that went to the United States for IPO in the first half of this year have higher quality, and high-quality companies with excellent fundamentals and growth will be more favored by investors.
In the short, medium and long term, Hao Yusheng continues to be optimistic about the IPO of Ming Chinese companies in the United States.
"In the short term, the upsurge of IPO in the United States continues; in the medium term, Chinese companies have more choices, A shares, Hong Kong stocks, and US stocks, and everyone will take the US election and Sino-US relations as market choices and timing considerations; in the long run, everything will return to normal, and market fluctuations are cycles, both political and economic, and will eventually return to the normal stage. The stock market has always moved forward with fluctuations."
Hao Yusheng also said, "There are many uncertain factors this year, but for high-quality companies, no matter whether the market is good or bad, as long as they are solid and have growth that investors can see, other factors are relatively minor. Investors need to invest in excellent Chinese companies."

Then he came to the public space on the first floor of the National Centre for the Performing Arts and had a dialogue with Yang Yang, Zhang Haochen and Yu Kuai, the tuner of the National Centre for the Performing Arts, in front of three nine-foot pianos with stories.

Commentator of People's Daily: Concentrate on running your own affairs well and create new advantages for future development-On studying and implementing General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech at the Entrepreneur Symposiu - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 25-People's Daily commentator's article on July 26: Concentrate on doing your own thing well and create new advantages for future development
At present, the global epidemic situation and the world economic situation are still grim and complex, and the challenges facing China's development are unprecedented.
Maintaining strategic determination, enhancing confidence in winning, and concentrating on doing our own affairs are the keys to our response to various risks and challenges.
At the recent entrepreneur symposium, General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed that under the current external environment of rising protectionism, sluggish world economy and shrinking global market, we must concentrate our efforts on doing our own thing well, give full play to the advantages of the domestic super-large-scale market, gradually form a new development pattern with the domestic big cycle as the main body and the domestic and international double cycles promoting each other, improve the modernization level of the industrial chain and supply chain, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation, speed up key core technology research, and create new advantages for future development.
Those who observe the situation are wise, and those who control the situation win.
Under the external environment of the in-depth development of economic globalization, the market and resources have played an important role in China's rapid development.
Now, the world under the impact of the epidemic is undergoing profound changes, facing more unstable and uncertain factors, and economic globalization is facing headwinds and turning back waves.
To make ideological and work preparations for dealing with changes in the external environment for a long time and promote China's economy to ride the wind and waves and achieve stability and far-reaching, an extremely important aspect is to take expanding and meeting domestic demand as the strategic basis for development, give full play to its own advantages, and add impetus to China's economic development and drive the recovery of the world economy by prosperous the domestic economy and unblocking the domestic cycle.
We should deeply realize that building a complete domestic demand system is related to China's long-term development and long-term stability.
The CPC Central Committee has judged the situation and clearly put forward the firm implementation of the strategy of expanding domestic demand, which is the need to cope with the impact of the epidemic, to maintain the long-term sustained and healthy development of China's economy, and to meet the growing needs of the people for a better life.
The advantage of a big country's economy is that it can be recycled internally.
China has the most complete and largest industrial system in the world, strong production capacity and perfect supporting capacity. It has more than 100 million market players and more than 170 million talents with higher education or various professional skills, and a super-large domestic demand market formed by 1.4 billion people including more than 400 million middle-income groups. It is in the stage of rapid development of new industrialization, informatization, urbanization and agricultural modernization, with huge investment demand potential.
Public ownership is the main body, multiple ownership economies develop together, distribution according to work is the main body, and multiple distribution methods coexist. The socialist market economic system and other basic socialist economic systems can not only stimulate the vitality of various market players, liberate and develop social productive forces, but also promote the organic unity of efficiency and fairness, and continuously realize common prosperity.
We should firmly grasp the strategic basis of expanding domestic demand, make production, distribution and circulation rely more on the domestic market to achieve a virtuous circle, clarify the strategic direction of supply-side structural reform, and promote the dynamic balance between total supply and total demand at a higher level.
It is necessary to speed up the construction of a complete domestic demand system, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation and other innovations, accelerate the promotion of strategic emerging industries such as digital economy, intelligent manufacturing, life and health, and new materials, form more new growth points and growth poles, and gradually form a new development pattern with the domestic big cycle as the main body and the domestic and international double cycles promoting each other.
Opening brings progress, while closing is bound to lag behind.
General Secretary Xi Jinping has repeatedly stressed that China's door to opening up will not be closed, but will only open wider and wider.
Taking the domestic cycle as the main body, it is by no means operating behind closed doors, but by giving full play to the potential of domestic demand, making better connection between the domestic market and the international market, making better use of the international and domestic two markets and two resources, and achieving stronger and more sustainable development.
At the same time, there is no contradiction between expanding domestic demand and opening up. The smoother the domestic cycle, the more conducive it is to building a new pattern of opening up and forming new advantages in participating in international cooperation and competition.
Although protectionism is on the rise in the world, we must stand on the right side of history, persist in deepening reform, expanding opening up, strengthening open cooperation in the field of science and technology, promoting the construction of an open world economy, and promoting the construction of a community with a shared future for mankind.
The Chinese nation has experienced many tribulations in its history, but it has never been crushed. Instead, it has become more and more courageous, growing up and rising from tribulations.
On the way forward, with the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core, the remarkable advantages of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, strong mobilization ability and strong comprehensive strength, and the unity and struggle of the whole party, the whole army and the people of all ethnic groups in China, we will be able to overcome all difficulties and obstacles, maintain the good momentum of China's economic and social development, build a well-off society in an all-round way, and smoothly start a new journey of building a socialist modern country in an all-round way!
Yu'e Bao's income declines, "post-90s" but "retaliatory" to save money?
With the decline of Yu'e Bao's income, the "post-90s" not only did not escape Yu'e Bao, but began to "retaliate" to save money?
The "Yu'e Bao Post-90s Saving Report" (2020 Edition) released by the China New Economic Research Institute and Alipay recently shows that in the first half of the year, the "post-90s" are more likely to save money: the amount of money saved per capita is nearly 40% higher than that in 2019.
Interestingly, the "post-90s" are more inclined to save from a small amount of money, with 60% of the average amount of money saved below 20 yuan...
Saving money with Yu'e Bao has also become the saving habit of the post-90s generation.
Data show that among the 700 million Yu'ebao users, 134 million are "post-90s".
There are 174 million "post-90s" in China, that is to say, about 3 out of every 4 "post-90s" in China are saving money with Yu'e Bao.
At present, the 7-day annualized rate of return of Yu'e Bao and other monetary funds has dropped to about 1.5% from a level higher than 2% at the beginning of the year.
Even so, it did not affect the pace of saving money for the post-90s generation.
Under the background of the promotion of Yu'e Bao's "saving effect", many young people who are used to using Yu'e Bao have directly transformed into "basic people".
According to Alipay data, as of July 13, the number of new "basic people" on Alipay has more than doubled year-on-year in the past month, and more and more young people have realized "advanced" financial management on Alipay.
Some analysts believe that the inflow of funds from Yu'e Bao into the stock market is also an important reason for the clear decline in the share of money funds in June.
The report also shows that "post-90s" girls are more inclined to save more money, with an average amount of 20% higher than that of boys; 60% of the users who hold funds on Alipay platform are men, and women tend to choose more stable financial management methods than men.
After saving money, what are the plans of the post-90s generation?
Alipay data show that the "post-90s" have the habit of saving money for their goals, with the largest number of users taking travel as their goal of saving money.
Affected by the epidemic, many "post-90s" saved money to prepare for travel after the epidemic; the reopening of cinemas also provides a new way to switch from saving money to consumption.

Due to contact with an infected PCOO employee, Andanal and 49 PCOO employees were tested for COVID-19 on the 24th.
The report released on the 25th showed that 10 of the employees tested positive.
PCOO Deputy Minister of Administration and Legal Affairs MarvinGatpayat said that the department is located in the new administrative office building of the presidential palace, which was originally scheduled to resume on the 27th when President Duterte delivered his fifth State of the Union address.
On the same day, Martin Andanal assured the public that PCOO continued to perform its duties to the Filipino people, ensuring that important information was provided to the public in a timely manner, and strengthening contact tracking and testing to avoid further spread of novel coronavirus pneumonia virus among PCOO staff.

France increases military investment in spac - Xinhuanet
French Defense Minister Floran Paley said on the 24th that France will add hundreds of millions of euros to its space defense budget and develop space military forces to prevent "unfriendly actions" that other countries may make in outer space.
Paley told Provence on the same day that from 2019 to 2025, the expenditure budget of French space military projects will increase from 3.6 billion euros (about 4.2 billion US dollars) previously proposed to 4.3 billion euros (5 billion US dollars).
According to the French Military Planning Act from 2019 to 2025 approved by the French Parliament in 2018, France is expected to update its existing observation satellites and communication satellites in the future, launch three electromagnetic interception satellites, and improve the modernization level of space surveillance radar.
French President Emmanuel Macron announced in July last year that a space military command and an "aviation and space force" would be established within the French Air Force.
Paley said she will officially announce the establishment of the space force when she visits a military academy in Salon, Provence later.
Paley said that this space force belongs to the Air Force and will have 500 personnel by 2025.
She said: "In the past, people thought that space served the common interests of science, but this idea is gone forever. Now space is a place where countries compete for global hegemony."
Paley reiterated Macron's previous statement that France has no intention of provoking an arms race.
"We are by no means engaged in an arms race. But it is my responsibility to thoroughly recognize the threats we may face."
Paley recalled the surveillance of a military satellite shared by France and Italy in 2017.
She said that "peeping" was a Russian satellite.
Russia denies this statement.
Paley said that France "soon" will have small patrol satellites that can detect and target "the black hands behind those unfriendly actions".
French media believe that the reason why France seeks to establish a space force is that US President Donald Trump asked the US Department of Defense to draft a bill to establish a space force in February last year.
Trump signed the National Defense Authorization Act in December last year, approving the establishment of the Space Force, the sixth largest service in the United States.
Some experts worry that these US measures have accelerated the pace of militarization of US space and may trigger a new round of space arms race.

The report says the shared accommodation market has picked up since Marc - Chinanews.com
(Reporter Yang Zhaokui) The "China Shared Accommodation Development Report 2020" (hereinafter referred to as the "Report") released by the Sharing Economy Research Center of the National Information Center recently shows that due to the impact of the epidemic, the transaction volume of China's shared accommodation market decreased by 72.1% year-on-year in the first five months of 2020.
However, the shared accommodation market began to pick up in March, and the market transaction volume, order volume and reception number gradually recovered.
The "Report" shows that the transaction volume of the shared accommodation market has dropped sharply. On the one hand, due to the sharp drop in travel accommodation demand under epidemic prevention and control, the order volume has dropped sharply. The total order volume in the first five months decreased by 65% year-on-year, and the number of receptions decreased by 63% year-on-year. On the other hand, weak demand also led to a relatively obvious drop in overnight prices, with the average overnight price in the first five months falling 16
However, the market transaction volume in March, April and May increased by 78%, 199% and 35% respectively; the number of orders increased by 141%, 152% and 50% respectively; and the number of receptions increased by 81%, 112% and 28% respectively.
The "Report" pointed out that the development of the shared accommodation industry is promising for a long time, but there are still many uncertainties in the near future.
In this regard, Yu Fengxia, deputy director of the Sharing Economy Research Center of the National Information Center, told the Workers' Daily reporter that the development of shared accommodation needs stronger policy support. On the one hand, it is necessary to implement the policies that have been issued in the early stage, further strengthen policy publicity, and focus on creating a better business environment. On the other hand, it is necessary to further strengthen policy guidance and support from stimulating consumer demand, enriching the supply of tourism accommodation services, innovating service methods, and strengthening cooperation between the government and platform enterprises.

Xinhua News Agency, Xiamen, July 26 (Yang Fushan, Zhang Shushan, Xu Jingyi) The Department of Vascular Surgery of Shanghai Changhai Hospital of Naval Military Medical University, a famous vascular surgery center in China, signed a contract with the Department of Vascular Surgery of Zhongshan Hospital affiliated to Xiamen University on the 25th to jointly set up a cooperation center to promote exchanges and cooperation between the two sides in the field of vascular surgery, especially in the field of aortic acute and severe diseases.
Zhongshan Hospital affiliated to Xiamen University said that after the vascular surgery of the two hospitals formally formed a cooperative unit, they will carry out remote consultation, formulate treatment plans with Changhai Hospital in real-time online consultation, select talents for further training, and jointly carry out surgical technical exchanges and teaching rounds every week; For complex cases, Changhai experts can be invited to the hospital for surgery according to the needs of patients, so that patients in southwest Fujian can enjoy the top medical resources in China without leaving the province.
The two hospitals will also work together to carry out innovative scientific research on surgery, popular science and early screening of aortic diseases, and so on.
A special seminar on aorta sponsored by Beijing Health Promotion Association and hosted by Zhongshan Hospital affiliated to Xiamen University was held in Xiamen on the same day.
The above-mentioned two well-known hospitals in Shanghai and Xiamen held a signing ceremony for the Vascular Surgery Cooperation Center at the same time at the meeting, announcing the formation of a cooperative unit to jointly improve the treatment level of vascular surgery-related diseases in southwest Fujian.
The Department of Vascular Surgery of Shanghai Changhai Hospital is the only vascular surgery research institute in the army and the only clinical medical center for vascular system diseases in Shanghai. It is also the first national key discipline of vascular surgery. It has led the establishment of the Endovascular Angiology Professional Committee of the Chinese Medical Doctor Association and is a top team with profound accumulation in the industry.
Professor Huang Xiaojin, Director of Vascular Surgery, Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University, was interviewed by the media.
The Department of Vascular Surgery of Zhongshan Hospital affiliated to Xiamen University is the first independent discipline of vascular surgery in Fujian Province. It has long been committed to the diagnosis and treatment of aortic and peripheral vascular diseases, and was approved to build a provincial key clinical specialty in 2018.
In the treatment of aortic diseases, in addition to the treatment of dissecting aneurysms and aortic aneurysms, he has rich experience in emergency ruptured aortic aneurysms.
"The Department of Vascular Surgery of Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University is outstanding in this region from the history of development, the breadth, difficulty and complexity of the operation. Therefore, this time we set up a cooperation center. In addition to the aorta, we can also carry out all-round in-depth cooperation in medicine, teaching and scientific research in the diagnosis and treatment of lower limb arteries, carotid arteries and other diseases."
Professor Feng Rui, deputy director of vascular surgery at Shanghai Changhai Hospital, said.
Zhongshan Hospital affiliated to Xiamen University and Shanghai Changhai Hospital signed a contract in 2018 to establish "Li Zhaoshen Famous Doctor Studio" in the Department of Gastroenterology.
Professor Huang Xiaojin, director of the hospital's vascular surgery department, said in an interview with Chinanews.com that the hospital's vascular surgery department has also had a long history of exchanges with Changhai Hospital. This time, the two hospitals formally formed a cooperative unit, bringing cooperation and exchanges between the two sides to a new level.
He said that the hospital will regularly invite Shanghai experts to Xiamen to carry out surgical technical exchanges, teaching rounds, and discussion of difficult cases. At the same time, it will further carry out remote consultation, which is currently planned to be held once a week. In addition, the department will also send personnel for further study and exchange to strengthen the training and development of discipline talents.
The reporter learned at the meeting that vascular disease is the largest cause of death in China, and the aorta, as the main road of various organs of the human body, flows from the heart to the whole body and plays an important role.
The occurrence of aortic disease is often accompanied by high risk, high mortality and high difficulty in treatment. The thickest section of the aorta has a diameter of 4cm. Once a hemangioma is formed, rupture occurs, or vascular intima rupture produces dissection, it will cause massive hemorrhage, which is very dangerous.
In recent years, with the change of people's lifestyle and the acceleration of the pace of life, China has become the world's largest country in hypertension, and aortic diseases have also increased. Nowadays, with the development of surgical technology and industrial materials, the treatment of aortic diseases continues to develop in the direction of minimally invasive, rapid and efficient.
Doctors can properly "change lanes" for blood flow by puncturing the thigh and placing stents in the aorta, so as to avoid the impact on aneurysms or ruptured dissections and achieve good therapeutic effects. Some operations even require local anesthesia.
This academic seminar invited more than ten domestic experts to discuss the new progress in the treatment of aortic diseases, and carried out cutting-edge technical training and difficult case discussion in the form of conference salons.
The reporter learned at the meeting that with the development of surgical technology and industrial materials, the treatment of aortic diseases is currently developing in a minimally invasive, rapid and efficient direction.

Directed by Chen Desen, supervised by Zheng Baorui and starring Liu Xianhua, He Rundong, Lin Chenhan and Jiang Luxia, the action adventure film Journey will be launched on July 24.
This is also the second large-scale movie to choose webcasting after "Bad Mom".
"Journey" is adapted from an online game of the same name. It tells the story of Dong Yilong, a teenager from Qingyuan Village, and Chu Soul, a warrior of the Chu family army, who embarked on a journey to participate in the selection of Marshal Ma of the South Zhao State Army. On the way, they met King Kong's little sister and the three completed their mission together.
This year is the 15th anniversary of the game "Journey" IP15, and the launch of the movie of the same name is undoubtedly a tribute to the classic game.
At the same time as the announcement, the film Journey released the poster of the "National War" version and the pilot trailer of "Live".
The excellent picture quality presents a grand picture of the national war in the journey world, depicting the profound brotherhood of the two protagonists, Dong Yilong and Chu Soul.
"Journey" chooses the overhead era to build the story background.
In the fictional Central Plains mainland, among the ten countries, the South Zhao State and the North Yan State live next to each other.
In order to defend against the increasingly powerful Beiyan, Nanzhao held a tournament to select generals.
The news spread to the remote Qingyuan Village. The villager Dong Yilong wanted to be the flag bearer of the family and compete on behalf of the Qingyuan Village family, but the villagers questioned his qualifications. After some efforts, Yilong finally embarked on a journey with the samurai Chu Soul.
The total investment of the film is nearly 300 million yuan, and the proportion of special effects shots in the whole film is as high as 80%.
It is conceivable that special effects have become one of the biggest highlights of Journey.
The post-special effects production team is also quite well-established. MORE VFX, the special effects team that created Wandering Earth, is responsible for restoring the "Journey" world with imaginative visual art and top technology.
Some of the classic game scenes, Phoenix, Qingyuan Village and Beast King Valley, will also appear in the movie, and game players should set off a wave of nostalgia.
In addition to the special effects team, behind-the-scenes production is also a group of people who have made great achievements in the industry.
Director Chen Desen has directed "Besieged City in October" and "Purple Rain Storm". Producer Zheng Baorui has filmed "Kill the Wolf 2" and "Journey to the West's Monkey King Three Beats the Bai Gujing". The action scenes are in the charge of Dong Wei, the best action director of the Academy Awards and the Golden Horse Awards. Art director Mak Guoqiang is also the winner of the best beauty finger of the two Academy Awards.

China News Service, Chongqing, July 26 (Reporter Han Lu) The reporter learned from China Railway Chengdu Bureau Group Co., Ltd. on the 26th that the small Three Gorges Tunnel of Zhengwan High-speed Railway, with a total length of about 18.9 kilometers, was completed on the same day.
It is understood that the Small Three Gorges Tunnel is not only the longest high-speed railway tunnel in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, but also the longest single-hole double-track high-speed railway tunnel with a design speed of 350 km/h among the projects currently under construction in China.
Zhengwan high-speed railway is located in Henan, Hubei and Chongqing provinces and cities, connecting Beijing-Guangzhou and Xulan high-speed railways in the north of Zhengzhou and Chongqing-Wan high-speed railway in the south of Wanzhou. It is an important part of the riverside channel and Hunan channel in China's "eight vertical and eight horizontal" high-speed railway network.
The small Three Gorges Tunnel of Zhengwan High-speed Railway was completed on the 26th.
The picture shows running through the scene.
Zheng Wangao Railway starts from Zhengzhou City, Henan Province, and passes through Pingdingshan City, Nanyang City and Xiangyang City, Hubei Province to Wanzhou District, Chongqing City in the southwest. The new line has a total length of about 818 kilometers, a design speed of 350 kilometers per hour, and about 184 kilometers in Chongqing.
Among them, the Zhengzhou-Xiangyang section has been opened for operation in advance on December 1, 2019, and the Chongqing section is stepping up construction.
The Small Three Gorges Tunnel, which runs through the whole line on the 26th, is a control project of Zhengwan High-speed Railway. The project is located at the junction of Fengjie County and Wushan County in Chongqing, with a total length of about 18.9 kilometers and a maximum buried depth of 890 meters.
Construction of the tunnel began in February 2017 and was completed on July 26, 2020.
According to Wang Guojun, head of Zhengwan High-speed Railway Tunnel Design of China Railway Second Academy Engineering Group Co., Ltd., the survey and design party, the topographic and geological conditions of the small Three Gorges Tunnel are very complex, facing risks such as karst, mud gushing and large deformation of soft rock. It is a Class I high-risk tunnel, and the design and construction of the tunnel are extremely difficult.
"During the construction of the project, we used geological survey method, geophysical exploration method and advanced drilling method to advance geological prediction, and adopted special design schemes for more than 30 karst caves of various types. For example, a bridge with a length of 24 meters was designed and built, spanning a large karst cave with a longitudinal length of more than 10 meters and a depth of more than 55 meters in the tunnel to avoid tunnel settlement." Wang Guojun said.
According to the China Railway Tunnel Bureau, the construction of the tunnel adopts the combination of dredging and blocking, through the construction of horizontal tunnel guide, grouting to block water, strengthening the support of tunnel structure and the construction of sewage treatment station, which not only ensures the orderly progress of the project, but also avoids the damage of construction drainage to the water body of the Small Three Gorges Scenic Area. At the same time, it successfully overcomes the construction problems such as large deformation of soft rock with a length of 7 kilometers and multi-outburst mud gushing with a daily maximum water inflow of 157,000 cubic meters.
After the Zhengwan high-speed railway is completed and opened to traffic, it will become a new convenient and fast passenger transport main channel from southwest China to the Central Plains, North China and Northeast China. It is of great significance to improve the capacity and quality of the northeast railway channel in southwest China, improve the layout of the regional road network, speed up the development of tourism resources and urbanization along the line, promote coordinated regional development, and promote the implementation of the western development strategy.
Experts say it is unconstitutional to collect immigration data through the U.S. Census for the allocation of seats in the House of Representatives
Some civil rights organizations and several US cities and counties sued the US federal government, saying that the Trump presidential palace's attempt to exclude undocumented immigrants from the US census was unworkable and unconstitutional.
The U.S. Census will determine the allocation of seats in the House of Representatives of the U.S. Congress.
Sarah Brannon, executive lawyer of the American Civil Liberties Union, told VOA, "This will not work."
She went on to say that Trump's request to determine the citizenship of the census takers in the census is difficult to do and "not very reliable."
Another civil liberties organization, Common Business, filed a lawsuit Thursday challenging Trump's executive order.
Some cities in New Jersey and Georgia joined the lawsuit.
Arlington County, Virginia, joined the lawsuit Friday.
Garvey, chairman of Arlington County's management board, said, "The U.S. Constitution requires an accurate count of our population every 10 years. We must accurately count everyone living in Arlington County, and we must not let this illegal attempt to scare people away and reduce the number of our immigrant communities succeed."
Other organizations and individuals praised President Trump's executive order.
Alabama Attorney General Marshall called the executive order a "victory" for the state.
He said, "When allocating seats in the House of Representatives and electoral college seats in each state, it must be based on the number of residents living in each state and the number of residents living legally."
The U.S. Supreme Court last year blocked the Trump administration from including citizenship issues in the 2020 census.
President Trump signed an executive order earlier this week instructing Secretary of Commerce Ross, who oversees the U.S. Census Bureau, to submit data on undocumented people from the census so that the administration can exclude these undocumented people from the census figures of each state and determine whether each state will increase, decrease or maintain seats in the House of Representatives.
The United States redistributes seats in the House of Representatives every 10 years according to demographic changes.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, July 26 (Reporters Ke Gaoyang and Li Song) The reporter learned from the Chongqing Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters that Chongqing has ushered in a new round of heavy rainfall since July 25, with heavy rains in 33 districts and counties, and floods exceeding the warning water level in 4 small and medium-sized rivers. The local area has started flood control level IV emergency response.
According to the monitoring of Chongqing Hydrological Monitoring Station, from 8:00 on the 25th to 8:00 on the 26th, most areas of Chongqing ushered in heavy rains, with 33 districts and counties such as Jiangjin, Qijiang and Wulong experiencing heavy rains, including Wanzhou, Yunyang and Nanchuan experiencing heavy rains.

Affected by heavy rainfall, four small and medium-sized rivers, Donkey Creek in Jiangjin District, Youjiang River in Fuling District, Yingyang River in Kaizhou District and Tuantan River in Yunyang County, have experienced over-warning water level floods, and the water level is still rising.
Heavy rainfall also led to landslides in Liujing Village, Tudi Township, Wulong District, which caused the traffic of village roads to be interrupted. The landslide slipped into the tributary of Wujiang River along Canghe River, blocking the river course to form a barrier lake. The local government has urgently organized the transfer of people downstream.
In response to the rainstorm, Chongqing Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters issued Class III early warning information of river floods at 13:00 on the 26th, and launched Class IV emergency response of flood control, requiring relevant districts, counties and units to strengthen patrol duty, mobilize emergency rescue teams and materials in a timely manner, and evacuate and transfer people in threatened areas.
Move in response to the trend and promote the construction of industrial projects-Viewpoint Headlines-Hunan Daily Network-Huasheng Online
In Hunan in midsummer, the heat wave blows.
However, the enthusiasm released by the provincial industrial project construction to promote the on-site observation meeting overshadowed the hot summer in the dog days, and the clear orientation of "comparing strength with industry and discussing heroes with projects" encouraged Sanxiang and Sishui.
The development of Hunan always depends on building projects and cultivating industries.
Facing the extremely unusual first half of the year, under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core, the whole province insisted on a game of chess, went all out to fight two tough battles of epidemic prevention and flood control, and regarded industrial projects as the "first move" to implement the "six stability" and "six guarantees".
From a year-on-year decline of 1.9% in GDP in the first quarter to a year-on-year increase of 1.3% in the first half of the year, it is self-evident that the period is difficult and the effort is huge.
In this precious report card, the construction of industrial projects is the key support for Hunan to accelerate economic recovery and develop steadily.
The potential is smooth and irreversible.
The construction of industrial projects should be put into the overall situation, and they are not only good at accumulating, accumulating and seeking potential, but also good at recognizing, seeking and adapting to changes.
Under the complex and severe background of the current international situation, in addition to painstaking efforts to attract investment, it is necessary to calm down and study the new characteristics of the current new situation, grasp the laws more scientifically and accurately, and better integrate into the new development pattern with the domestic big cycle as the main body and the domestic and international double cycles promoting each other.
Pay more attention to improving the basic industrial capacity.
In the first half of the year, not only did a large number of heavyweight investment projects in emerging industries break ground and sow hope in our province, but also traditional advantageous industrial enterprises accelerated their distribution in the digital, intelligent and green industrial transformation.
Yiyang Aoshikang Third Science Park Project renovated the existing production line, and the intelligent production line of high-end printed circuit boards seized the first opportunity; The new factory area of Hunan Zhongyan Changde Cigarette Factory is committed to intelligent transformation and the process of building a modern factory, which is also a vivid portrayal of "old trees sprout new shoots"... Focusing on the major national strategy and "two new and one heavy", efforts should be made to consolidate and upgrade advantageous industries, actively cultivate and develop emerging industries, and comprehensively increase scientific and technological innovation and localization substitution, so as to continuously consolidate the basic conditions and accumulate transformation momentum.
Pay more attention to cultivating and developing new economies, new formats and new models.
The sudden COVID-19 epidemic has brought the popularity of the "cloud economy", stimulated the potential of the digital economy, and provided new opportunities for industrial transformation: in the first half of the year, the computer and office equipment manufacturing industry, electronic and communication equipment manufacturing industry in our province increased by 12.6%, the online retail sales of wholesale and retail enterprises above designated size increased by 32.2% year-on-year, and the online meal fee income of catering enterprises increased by 35.6% year-on-year.
It is the general trend to nurture new machines in the crisis, open new situations in the changing situation, actively promote digital industrialization and industrial digitalization, and guide the integration and development of digital economy and real economy.
Pay more attention to optimizing and stabilizing the industrial chain supply chain.
Construction machinery is the main force of Hunan's industry, but two-thirds of the supporting enterprises are outside the province, and there is still room and potential in the supporting chain.
To strengthen industrial chain thinking and grasp projects, it is not only necessary to have the continuous accumulation of head enterprises and achieve technological breakthroughs in key links of the industrial chain; It is also necessary for all localities to devote themselves to cultivation, stimulate the "chain" lock reaction by strengthening the chain to supplement the chain and extend the chain, promote the coordinated layout of relevant supporting industries, and speed up the construction of an independent, controllable, safe and reliable industrial chain supply chain.
To tide over difficulties and support enterprises, Hunan is still a hot land and paradise with a good business environment and emerging market opportunities.
All parts of the province have made frequent moves, new moves and practical moves, thinking that the "burden reduction" of enterprise rescue has led to the "acceleration" of high-quality development; Shaoyang implements "shareholder-style" services, does not prevaricate for enterprises, does not discount policies, and does not solve problems overnight... In the process of recovering the losses caused by the epidemic, all kinds of "do everything possible" to identify short-board pain points and achieve vivid stories that turn crises into opportunities.
Focusing on studying, cultivating and developing industries and optimizing the business environment in a down-to-earth manner will surely win the favor of more investors.
The wind and waves are still ahead, but the state of riding the wind and waves has become the norm for the whole province to focus on the construction of industrial projects and promote high-quality development.
In this critical period, we must learn and implement the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's series of important instructions, effectively deal with external uncertainties with the certainty of our own work, persistently promote the construction of industrial projects, share enthusiasm and sweat, and ensure the successful conclusion of the 13th Five-Year Plan and building a well-off society in an all-round way.

The overall stability of employment and prices shows that the economy has "temperature" - Chinanews.com

The overall stability of employment and prices shows that the economy has "temperature"
Lin Huocan, a reporter from Economic Daily China Economic Network
In the first half of this year, in the face of the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic, China made overall plans to promote epidemic prevention and control and economic and social development. The epidemic prevention and control situation continued to improve, the steady economic recovery was obvious, and the employment and price performance closely related to people's livelihood were generally stable. China's economy handed over a report card of economic operation with temperature.
In the first two months of this year, the surveyed unemployment rate rose.
Especially in February, the production and operation activities of many enterprises were basically in a state of shutdown, the employment demand of enterprises decreased, recruitment was delayed or cancelled, and the unemployment rate surveyed in cities and towns increased.
With the gradual improvement of the epidemic prevention and control situation, the production and living order of the whole society has been continuously restored.
The CPC Central Committee adheres to the general tone of seeking progress while maintaining stability, further intensifies macro policy hedging, comprehensively strengthens the employment priority policy, and actively promotes the work of assisting enterprises to stabilize posts and expand employment.
China has stepped up policies to hedge and stabilize jobs, played a combination of policies of "reduction and exemption, slow return and compensation", phased reduction and exemption of three social insurance unit contributions, allowed deferred payment of social insurance premiums, expanded the benefits of stable post return of unemployment insurance for small and medium-sized enterprises and the policy of replacing training with work, and provided absorption subsidies and probation subsidies for enterprises to absorb the employment of key groups.
With the implementation of various employment stabilization policies, the employment demand of enterprises has steadily picked up, the employment situation has gradually improved, and the surveyed unemployment rate in cities and towns has gradually declined. In June, the surveyed unemployment rate was 5.7%.
Zhang Yi, director of the Department of Population and Employment Statistics of the National Bureau of Statistics, said that in the second quarter, various employment policies continued to take effect, and the labor force who withdrew due to the impact of the epidemic in the early stage returned one after another. The urban labor participation rate in June increased by about 10 percentage points compared with February, which was close
Data show that the total urban employment in June increased by more than 19% compared with February, and most industries reached the pre-epidemic level; The average weekly working hours of employees in enterprises reached 46.8 hours, 6.6 hours higher than that in February and 0.1 hours higher than that in January.
Prices are also related to thousands of households.
In January this year, CPI rose 5.4% year-on-year, setting a new high for many years.
Entering February, although the year-on-year increase of CPI fell slightly, it was still in the "5 range".
The year-on-year increase of CPI is at a high level, which is not only driven by consumer demand before the Spring Festival, but also by the wrong month of the Spring Festival and a low year-on-year base.
However, the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on prices is particularly obvious.
Affected by epidemic prevention and control, logistics delays, untimely supply of materials and increased transportation costs occurred all over the country in January and February. In addition, some citizens hoarded and snapped up, and the prices of some daily necessities increased significantly.
In order to cope with the disturbance of epidemic prevention and control to the price situation, relevant departments have brought important living materials into the scope of emergency transportation guarantee to ensure smooth transportation of materials.
Under the action of a series of policy measures, the market supply of vegetables, melons and fruits has been strongly guaranteed.
In response to the rapid rise in pork prices at the beginning of this year, after the central government issued the policy of ensuring supply and stabilizing prices, various regions and departments quickly implemented it, and the supply of pork reserves improved significantly, pig production capacity recovered in an orderly manner, and the production and marketing order gradually became normal.
Since March, pork prices have continued to decline, driving the year-on-year increase in food prices back to 10.6% in May; In June, pork prices rose slightly month-on-month due to factors such as the slowdown in pig slaughter, reduced imports and the rebound in group consumer demand.
Seasonal changes in fresh vegetable prices are obvious, with an average increase of 3.4% in the first half of the year.
Affected by the high base of comparison in the same period last year, fresh fruit prices continued to decline year on year, with an average decline of 13.3% in the first half of the year
The basic livelihood of the masses has been effectively guaranteed, and the overall economic and social situation has remained stable and orderly.
With the gradual recovery of transportation and logistics, all localities have increased their efforts to ensure supply, and the market supply and demand situation has improved.
Starting in March, CPI fell month on month for four consecutive months, and the year-on-year increase also dropped from 4.3% in March to 2.5% in June, and the overall price level returned to stability.
In the second half of the year, China's prices will continue to maintain a moderate level, and the overall inflationary pressure is not great, but it is still necessary to promote the restoration of production and living order on the premise of normalizing epidemic prevention and control.
Effectively respond to natural disasters such as floods and droughts in major agricultural production areas such as grain, fruits and vegetables, strengthen market supervision, and resolutely crack down on hoarding, price hikes and other behaviors that disrupt market order.

New book reveals: Prince Harry thinks his brother is "snobbish and arrogant"
The British Times and Sunday Times serialized a new book called Finding Freedom, which depicts the royal life of Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle.
However, Reuters reported that Harry and Megan had distanced themselves from the book, saying that they had not been interviewed by the author or provided any content.
The Sunday Times reported that the new book quoted sources as saying that when Harry and Megan were dating before marriage, Prince William wanted to confirm whether Megan, who was originally a Hollywood actress, had ulterior motives for Harry.
According to sources, William said to Harry at that time: "Don't feel the need to rush (marry Megan).
You can spend as much time as possible getting to know this girl. "
The report said that when Harry heard William describe Megan as "this girl", he felt arrogant and snobbish from his brother's tone, and he also thought that he no longer needed others to take care of him.
Harry and Megan announced in January this year that they plan to live a more independent life and will support themselves.
After the two officially stepped down as senior members of the royal family in March, they now live in Los Angeles with their son Archie to pursue a new career.
Harry and Megan got married in May 2018.
At that time, the marriage was regarded as injecting Hollywood's glamour and new era atmosphere into the British royal family, and the two became one of the most eye-catching celebrity couples in the world.

Chinanews.com, Hainan, Qinghai, July 26 th: "Flower Sea Live Room" by Qinghai Lake: "Sweet" Brings Goods to Help Farmers Increase Income
Author Hu Guilong Pan Yujie
"In midsummer, Qinghai Lake is full of golden flowers and thousands of bees flying. Here, the altitude is high, the temperature difference between day and night is large, and the air pollution is less. The strong light breeds the most tenacious and generous bee colony, creating Qinghai royal jelly with high activity, high protein, rich nutritional value, low sugar and low fat characteristics."
On the 26th, Zhang Jianxun, deputy director of the Industry and Information Administration of Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, said.
On the same day, the live broadcast of bee products was held on the banks of Qinghai Lake. China Bee Products Association, representatives of entrepreneurs, bee farmers and other parties gathered to jointly promote Qinghai characteristic bee products. Nearly 10,000 bottles of Qinghai Plateau royal jelly were sold online and offline, with a total of nearly 3.8 million yuan.
The picture shows beekeepers displaying bee products on the spot.
It is reported that this live delivery activity promoted the exchange and cooperation of "enterprises + beekeepers + growers" with the help of Beijing Houdeli Bee Industry Chain Store Network, Kuaishou, Taobao and other well-known domestic bee product retail enterprises, live broadcast and e-commerce platforms, and continuously issued "Qinghai Plateau Spring Pulp Consumption Voucher" to consumers through online and offline channels. It is estimated that the total profit of enterprises for the whole year will be nearly 5.28 million yuan.
In this regard, Wu Na, president of Beijing Houdeli Bee Industry Co., Ltd., believes that it is "worth it": "This move can expand the popularity of Qinghai bee products, attract more consumers to understand and like pure natural bee products without adding, and drive beekeepers to increase their income."
At present, the company has signed production cooperation strategic agreements with Qinghai Cloud Bee Industry Co., Ltd. and Qinghai Huabao Bee Industry Co., Ltd., hoping to jointly promote the rapid development of Qinghai's local bee industry.
The picture shows the sea of rape flowers by Qinghai Lake.
This spring, due to the need to set up road checkpoints for epidemic prevention and control, beekeepers' journey of "chasing flowers and honey" was blocked, and many bees died due to missing the flowering period and lack of food, which seriously affected beekeepers' income.
"Throughout the year, beekeepers travel long distances from Yunnan and Sichuan all the way north to the northwest region following the flowering period. They sleep rough and have no fixed place to live, which is very hard.
As enterprises, we have a responsibility to help them. "
Wu Na said.
"Little bees are 'environmental scouts', and bees cannot survive in heavily polluted areas." Zhao Xiaochuan, executive vice president of China Bee Products Association, said that bee pollination is an important link in the ecological chain and plays an irreplaceable role in protecting plant diversity and improving the ecological environment.
At the same time, bee pollination can increase the yield and improve the quality of crops, especially in areas with wide planting and poor management conditions, pollination is of greater significance.
Research data show that pollination can increase rape yield by about 15% -30%.
The picture shows Zhao Xiaochuan (right), executive vice president of China Bee Products Association, promoting Qinghai bee products.
"The economic, ecological and social benefits created by bee pollination are far greater than the value of bee products themselves. The bee industry has great potential in human health, crop production, vegetation reproduction and ecological protection, and people have always known little about it."
Zhao Xiaochuan said.
Nowadays, the number of beekeepers is getting smaller and smaller. In addition to beekeepers who travel all the year round, there are still many poor households with mobility difficulties who choose to invest in cooperatives with beehives.
"The state has financial support. We contact technicians to help guide. Bee farmers lack understanding and judgment of the market environment. To open up sales, they also need the help and coordination of the government, enterprises and industry associations."
Zhao Xiaochuan said.
"I hope everyone will pay more attention to and help beekeeping groups in the future," Wu Na said. "Our bee products are also screened and controlled in strict accordance with national standards to ensure quality and protect consumer rights while helping beekeepers."

Liu Yunlong, the old face of spy war drama, plays a stuttering her - Xinhuanet
Produced by Liu Yunlong, directed by Yin Fei and starring Liu Yunlong, Su Qing, Liang Guanhua and Li Liqun, the large-scale spy war drama "Chance of Victory" landed on Guangdong Satellite TV's "Vitality Theater" at 7:30 pm on July 16.
The play tells the story of Tang Fei (Liu Yunlong), an underground member of the Communist Party of China lurking in the Japanese and puppet police stations, and a Soviet agent, assassinating the leader of the Japanese agent and smashing the Japanese army's shocking plot.
"Winning" is based on historical facts, and the material is taken from the dusty Soviet military archives for many years.
During the battle to defend Moscow, the elite of the Soviet Red Army in the Far East advanced westward to help. At this time, the "Northward Movement" of the Japanese Kwantung Army thought there was an opportunity and wanted to send troops.
In order to solve the danger of being attacked from the inside and back, the intelligence personnel of the Communist Party of China and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union jointly implemented the "Mudanula" plan.
According to this historical background, Deng Yuan, a well-known screenwriter, has been polished several times, making the plot tortuous and brain-burning.
Liu Yunlong served as both producer and actor in "odds" this time.
In the play, Tang Fei, who he plays, is the chief of the Criminal Section of Linhe Police Department, a stuttering policeman who is quite happy and even a little ruffian, and his real identity is an underground member of the Communist Party of China.
Cai Meng, the heroine who staged the opposite play, is the section chief of Linhe Security Bureau, which is deeply appreciated by Japanese boss Fukuhara. There is a delicate and ambiguous relationship between Cai Meng and Tang Fei.
Su Qing has tried many different types of roles in recent years, from Lu Ruowen in "Those Years We Are Young" to Er Qing in "Yanxi Story", all of which have impressed the audience and their acting skills have been recognized.
This time Su Qing and Liu Yunlong are partners for the first time. The setting of stuttering sheriff and charming policewoman is quite interesting and innovative.
In addition to the two protagonists, there are many powerful actors such as Liang Guanhua, Li Liqun, Qian Bo, Lei Han and Shen Junyi in Winning, and the old drama Bone Biao Opera is also one of the highlights of the play.
It is understood that the production of "odds" is also very sophisticated, with the crew shooting nearly 2,000 kilometers across Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Liaoning provinces.
In order to restore the bizarre urban style during the Japanese occupation period in Northeast China, the crew art props team rushed to work day and night, carefully polishing every detail of the scene construction and props, making the scene in the play exquisite and rich in historical texture.

Greenland Opens a New Round of Mixed Reform Shanghai State-owned Assets Plans to Transfer 17.5% Shares-Economic Observation Network-Professional Financial News Website
On July 26, Rao Xianjun, a reporter from Economic Observation Network, Greenland Holdings (600606.SH) issued the "Prompt Announcement on State-owned Shareholders' Intention to Transfer Part of the Company's Shares and Resume Trading by Public Solicitation of Transferees".
According to the announcement, in order to further deepen the reform of state-owned enterprises, optimize the adjustment of the layout structure of state-owned assets, and improve the equity structure of Greenland, Shanghai Real Estate (Group) Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Shanghai Real Estate") and Shanghai Chengtou (Group) Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Shanghai Chengtou") plan to transfer some of their shares through public solicitation of transferees, and the total proportion of shares to be transferred shall not exceed 17.5% of the total share capital of Greenland.
The price of the shares to be transferred this time shall not be lower than the higher of the following two: the arithmetic average of the daily weighted average price of the 30 trading days before the suggestive announcement date (July 27, 2020); The audited net asset value per share of the company in the latest fiscal year.
At present, there is still no final conclusion on the new strategic investors of Greenland. According to the public announcement information, it is estimated that the new strategic investors need to pay about 14 billion yuan to win the 17.5% equity transferred in the mixed reform of Greenland.
It is worth noting that after the completion of this share transfer, Greenland is expected to still have no controlling shareholders and actual controllers, but the control structure may change greatly.
Greenland Holdings has carried out many institutional reforms since its establishment: from 1992 to 1997, it operated in accordance with market-oriented rules under the pure state-owned system; From 1997 to 2013, the shareholding system of state-owned holding and employee stock ownership was established and continuously improved; From 2013 to 2015, strategic investors were introduced to form a mixed ownership system of cross-shareholding and mutual integration of state-owned and non-public capital; Since 2015, it has been listed as a public company.
Greenland's current mixed reform plan is similar to Gree's. In December 2019, Hillhouse Capital led Zhuhai Mingjun to take over 15% of Gree Electric Appliances (000651.SZ) with 41.662 billion yuan, and Gree Group retreated to a minority shareholder. After completing the mixed reform, Gree Electric Appliances implemented modern enterprise management methods such as executive incentive plan and no actual controller structure.
Shanghai Real Estate and Shanghai Chengtou are state-owned enterprise groups wholly owned by Shanghai State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission. Zhang Yuliang, chairman and president of Greenland Holdings, said that Greenland's move is an important measure for Shanghai to promote the comprehensive reform of state-owned enterprises and accelerate the reform of state-owned enterprises in the new stage in accordance with the requirements of the CPC Central Committee. It fully demonstrates the new reform ideas of adjusting measures to local conditions and tailoring clothes. By introducing new outstanding strategic shareholders to listed companies, it supports enterprises to further improve the degree of marketization, enhance the freedom of operation and management, and accelerate the full release of reform vitality.

White House advisers "bite back" states to return to work too earl - Chinanews.com
White House advisers "bite back" states to return to work too early
On July 23, local time, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the United States exceeded 4 million, accounting for 30% of global cases.
For several months, US President Trump has repeatedly asked all states across the country to return to work and school. It was not until recently that he changed his attitude and took the initiative to wear masks in public. His advisers even "bite back" and said that some state governments returned to work too early.
On the 22nd, White House presidential adviser Kelly Ann Conway said at a press conference that some state governments failed to comply with the standards for returning to work and restarted places such as bars prematurely.
Conway also mentioned that the previous statement that the president has "absolute power" to decide the resumption of work in each state is a misinformed rumor.
"The president is a federalist and he believes that all states have autonomy."
She defended Trump.
However, the "rumors" in Conway's mouth were personally spoken by Trump at the White House epidemic briefing on April 13.
This self-slapping operation was ridiculed by netizens as "rewriting history".
Kylie Conway wants to rewrite history. She's a liar.
Trump called Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer a dictator because she followed medical guidelines and insisted on stopping work.
Trump wants to push for a return to work so he can hold a rally.
This is not the first time Kellyanne Conway has caused controversy.
On April 15, Conway blurted out in an interview with Fox News: "This is COVID-19, not COVID-1, friends!"
She seemed to understand "19" as a version number and was ridiculed crazily by netizens: read the newspaper without common sense!
Is it reasonable for a 3-year-old child to sue the school after being smashed in the playground of the university?
2020-07-26 05:01:11 Source: Legal Daily Author: Wang Sishuo Editor: Wang Sishuo
The playground was smashed, and the child was compensated before suing the school
Zhao Yifan, our correspondent
3-year-old Xiaowen was playing in the playground of a university when he was accidentally hit in the head by Chen Mou of the softball team while pitching.
After Chen Mou made compensation, Xiaowen's father, Mr. Wen, as Xiaowen's legal representative, sued the school to the court, demanding an apology from the school where the playground was located, and paying a total of 20,000 yuan in medical expenses and emotional damages.
Recently, after hearing the case, Haidian District People's Court of Beijing held that the school had set up a protective net on the playground at the time of the incident, and had fulfilled its proper security obligations, and Chen Mou had made compensation. On this basis, the judgment rejected the plaintiff's claim.
Mr. Wen claimed that during the summer vacation of 2019, he took Xiaowen to play on the school playground, when the softball team was training on the playground.
In order to avoid the risks, Xiaowen, Mr. Wen and many other children and parents move in the safe area designated by the softball team.
However, Chen Mou, a member of the softball team, dropped the ball while pitching, causing the softball to fly over the protective net to the above-mentioned safe area and hit Xiaowen in the back of the head.
Mr. Wen immediately took Xiaowen to the hospital for treatment and was diagnosed with head trauma.
Mr. Wen believes that the facilities of the school stadium do not meet the relevant safety regulations and do not effectively manage the team and related facilities.
The school's fault led to the above incident, which caused Xiaowen to suffer great physical and mental pain, and also brought great pain to his family, for which the school should bear legal responsibility.
In response, the school argued that the school had set up a protective net on the playground, posted management regulations and training notices, told them to keep a safe distance from the training ground and reminded them to pay attention to their own safety when entering the playground, and the plaintiff could not prove that the school "failed to fulfill its security obligations", so it did not agree to compensation.
After hearing the case, the court held that the site of the incident was a site open to the public free of charge by the university involved. Although the school has a security obligation for the management of the playground, this security obligation only needs to meet the general duty of care.
At the time of the incident, the school set up a protective net on the playground, which has fulfilled its proper security obligations, and Chen Mou also compensated Xiaowen for medical expenses, transportation expenses and other losses of more than 2,000 yuan in accordance with the compensation agreement reached before, and both parties agreed to settle the dispute once.
Afterwards, Xiaowen's parents once again claimed compensation from the school, which was unfounded in law, and the court ruled that all the plaintiff's claims were rejected.
After the verdict was pronounced, neither party appealed, and the verdict is now in effect.
According to Article 37 of China's Tort Liability Law, schools, as managers of public places, have the obligation to ensure safety; In the case that the behavior of a third party causes damage to others, the third party bears tort liability, while the managers of public places who fail to fulfill their security obligations should bear corresponding supplementary responsibilities.
The judge said that as the manager of a public place, he is most likely to know the actual situation of the whole place and foresee the possible dangers and damages, so he is most likely to take necessary measures to prevent the occurrence of losses or reduce the degree of damage, and the cost of avoiding and reducing the occurrence of damage is the lowest, so the law stipulates that he shall bear the corresponding guarantee obligations for engaging in social activities.
In this case, for unspecified people entering the playground that is open to the public free of charge, the school's security obligation should be compatible with its social activities. Specifically, it should mainly take basic security measures and have the obligation to inform about hidden dangers.
In judicial practice, it is not appropriate to impose excessive security obligations on managers of public places.
If the school has set up a protective net and fulfilled its obligation of informing, it can be concluded that the school is not at fault and should not bear legal responsibility.
In addition, for third-party infringement, even if the managers of schools and other public places fail to fulfill their security obligations, their responsibilities are also a supplement to damages. According to the newly promulgated Civil Code, managers can also recover compensation from third parties after assuming supplementary responsibilities.
Therefore, in such accidents, the victim should not expand the scope of claim after receiving compensation from the direct infringer.
Under the normalization of epidemic prevention and control, people's enthusiasm for exercise and fitness is high.
With the gradual liberalization of inter-provincial tourism business, the tourism market is about to usher in a recovery.
Fujian Province resumed inter-provincial tourism business from July 21. On the first weekend after opening up, Xiamen, a popular tourist destination, ushered in a peak passenger flow.
As a popular tourist destination city, many tourists arrive in Xiamen on weekends.
Xiamen Railway Station is expected to send 3.7 million passengers during the summer vacation, while the airport passenger flow is mainly students, tourists and visiting relatives.
The tourism market is gradually picking up. In July, Xiamen Airport operated 440 flights a day, and domestic flights have recovered to 80% of the pre-epidemic level.
Airlines have encrypted the air express lines from Xiamen to Shanghai, Beijing, Kunming, Xi'an and other major cities to seize the recovered tourism market.
At present, many travel agencies in Xiamen have launched a number of summer domestic inter-provincial tour products, and the team itinerary is mainly based on outdoor scenic spots.
In view of the summer passenger transport peak in railway stations and airports, relevant units have deployed more manpower to guide people in areas where people are easy to gather, such as check-in counters and security check passages, Fujian has also optimized and upgraded the "Bamin Health Code", realizing the sharing and mutual recognition of health data with 31 provinces, and promoting the orderly recovery of the tourism market.
Can Andy Lau and Liu Qingyun "dismantle" a new spar - Xinhuanet
"Bomb Disposal Expert 2" recently announced that it will be released on December 24, becoming the first film to be finalized for the New Year.
The second part is still directed by Qiu Litao, supervised and starring Andy Lau, and unfolds with a brand-new story.
It is reported that the addition of the "nuclear bomb" element in the second part has also made the challenges faced by bomb disposal experts more difficult. Several glimpses in the trailer have already made people's hearts hang on a thread. The mushroom cloud of the Big Bang and the airport engulfed by flames are quite shocking.
Three years ago, "Bomb Disposal Expert", produced by the original crew, won the May Day box office champion of that year and won seven nominations at the Hong Kong Film Awards. Qiu Litao × Andy Lau also became the audience's gold medal partner.
This time, "Bomb Disposal Expert 2" also makes people look forward to whether this pair of ace combination can spark new sparks.
"Bomb Disposal Expert 2" tells a brand-new story: Former bomb disposal expert Pan Chengfeng (Andy Lau) fainted at the scene of the explosion and was listed as a suspect by the police.
In order to find the truth, he had to ask his friend Dong Zhuowen (Liu Qingyun), who is also a bomb disposal expert, for help.
Pang Ling (Ni Ni), a female inspector eager to solve the case and Pan Chengfeng's ex-girlfriend, was also involved.
He is still a bomb disposal expert, but the complexity of Andy Lau's new role can be felt from the advance notice of the file: he broke a leg and put on a prosthetic limb, while being chased by Liu Qingyun, who is also a bomb disposal expert, and being directed by his ex-girlfriend Ni Ni.
What exactly is the relationship between the three people, what exactly did Andy Lau do at the Island Hotel, what kind of cases were involved in, and what twists and turns his career as a bomb disposal expert has gone through, all kinds of mysteries make people curious.
It is understood that the highlight of the film is to view the world landmark buildings in Hong Kong on the spot, and the top special effects production team brings shocking and realistic visual impact.

China News Service, Chongqing, July 26 (Reporter Liu Xian) The Chongqing Municipal Development and Reform Commission announced on the 26th that the city has so far returned 4,404 fishermen, accounting for 42.54% of all fishermen involved.
Li Daiguo, 53, said in an interview with Chinanews.com that his grandfathers were fishing in Longxi River. Since he was 11 years old, he has been fishing with his father, rocking a boat, walking along Longxi River, going up to Liangping, Chongqing, and going down to longevity. Every time he left home, he spent ten days and a half months relying on fishing to maintain his family's life.
However, since 1997, with the gradual influx of rural population into Chang Town, there are more and more residents in Gao'an Chang Town, resulting in more and more serious environmental pollution.
Paper mills, chemical plants and farms have been built along the Longxi River, which also pollutes the river.
By 2007 and 2008, Longxi River had become a stinking ditch.
"The scales of the fish caught are all black, and the inside is also black after being cut open."
Li Daiguo said that fishing is becoming more and more difficult after river pollution.
The local government began to make great efforts to control the pollution of Longxi River, including cleaning and drifting, patrolling the river, and managing and protecting aquatic resources.
Li Daiguo also returned from fishing to production and became a member of the river patrol team to manage and protect aquatic resources.
From January 1, 2020, Chongqing Aquatic Life Reserve and related waters in the main urban area have been completely banned from fishing.
According to the data of Chongqing Development and Reform Commission, so far, Chongqing has accumulated 3,403 fishing boats and signed 4,643 fishing boats with withdrawal agreements, accounting for 63.3% and 86.3% of the total three-year tasks respectively.
4404 fishermen have been withdrawn, accounting for 42.54% of all fishermen involved.
Among the 4,404 people who have retired, 4,267 have achieved employment, accounting for 96.89% of the fishermen who have retired.
Old-age insurance covers 2,691 people, accounting for 61.10% of the fishermen who have retired.
In the next step, Chongqing will carry out various special rectification actions in depth, accelerate the clean-up and rectification of shoreline utilization projects in the main stream of the Yangtze River, complete a new round of census of sewage outlets entering the Yangtze River and carry out corresponding rectification actions, basically complete the rectification task of "three phosphates" (referring to phosphate rock, phosphate chemical industry and phosphogypsum reservoir), clean up and rectify small hydropower, promote the special action of afforestation and greening on both sides of the Yangtze River, strengthen the construction of green mines, consolidate the special rectification results of illegal docks and illegal sand mining in the main stream of the Yangtze River, and
Israel strengthens repeated prevention and control of the epidemi - Chinanews.com

Israel strengthens repeated prevention and control of the epidemic
At the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, Israel's prevention and control measures have achieved remarkable results.
However, with the gradual lifting of the ban on prevention and control measures, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Israel has increased significantly recently, and the Israeli government has repeatedly taken emergency measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic.
On February 28, the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Israel, so it quickly closed all entry and exit ports, suspended non-essential industries, changed schools to online teaching, restricted public transportation and non-essential social activities, blocked cities with severe epidemics, and jointly maintained prevention and control measures by military and police.
This series of measures quickly achieved positive results. By mid-May, the number of newly confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Israel in a single day had dropped to single digits.
With the epidemic under control, Israel's various prevention and control measures have been fully unsealed. Since June, the number of newly diagnosed COVID-19 has gradually rebounded.
Especially after entering July, the spread of the epidemic has been accelerating.
In recent days, there are more than 1,500 new cases in Israel every day for 8 days, and as of July 25, there were 916 new cases on that day.
As of July 25, there were 59,745 confirmed cases and 448 deaths in Israel.
Facing the rapid rebound of the epidemic, the Israeli government has repeatedly taken emergency measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic.
On July 6, after the number of confirmed cases exceeded 30,000, the Israeli government closed public entertainment places such as gymnasiums, swimming pools, bars and nightclubs, and introduced a policy of restricting public transportation, stipulating that the maximum number of passengers per bus should not exceed 20.
On the 17th, the Israeli government announced a series of new restrictive measures, including the implementation of "city closure" on weekends, which stipulated that "city closure" would be implemented from 17:00 every Friday to 5:00 every Sunday.
During this period, people can go out, but shops, shopping centers, barbershops, beauty salons, libraries, zoos, museums, exhibition halls, swimming pools and tourist attractions will be closed, while supermarkets, pharmacies and other basic service places will remain open.
At the same time, gatherings of more than 10 people are prohibited on all dates and time periods, gymnasiums, studios and other places will be closed, restaurants and cafes are prohibited from eating in the hall, and only take-out services are allowed.
At the same time, the Israeli people did not pay enough attention to the seriousness of the epidemic and failed to form a joint force with the government in fighting the epidemic.
After repeated outbreaks in Israel, many people took to the streets to protest and march because the government's prevention and control measures affected their own economic interests.
On July 11, tens of thousands of people held demonstrations in Tel Aviv, believing that the anti-epidemic policy affected the economy.
On the evening of the 21st, thousands of protesters gathered in front of Prime Minister Netanyahu's residence in Jerusalem to protest against Prime Minister Netanyahu's promulgation of prevention and control measures such as banning restaurants and cafes without giving corresponding compensation.
In addition, many people do not abide by the regulations of wearing masks and keeping a safe social distance of two meters during outdoor activities. In order to avoid being fined by the police for not wearing masks, many people only wear masks on their chins or wrists.
During the repeated epidemics, the school was the hardest hit area for the spread of novel coronavirus. According to a reporter's recent visit to this kindergarten, teachers and students in the kindergarten did not wear masks as required by the government, nor did they keep a safe social distance of two meters from each other, laying hidden dangers for a large number of teachers and students to be infected with the virus.
Professor Elie Waxman, a member of the advisory panel of experts on fighting the epidemic of Israel's National Security Council, believes that Israel is moving towards a "dangerous situation", pointing out that the epidemic prevention and control measures currently taken by Israel are not enough, and all leisure and entertainment venues and summer schools should be closed to control the further spread of the epidemic.
Waxman said that Israel lacks an overall plan to fight the epidemic, and the parliament and government departments should abandon their respective interests as soon as possible, reach an agreement on fighting the epidemic, and formulate clear steps including relevant restrictions in different departments.
Tel Aviv, July 25th, our reporter in Tel Aviv, Wang Jiong
Wu Fengfang, a farmer in Guyuan, Ningxia, couldn't beat his wife Dai Tianfu. The two men drove from their home 20 miles away to Liangyun Cultural Compound.
Despite the inconvenience of legs and feet in the past two years, Dai Tianfu, 77, is still counting on "coming here every three or five times to have a trick addiction".
This is an inconspicuous courtyard in Yuanzhou District of Guyuan City. Different from ordinary farmhouses, melodious Qin Opera is often heard in the courtyard, as well as wonderful shadow plays, embroidery works, traditional Qin Opera, eyebrow Hu Opera and so on.
The owner of the compound is Liang Yun, who used to be a carpenter.
More than 10 years ago, he began planning to build a cultural compound, who loved shadow play and singing opera.
With Liang Yun Cultural Courtyard, the cultural life of the villagers has become rich and colorful.
Before the reporter entered the Liang Yun Cultural Courtyard, the tune of Qin Opera had already spread out.
Bai Lixiang, a villager from a neighboring village, is singing excerpts from Qin Opera for the villagers.
She loved Qin Opera since she was a child, and now she is famous in the local area. As long as she has free time, she will come to the cultural compound to perform for the villagers.
Recently, Bai Lixiang also played a live webcast.
Bai Lixiang said: "It is a very happy thing to have a stage for more people to see themselves perform."
On the stage, the singers looked at each other and the players played one tune at a time. Although they were amateurs, their enthusiasm did not decrease at all.
Just like the rustic style of the farmyard, outside the Qin Opera, the "grassroots" art and intangible cultural heritage in the Liang Yun Cultural Courtyard come to me.
The compound also has a collection of more than 300 agricultural utensils of different ages, traditional and handmade tile sculptures, paper-cuts, embroidery, shadow puppets and other objects.
Liang Yun led the reporter into the exhibition hall in the courtyard, which showed his collection of old objects, old wine pots, Sanxianzi, spinning wheels, etc.
Why does an ordinary farmer build a cultural compound?
"Shadow play is my family craft, and I have been learning this craft since I was 15 years old."
Established in 2012, Liang Yun Cultural Courtyard has become the first rural "intangible cultural heritage exhibition hall" in Ningxia, and is also a demonstration compound for the protection of intangible cultural heritage in Guyuan City.
In addition to Liangyun Cultural Courtyard, more than 120 cultural courtyards and 79 folk performance groups have emerged in Yuanzhou District of Guyuan City, of which there are more than 50 cultural courtyards of a certain scale, such as Shenjiahe Cultural Courtyard, Wang Yonghong Cultural Courtyard and Yanglang Cultural Courtyard, covering all towns and streets in Yuanzhou District, with more than 5,000 participants.
These grassroots artists are active in the fields, enriching the cultural life of the masses and meeting their spiritual needs.
"As life gets better and better, traditional culture cannot just be left behind."
"Liu's spy war drama" returns again "odds" to see Liu Yunlong and Li Liqun's opponent "drag racing" - Xinhuanet
The 40-episode spy war drama "Winning" will land on Beijing Satellite TV from July 16.
"Chance of Victory" is based on real historical facts and is based on Soviet military archives that have been sealed for many years and published for the first time.
Actor Liu Yunlong, who is well known to the audience for his "spy drama", broke through his image in the play and challenged a "stuttering agent" who was quite happy.
In recent years, the popularity of dramas such as "Pretender", "Mask" and "Kite" has proved that spy war dramas have exuberant vitality.
Different from previous spy war works, "Winning" looks at the world and extends the background of the story to the Soviet Far East battlefield.
With the final stage of the Anti-Japanese War in 1944 as the background, it tells the story of Tang Fei (Liu Yunlong), a secret intelligence worker of the Communist Party of China, who, under the leadership of the secretary of the Linhe Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese underground party and the director of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Agency, carried out the "Mudanula" strategic action of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Agency.
In many spy war dramas, the hero, as a senior spy, is a perfect image of handsome, high IQ and maturity.
But in Liu Yunlong's view, such a person is not suitable for being a spy. "A spy should be the kind of person who can't be found in the pile of people. If he comes out, he is the kind of image that is very handsome. I wish everyone would pay attention to you. Can he still lurk? There is a line in" Kite ", 'If you don't come to arrest me, I forget that I am a Kuomintang', and spies should be elitist."
Therefore, in "odds", Liu Yunlong creatively designed his hero Tang Fei as a "stuttering agent" with a sense of joy.
The other camp in "odds" is supported by Japanese Fukuhara played by Guanhua Liang and Fang Shibao, director of the police department played by Li Liqun.
The two powerful actors, one south and one north, have added a lot of highlights to the whole play.
Director Yin Fei used the word "drag racing" to describe the opposite play between Li Liqun and Liu Yunlong in the play. "It is definitely drag racing. The two of them have a special tacit understanding. This tacit understanding on them has a great impact on me. Many times their plays are 'hanging now'. For example, we only wrote half a page in length. If I don't stop shooting, they can continue to play."
The masters do not rob each other of the play, and the director does not stir up the play. When the actors are in the role and ensure their character status, they can not only shape the role from the perspective of the characters, but also bring more viewing possibilities to the audience. Yin Fei said that such a play is brilliant enough.
In the play, you can also see many familiar faces in the "Liu's spy war drama". The famous and imposing "Mountain City F4" in "Kite" also gathered three people in "Winning".
Hou Yu and Liu Mingyang, who played Song Xiaoan and Zhao Jianzhi, once again played Tang Fei's right-hand man.
Director Yin Fei said, "These two people have no inferiority, they just drifted with the tide in that era and that environment."
Liu Yunlong also offered, "We must have a human touch. This human touch means that there must be good and bad people around me, and bad people are enemies, but we must also develop them and our team must also grow."
Liu Yunlong also carefully designed the ending of these two people in the play, and he believes that he will give the audience a satisfactory answer.

Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, July 25-Xu Zhengyu, Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, said that Hong Kong's financial market remained active and operated in an orderly manner.
He expressed optimism about Hong Kong's financial stability and economy.
Xu Zhengyu said at an online seminar jointly organized by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Toronto and the Hong Kong-Canada Chamber of Commerce (Canada Federation) on the 24th (Toronto time) that Hong Kong is experiencing a difficult situation because of the "storm of legislative amendments" and the COVID-19 epidemic.
The exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar is stable and biased towards the strong exchange guarantee level.
There is no obvious sign of capital outflow from the banking system. On the contrary, more than 11 billion US dollars have flowed in since June.
The total amount of bank deposits has also continued to increase in the past few months. There has been a series of public offering fund-raising activities in the stock market, and market transactions have repeatedly increased.
Xu Zhengyu said that the COVID-19 epidemic has put pressure on the global economy and financial markets, but Hong Kong's basic advantages remain unchanged.
Hong Kong has many advantages, including geography, rule of law, high-speed communication, free flow of information and capital, and a simple and low tax system, which make Hong Kong a leading international financial center.
Xu Zhengyu pointed out that the SAR Government has set aside HK $6 billion in the "Epidemic Prevention and Anti-epidemic Fund" to create about 30,000 time-limited jobs in the public and private sectors in the next two years, covering people with different skills and academic qualifications.
To support the development of financial technology, the SAR Government has also launched the "Thousand Talents Scheme" to subsidize local financial technology companies, start-ups and other enterprises with financial technology-related businesses, so as to create 1,000 new jobs, hire local talents and enrich Hong Kong's financial technology talent pool.
Looking ahead, Xu Zhengyu expressed optimism about Hong Kong's financial stability and economy.
He encouraged Canadian enterprises to make good use of Hong Kong's advantages and its position as an international financial center, an international asset and wealth management center and a global offshore RMB business hub to develop and invest in Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area and its surrounding areas.
The Lancet published an article praising China's anti-epidemic efforts and encouraging countries to learn from experienc - Chinanews.com
The Lancet magazine published an article on the 25th, saying that China, as a country with a population of 1.4 billion and a scale similar to that of Europe or the United States, has effectively controlled the COVID-19 epidemic at this stage, and there has been no large-scale spread, which has largely controlled the domestic epidemic.
The article said that in the past ten years or so, China has made a lot of investment in domestic research and public health construction, which makes China's preparation for COVID-19 much better than that for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).
The author said that when SARS broke out in 2002, China was not prepared enough at first, especially the pathogen could not be determined.
When novel coronavirus was discovered in December 2019, Chinese scientists were soon able to identify the type of virus and shared genome sequencing data with the international community on January 11, 2020.
By the end of January, doctors from Chinese mainland and Hong Kong had clarified the clinical characteristics of the virus and warned the world about the threat of novel coronavirus through research papers published in the Lancet.
China has also been at the forefront of vaccine research. Under the state of emergency declared by the country, such research has been carried out very quickly and strictly through close domestic cooperation. In May and July, the results of the progress made in the early trials of COVID-19 vaccine developed by China were published in the Lancet respectively.
China's experience shows that it is very important to invest in national health and research systems and effectively improve laboratory capabilities.
This is the basis for the country to respond quickly and effectively to health emergencies and global health security.
Other countries, especially low-income and middle-income countries, are worth learning from.
In addition, China's experience proves that on the basis of strong research, there must be a strong high-level decisively relying on scientific basis to make correct decisions, so that the COVID-19 epidemic can be effectively controlled.
The article emphasizes that the government and its leaders must respect science, understand the value of science, and take action against it in the most beneficial way to society.
At the beginning of the outbreak, China's National Health and Construction Commission sent three groups of infectious disease experts to Wuhan to investigate the risk and spread of novel coronavirus. Their suggestions provided the basis for Wuhan's decision to "close the city" on January 23; When some experts put forward the necessity and urgency of building a shelter hospital, the government quickly made a decision and implemented it quickly; At the same time, the extensive participation of the community and the masses also made the epidemic quickly and effectively controlled.
Finally, the article emphasizes that in response to global health emergencies, countries need to strengthen global cooperation and joint response.

Director Dapeng's "Good Luck" was shortlisted for the Golden Goblet Awar - Xinhuanet
On July 18, the 23rd Shanghai International Film Festival announced the official list of films selected for the Golden Goblet Award.
Director Dapeng's first realistic film "Good Luck" was successfully shortlisted for the Golden Goblet Award of this film festival, and the film officially released its first poster.
Photo courtesy of poster film party
The film "Good Luck" is Dapeng's first realistic work, and it is also his second bond with the Golden Goblet Award.
The film tells the story of a comedy director who returned to his hometown in the northeast countryside on a whim, hoping to make a literary and artistic film for the New Year. As a result, he encountered a series of accidents.
The family members gathered for filming finished the final party.
In the movie poster released today, Wang Jixiang, a member of the family, sits in the middle of the picture smoking a cigarette. The background is the black land of Northeast China dressed in silver, and the prospect is the red lanterns that Chinese people must hang on holidays.
The red lantern, which symbolizes joy and reunion, is in great contrast to the lonely Wang Jixiang, which seems to reveal the complexity and entanglement in this big family relationship.
It is reported that in the film, except for the daughter of "Third Uncle" Wang Jixiang, who is played by actor Liu Lu, the rest of the scenes are completed by the real director's family. The experimental audio-visual style of the film breaks the boundary between drama and reality and brings the audience a brand-new immersive viewing experience.
According to director Dapeng, the creation of "Good Luck" originated from "an act of God". A series of sudden changes in the family during the shooting forced the original shooting plan to change accordingly. Life without a script was finally recorded as a movie, but it released tension beyond design.
How does director Dapeng face this "providence" and how can he continue to meet the changes brought about by this providence?
There is no doubt that "Good Luck" is full of experiments. The almost full lineup and innovative audio-visual style have turned life in front of the camera into a movie. Under the package of real images, the audience will also find the shadow of themselves and their families from the family presented in the film. With the end of the family gathering in the film, a series of thoughts are aroused.
NEWS.GOV.MO: Novel Coronavirus Infection Response Coordination Center Enquiry Hotline Statistics (July 25 08:00 - July 26 08:00)
From 08H00 on July 25 to 08H00 on July 26, 2020, the enquiry hotline of Novel Coronavirus Infection Response Coordination Center received 292 telephone enquiries.
291 enquiries about the epidemic situation have been immediately transferred to representatives of relevant departments for follow-up. The situation is as follows:
271 cases from the Health Bureau (involving: inquiring about isolation; inquiring about nucleic acid testing; inquiring about the cards of the two places; health codes; others.)
17 cases from the Public Security Police Department (involving: inquiring about immigration measures; inquiring about the entry and exit measures of licensed vehicles in Guangdong and Macao; inquiring about Zhuhai government affairs hotline; inquiring about the stay of documents.)
1 case from Tourism Bureau (involving: inquiring about isolated hotels.)

Maritime and Water Affairs Bureau 1 case (involving: asking whether Hong Kong fishing boats need to report to the Maritime and Water Affairs Bureau and nucleic acid testing when entering Hong Kong.)
At Banong Zhuokang sentry post, platoon leader Yu Wang and a soldier stood guard on duty.
In this place where the annual average temperature is more than ten degrees below zero, a row of simple barracks stands at the mountain pass, and a national flag flutters in the wind not far from the barracks. Soldiers stand guard in the wind every day and need to patrol at higher altitude regularly.
Soldiers need to use both hands and feet to climb the steep slope of rocky piles.
It was late July, when flowers and plants flourished at low altitude, while in Banong Zhuokang, only the ravine behind the barracks had relatively dense green.
Gao Peng, a soldier who has been stationed at the outpost for six years, pointed to the ravine and said that this is their back garden. Only in July and August can grass grow slowly every year. Soon after, it all turns yellow and is covered with snow.
It may take about 9 hours to patrol on foot.
Under the harsh plateau environment, the soldiers stationed here are accompanied by snow-capped mountains and glaciers all the year round, and they also regularly patrol mountain passes at higher altitudes.
A few days ago, a patrol composed of eight soldiers, led by instructor Liang Yixin, once again embarked on the patrol road.
Each soldier carried a weight of about 30 kg and headed for the target point early in the morning.
On the way, a soldier turned against Gao and his comrades gave emergency rescue.
In addition to patrol missions, the soldiers at the Banong Zhuokang sentry post have to carry out tactical and physical training every day.
As time goes by, the altitude is rising, the oxygen content is getting lower and lower, and the physical strength is constantly overdrawn. These factors test the will of the patrol members.
They gritted their teeth and insisted, crossing several landslides and dangerous beaches one after another.
At about 16 o'clock, it was lunch time for the patrol members. They took out their own dry food and sat on the spot at an altitude of more than 5,700 meters, accompanied by sleet and supplemented their physical strength with food.
Soldiers at Banong Zhuokang sentry post carry out tactical and physical training.
During the break, they will play cards together, and the losers will do push-ups, which can not only entertain but also exercise their physical fitness.
After a short rest in the cold wind, they climbed to the target point of the patrol, took out the national flag on the mountain pass and solemnly swore.
Behind them are snow-capped mountains, and in front of them are dozens of kilometers of no man's land. They are the safest guardians of the country.
Beijing consumption season restart - Xinhuanet
Beijing restarted various activities in the Beijing consumption season in accordance with the principle of "comprehensive restart, key planning, orderly promotion and strict organization".
On July 26, 1.5 million government and enterprise consumption vouchers were issued, including 1 million offline catering and shopping vouchers and 500,000 smart product vouchers, which can be collected by consumers in JD.com APP.
Liu Meiying, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Commerce, introduced at the media briefing held on the 25th that the restarted consumption season will further reduce the allocation of funds by enterprises on the basis of maintaining the preferential subsidies for existing consumption coupons and cards.
Starting from early August, the current 1:1 allocation of government and enterprise contributions will be adjusted to 2:1. For example, if the original consumer can enjoy a 120 yuan discount after receiving a card package to the store for consumption, the government will subsidize 60 yuan and the enterprise will make profits of 60 yuan. After the adjustment, the government subsidizes 80 yuan and the enterprise makes profits of 40 yuan.
During the consumption season, the three major operators will subsidize traffic and terminals around 5G consumption to further promote Beijing's new 5G infrastructure and new 5G consumption.
Chen Maobo pointed out that Hong Kong's economy has been hit by another outbreak of the epidemic, calling on all sectors to tide over the difficulties togethe - Chinanews.com
China News Service, Hong Kong, July 26-Chen Maobo, Financial Secretary of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, said on the 26th that Hong Kong is facing a new wave of novel coronavirus pneumonia epidemic, and business exchanges and economic activities that had shown signs of recovery have also been hit.
The SAR Government once again calls on owners of all sizes to reduce rents and tide over the difficulties with retailers, restaurants and small and medium-sized enterprises.
Chen Maobo published an article entitled "The Rugged Road to Recovery" on the Internet that day.
He said that the recent high number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Hong Kong and the grim situation have affected the people's livelihood and plagued the economy.
When the epidemic is repeated, the first thing is to strictly prevent imported cases, and deal with and interrupt the virus transmission chain as quickly as possible; When the epidemic is under control, economic activities should be resumed in a timely and corresponding manner.
He pointed out that in the face of the impact of the new wave of epidemic, business contacts and economic activities that had shown signs of recovery had also been hit.
For the business sector, apart from the spirit of contract, social responsibility is equally important, especially those groups that have received large government subsidies under the Employment Protection Scheme.
He mentioned that Hong Kong's economic situation in the second quarter of this year was still very grim, but the contraction seemed to slow down slightly.
On the export side, he believes that the external situation of Hong Kong is still grim.
Chen Maobo said that the development of Hong Kong in the past few decades shows that every crisis hides new opportunities and every difficulty hides the key to future development.

"The cost of services is increasing," he said.
Because of the epidemic, people began to spend more time on the Internet. "
Marinichev does not rule out that the Internet price will rise seriously every year, and believes that operators can provide customers with higher speed and more services to offset people's dissatisfaction with the price increase.
"Chinese Doctor" plans to shoot to pay tribute to anti-epidemic her - Xinhuanet
Recently, with the respect of Chinese filmmakers for fighting epidemic heroes, Yu Dong, chairman of Bona Film Group, and Liu Weiqiang (left), director of Bona Film Group, had a discussion and exchange with Academician Zhong Nanshan in Guangzhou on the filming and production of the anti-epidemic film "Chinese Doctor".
Bona Pictures hopes to pay tribute to all medical and epidemic prevention workers fighting in the front line of epidemic prevention and control through "Chinese Doctor"!
In 2021, the film will be released nationwide as a tribute film to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China.
At present, under the arrangement and deployment of the Central Propaganda Department and the National Film Bureau, and with the support of the Guangdong Film Bureau and the Hubei Film Bureau, Bona Pictures is organizing the original crew of the film "Chinese Captain" to prepare for the film "Chinese Doctor". This is a film that reflects the unity of the people of the whole country to fight the COVID-19 epidemic under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee.
Focusing on the front line of anti-epidemic in Wuhan, the film will take Wuhan medical staff and medical teams from various provinces and cities to help Hubei as the background, and show the touching stories of Chinese medical staff full of dedication and sacrifice in the front line of anti-epidemic from the perspective of human nature, using unique narration and highly impactful lens language.
It is understood that at the first time on the day when Wuhan was unsealed, Bona Company overcame many difficulties, sent a shooting team to go deep into the front line of the epidemic, and exchanged face-to-face understanding and collected information with hundreds of medical workers. At present, it has interviewed Academician Zhong Nanshan himself, Guangzhou's first aid to Wuhan, Guangdong's aid to Hubei medical team, and angels in white at the forefront of the anti-epidemic front, such as Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan Union Hospital, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University and Wuhan Central Hospital, and has taken a large number of precious first-hand video materials.
Academician Zhong Nanshan also raised expectations and hopes for the filming of the film in this symposium: "I am looking forward to it. I hope you will not only visit some experts who have made more appearances, but also interview more medical staff who are working hard in the front line. They are the majority."
He said that he had seen "Me and My Motherland" and "Captain of China" before and thought it was a good way to tell the story of the big pattern from the perspective of ordinary people.
"Now some foreign friends still have some misunderstandings about China."
When talking about the spread of the film, Academician Zhong Nanshan said that at present, some people abroad like to label the virus politicized, and he hopes that the film can impress the audience from the perspective of human nature: "In addition to being shown in China, it is best for this film to be shown abroad, and to impress the audience with a real humanistic spirit in a way that both domestic and foreign audiences can understand."
Academician Zhong Nanshan also fondly recalled the film "People to Middle Age" in the 1980s. "After so many years, what impressed me most about the film after the reform and opening up was" People to Middle Age ". At that time, my foreign doctor friends all cried. If" Chinese Doctor "can play such a role, it would be great."
Academician Zhong Nanshan said that if "Chinese Doctor" can resonate with foreign audiences, it will be very successful.
During the discussion and exchange, Academician Zhong Nanshan also shared his opinions and suggestions on the current international epidemic prevention and control, "I believe that people are always smarter than viruses."
Academician Zhong Nanshan said that although the virus is difficult to predict, from the primitive society to the present, human beings have survived thousands of difficulties and risks. Nowadays, modern society has developed medical science and technology and social management measures. In addition, medical staff and even ordinary people all over the world have a basic understanding of scientific response to the COVID-19 epidemic. People will no longer be as passive as before. "Next, we should pay attention to two aspects of work, one is to study how the world can strengthen cooperation, and the other is to pay attention to soothing people's hearts."

Cultural Tourism "Red Fruit" Gathers in Shaoshan-Xiangtan First Red Expo-Today's Highlights-Hunan Daily Network-Huasheng Online
Hunan Daily New Hunan Client Correspondent Jiang Rui Correspondent Xiao Yan
Jiaxing Red Boat Mould, Shaoshan Mao Zedong Bronze Statue, Yan'an Cloth Flower Crafts, Xiangxi Yongshun Bacon... On July 25, 2020 Hunan Red Tourism Culture Festival opened in Shaoshan.
As one of the main activities, the first Xiangtan Red Cultural Industry Expo was held in Shaoshan Global Tourism Consulting and Distribution Center.
Red cultural and creative products in the exhibition area and native products in the old revolutionary base areas are dazzling, attracting tourists from all over the world to buy them.
"This Red Expo is not only a demonstration of the achievements of the national red cultural industry, but also an important platform for exhibitors and enterprises to exchange experiences and explore development paths."
According to the relevant person in charge of the executive committee of the first Xiangtan Red Expo, the theme of this Red Expo is "Promoting Red Culture and Boosting Cultural Tourism", with a total exhibition area of nearly 3,000 square meters, and an atmosphere creation area, a scenic spot exhibition area and an online shopping experience area for red cultural tourism online games have been set up.
137 enterprises and units from 8 provinces and cities including Jiaxing, Zhejiang, Zunyi, Guizhou and Yan'an, Shaanxi, as well as Changsha, Zhuzhou, Yueyang and Chenzhou in our province were invited to participate in the exhibition, with 768 kinds of exhibits on display, including red cultural relics, handicrafts, food specialties, tourist routes, red training courses and red cultural and creative products.
The exhibition area will last until July 29th.
As the host of the Red Expo, Xiangtan exhibition area has many bright spots.
According to the person in charge of the exhibition area, Xiangtan exhibition area is divided into two parts: the development of red industry and red cultural industry.

More than 30,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Japa - Xinhuanet
According to statistics, there were 239 new confirmed cases in Tokyo on the 26th, and more than 200 new cases were added in a single day for six consecutive days, with a total of 11,214 cases.
In addition, there were 141 new confirmed cases in Osaka Prefecture, 90 new cases in Fukuoka Prefecture and 80 new cases in Aichi Prefecture.
In the first half of the year, telecommunication network fraud crimes rose by 70%, and the highest inspection summarized characteristic - Chinanews.com
BEIJING, July 26 According to the website of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, in the first half of this year, procuratorial organs across the country prosecuted 58,101 people for fraud crimes, up 35% year-on-year.
Especially in the crimes hindering the prevention and control of the epidemic, fraud crimes occur frequently, and the number of fraud crimes prosecuted by procuratorial organs accounts for 43.4% of the total number of crimes hindering the prevention and control of the epidemic.
The Supreme People's Procuratorate has carried out targeted guidance. Among the ten batches of typical cases involving epidemic prevention and control that have been released so far, there are 9 cases involving fraud.
Judging from the handling of cases by procuratorial organs in the first half of the year, there are many kinds of fraud crimes, ranging from national macro policies to people's clothing, food, housing and transportation, including epidemic-related fraud, "medical care" fraud, "health care products" fraud, "enrollment intermediary" fraud, "routine loan" fraud, defrauding state subsidies fraud, national assets unfreezing fraud and so on, constantly "innovating", covering education, medical care, employment, old-age care, social security, land acquisition and demolition, precise poverty alleviation, financial credit and other fields, which not only cause economic losses to the victims, but also seriously affect economic and social development.
In particular, some telecommunication network frauds break through the restrictions of national boundaries, regions and personnel, and have the characteristics of stakeholder, cross-border, remote, electronic payment, etc. There are many unspecified victim groups and great harm.
For example, some set up special companies, rent high-end office buildings, set up multiple departments or posts, use legal network platforms to publicize and recruit, train and assess recruiters, adopt enterprise operation mode management, and wear "legal cloak", which is more confusing.
It is the unshirkable responsibility of procuratorial organs to punish and prevent crimes according to law and issue early warnings to the public and relevant departments in a timely manner.
In judicial handling, procuratorial organs conscientiously perform their duties, not only insisting on maintaining a high-pressure situation against fraud crimes, but also refining various law enforcement measures in a targeted manner, and promoting social governance by issuing procuratorial suggestions.
Procuratorial organs strictly control the facts, evidence, procedures and application of law in approving and prosecuting fraud cases, and take facts as the basis and law as the criterion, so as not to waste money.
Especially for telecommunication network fraud crimes, we should pay attention to the core role of electronic data in fact determination, and strive to build an evidence chain of mutual confirmation among electronic data, verbal evidence and documentary evidence.
For example, in the case of an epidemic-related fraud handled by the Yinzhou District Procuratorate of Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province, the procuratorial organ intervened in advance at the first time, and it took only five days from the occurrence of the case to its completion, reflecting the attitude and determination to handle it quickly and strictly and maintain the stability of the overall social situation.
In the process of examining arrest and prosecution, attention was paid to the prosecution of missing criminals in cases, correcting 733 missing arrests by public security organs and 1113 missing examination and prosecution of accomplices by public security organs.
In the first half of the year, procuratorial organs across the country issued 298 procuratorial suggestions on fraud crimes, promoting joint efforts to prevent fraud crimes and promoting in-depth governance.
For example, in view of the loopholes found in the supervision of telecommunication networks by communication enterprises, banks, intermediary organizations, etc., Guangzhou Procuratorate and Dongguan Procuratorate of Guangdong Province put forward procuratorial suggestions in time, urging relevant units to strengthen supervision, improve mechanisms, and promote the construction of a long-term system.
The fourth is to do a good job in recovering stolen goods and losses.
Procuratorial organs around the country seize important links such as intervening in investigation, guiding evidence collection, examining and prosecuting, urging investigation organs to actively recover stolen money, cooperating with relevant departments to do a good job in recovering stolen goods and losses, and striving to minimize the economic losses caused by fraud crimes to the people.
For example, in the Lin Moumou routine loan case handled by the Beijing Municipal Procuratorate, the case involved 22 properties waiting to be sealed up. Under the condition that the property may be disposed of first by other cases, it was the first to issue a "suspension letter" and deliver it to the relevant court in a timely manner. It is suggested that the previous seizure court suspend the execution of the property involved and dispose of it uniformly after the criminal facts are found out, so as to make the best efforts to recover the property involved and recover the losses of the victims.
Prosecutors remind everyone to be very vigilant against fraud crimes, not to expect "pie in the sky", not to be credulous because it is cheap, and to keep their "money bags".
Yina Town, Weining County, Guizhou Province: Shorter Apple Trees, Broader Road to Poverty Alleviation
2020-07-26 11:42:58 Source: China Economic Net Author: Zhu Yanjing Editor: Zhu Yanjing
In the scorching heat, a reporter from Economic Daily-China Economic Net walked into Zhonghai Village, Yina Town, Weining County, Guizhou Province.
Under the scorching sun, villager Li Yuanzhong weeded in the base. Although his face was red in the sun, he hummed a few ditties from time to time.
Weining County, where Yina Town is located, has a certain popularity in the surrounding areas due to its low latitude, high altitude, sufficient light and large temperature difference between day and night. However, due to its small size and many spots, it has not been able to sell at a good price and form an industrial scale.
Yina Town used to be a poor township that "wrapped valley potato for the spring and autumn". Ten years ago, the incidence of local poverty was as high as 25.8%.
In the critical period of getting rid of poverty and entering a decisive battle, it is urgent to change the traditional planting habits, adjust the industrial structure and increase farmers' income.
After many visits, Chen Chao, secretary of the Party Committee of Yina Town, and a group of people in the town believed that industrial development could no longer follow the old path.
To this end, Yina Town introduced leading enterprises to grow apples in a modern way.
Hou Jianwen, deputy general manager of Weining Chaoyue Agriculture Co., Ltd., came to Yina Town from Shaanxi Province in 2015 for investigation, took a fancy to the local planting conditions at a glance, and began to plant apple trees locally in 2016.
At first, the village mobilized Li Yuanzhong to transfer the land to plant apple trees. Li Yuanzhong and his wife murmured in their hearts: "After planting apples for so many years, I haven't seen anyone in the village who has grown apples and made a fortune."
"The apples planted are dwarf apples, which will not make the apple trees grow too high."
To Li Yuanzhong's surprise, a new method was adopted for apple planting this time. Irrigation pipes were laid under each apple tree, and water and fertilizer were poured to the roots of the tree. When the fruit was harvested in autumn, the tractor drove directly into the orchard and could pick the fruit standing up.
At present, the Apple base has gradually entered a high-yield period, and the market is as expected by Hou Jianwen. Apple is not worried about selling and is deeply loved by consumers in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and other cities.
The growing apple industry has brought new changes to Li Yuanzhong's life. Although he is still farming, he has a new source of income.
Li Yuanzhong's family has more than 9 mu of land transferred to the Apple Base. Every year, in addition to the guaranteed land transfer fee, there is also a profit dividend after hanging the fruit. The couple usually work in the base. "One person can get 80 yuan every day and have work all the year round."
Li Yuanzhong told reporters that last year's profit dividend was more than 2,800 yuan, plus the land transfer fee and the couple's working income, and the family's income was more than 80,000 yuan. "There is no worry about food and clothing, and a well-off life has already lived."
"At present, it has achieved initial results. The annual output value of 1 mu of apples exceeds 15,000 yuan, which is about 10 times that of corn."
Chen Chao told reporters that 20,000 mu of apples have been planted in the whole town of Yina, 6,000 mu in Zhonghai Village alone, covering 4,056 households and 17,200 people, including 656 households and 2,952 poor households who have set up files and set up cards. The annual salary is more than 6 million yuan, which really realizes that the base is built at home and there is no need to go out to work.
Li Yuanzhong, whose pockets are bulging day by day, has also begun to realize his "wish".
During the Lunar New Year this year, Li Yuanzhong bought an off-road vehicle and now drives to and from work every day. "There are still more than ten mu of land at home. When the next step is to expand the scale of the Apple base, all of it will be transferred to them, and the income will be even more."

Membrane separation technology helps crack the "greenhouse effect"
Schematic diagram of preparation technology of new mixed matrix membrane
News from our newspaper reporter Shang Rui reported: A few days ago, the atmospheric environment and bioenergy team of Tianjin University made great progress on "carbon dioxide capture by membrane separation" and successfully developed a new hybrid matrix membrane preparation technology to greatly improve the carbon dioxide capture performance of membrane materials.
Relevant achievements have been published as cover articles of the international journal Greenhouse Gases: Science and Technology.
"Greenhouse effect" is a major environmental problem that puzzles human development, and carbon dioxide emission is the culprit causing "greenhouse effect".
How to efficiently capture and utilize carbon dioxide emitted by human beings is the focus of scientists' attention.
"Membrane separation method" is a new carbon dioxide capture technology, which separates carbon dioxide gas with the help of membrane materials, and has the characteristics of high efficiency, energy saving and simple operation.
How to make the membrane material "breathe deeply" and improve the efficiency of gas separation is the bottleneck and difficulty of capturing carbon dioxide by membrane separation.
The scientific research team of Tianjin University innovated ideas and explored the influence of different solvents on membrane gas separation performance through repeated experiments.
The experimental results show that with N-methylpyrrolidone as the preparation solvent, the distribution of carbon nanotubes in the membrane material is more uniform and "more breathable", which effectively improves the gas separation efficiency and rate of the membrane material.
The carbon dioxide separation performance of the mixed matrix membrane prepared by this new technology is close to the theoretical separation upper limit of this kind of membrane material at present.
"The new technology provides a new idea for capturing carbon dioxide by membrane separation."
Li Run, a member of Tianjin University's Atmospheric Environment and Bioenergy Team, said: "We hope that this technology can provide strong support for future coal-fired power plants and chemical enterprises to deal with flue gas and play a major role in controlling greenhouse gas emissions and other fields."
Understand what is the professional grade difference before volunteering to fill in the repor - Chinanews.com

Understand what is the professional grade difference before volunteering to fill in the report.
Every year, when filling in college entrance examination volunteers, some students or parents do not understand the terms involved in volunteering, which affects volunteering.
This year, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing University of Science and Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing Forestry University and Beijing University of Chemical Technology jointly issued the 2020 enrollment policy to cancel the professional grade difference.
What does professional grade difference mean and what is the significance in voluntary reporting?
There are three ways to allocate professional rules
Experts remind that before filling in the volunteer form, you must carefully read the "Admissions Regulations" of your favorite school to understand the admission rules of colleges and universities, including the transfer ratio, professional distribution rules, etc.
Professional distribution rules refer to the three main ways of professional admission: professional priority, score priority and professional grade difference after the transfer of files in colleges and universities.
The specific method used by colleges and universities will be specified in the enrollment regulations.
However, there are also some colleges and universities whose admission principle is to give priority to the total score, and there is no grade difference between majors.
That is to say, candidates within the admission range will be queued up according to the total score. When the score does not reach the first professional voluntary admission score line, it will be seen whether it has reached the second professional voluntary admission score line, and so on until the last professional voluntary is admitted, and there is no grade difference between the professional voluntary.
The so-called "professional grade difference" means that when colleges and universities arrange candidates' majors, they determine the admission majors of volunteer candidates of different majors according to one or several score values published in the enrollment regulations. This score value is "professional grade difference".
That is, the score difference between the first professional volunteer and the non-first professional volunteer of the college when admitting candidates, and the grade difference scores between the professional volunteers, such as 3 points, 2 points, 1 point, etc.
For example.
Suppose student Xiaoming applied for college A and scored 560 points. His professional volunteers are: computer, international trade, automation, mechanical engineering and e-commerce. The professional admission of college A adopts the method of professional grade difference, and the grade difference is divided into 2 points, 1 point, 1 point and 0 point.
In the professional allocation, if Xiaoming's first professional volunteer meets the professional admission requirements and the major has a planned balance, then Xiaoming is admitted to the "computer" major; If the computer is not admitted, his score will be subtracted by 2 points, and candidates who volunteer to apply for "international trade" with the first major will be ranked according to the score of 558 points to determine whether they meet the professional admission conditions; If it is still not satisfied, the score will be subtracted by 1 point (that is, 557 points) for the "automatic" admission of the third professional volunteer; If it is still not satisfied, the score will be subtracted by 1 point (that is, 556 points) for admission to the fourth major, If the follow-up major still cannot meet its professional wishes, the score will not be reduced, and so on.
Different universities have different professional grade differences
With the popularization of parallel volunteering, many colleges and universities have now cancelled the professional grade difference, but some colleges and universities still retain this method this year. Judging from the "enrollment regulations" announced by various colleges and universities, more than 20 universities have set up professional grade differences this year.
For example, Sichuan Agricultural University, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Heilongjiang University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Jiangxi Normal University, Chengdu Medical College, Northeast Dianli University, Jimei University, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing University of Technology, Ningxia University, Shandong University of Technology, China Civil Aviation Flight College, etc.
In these universities, each university has different professional grades.
Some colleges and universities have a grade difference in each major, such as Ningxia University. Candidates whose files have been submitted to the school are admitted according to the order in which candidates fill in their professional volunteers by 1 point in turn.
However, some universities have set different professional grades between different majors.
For example, Jimei University, the total score of professional volunteer grade difference is 4 points, that is, the grade difference between the first professional volunteer and other professional volunteers is 3 points, and there is no grade difference between other professional volunteers, which is regarded as parallel volunteer, and the professional grade difference between other professional volunteers and transfer professional volunteers is 1 point.
When filling in their volunteers, candidates and parents must carefully read the admission policy of the reported school to see if there is a professional grade difference and what is the form of the grade difference. While fully considering the scores, they should also reasonably analyze the schools and majors to be selected. If the colleges and universities clearly adopt the grade difference method for admission in the enrollment regulations, candidates should pay attention to the gradient between the majors when choosing majors to improve the admission probability.

Chengdu people gathered to watch the US consulate police prevent people from "looking too happy"
In response to the closure of the Chinese Consulate General in Houston by the United States, China announced the closure of the US Consulate General in Chengdu on Friday.
On Saturday, the badge of the US consulate was removed, and on Sunday, a dark glass car left the consulate amid boos from passers-by.
On Sunday, many Chengdu people gathered in front of the US Consulate to take photos, and those who had not been there were also driven by curiosity about current events to take a look.
Agence France-Presse reporters from Chengdu Railway Station also went to observe near the US Consulate in Chengdu, and reported that there was an endless stream of curious people, and many parents took their children for a walk to watch the Consulate, take photos of buildings, or take selfies.
The consulate was surrounded by guards, and the police "corrected" people's behavior from time to time. They did not seem to allow any outrageous behavior: a woman was stopped as soon as she was preparing to sing red songs, and a guard confiscated a banner.
However, residents of a nearby residential building succeeded in pulling up a giant Chinese flag on their balcony and shouting slogans in support of China.
The US Consulate in Chengdu opened in 1985, covering all consular affairs of the United States in southwestern China, especially the Tibet Autonomous Region.
Agence France-Presse reporter from Chengdu station said that the Chinese government's response to the United States was relatively restrained: many Chinese people asked the government to close the US consulate in Hong Kong online, but the official only said that "closing the US consulate in Chengdu is a necessary and legal response to the unreasonable behavior of the United States".
At present, in addition to Chengdu, the United States has consulates in Guangdong, Shanghai, Shenyang, Wuhan and Hong Kong in China.
Large-scale financial media action "Walking to the Village Live to Watch Poverty Alleviation" starts-Today's Highlights-Hunan Daily Network-Huasheng Online
Hunan Daily, New Hunan Client, July 25 (Reporter) On July 25, the large-scale financial media action "Going to the Village Live to See Poverty Alleviation" sponsored by the Financial Program Center of the Central Radio and Television General Station started from Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province. Two caravans carrying 5G new media mobile cloud production and broadcasting system slowly drove out of the scene under the eyes of the guests at the scene.
General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out that "2020 is a milestone year. We will build a well-off society in an all-round way and achieve the goal of the first century. 2020 is also the year of decisive battle against poverty".
The large-scale financial media action "Going to the Village Live to Watch Poverty Alleviation" is an important measure taken by the Financial Program Center of the Central Radio and Television General Station to cooperate with this major theme and do a good job in poverty alleviation propaganda.
The action will go into poverty alleviation villages in more than 20 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the Central Government across the country, dig out fresh poverty alleviation stories, directly attack the great changes in the appearance of villages and villages, and show how villagers break through the predicament of survival and development and move towards the road of becoming rich.
The operation will last for more than three months.
The reporter started from Xuzhou and divided into two roads, all the way to the southwest line, passing through Anhui, Hubei, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangxi, Guizhou, Sichuan, Chongqing, Yunnan, Tibet and other places; The other road takes the northwest line, passing through Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Hebei and other places, with a journey of more than 10,000 kilometers.
In the form of reporting, "Walking to the Village Live to Watch Poverty Alleviation" boldly integrates.
The economic development of the villages visited by the caravan will be broadcast through CCTV Financial Channel, CCTV Economic Voice, China Traffic Radio and CCTV Financial New Media.
Among them, the live TV broadcast will be mainly completed in the noon news program "Tianxia Finance" of CCTV Financial Channel (premiere time:12:00-13:00 from Monday to Sunday), and the prime-time news column "Economic Information Network" of CCTV Financial Channel will set up a poverty alleviation report column (premiere time:20:30-21:30 from Monday to Sunday).
At the same time, the caravan will broadcast live for up to one hour to each village on the CCTV financial client. The audience can watch the live broadcast and participate in the lottery by downloading the CCTV financial APP.
In terms of technology application and studio design, "Walking to the Village Live to Watch Poverty Alleviation" has the courage to make a breakthrough and pioneered the "Outfield New Media Caravan".
The car is equipped with 5G new media mobile cloud production and broadcasting system, and uses 5G + 4K / 8K + AI technology to realize the organic combination of online and offline, large screen and small screen, and TV broadcasting.
Equipped with Sanxun broadcasting area, the broadcasting area is converted from a container, with a length of 12 meters, a width of 2.55 meters and a height of 3.98 meters. The box adopts a hydraulic automatic deployment structure, which can turn up to 120 degrees.
The studio area can also be automatically expanded and an external expansion platform, covering an area of more than 50 square meters, can meet the scene requirements of most programs.
At present, Dongchuan District of Kunming City is already hot in summer, and what is hotter than the weather is the poverty alleviation workshop next to the relocation site.
Lv Ling, an employee of Kunming Aisfu Electronic Technology Company, said, "Now, as soon as you leave your home, you enter the factory door to make money and take care of your family. Thanks to the free vocational skills training organized by the trade union."
Walking into the poverty alleviation workshop of electronic components processing in Tongdu Street, Dongchuan District, a busy picture came into view.
Lv Ling, who is in her 40s, is a single mother. She takes care of her children alone and takes care of her elderly parents.
When she was in the most difficult time, Dongchuan District Federation of Trade Unions helped to come up with ideas and find ways to "send charcoal in the snow" after running.
Since 2018, Lv Ling has enjoyed housing, schooling, social security, employment and other assistance policies and assistance funds issued by trade unions at all levels.
This year, her child has successfully graduated and employed, and she herself has a job and income after taking part in skills training, and has been out of trouble at the end of April.
It is reported that the special skills training project of Dongchuan District General Organization to help fight poverty is part of the skills training work of Yunnan Federation of Trade Unions.
According to the characteristics of the workers in difficulty in the relocation and resettlement sites for poverty alleviation in the district, the district general manager made in-depth investigations to understand the training needs, determined the types of training jobs, and planned to train 450 electricians, welders and pastry chefs in the near future.
Recently, Li Yi, an employee of the Agricultural Bank of Yunnan Menglian County Sub-branch, wrote a sincere thank-you letter to the County Federation of Trade Unions.
In her letter, she sincerely thanked the trade union for giving her the golden autumn student aid from August 2013 to January 2017 to help her complete her studies.
In 2004, Li Yi's father died in a car accident and her mother was included in the files of employees in difficulty. Since then, she has been enjoying the care of the filing and card-setting policy.
With the help of the local trade union, Li Yi successfully completed her studies.
Since 2016, 3,809 households have been lifted out of difficulties through institutional guarantee and precise assistance.
The success of Lv Ling's family and Li Yi in getting rid of difficulties is a microcosm of Yunnan trade unions promoting the work of getting rid of difficulties for workers in difficulty.
According to Duan Kaiyuan, a staff member of the Legal and Rights Protection Department of the Yunnan Federation of Trade Unions, the provincial general manager has strengthened the dynamic management of the files of employees in difficulty, promoted the normalization of filing work, and timely incorporated the difficult employees who meet the filing conditions into the assistance system; Broaden the application channels for employees in difficulty, and use WeChat to open an online filing service platform for employees in difficulty, so as to facilitate employees in difficulty to declare voluntarily in a timely manner.
During the epidemic period, it was difficult to go out to work. In order to help workers with difficulties in filing relieve the pressure of life, Yunnan Province has arranged a total of more than 13 million yuan to send warm funds. According to the standard of 2,000 yuan per household for workers with difficulties in filing at the national level and 1,500 yuan per household for workers with difficulties in filing at the provincial level, more than 6,000 national and 1,000 provincial workers with difficulties in filing have been given special warm condolences.
At the same time, the provincial general manager connects with various Internet recruitment platforms such as human and social departments and Zhaopin recruitment, pushes recruitment information to employees in difficulty, and provides employment consultation, employment guidance and other services.
