Talent is the key to rural revitalization.
Where to find talent?
Excellent migrant workers returning to their hometowns are an indispensable force.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 26: Turning Excellent Migrant Workers Back Home into a New Force for Rural Revitalization
This year, 34 - year - old Zhang Xiong, whose family lives in Orchard Village, Meishan City, Sichuan Province, quit his job in Beijing with a monthly salary of tens of thousands in 2010 and returned home to start a business.
After several years of hard work, he now runs a family viticulture farm with an annual income of more than one million yuan, and has become a well - known leader in getting rich, and has also been selected to join the "two committees" of the village.
In recent years, inspired by a series of policies to support and benefit farmers, such as the national fight against poverty and rural revitalization, more and more outstanding migrant workers like Zhang Xiong have chosen to return to their hometowns to start businesses, which has activated a pool of spring water in the countryside.
Sichuan, a province with a large population in western China and a major labor export province, has implemented the "Excellent Migrant Workers Reintroduction and Training Project" in light of the situation, and in 2019 alone, more than 8,000 village party branch secretaries, 61,000 village reserve forces, and more than 20,000 party members were selected from the outstanding migrant workers, providing a strong guarantee for winning the battle against poverty and implementing the strategy of rural revitalization.
Well - off is not well - off, the key depends on fellow countrymen.
Since the reform and opening up, a large number of young and middle - aged laborers in China's rural areas have gone out to work to increase their income, and some have set up their own enterprises through hard work.
However, objectively, it has also led to the "hollowing out" of rural areas to varying degrees, especially the weakening of rural grass - roots organizations, and the village party branch secretaries and party members have shown the characteristics of "one old and one low", that is, they are aging, have low academic qualifications, and the village party organization leaders are not strong, and the problem of lack of youth and youth is prominent.
If rural talents and other elements continue to flow to cities in one direction, and the countryside is in a state of "blood loss" and "anemia" for a long time, revitalization is an empty phrase.
To attract back migrant workers who are capable, aware, and interested in serving their hometowns, to guide them to return to their hometowns to start businesses and become leaders in becoming rich, to train them to become Party members and rural cadres on the basis of merit, and to enrich the ranks of cadres at the grass - roots level, is the solution to the root causes of the shortage of rural Party members and grass - roots Party organizations.
Excellent migrant workers should be brought back, and they should be allowed to stay and do well.
In recent years, Sichuan has started by paying close attention to the party building of migrant workers, and on the basis of strict candidate criteria, has established systems and mechanisms such as targeted return, service guarantee, training, and selection and use of outstanding migrant workers, so that they can improve their abilities, secure their jobs, and have hope in their lives, so that they can truly take root in rural areas, and have a sense of accomplishment in starting a business.
This year marks the end of the decisive battle against poverty, and talent is the key factor in connecting the fight against poverty with rural revitalization.
Party committees and governments at all levels should attach great importance to the group of outstanding migrant workers returning to their hometowns, and, through comprehensive measures, turn them into a task force and a new force that can stay, fight, and take them away, so as to provide strong organizational guarantee and talent support for rural poverty alleviation, well - off society, and development and revitalization.
Because of the epidemic, this year's college graduates are a very special class, and on the evening of July 11, the Bilibili Summer Graduation Song Festival brought a special live online performance to the graduates, and musicians such as Lao Wolf, Pu Shu, Li Yuchun, and Mao Yi sent songs and best wishes to the fresh graduates.
Wu Yifan, a well - known up - and - comer, also brought "Weeds," a rap song based on Lu Xun's collection of prose poems of the same name, which is extremely popular among young people.
Due to the epidemic, many graduates failed to experience the sense of ceremony of dialing ears and awarding degree certificates on the spot, so they transferred the sense of ceremony online.
Data showed that the 2.5 - hour song festival had a peak live popularity of more than 35 million.
"Follow your heart, seize the opportunity, and do not care about the consequences, but sometimes there will be unexpected gains."
Although it was a graduation song festival, many of the songs also moved non - fresh graduates.
"I really want to cry after watching the whole scene. Everyone's youth is full of beauty and regret, but it is worth remembering, and everyone should go on bravely."
Beijing's natural ecology continues to improve, attracting more than 500 species of wild animals to "settle" in cities - chinanews.com

The natural ecology of the capital continues to improve, attracting wildlife cities to "settle"
There are more than 500 species of wild animals in Beijing
(Reporter Wang Bin) A reporter from Beijing Youth Daily learned from the Municipal Landscape and Greening Bureau that with the continuous improvement of the natural ecological environment in the capital in recent years, the species and number of wild animals have also continued to increase.
At present, the number of terrestrial vertebral wild animals inhabiting Beijing has increased to more than 500 species, including first - class protected animals such as brown horse chickens and black storks, as well as second - class protected animals such as impala, whooper swans, gray cranes, and mandarin ducks.
Whether it is an urban forest planted in the Second Ring Road or a small wetland embedded between buildings, it not only brings wild nature to the citizens of the capital, but also attracts wild animals to "settle" in the city.
In the middle of summer, the Songshan National Nature Reserve, located in the Yanshan Mountains in the northwest of Yanqing District, is full of vitality.
A raccoon was playing leisurely by a mountain stream, while two dogs and badgers were joking with each other.
Hu Qiaoli, director of the Songshan National Nature Reserve Management Office, said that by the end of 2019, 178 species of wild animals, including the national first - class protected animal golden eagle and the national second - class protected animal spoon chicken and impala, were living in this green sea with a total area of more than 6,200 hectares, and that nearly one - third of the city's wild animal species could be found here.
"In Songshan, wild animals are the real'owners', and our staff can only be considered'bodyguards' at best."
Hu Qiaoli said that in order to understand the situation of wild animals and plants in the reserve on the ground, more than 30 professional rangers patrol along 16 carefully formulated protection routes every day, and once a month, they also make a "big circle", which takes them to almost the entire reserve in a full day.
"During the inspection, it is necessary not only to check and record biodiversity, but also to check and install artificial bird nests, rescue injured wild animals, install infrared cameras in the wild, and so on."
More than 200 infrared cameras have been installed in Songshan National Nature Reserve to record the living conditions of wild animals in the forest.
Hu Qiaoli said that with the increasing biodiversity of protected areas in recent years, more and more wild animals have appeared in the camera, leopards, raccoons, and badgers have become "resident guests", and the "appearance rate" of the national second - class protected animal impala has also become higher and higher.
Zhang Zhiming, Director of the Wildlife and Wetland Protection Department of the Beijing Landscape and Greening Bureau, said that the number of terrestrial vertebral wild animals in Beijing has increased from 461 species in 1994 to more than 500 species today, and that the species and number of wild animals in Beijing have continued to increase in recent years.
The presence of wild animals in cities is becoming more and more common, which is closely related to the continuous upgrading of the greening of the capital city in recent years.
In particular, the new round of afforestation and greening of one million mu, which began in 2018, proposes to reshape the urban ecological environment, enhance the ecological function of woodland and green space, and highlight the concept of "near nature".
The planning strives to achieve interconnection and interaction with the surrounding green areas to facilitate wild animals to "visit relatives and friends", and the trees planted are also honey and food source plants that animals love.
Black Land "Sows" Agricultural Modernization - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 26: Black Land "Sows" Agricultural Modernization
In the middle of summer, two spraying aircraft passed over the 10,000 mu high - yield demonstration field at the Second Operation Station of the Fifth Management Area of Friendship Farm, forming two white lines, and the words "the first field in the world", planted with black rice seedlings in the green fields, stood out.
Kong Lingqiang, the director of the operation station, said that the aircraft can spray more than 6,000 mu of cultivated land a day, which is about 8 times more efficient than drones and hundreds of times more efficient than humans.
This farm is located in Friendship County, Heilongjiang Province, the largest grain - producing province in China, and from the sound of "swish" rice cutting in the past to the sound of "rumbling" today, traditional Chinese farming and farms have transformed on this black soil belt.
In addition to aircraft, satellites are also used in the modern agricultural production of Friendship Farm.
Kong Lingqiang said that on the one hand, they use satellite remote sensing technology to achieve precise fertilization, reduce agricultural input, and reduce pollution; on the other hand, satellite navigation technology can improve the standard operation level of agricultural machinery in the field.
During this year's rice production, the farm expanded the operating area of satellite navigation driverless seedling transplanting technology from 3,000 mu last year to 30,000 mu.
This technology makes seedling planting more uniform, maximizes the utilization of sunlight and cultivated land resources, and also saves 16 yuan in labor costs per acre.
The farm has tried new technologies such as informatization and intelligence in agricultural production, and has formed the largest agricultural machinery group in China from the ground to the sky.
According to statistics, at present, the total number of farm machinery is 49,000 units (pieces), and the comprehensive mechanization rate in the field is 99.8%.
The operation of agricultural machinery has achieved 100% GPS satellite navigation, 100% precision sowing in dry fields, and 100% high - powered locomotive operation in dry fields.
"Green agriculture, smart agriculture, and digital agriculture are the exploration directions for agricultural modernization."
Liu Hualien, director of Friendship Farm, said.
The key to agricultural modernization lies in scientific and technological progress.
In recent years, Heilongjiang's agricultural reclamation, represented by farms, has played a demonstration and leading role in the "aircraft carrier" of modern large - scale agriculture, and has initially established a modern agricultural industry system led by large - scale planting, standardized production, and industrial management.
On the outskirts of Friendship County, there is an agricultural machinery expo park covering an area of 350,000 square meters.
More than 140 units (pieces) of agricultural machinery and tools introduced and used by Heilongjiang's agricultural reclamation over the years are displayed here.
These agricultural machinery and farms have witnessed the development of China's agricultural modernization.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, July 26: Xie Xiao's Family for Everyone - - The People of Jiangkou River Lianwei in Hefei, Anhui Province Transferring Direct Strikes
Xinhua News Agency reporters Chen Shangying, Wang Liwu, and Liu Xia Village
At 4 p.m. on July 25, Fu Kun Bao, wearing rubber shoes covered in mud, went from the front room to the back room, and he and his wife, Zhou Yan, were busy packing things back and forth.
"I received a call from the village cadres for the transfer, and I was still weeding in the fields."
Fu Kun Bao said that he has transferred more than 60 acres of land, planted rice, and is now growing well, "I took medicine yesterday, but I haven't cleaned up any tools."
Fu Kun Bao pointed to the pesticide sprayer placed in the corner, "No one wants their home to be flooded, so let's leave the small family for everyone."
In order to cope with the continuous high water level pressure and possible heavy rainfall in Chaohu Lake, Hefei City, Anhui Province, is ready to open the Jiangkou River Lianwei, where Fu Kun Bao's family is located, for flood diversion and storage on the 26th.
Jiangkou River Lianwei is located in Fexi County, close to the Chaohu embankment.
In Wei, thousands of villagers involved in Yandian Township and Sanhe Town need to be transferred.
As of 16:00 on the 25th, the water level of Chaohu Lake, the fifth largest freshwater lake in China, remained at a high level of 13.2 meters, exceeding the guaranteed water level by 0.7 meters.
Fu Kun Bao's kitchen was clean, with a pot of pumpkin heads on the table, and eggs and some brine in the refrigerator.
"I didn't expect to move, but the water of the Jiangkou River looks good at present."
Zhou Yan said that the family was a bungalow, and that some large objects had not yet figured out where to put them.
"Pack up valuable items first, and large items such as refrigerators and televisions can be put in the homes of high - lying neighbors or relatives for the time being."
Wang Liwen, a village official, gave Fu Kun Bao an idea.
Wang Liwen was responsible for the transfer and resettlement of 13 villagers, and informed them one by one to confirm each person's resettlement plan.
The nearest settlement to Fu Kun Bao's family is Suxiao Primary School in Yandian Township, which is about 2 kilometers away.
In addition to large items, Fu Kun Bao and his wife also suffered from more than 1,000 pounds of grain and some newly purchased furniture.
"The food is ready to be dragged to relatives' homes, so there is no way to move the furniture."
As soon as the couple discussed, they put a stool under the newly purchased bed and raised it by about half a meter.
At 6 p.m., Fu Kun Bao began to use a tricycle to transport things to relatives' homes, and Zhou Yan continued to clean up at home.
At 11 o'clock in the evening, the couple looked at the house before and after, pulled up the electric gate, and prepared to go to the settlement.
"I hope the water recedes as soon as possible."
Fu Kun Bao said.
At 9:30 a.m. on July 26, the reporter saw at the scene of Jiangkou River Lianwei that all preparations had been made before the flood diversion.
Zhang Ji Colin Small House Team Up to Support Muscular Teenagers - Xinhuanet
The sports youth hot - blooded competitive show "Sports Bar Youth" officially landed on Hunan Satellite TV on July 11.
Zhang Jike, the sports leader, and Lin Xiaozhu, the sports assistant, shared the stage across the border, and Lin Dan and Fu Yuanhui commented on their respective styles, while the hardcore of the "behemoth" - like power pulling device made the program "burn".
In the first episode, 11 sports teenagers appeared on the power track, and while their appearance stunned the audience, the "strong conflict", "strong confrontation", and "strong heart" on the competitive stage also attracted attention.
Among them, the "strong conflict" came from Super A sports student Qiao Wenyi, who openly provoked Xu Zhibin, known as the "flower beauty man" on the same track, before the race, choking that Xu Zhibin's appearance condition should go to the singing and dancing program, and even released the harsh words, "Don't cry if you lose".
The remarks made the teenagers and the sports leaders on the field take a breath of cool air.
The "strong confrontation" was more like a fight between immortals, and Sun Jianqi, known as the "Great Demon King", met Zhang Xindong, who was also strong, and staged a strong showdown.
Their identities are also unexpected: Sun Jianqi is an actor who loves fitness, while Zhang Xindong is a retired special warfare team member and three - time Warrior Medal recipient.
At the beginning of the competition, the two teenagers made every effort to quickly pull out the small pole, and the long - lasting confrontation on the big pole made the audience sweat for them.
Under the tense conditions, Zhang Jike, as one of the leaders of the "Sports Bar Youth" campaign, was also watching the game carefully.
During the commentary session, he was also very careful, patiently encouraging the teenager who lost the match, and helping to make every mistake in the replay process.
The sports assistant Lin Xiaozhu, on the other hand, is a fancy assist, and she makes no secret of her appreciation for the teenagers whose face value is online.
When I learned about the overloaded daily training of sports teenagers, I admired them even more.
Lin Dan and Fu Yuanhui, who are also leaders of the movement, have their own styles, one is a "prophet" who is calm and idle, and the other is a "flood girl" who dispels tension with a smile.
In addition, Jike Junyi and Liu Ye, as sports assistants, have also created a lot of hilarious topics around sports teenagers.
Church fire in Nantes, France: Parish volunteers admit arson is usually kind and quiet - chinanews.com
chinanews.com, July 26 - According to foreign media reports, on July 18, the famous Cathedral of St. Peter and St. Paul, a religious and historical architectural treasure in Nantes, France, was severely damaged in a fire, and the organ was completely destroyed.
On the 26th local time, the Nantes prosecutor announced that a parish volunteer responsible for guarding the cathedral had been charged with "arson and destruction".
He has admitted that he started the fire in the church.
According to the report, local prosecutor Senas said that the 39 - year - old parish volunteer from Rwanda admitted that he had set fire to three places in the cathedral at night.
The man's lawyer said that the arsonist now regretted doing this.
This person entered France through asylum a few years ago, and was sheltered in the diocese where the fire occurred, and was taken in in the church.
The prosecution pointed out that he had recently tried to renew his visa and was in dialogue with the police.
However, the church said it still could not believe that the faithful, who were usually very kind and smiling, but did not speak much, would destroy the church he loved so much.
On the day of the fire on July 18, the volunteer had already been questioned and investigated by the police because of illogical problems in his account, but he was later released.
The picture shows firefighters carrying out rescue operations at the scene.
On the evening of the 25th, the man was arraigned again after the professional engineers of the Paris Central Police Laboratory obtained new evidence.
This time, the man admitted to the act of arson.
According to reports, if found guilty of intentional arson and destruction, the suspect could face 10 years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros.
According to the report, the fire caused serious damage to the Cathedral of St. Pierre and St. Paul, the organ in the church was completely burned, and the stained glass window behind the organ was also severely damaged.
Brunet, the chief architect of the French Historic Preservation Building, believes that it is conservatively estimated that the restoration of the South Cathedral will take at least three years.
Comprehensive news: US unilateralism undermines bilateral relations International public opinion supports China's countermeasures against the US - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26 - On the morning of July 24, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the U.S. Embassy in China that China had decided to revoke the establishment and operation license of the U.S. Consulate General in Chengdu, and put forward specific requirements for the Consulate General to stop all business and activities.
International public opinion believes that the unilateralist measures taken by the United States have caused serious distress to the relationship between China and the United States, and that it is legitimate and necessary for China to respond to the unreasonable provocations of the United States and take countermeasures.
Andres Borkes, director of the Center for China Studies at the Institute of International Studies at the University of Chile, said that the unilateralist measures of the United States have damaged the bridge of understanding between the two peoples and caused the relationship between the two great powers to suffer a crisis.
China's notification to the United States to close its Consulate General in Chengdu is a countermeasure to the unilateral measures of the United States and is in line with diplomatic practice.
Patricio Justo, a professor at the Catholic University of Argentina and director of the Argentina - China Research Center, believes that China's above - mentioned decision is a legitimate and necessary countermeasure to previous provocations by the United States, and is not aimed at ordinary Americans.
The United States is trying to divert the attention of the American people by pressuring China to cover up its inadequate response to the new coronavirus outbreak.
Bambang Suryono, chairman of the Asian Innovation Research Center, an Indonesian think tank, said that the provocative diplomatic gestures taken by the United States have caused serious distress to the relationship between China and the United States, and that the relationship between the two countries faces severe challenges.
China's notification to the United States to close its Consulate General in Chengdu is a normal countermeasure, which is in line with diplomatic practice, and not only reflects China's principled position of resolutely safeguarding its own interests, but also reflects the reasonableness, advantages, and benefits of China's diplomacy.
Tanzanian commentator Francis Semwinza said that China's above - mentioned decision was a legitimate and necessary response to the US provocation.
China - US relations should return to normal, and the US should take the initiative to improve its relations with China and stop interfering in China's internal affairs.
The United States should focus on how to achieve win - win economic and political results with China, and how to benefit the two peoples and the international community as a whole.
Ali Yusuf, executive director of the Sudan - based Federation of Arab - Chinese Friendship Associations, said that the countermeasures China was forced to take were a legitimate and necessary response to the unreasonable actions of the US, and were in line with international law and basic norms governing international relations, as well as diplomatic practice.
Previously, the US requested the closure of the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, which seriously violated international law and basic norms governing international relations.
It is hoped that the US will rescind its previous decision and create necessary conditions for bilateral relations to return to normal.
Singapore's Lianhe Zaobao published an editorial saying that the greater strategic intention of the United States is to contain China and prevent its continued rise.
In the face of pressure from the United States, although China does not want to see the relationship between China and the United States continue to deteriorate, it has to take countermeasures.

The relevant person in charge of the Guangdong Coast Guard said that in the future, it will continue to maintain a high - pressure situation, crack down on all kinds of illegal and criminal smuggling activities at sea, and maintain good order in the waters under its jurisdiction.
Hurricane Hannah may cause swollen rivers and flash floods as it makes landfall in Texas - chinanews.com
chinanews.com, July 26 China News Service reported that Hurricane Hannah made landfall in Texas at 5 p.m. local time on July 25, which will bring strong winds, torrential rain, swollen rivers, and life - threatening flash floods to Texas.
The National Hurricane Center said Hurricane Hannah is expected to sweep through parts of southern and northeastern Texas with torrential rain, which may cause some streams to swell and life - threatening flash floods.
According to the report, the area most affected by Hurricane Hannah is south of Corpus Christi to the mouth of the Rio Grande River, while widespread flash floods are possible in the Rio Grande Valley.
Texas Governor Abbott said on the 25th, "Any hurricane is a huge challenge."
Thirty-two counties in the state declared disaster emergencies because of the hurricane.
Corpus Christi, a city with a population of more than 320,000, has closed its libraries and museums, and residents are on standby.
Abbott also said that at a time when Texas is being hit hard by the new coronavirus pandemic, the hurricane cannot be allowed to bring more casualties to Texas.
According to reports, precipitation in southern Texas is expected to reach 6 to 12 inches on the night of the 26th, while northern Texas and coastal Louisiana will also receive 3 to 5 inches of rain.
Due to global warming and other factors, Hannah formed earlier than previous Atlantic hurricane seasons.
Typically, the first hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean does not form until mid - August.
Poland to withdraw from European treaty to prevent violence against women
The Polish Ministry of Justice said Saturday that Poland will take steps next week to withdraw from the European Treaty on the Prevention of Violence against Women.
Poland's right - wing government cabinet said the treaty required schools to teach students about gender issues, trampling on the rights of students' parents.
Polish Justice Minister Jobro held a press conference and said that his Ministry of Justice would make a request to the Ministry of Labor and Family to begin withdrawing from the treaty on Monday.
That treaty is also known as the Istanbul Convention.
"The treaty contains elements that we think are harmful in the form of meaning," Gioblo said.
Poland's ruling Law and Justice Party and its coalition partners have a close alliance with the Roman Catholic Church and promote a conservative social agenda.
Polish President Andrzej Duda made hostility to gay rights one of the main issues during his successful re - election campaign this month.
On Friday, thousands of Poles, most of them women, protested against the withdrawal from the convention in Warsaw and other cities.
Lempat, one of the organizers of the protest, said at a protest march in Warsaw, "The purpose of withdrawing from the treaty is to legalize domestic violence."
Some protesters held banners that said, "PiS is a hell for women."
PiS has long complained about the Istanbul Convention.
Poland's previous centrist government ratified the convention in 2015.
The PiS government said the treaty did not respect religion and required liberal social policies to be taught in schools.
So far, however, the party has not decided to withdraw from the convention.

According to a recent report by the Russian newspaper Izvestia, the development contract for the Vuzhika-52M, called "Super Alligator", was signed by the Russian military and military industrial units in April last year, and the first two upgraded Vuzhika-52M are currently undergoing retrofitting at the Far East Helicopter Factory of the Russian "Progress" Aerospace Corporation, and its national - level testing and improvement work will be completed by October 2022.
According to Russian experts familiar with the above - mentioned upgrade work, the Vuzhika-52, the "predecessor" of the "Super Alligator", was officially installed in November 2011, and the model exposed some weaknesses in use, and the upgrade was designed to "make up for the shortcoming".
The report said that compared to the Ka-52, the Ka-52M will partially use new protective materials that will not increase weight, and its pilot cockpit will be reinforced and equipped with new equipment to withstand missile attacks, thereby increasing the probability of battlefield survival; a more powerful generator will be installed to power more complex airborne electronic equipment; the photoelectric system will be upgraded to detect and identify battlefield targets farther apart; the new light multi - purpose missile, equipped with main attack armored fighting vehicles and reinforced concrete fortifications, will have a range of 20 kilometers, which is about double the range of similar missiles used by Russia's active military forces; and its defense weapons and communication equipment will be as versatile as the Mi-28NM helicopter gunship, which can attack aerial targets, thus making related maintenance simple and economical.
In addition, the Ka-52M will have more advanced electronic guidance systems, weapon targeting systems, and navigation equipment.
Russian experts also said that it is worth noting that the Ka-52M will be equipped with communication equipment to communicate with drones, so as to obtain information transmitted by nearby drones in real time in the air, such as displaying images taken by drones on the cockpit screen of the helicopter.
According to the plan, the pilots of the Ka-52M can directly control the drones they cooperate with, thereby improving the pilots' mastery of the battlefield situation and guidance of long - range missiles.
According to Russian media reports, Russian Deputy Defense Minister Krivoruchko said in December last year that the Russian Defense Ministry plans to purchase more than 110 Vuzhika-52M by 2027.

Xinhua News Agency, Shijiazhuang, July 26 (Reporter Wang Kun) The reporter learned from the Hebei Provincial Water Resources Department that since the beginning of this year, Hebei Province has implemented ecological water replenishment for 28 rivers and Baiyangdian, including the Hutuo River, the Tang River, and the Juma River, and has completed a total of 1.75 billion cubic meters of ecological water replenishment for rivers and lakes.
Hebei Province grasped the favorable opportunity of increasing the flow of water through the South - to - North Water Diversion Project, and implemented ecological water replenishment by diverting river water to rivers such as the Tang River, the Shahe River, and the Shulong River.
At the same time, nine large and medium - sized reservoirs, including Xiyang and Dongwushi, as well as Baiyangdian, have been used to provide ecological water replenishment to the Fuyang River, Qinglong River, and other rivers, resulting in a total surface area of more than 90 square kilometers.
In order to do a good job in ecological water replenishment, the Hebei Provincial Water Resources Department has actively organized and carried out the investigation of hidden dangers of water replenishment rivers, rectification and reinforcement, and river cleaning, refined practical measures, and strengthened inspection, management, and protection.
Through supervision and inspection and centralized unannounced visits, all kinds of problems were solved in a timely manner to ensure the safe and orderly replenishment of the river.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Hebei Provincial Water Resources Department, the orderly implementation of the ecological replenishment of rivers and lakes has effectively restored the ecological environment of rivers and lakes in Hebei Province, promoted the replenishment and conservation of groundwater along the coast, greatly improved the living environment and economic development environment along the route, and is of great significance to the realization of the river and lake management and protection goals of "clear water, green banks, smooth rivers, and beautiful scenery".
DETROIT (AP) - In the past two weeks, the number of new coronavirus cases in Spain has risen sharply, with thousands of new cases on several days.
The UK government temporarily decided on the evening of Saturday (July 25) to remove Spain from the safe travel list from midnight local time on the 26th, and those entering the UK from Spain must isolate for 14 days.
British tourists who were holidaying in Spain expressed surprise, concern, and even anger at the decision, as the news was so sudden that it caught them by surprise.
According to reports, British Transport Secretary Grant Shapps is also currently holidaying in Spain.
Before the UK issued the quarantine measures, Norway had also announced that people returning to Norway from Spain would be quarantined for 10 days.
France and Belgium have advised their residents to abandon their plans to holiday in and around Barcelona.
The beaches in these areas were so overcrowded that social distancing could not be maintained, and the police needed to take measures to reduce the number of beachgoers.
Tourism is an important pillar industry in Spain
Spain: It's Safe Here
In response to the decision made by the UK, the Spanish Foreign Ministry said on Sunday that the outbreak in the country was under control.
Spanish Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya stressed to the media, "Spain is safe, not only for Spaniards, but also for tourists."
The Spanish government will try to persuade the British government to exclude the Balearic and Canary Islands from the quarantine measures.
The reason is that the infection rate in these two tourist destinations is far lower than in the UK mainland.
In order to prevent the spread of the epidemic, the Spanish region of Catalonia has also reimposed the "foot ban".
Tourism is an important pillar industry in Spain, and Spain is one of the most popular holiday destinations for British tourists.
This decision by the UK is expected to greatly affect Spain's tourism industry.

FAA urgently orders investigation of 2,000 Boeing airliners after engine may stall - Xinhuanet
The United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an emergency airworthiness directive on the 24th, requiring an emergency inspection of about 2,000 Boeing 737NG and 737Classic airliners registered in the United States, because corrosion of the air check valves of these airliners could cause the engines to stop in the air.
The FAA said it has received four reports of engine parking in the air for 737NG and 737Classic airliners so far, so it has made an emergency inspection request for airliners that have been parked continuously for 7 days or more, and airliners that have flown less than 11 times so far since they were put back into flight.
The FAA warned that if the level 5 check valves of all two engines of the airliner were corroded, they could become stuck in the open position, causing the airliner to completely lose power and be unable to restart the engine.
The aviation regulator ordered that once the check valve is found to be corroded, the airline operator must replace the key component before the airliner is put into service again.
Boeing responded later in the day that the new coronavirus outbreak had reduced travel demand, and as a result, many airliners were mothballed or used less, making "check valves more susceptible to corrosion."
Boeing also said that it has advised air operators to inspect the airliners involved in the directive, and that if problems are found, Boeing will provide assistance in overhauling and replacing check valves.
The Associated Press reported that the airliners of major U.S. airline operators usually fly multiple times in a day, but after the outbreak of the new coronavirus, a large number of airliners were grounded; with the recent slow growth in passenger travel demand, some airliners have returned to service.
The FAA did not release details of the four air parking reports.
Alaska Airlines disclosed one of the incidents later on the 24th.
The airline operator said in a statement that one of its airliners was en route from Seattle, Washington, to Austin, Texas, on July 15 when an engine suddenly stalled, and the airliner finally made a successful emergency landing at Austin Airport.
Alaska Airlines said it had replaced the jet's engine and had inspected the engines of six airliners in accordance with FAA instructions.
American Airlines, United Airlines, and Southwest Airlines respectively said on the 24th that their airliners did not experience engine stall related to the air check valve.
Four American Airlines airliners will be inspected, and 28 United Airlines airliners will be inspected.
Delta said it would inspect 20 of its airliners, but did not say whether there had been any engine stalls.
Several media reported that the FAA's emergency airworthiness directive was another blow to Boeing.
Indonesian Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines each crashed a Boeing 737MAX in October 2018 and March 2019, respectively, killing a total of 346 people.
This series of airliners was subsequently grounded worldwide, stopped production in January this year, and resumed production in May.
Steve Dixon, the head of the FAA, admitted in June that the FAA had "made a mistake" in its regulation of Boeing with regard to the 737MAX.

A "Nutrient" for the History of the Party and the History of New China - chinanews.com
2020-07-26 17:37:29 Source: People's Tribune Author: Zhu Yanjing Responsible Editor: Zhu Yanjing
Recently, when visiting the Siping Battle Memorial Hall, General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized, "1.4 billion people and more than 90 million Party members, especially leading cadres at all levels, should learn the history of the Communist Party of China and the history of New China well."
conscientiously studying the history of the Party and the history of New China is a compulsory course for Party members and cadres to keep their original intention and mission in mind, from which they should draw rich nourishment, cultivate the feelings of family and country, and walk the Long March in the new era.
A magnificent history of the Party and the history of New China records the hard work and glorious course of the Communist Party of China since its birth, and shows the faith and loyalty forged by the Communists with their lives and blood, as well as the original intention and mission that they will always adhere to.
History is the best textbook, and for Party members and cadres, the history of the Party and the history of New China are the brightest chapters in this textbook.
Every Party member and cadre should constantly strengthen the historical thinking of taking history as a mirror and moving towards the future, take up the "baton" of the times based on the new journey and new mission, and walk the Long March of the current generation well.
Cast the soul with history, and adhere to the original mission in studying the history of the Party and the history of New China.
The history of the Party and the history of New China is full of the immutable original mission and rock - solid faith of the Chinese Communists, which demonstrates the simple feeling that the Communists will always be with the people.
To get to know important events, important meetings, and important people in the history of the Party and the history of New China up close is not only an intuitive shock to the heart and a baptism of thought, but also to understand the connotation of the original faith from the depths of the soul, and to know the weight of the mission.
For Party members and cadres, if they want to continue to sharpen their original mission and maintain their advanced nature forever, they must find the origin and fulcrum of our original intention from the history of the Party and the history of New China, maintain a clear understanding and firm position, stir up the strength to work hard for the country and the people, and ensure that the red rivers and mountains laid down by the revolutionary forefathers with their blood and lives are passed down from one generation to the next.
It is wise to study history, and to pass on the noble spirit in studying the history of the Party and the history of New China.
Since the founding of the Communist Party of China, it has shaped a series of great spirits, including the spirit of the Red Boat, the spirit of Jinggangshan, the spirit of the Long March, the spirit of Yan'an, the spirit of the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, the spirit of Xibaipo, the spirit of "two bullets, one star", and the spirit of spaceflight.
These great spirits precipitated by history have provided powerful spiritual inspiration for our Party to overcome all kinds of risks and challenges on the way forward, and are valuable spiritual assets that cannot be defeated, swept away, or robbed.
The process of studying the history of the Party and China is a process of revisiting and shaping these spirits, and we must consciously take the noble spirit of our revolutionary forefathers as a mirror, adhere to the spiritual home of the Communists, build a solid spiritual foundation for advancing the great cause and realizing the great dream, and inherit and carry forward these spirits to shine a new light of the times.
Read history and introspect, and continue to preserve righteousness and eliminate evil while studying the history of the Party and the history of New China.
For Party members and cadres, there is no history that can bring more profound warning, enlightenment, and reference than the history of the Party and the history of New China.
In the history of the Party and the history of New China, we can see not only the great deeds of the older generation of revolutionaries who devoted themselves to their faith and worked tirelessly to achieve the set goals, but also the profound lessons of some people who were shaken by their ideals and beliefs and went to the opposite side of the revolution, which enlighten and warn us to never stagnate or slacken with firm determination and will, to always maintain an abundant and tenacious spirit of struggle, to constantly purify the Party spirit, to cultivate ourselves and to discipline ourselves.
To truly become a firm believer and faithful practitioner of the lofty ideals of communism, we need to brush away the "dust" of our thoughts and strictly prevent the "dirt" from staining our bodies, and the history of the Party and the history of New China should be the basis for every Party member and cadre to examine and warn themselves.
Knowing history is inspirational, and taking the heavy responsibility of the times in studying the history of the Party and the history of New China.
General Secretary Xi Jinping once pointed out, "Studying the history of the Party and the country is a compulsory course for adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics and pushing forward various undertakings of the Party and the country."
Looking back at history and asking questions about the original intention, in order to continue to be glorious and move towards the future.
Every Party member and cadre should take the study of the history of the Party and the history of New China as a lifelong pursuit, constantly straighten out the course of life while studying, and take the historical mission, dare to take responsibility, and take the initiative in their respective positions.
Adhere to the advanced deeds of the older generation of revolutionaries as a reference and guide, constantly polish the political character of the Communists, maintain the attitude of striving for success and the spirit of struggle that the more difficult it is, the more difficult it is to move forward, and write a brilliant stroke of their own in the vast journey of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
Pursuing the Poetic "Yellow River Dream" by "Scrambling Jiangnan" - chinanews.com
(The Story of Poverty Reduction in China) Pursuing the Poetic "Yellow River Dream" by "Scrambling Jiangnan"
China News Service, Yinchuan, July 26 (Yang Di) "Jiuqu Yellow River is thousands of miles of sand, and waves scavenge the wind from the horizon."
The Yellow River, which has aroused the pride of countless literati, has given birth to the beautiful and rich Ningxia Plain, and today, Ningxia, which is known as "Jiangnan", is adhering to the concept of "ecological priority and green development" and pursuing the poetic "Yellow River Dream".
River Shimizu's "Dream of Blue Wave"
"The Yellow River in the world enriches Ningxia", and the Yellow River flows 397 kilometers through Ningxia, making it the "mother river" that nurtures one side.
However, with the rapid advancement of industrialization and urbanization, the development, utilization, management, and protection of rivers and lakes are out of balance, and chaos such as over - standard discharge, land creation around lakes, and encroachment on water areas are prominent, resulting in black and smelly water bodies, over - standard water quality, dirty environment, and ecological degradation.
Now, Ningxia is promoting the restoration of diverse water ecosystems and striving to restore the beauty and clarity of the Yellow River.
Water control should start at the source.
In Yinchuan, Ningxia, the local government adopted the "standard raising + pollution control + strict control" approach, and all industrial park sewage was treated centrally, all urban sewage treatment plants were discharged to the first - class A standard, and black and smelly water bodies in built - up urban areas were basically eliminated, and the third batch of China's black and smelly water demonstration cities were successfully declared.
In addition, Ningxia fully implemented the river and lake chief system in 2017, and has now achieved full coverage of the responsibility system of the five - level river and lake chief system in districts, cities, counties, and villages, and river and lake chief patrol has become the norm.
The 64 - year - old Gu Jincheng, who lives in a village along the Yellow River, has witnessed the changes of the Yellow River: "The water used to stink, but after rectification, the stink is gone."
Gu Jincheng said that the ecological environment is better and his life is more comfortable, and now he often goes for a walk along the Yellow River with his family to feel the blue water and blue sky.
The "Wetland Dream" of Shaguo Xiang Ji
Birds, green trees, trestles, blue water... the beautiful scenery of Fan Zhongyan's "sand gulls" has become a reality in the Yellow River Wetland Park in Yinchuan, Ningxia.
The Yellow River flows through Ningxia, forming a variety of wetlands such as river wetlands, lake wetlands, and swamp wetlands along the way, which plays an important role in promoting the rational utilization of water resources and the balance of water ecology, and has also become an important international bird migration channel.
Since 2009, relevant departments in Ningxia have invested about 3.45 billion yuan in wetland protection projects, and at present, Yinchuan wetland covers an area of 192,000 hectares, with a wetland protection rate of 78.5%, and there are nearly 200 natural lakes and swamps, including 5 national wetland parks, 1 national urban wetland park, 6 autonomous region - level wetland parks, and 8 municipal parks.
Lu Jinhu, deputy director of Yinchuan Wetland Protection Center, told reporters that wetland protection has increased biodiversity, which is particularly evident in birds, "The gull is an endangered bird, and there are only more than 20,000 in the world, of which more than 2,000 live in Yinchuan Wetland."
At the same time, Ningxia has demarcated a 500 - meter red line for the wetland protection area on both sides of the Yinchuan section of the Yellow River in accordance with the law, stipulating that no unit or individual, except for public welfare projects, shall carry out development, construction, or business activities within the protected area.
Zhao Shaoyong, deputy director of Yinchuan Water Conservancy Service Center, said that through pollution source control, comprehensive remediation of river and lake ecology, and terminal wetland construction, the water quality of nine major drains into the Yellow River in Ningxia has now reached 100% of the standard, "Now the water is clear, the fish are swimming, and the flowers are blooming."
The "Drinking Water Dream" for People's Livelihood
Yinchuan City, Ningxia, once had the title of "embarrassment ": the only city along the Yellow River to" keep the Yellow River short of water and drink ".
Since 2010, Yinchuan City has been facing the persistent problem of water shortage during the summer peak, and in the past decade, the "pain of water shortage" has become a painful experience for many high - rise residents in the summer, but with major water sources at the limit of overextraction and large areas of groundwater overextraction funnel areas already formed underground in urban areas, water shortage has become a problem for Yinchuan City.
Thanks to the improvement of the water quality of the Yellow River, drinking purified water from the Yellow River has become a solution to the drinking water problems of local residents.
Ding Ming, deputy director of Yinchuan Water Bureau, said that in order to improve the living and production water needs of urban and rural residents in Yinchuan, Ningxia launched the water supply project on the western route of the urban and rural areas in Yinchuan metropolitan area in a timely manner, and replaced the original underground water source with high - quality Yellow River water.
"On December 29, 2019, the water supply project officially opened water to the three districts of Yinchuan City, and in 2020, residents of Minning Town and Helan County also drank water from the Yellow River."
Ding Ming said that the Yinchuan Water Resources Ministry will consider the transformation of the integration of rural drinking water and urban water supply in the region as a whole, "In the next step, we will integrate all scattered rural water supply points into the western water supply project, and it is expected that the integrated urban - rural water supply in Yinchuan will be basically realized by the end of this year."
All departments responsible for compaction strengthen flood prevention and relief work - chinanews.com
All departments responsible for compaction strengthen flood prevention and relief work
CCTV news (newscast): According to the Ministry of Water Resources, at 12:00 today (July 25), the river below Wangjiaba, the main stream of the Huaihe River, exceeded the warning level by 0.64 meters and 3.31 meters, and the river below Shashi, the main stream of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and the two lakes exceeded the warning level by 0.05 meters and 2.02 meters.
Taihu Lake has been above the warning level for 28 days since June 28.
At 12:00 today, the average water level of Taihu Lake was 4.67 meters, exceeding the guaranteed water level by 0.02 meters.
Today, after consultation, research, and judgment, the National Defense Administration decided to continue to maintain the flood prevention response of the Yangtze River and Huaihe River, and asked all regions to consolidate their responsibilities and further implement flood prevention and relief work.
Today, the State Defense Office and the Ministry of Emergency Management dispatched professional drainage vehicles from Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Fujian to help Jiangxi solve local problems such as urban waterlogging caused by heavy rainfall.
For the first time, the United States launched a countervailing investigation against China for "undervaluation of the RMB exchange rate"
In response to the recent announcement by the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. Department of Commerce has decided to launch an anti - dumping and countervailing investigation into tie - belt products originating in China, as well as an investigation into the "undervaluation of the RMB exchange rate" project.
China's Ministry of Commerce pointed out that this is the first time that the United States has filed a case to investigate the so - called "undervaluation of the RMB exchange rate" in a countervailing case, and China firmly opposes this.
China's Ministry of Commerce issued a special press release on this issue on the evening of the 23rd, stating that China implements a managed floating exchange rate system based on market supply and demand and adjusted with reference to a basket of currencies, and that the market plays a decisive role in the formation of the exchange rate.
The press release emphasized that on the whole, the RMB exchange rate is at a reasonable and balanced level and is not undervalued.
Since 2005, the RMB has appreciated by more than 17% against the US dollar.
According to the data released by the Bank for International Settlements, from the beginning of 2005 to May 2020, the nominal effective exchange rate of the RMB appreciated by 38% and the real effective exchange rate by 49%, making it the strongest currency among the G20 economies and one of the currencies with the largest appreciation in the world.
The Ministry of Commerce pointed out that the exchange rate issue exceeded the authority of members to conduct countervailing investigations in accordance with the rules of the World Trade Organization.
In February this year, the United States amended its regulations to conduct countervailing investigations against other countries' exchange rates, which has been suspected of violating WTO rules and has been opposed by many parties.
According to the press release, even in accordance with U.S. regulations, the content of the applicant's complaint contains a large number of errors and does not meet the necessary countervailing elements such as financial support, grant of benefits, and specificity.
China urges the US to abide by existing international rules and stop conducting countervailing investigations against the so - called "undervaluation of the RMB exchange rate".
Affected by the further rise in tensions between China and the United States, the offshore and onshore RMB exchange rates against the US dollar fell sharply during the day on the 22nd, and both fell below the 7.0 yuan per US dollar mark.
Whether this move by the U.S. Department of Commerce is intended to force the yuan to rise is noteworthy.
The spot exchange rate of the RMB against the US dollar rose above the 7.0 mark on the 23rd, closing at 6.9961.
The midpoint rate of the officially regulated RMB exchange rate against the US dollar was lowered by 17 basis points to 6.9938 on the 24th.
As the epidemic gradually improved, the film and television industry, which had been dormant for nearly half a year, also returned to normal.
Recently, the organizing committee of the 26th Shanghai Television Festival announced the shortlist of this year's Magnolia Award.
In terms of Best Actor and Actor, powerful Mesozoic actors have an absolute advantage, with Lei Jiayin, Chen Baoguo, Zhang Ruoyun, Sun Honglei, and Huang Lei competing for Best Actor, and Haiqing, Ma Yili, Qin Hailu, Sun Li, and Yan Ni competing for Best Actress.
The results will be officially announced on August 7.
So far, from the topic of college entrance examination, "Little Joy", a realistic educational TV series depicting the "Chinese family", has won a total of six nominations for "Best Chinese TV Series", "Best Director", "Best Screenplay", "Best Actress", and "Best Supporting Actor / Actress".

Arreaza said that the U.S. government has been pressuring China in politics, diplomacy, economy, and public opinion recently, which is a baseless attack on a sovereign country.
Arreaza retweeted the tweet posted by Chinese Ambassador to Venezuela Li Baorong on his personal account earlier in the day and made the above comment.
Li Baorong said in his tweet that China strongly condemns the US for forcibly entering the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, which seriously violates the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and the China - US Consular Treaty, and that China will make a legitimate and necessary response to this.
Venezuelan Vice President Rodriguez, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs for North American Affairs Carlos Long and other government officials, social celebrities, and mainstream media journalists also retweeted Li Baorong's tweets, condemning the actions of the United States as a serious violation of international law.

To this end, the PCOO has specially prepared a working group that has not been in contact with confirmed staff to cooperate with President Duterte's press release on SONA.
Martin Andanar, Minister of PCOO, said in an interview with DZBB radio on the 26th that he had prepared two sets of plans for President Duterte to issue SONA.
According to Plan A, Duterte will deliver SONA at the Batasang Pambansa Building in Quezon City on the afternoon of the 27th.
Due to the epidemic, only 50 seats were arranged for some government cabinet members and legislators, and a special video conference room was set up for other cabinet members, local government officials, and others to watch.
All participants passed a rapid test to enter the National Assembly building on the same day.
Once one of the participants tests positive, Plan B will be activated, that is, President Duterte will deliver SONA at the Malacanang Palace, the presidential palace, and fewer seats will be arranged on site.
As is customary, SONA will broadcast live to the whole Philippines in real time.
At the time of writing, the Philippine Presidency has not yet confirmed whether Duterte's family will attend SONA.
Andanar said that President Duterte's SONA will focus on how the government will lead the Philippines to deal with the new coronavirus outbreak and restore social and economic life, and will also mention his commitment when he took office to fight government corruption, crack down on illegal drugs, and reduce poverty.
Duterte will also explain other plans of the current administration, including creating more jobs, revitalizing the economy, promoting education, and helping overseas Filipino workers suffering from the pandemic.

Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, July 26 (Reporter Ai Fumei) Due to the epidemic, kindergartens in Yinchuan City, Ningxia, have not yet resumed, especially as the financial pressure on private kindergartens has increased, which has had a certain impact on the stability of kindergarten teachers and their sustainable development in the future.
In response, Yinchuan City has taken a number of measures, such as pre - allocation of subsidy funds for inclusive private kindergartens, job stabilization subsidies for non - inclusive private kindergartens, and rent relief for private kindergartens, to support these kindergartens to stabilize their teachers.
According to the relevant policies of Yinchuan City, if the organizers of inclusive private kindergartens (including those that have been converted to inclusive kindergartens after the management of supporting kindergartens in urban districts) pay basic living expenses of not less than 1660 yuan per teacher per month with reference to the minimum wage standards of the three districts during the epidemic, the municipal finance department will allocate a 6 - month subsidy fund in accordance with the standard of 1000 yuan per student per year for inclusive private kindergartens to cover teachers' salaries and social insurance costs.
For non - inclusive private kindergartens that also provide basic living expenses of not less than 1660 yuan per teacher per month, Yinchuan City will arrange a 6 - month subsidy fund as a job stabilization subsidy fund for early childhood teachers in accordance with the standard of 500 yuan per student per year.
At the same time, for private kindergartens that rent state - owned assets, Yinchuan City will reduce the rent of houses for three months during the epidemic prevention and control period, and encourage developers and other rental entities to assume social responsibility and reduce the rent of kindergartens for more than three months, and the relevant taxes and fees will be reduced according to the policy.
The No. 3 flood of the Yangtze River in 2020 forms detailed and practical response measures by the Ministry of Water Resources - chinanews.com
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26 (Reporter Hu Lu) On July 26, the Yangtze River flood No. 3 of 2020 formed.
When presiding over the meeting on the 26th, Eu Tingping, Minister of Water Resources, requested that the Three Gorges Reservoir should be carefully dispatched, water from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and Dongting Lake should be considered as a whole, wrong peak scheduling should be implemented, sufficient storage capacity should be reserved to prepare for possible major floods, and the flood control safety of the middle and lower reaches of the main stream and the important embankment of Dongting Lake should be ensured.
It is predicted that there will be heavy to torrential rain in parts of the eastern southwest, southern Jianghuai, northern and western Jiangnan, eastern and southern Hubei, central Guangxi, and other places in the next three days, including heavy rain in northern Hunan, southwestern Jiangsu, and other places; moderate to heavy rain in central and western North China, including heavy rain in central Hebei.
The Ministry of Water Resources predicts that under its influence, the flow of the Three Gorges Reservoir in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River may reach about 60,000 cubic meters per second around the 28th, and the water level of the Liantang River and Dongting Lake in the middle reaches will rise again and exceed the limit by about 0.20 meters; the water level of the middle reaches of the Huaihe River will generally recede slowly, and the water level of Hongze Lake will continue to rise slowly; and the Haihe Daqing River system, Yongding River and other rivers will experience a process of rising water.
Eu Tingping proposed that the Huaihe River basin should further increase flood discharge, reduce the water level of Hongze Lake as soon as possible, and prepare for possible major floods.
It is necessary to do a good job in dealing with torrential rains and floods in the Surabaya system in Yishu.
He said that the Taihu Lake basin should continue to increase flood discharge without relenting, reduce the water level of Taihu Lake and surrounding river networks as soon as possible, and reduce the risk of high water levels and typhoons in Taihu Lake.
In addition, he stressed that floods in Inner Mongolia, Hebei and other northern regions rise and fall steeply, and the warning time is short, which can easily cause flash floods and mudslides, making it difficult to defend against them; the number of small and medium - sized reservoirs and silt dams is large, and there are safety risks.
58 APPs that infringe on users' rights and interests were exposed, involving more than 10 listed companies - chinanews.com
The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology reported that in accordance with laws and regulations such as the Cybersecurity Law, the Telecommunications Regulations, and the Regulations on the Protection of Personal Information of Telecommunications and Internet Users, third - party testing agencies have recently been organized to inspect mobile application software and urge enterprises with problems to carry out rectification.
The problems of these 58 APPs include private collection of personal information, excessive collection of personal information, frequent requests for permissions, excessive requests for permissions, difficulty in account cancellation, private sharing to third parties, and denial of permissions.
The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology requires that 58 APPs should complete the rectification and implementation work by July 30, and if the rectification is not completed within the time limit, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology will organize and carry out relevant disposal work in accordance with the law and regulations.
A reporter from China - Singapore warp and weft combed through and found that more than 10 US, Hong Kong, and A - share listed companies were behind the 58 APPs reported.
For example, "Fudoduo" is a product of Fudoduo, a US - listed company, and has five major problems: collecting personal information privately, collecting personal information beyond the scope, sharing it privately with third parties, forcing users to use targeted push functions, and frequently applying for permissions.
According to public information, Fangduo landed on Nasdaq in November 2019, and is "the first real estate agency in China with an industrial Internet SaaS (software service) model", providing online solutions for many intermediary merchants.
In response to the "Qunar" APP account cancellation problem pointed out in the notification, according to Beijing News, Qunar responded that in order to prevent black production from taking advantage of frequent registration and cancellation for profit, Qunar has set a one - month interval between registration and cancellation on the basis of self - cancellation.
Taking into account the convenience of cancellation and the security of the account, the cancellation has been changed to take effect immediately, and is currently awaiting review.
A cybersecurity expert who did not want to be named told the China - Singapore warp and weft client that the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has issued three APP notifications of such violations of users' rights and interests this year.
Among them, the private collection of personal information, excessive requests for permissions, and the difficulty of account cancellation have repeatedly been "managed".
It can also be found from the notification that the infringement of privacy by APP has attracted more and more attention at present.
On July 24, the day of the notification of 58 APPs infringing on the rights and interests of users, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said it had issued a notice to deploy and carry out in - depth special rectification actions to promote APPs infringing on the rights and interests of users.
The special rectification will strengthen supervision and inspection in accordance with regulations, urge relevant enterprises to strengthen the protection of APP personal information, rectify and eliminate outstanding problems such as illegal collection, use of users' personal information, harassment of users, deception and misleading users, and inadequate implementation of the management responsibilities of the application distribution platform, so as to purify the APP application space.
Lewis family: John Lewis was a warrior who "fought for the weakest"
John Lewis, a member of the United States Congress and a civil rights fighter, was remembered as a soldier who "fought for the weakest" at a memorial service held in his honor on Saturday (July 25).
A public memorial service for Lewis began in Alabama on Saturday.
There were two memorial services on the first day.
At the public memorial service at Troy University in Alabama on Saturday, Lewis' five siblings and one nephew spoke of him as a loving, fearless, and family - oriented man.
Lewis' youngest brother, Henry "Grant" Lewis, said at the meeting, "He devoted his life to helping others."
Samuel Lewis said that his mother had warned John "not to get into trouble, not to get into trouble."
He added that John did not heed his mother's warning, saying, "We all know that John always gets into trouble, always gets into trouble, but that's because he sticks to the right thing, which is a good trouble."
Lewis' brothers and sisters reminded the people at the memorial service that John's most famous argument was to create "good trouble", that is, he did not shy away from provoking trouble for the sake of justice.
John applied to Troy University in Troy, Alabama, where he was born, but Troy University, an all - white school at the time, rejected his application.
John Lewis, who preached the Gospel to chickens on his farm as a child, eventually earned a degree in religion and philosophy from Fisk University.
Many years later, Troy University awarded Lewis an honorary doctorate.
Senator Doug Jones of Alabama said that the current protesters "are protesting peacefully and non - violently", just as Lewis did during the civil rights movement.
Jones said, "Even if President Trump knocked over a boatload of people and described all the protesters as rioters, he was wrong.
The protesters are patriots who want the United States to move towards a more equal country. "
A six - day series of events in Lewis' memory will culminate this week at a funeral in Georgia.
Lewis' coffin was parked Saturday at a public memorial service at Troy University, where people came to pay tribute to the civil rights pioneer.
Later Saturday, a private service paid tribute to him in a small church in Selma, Alabama, followed by a public memorial service.
On Sunday, Lewis' body will cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma.
It was in front of this bridge in 1965 that he and demonstrators demanding black voting rights were severely beaten by Alabama police, who also fired tear gas at the demonstrators.
Lewis was nearly killed.
This day became known as "Bloody Sunday".
Lewis' body will be transported to Montgomery, the capital of Alabama.
Mayor Steven Reed encouraged people to line up on the sidewalk to join Lewis on the final journey.
At the same time, officials asked the public to wear masks and maintain social distancing when participating in the event.
Alabama Governor Kay Ivey ordered the flag to be flown at half - mast on Saturday and Sunday in memory of Lewis.
During the nearly week - long commemoration, Lewis' body will be placed briefly at the Alabama State Capitol in Montgomery, the Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta, and the United States Capitol in Washington.
Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced last week that people could pay tribute to Lewis at the U.S. Capitol on Monday and Tuesday.
Due to the coronavirus outbreak, public tributes to Lewis will be held outdoors.

Recently, during his visit to Jilin Province, General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized the need to strengthen the leadership of the Party, promote the extension of Party organizations to the grass - roots level, improve the working system of Party organizations at the grass - roots level, and provide a strong guarantee for the governance of urban and rural communities.
Adhere to Party building as the lead and implement the Party's leadership in all fields, aspects, and links of grass - roots governance, which is a fundamental requirement for doing a good job in grass - roots governance.
To improve the level of governance at the grass - roots level, we must adhere to the guidance of Party building, promote the transformation of the Party's political, organizational, and mass work advantages into governance advantages by strengthening political guidance, building battle fortresses, and rallying red forces, and pass on the Party's power and ideas to the "nerve endings" and "last mile".
Pay attention to nourishing calcium and casting the soul, and strengthen political guidance.
To strengthen the political guidance of grass - roots governance, we must implement the project of "replenishing calcium and casting the soul" well.
We should take learning and understanding Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era as the primary task, take "never forget the original intention and keep the mission in mind" as the eternal task of Party building and the lifelong task of Party members and cadres, strengthen the principle of reading the original works and learning the original texts, and continue to promote the Party's innovative theory through special training, batch training, discussion and exchange, and holding lecture halls, so as to push Party members and cadres to further enhance the "four consciousness", strengthen the "four self - confidence", and achieve the "two maintenance", so as to better perform their duties.
Through the combination of online and offline learning methods, we will broaden the channels of learning and education, and guide grassroots Party organizations and Party members and cadres to truly integrate learning and education into their daily lives.
Pay attention to practical training, and in the process of resolving key and difficult issues in the field of grass - roots governance, solve the troublesome and troublesome issues of concern to the masses, so as to temper the Party spirit and ability.
We should improve the norms and build a battle fortress.
Grassroots Party organizations are not only an important part of the grass - roots governance system, but also an important carrier for the demonstration of governance capabilities.
To promote the standardized construction of grass - roots Party organizations, we should start by grasping the working regulations of Party branches, focus on issues such as the weakening and virtual leadership of Party organizations, and strengthen the foundation, make up for shortcomings, and promote development by establishing up - and - down linkage mechanisms, innovating the form of branch establishment, normalizing and rectifying weakness and laxity, establishing and improving decision - making and deliberation mechanisms, and serving the masses.
In rural areas, we will strengthen the standardized construction of village - level Party organizations, standardize organizational forms, learning activities, and management mechanisms against the standardized construction standards of Party branches, and effectively promote the detailed implementation of systems such as "three meetings, one lesson", and themed Party Day activities.
In cities, we should pay attention to street communities, explore innovative branch setting forms, focus on weak areas, "choke points", and "pain points", and actively build urban party building alliances so that the Party's work can be effectively covered.
At the same time, we will establish and improve the governance system and mechanism at the grass - roots level, improve the decision - making and deliberation mechanism in which major events are discussed together, practical matters are done together, important matters are decided together, urgent matters are discussed together, difficult matters are solved together, and grass - roots Party organizations lead, improve the mechanism for Party members and cadres to contact and serve the masses, gather the hearts and minds of the people in serving the people, enhance the sense of gain, happiness, honor, and pride of Party members and the masses, and make grass - roots governance more warm.
Give full play to the vanguard role and rally the red forces.
Party members and cadres at the grass - roots level are the cornerstone of grass - roots governance.
To improve the governance capacity at the grass - roots level, we should focus on improving the governance capacity of Party members and cadres at the grass - roots level, pay attention to giving full play to the demonstration and leading role of "red cells" in grass - roots governance, and gather red forces at the forefront of connecting and serving the masses.
It is necessary to take improving governance ability as a compulsory course for Party members and cadres at the grass - roots level, constantly strengthen ideological refinement, professional training, and practical training, carry forward the spirit of responsibility in their own positions and in urgent and dangerous tasks, and lay a solid foundation and contribute to the modernization of the national governance system and governance ability.
It is necessary to carry out extensive activities of "community whistle blowing and party members reporting for duty", and to participate in community construction, management, and service by participating in themed party day activities, contacting people in difficulty, identifying service projects, claiming micro - wishes, and making reasonable suggestions, so that party members can play a role in community governance.
It is necessary to give full play to the role of rural non - working Party members, and to guide the vast number of grass - roots Party members to actively participate in the fight against poverty, ecological construction, maintaining stability in letters and visits, and banning burning of straw by setting up vanguard posts for non - working Party members, so as to better integrate the red forces and serve the people.
The foundation is solid and the building is strong.
Grassroots Party organizations are the foundation of the ruling edifice.
Only by adhering to the close relationship between the Party and the masses and increasing the well - being of the people as the focus, and taking Party building as the fundamental way to promote the innovative development of grass - roots governance, can we build a solid foundation so that grass - roots Party organizations can be pulled out and topped, and Party members and cadres at the grass - roots level can catch up and rush up, so as to promote grass - roots governance to have a "soul", be orderly, powerful, and effective.

Hoh Xili Tibetan Antelope Enters Remigration Season - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, July 25 (Reporter Wang Jinjin) The reporter learned from the Wudaoliang Protection Station of the Hoh Xili Management Office of the Sanjiangyuan National Park Management Director that monitoring showed that the Tibetan antelopes that had previously migrated to the Zhuonai Lake area in the hinterland of Hoh Xili to give birth were ending their calves and beginning to return to their original habitat with their calves.
Surveillance footage near the Wudaoliang Protection Station shows that on July 25, about 40 female Tibetan antelopes led three young Tibetan antelopes through the 3002 km of the Qinghai - Tibet Highway and the Wudaoliang North Bridge of the Qinghai - Tibet Railway, and the Tibetan antelopes have begun to move back.
Experts have analyzed that in recent years, the number of Tibetan antelope calves in relocating sheep has accounted for one - quarter to one - fifth of the total number of Tibetan antelope sheep.
Lian Xinming, an associate researcher at the Northwest Plateau Institute of Biology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said, "At the beginning of the migration, Tibetan antelopes face a high risk of predation, so the number of calves in the herd will be relatively small, and there may even be no calves."
According to statistics from the Hoh Xili Management Office of Jiangyuan Park, Director of Management of Sanjiangyuan National Park, the overall number of Tibetan antelopes returning has been increasing year by year, and the number of Tibetan antelopes returning in 2019 was 4,860, an increase of 338 over 2018.
Lian Xinming said, "It is expected that the return migration of Tibetan antelopes will end in early September this year, and the number of returning Tibetan antelopes is expected to continue to increase."
The Tibetan antelope is a national first - class protected animal.
At the end of May every year, Tibetan antelopes from Sanjiangyuan in Qinghai, Qiangtang in Tibet, Aljinshan in Xinjiang, and other places go to Zhuonai Lake, located in the hinterland of Hoh Xili, to lamb.
Wu Xiaomin, an expert on the protection of Tibetan antelopes in China and a researcher at the Shaanxi Provincial Institute of Zoology (Northwest Institute of Endangered Animals), said, "The return migration of Tibetan antelopes is the process of female Tibetan antelopes returning to their habitat with their calves after they have given birth. At first, the return migration group that left the calving site is relatively large, but then the Tibetan antelopes will return to their respective habitats according to different geographical populations and along different paths."
To ensure the safe return of Tibetan antelope sheep, the reporter learned that the Hoh Xili Management Office of Jiangyuan Park, the director of management of Sanjiangyuan National Park, has arranged staff to continuously carry out video monitoring and district patrols in the main return areas.
If a Tibetan antelope sheep is found trying to cross the highway, the mountain patrol team will carry out temporary traffic control at the first time to allow the sheep to pass safely through the wildlife passage and ensure that they are as little disturbed by humans as possible on their way back.
So, how should we relieve the heat in our daily life?
Experts suggest that when going out in summer, try to avoid hot periods, and it is best not to walk or work in the blazing sun around noon, because the sun is strongest in this time period, and the possibility of heatstroke is higher.
If you must go out at this time, you must do a good job of protection, such as wearing a parasol, a visor, and sunglasses, and if you have conditions, it is best to apply sunscreen to prevent sunburn.
Try to choose cotton, hemp, and silk textures with light colors and good breathability, and wear less chemical fiber clothing, so as not to dissipate heat in time when sweating a lot, which can cause heatstroke.
In hot and sultry weather, prepare enough water to drink, drink it in time, and do not wait for thirst to drink water, because once you feel thirsty, your body is already short of water, so limit your water consumption to 150 ml to 200 ml at a time, and drink warm water, not ice water.
Depending on the temperature, the average person drinks 1.5 liters to 2 liters of water per day, and the high - temperature worker drinks 3 liters to 5 liters of water per day.
When sweating more, some salt water can be properly replenished to make up for the salt lost by sweating.
In addition, the human body is prone to potassium deficiency in summer, which makes people feel tired and tired, and potassium - containing tea is an excellent summer drink.
In summer, eat fruits and vegetables with high water content, such as lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, etc.; fresh fruits, such as peaches, apricots, watermelons, melons, etc., with a water content of 80% to 90%, can be used to replenish water; dairy products can not only replenish water, but also meet the nutritional needs of the body.
In addition, people working in high - temperature environments should properly supplement drinks containing potassium, magnesium, and other elements.
In summer, the days are long and the nights are short, the temperature is high, the metabolism of the human body is strong, the consumption is also large, and it is easy to feel tired.
Adequate sleep can relax all systems of the brain and body, which is not only beneficial to work and study, but also a measure to prevent heatstroke.
Experts say the best bedtime is from 22:00 to 23:00, and the best time to get up is from 5:30 to 6:30.
When sleeping, be careful not to lie under air conditioning vents and electric fans, so as not to suffer from air conditioning diseases and hot colds.
Experts suggest that people who are engaged in outdoor activities or high - temperature work should carry heat prevention drugs such as 10 drops of water, Rendan, patchouli water, or patchouli pills with them, or place them in the nearest workplace and use them at any time to prevent heatstroke.

Among the few graduates who exhibited in person was Li Jingyin from the Sculpture Department of Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts.
"I came to Beijing on July 7, when I was actually a little worried about the epidemic, and I did a nucleic acid test three days in advance, and I came to the exhibition with the alcohol cotton and the test report."
His work "Yesterday as a Mystery" has a complex structure and must be done by hand.
At the same time, he also took on the task of helping his classmates repair damaged works.
"The exhibition will be held until 4:30 in the morning, and then the repair will be done, and the time is very tight, so I forgot to take a photo with the work, which is a bit of a pity."
He hoped that when the epidemic became more stable, he and his classmates would come to Beijing to see the exhibition of his work.

New drug developed by Australian University is expected to be used to treat blood vessel blockage caused by the new coronavirus - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Sydney, July 26 (Reporter Chen Yu) - Researchers at Monash University in Australia are developing a new drug to help prevent heart disease and stroke, and hope it can be used to treat blood vessel blockages caused by the new coronavirus.
The researchers found that an enzyme in platelets accelerates platelet coagulation before a heart attack or stroke.
From this, they developed a drug that temporarily inhibits platelet clotting, thereby avoiding blockage of blood vessels and preventing heart disease and stroke.
The researchers said the drug only inhibits the clotting effect of platelets when there are signs of heart disease or stroke.
Since studies have shown that similar blood vessel blockages are one of the main causes of death in patients with severe COVID-19, the researchers hope that this drug can be used in the treatment of such severe patients in the future.
At present, the drug has achieved good results in animal model experiments, and the researchers are ready to conduct human clinical trials in the next stage.
The research results have recently been published in the American journal Science Translational Medicine.
He became the first spectator to enter the stadium after the CBA rematch allowed spectators to watch the match live.
On the same day, during the second stage of the rematch of the 2019 - 2020 Chinese Men's Basketball Professional League (CBA) (Laoshan Division) held in Qingdao, Shandong Province, medical staff, teachers, and public security personnel completed the relevant processes, including nucleic acid testing, through the official ticket purchase platform, and then entered the stadium to watch the match between Shanghai Jiusi Team and Shandong Wang Team.
During the race, spectators must wear masks throughout the race, take their seats correctly, and strictly keep their seats spaced one meter apart.
When exiting the venue, the audience must leave the venue in an orderly manner, maintaining a "one - meter line" of social distancing, in order from the back to the front, first to the sides, and then to the middle.
Xinjiang cultivates "sunflower fields" and makes good use of clean energy - chinanews.com

China News Service, Hami, Xinjiang, July 26: Xinjiang cultivates "sunflower fields" and makes good use of clean energy
More than 6,000 pentagonal heliostats, each 48 square meters, are neatly arranged in circles, like a silver "sunflower field", which rotates with the sun and reflects sunlight to a heat - absorbing tower more than 200 meters high in the center to generate electricity.
The reporter saw this scene at the CLP Hami Molten Salt Tower photothermal power plant in Nu Maohu Town, Yiwu County, Hami City, Xinjiang on the 25th.
"The so - called molten salt tower photothermal power generation is the concentrated reflection of sunlight through the mirror to the heat - absorbing tower to form heat energy, and then the heat energy is converted into electricity through traditional power generation technology."
Zhang Yong, deputy general manager of CLP Hami Solar Thermal Power Generation Co., Ltd., said that its design principle is similar to that of solar stoves used in rural areas in northwest China, which concentrate sunlight.
Construction of the power plant started in October 2017 and was connected to the grid by the end of last year, covering an area of 6,600 mu, and a total of 14,500 sun - setting mirrors are planned to be installed.
"Compared to traditional solar power generation technology, its biggest advantage is that it can store the accumulated heat energy and generate electricity at night."
Zhang Yong said that the 13 - hour heat storage system deployed in the project allows the generator set to maintain continuous and stable operation, unaffected by changes in light, and can also quickly participate in power grid peak shaving according to the peak and valley demand of the power grid load.
When fully completed, the project will generate 198 million kilowatts of electricity per year, save more than 60,000 tons of standard coal per year, reduce sulfur dioxide by more than 60 tons, nitrogen oxides by more than 60 tons, soot by about 20 tons, and carbon dioxide by more than 150,000 tons, and provide a steady stream of clean energy for the region.
In addition, there is another silver "sunflower field" in the Shicheng Zi Photovoltaic Industrial Park in Hami City.
The Hamifu Solar Photovoltaic Power Station covers an area of more than 2,300 mu, and the 714 power generation devices that have been built also follow the sun, keeping the sun's rays at a 90 - degree right angle to the condenser surface.
"We use dual - axis tracking condenser power generation technology, and through unified and integrated control, all power generation equipment will adjust the angle according to the height of the sun to maintain power generation efficiency."
Duan Mengqi, the director of the power station, said that under good weather conditions, the power generation technology can improve the efficiency of traditional photovoltaic power generation by about 20%.
In the first half of this year, the power station has generated more than 7 million kilowatts of electricity, supplementing local demand for electricity.
Shicheng Zi Photovoltaic Industrial Park is currently a photovoltaic industry demonstration park with the largest single scale and the most complete types of photovoltaic modules in Xinjiang, with a total of 38 photovoltaic power generation projects, with a total installed capacity of 820,000 kilowatts.
In the first half of this year, more than 110 million kilowatts of electricity were generated, an increase of 6% over the same period in 2019.
Hami is one of the regions with the best solar energy resources in China.
The average annual total solar radiation is more than 6,200 megajoules per square meter, and the annual sunshine hours are about 3,200 hours.
In recent years, the city has vigorously developed the photovoltaic industry and planted "sunflower fields".
More than 2.5 million kilowatts of solar power has been installed, and in the first half of this year, the city's photovoltaic power generation exceeded 1.4 billion kilowatts, an increase of about 14% year - on - year.
At present, there are more than 330 grid - connected photovoltaic power stations in Xinjiang, with an installed capacity of more than 10 million kilowatts.
The annual photovoltaic power generation is expected to reach 15 billion kilowatts this year, which can replace more than 6 million tons of standard coal.
Police report details of "female college student lost contact while traveling to Qinghai" Search and rescue work continues - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, July 26 (Reporters Wang Jinjin Zhou Zhe) Recently, "a female college student lost contact after traveling to Golmud, Qinghai" attracted the attention of netizens.
The Public Security Bureau of Golmud City, Haixi Mongolian and Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, reported on the 26th that Huang, a student of a university in Nanjing, is still in a state of loss of contact, and that the police in many places are going deep along the route of Huang's loss of contact and actively carrying out search work.
On July 10, 2020, the Public Security Detachment of Golmud City Public Security Bureau in Haixi received a notice from its superiors that Huang, a student of a university in Nanjing, took the Z164 train from Nanjing to Golmud on July 5, and on July 9, his mobile phone was turned off and lost contact in the southwest area of Qingshuihe at Sonandajie Protection Station in Qumalai County, Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, and asked for assistance in finding it.
According to the investigation by the Golmud Public Security Bureau, Huang entered Qinghai Province at 19:54 on July 6 and arrived in Golmud City at 4:00 on July 7.
At 8:00 on the same day, the missing person, Huang, took a taxi from the Yellow River Hotel in Golmud City towards National Highway G109, and arrived at Sonandajie Protection Station in Hoh Xili at 12:00, and the taxi driver returned alone, and Huang arrived in the Qingshuihe area near Sonandajie Protection Station at 15:00 on the 7th and shut down in the area at about 18:00 on the 9th.
During further investigation, the police found that Huang had passed through the Naijigou checkpoint at 17:07 on July 13.
The Naijigou Checkpoint is a checkpoint set up by Nagqu City, Tibet Autonomous Region, at Nanshankou, Golmud City, and since there is no video surveillance at the checkpoint, it is impossible to determine the information of the person and the vehicle, so the police can only search along the route by car, and coordinate with the various checkpoints along the route in Tibet to immediately contact the Golmud Public Security Bureau if they find Huang.
According to the latest information, at 1 a.m. on July 26, the Golmud Public Security Bureau organized rescue forces to carry rescue equipment to search the Freezing Spring Protection Station and Sonandajie Protection Station along the Qinghai - Tibet Highway, and actively contacted the Sichuan police, the Tibet police, and the Nanjing police to carry out joint work, and the search and rescue work is still continuing.
The local police hope that if the vast number of netizens and all sectors of society have relevant clues, they will provide them to Golmud police and Nanjing Jiangning police in a timely manner, and strive to find the missing person, Huang, as soon as possible.
At the same time, relevant experts suggested that tourists should be standardized, rational, and civilized in their outdoor activities, pay attention to roadside warning signs at all times, do not venture into no man's land, and call the police in a timely manner in case of emergency.
US media uncovered the truth about the groundless US request for China to close its Consulate General in Houston - chinanews.com

The US media uncovered the truth about the groundless US request for China to close its Consulate General in Houston
On the 24th, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the U.S. Embassy in China that China had decided to revoke the establishment and operation license of the U.S. Consulate General in Chengdu, and put forward specific requirements for the Consulate General to stop all business and activities, as a countermeasure to the U.S. sudden request to close the Consulate General in Houston on the 21st.
This action by the US government has attracted much attention, and its political motives have been questioned by foreign media and scholars.
Why is China required to close the Consulate General?
A number of foreign media said that it was not clear why the United States chose the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, but as for the purpose of this move, the foreign media said bluntly: for the general election.
CNN reported on the 23rd that the US move to ask China to close its Consulate General in Houston raised questions about its political motives.
According to the article, the US government's disastrous response to the new coronavirus pandemic caused President Donald Trump's poll approval rating to be low before the election.
White House officials privately said that the tough strategy against China was to save Trump's popularity and to deflect responsibility for the failure of the White House's response to the pandemic.
According to the article, the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is a "politically driven and very cautious" target chosen by the United States, and the U.S. government chose it "to create a tough attitude while avoiding the risk of major conflict".
The BBC also believes that at a time when the US election season is approaching and the US economy has been hit hard by the pandemic, Trump believes that "playing the 'China card' has political advantages".
The current situation is "a spiraling, tit - for - tat struggle", which is driven to a certain extent by the US government from the perspective of domestic considerations, and will only worsen the tension between China and the US.
CBS reported that Trump's re - election prospects are under pressure due to the outbreak, and that he has repeatedly blamed China for the outbreak.
Almost every day, the United States takes new actions against Trump's absurd argument that "China exploits the United States".
"The Consulate General of Houston is very important in establishing ties between the two countries"
The Associated Press commented that the United States' demand that China close its Consulate General in Houston has exacerbated tensions between the world's two largest economies.
If the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is closed, in addition to the diplomatic impact, Chinese citizens located in the southern United States will face difficulties in obtaining consular services, as will American citizens seeking visas and other services.
A Houston business group expressed regret over the US request for China to close its Consulate General in Houston, saying that the Consulate General has played an important role in establishing trade, investment, and cultural ties between the two countries.
According to the Associated Press, this reflects the importance of China's economy.
According to the website of US Foreign Policy magazine, this move by the US "is part of a series of provocative measures that will only worsen US - China relations".
Reuters quoted Jonathan Pollack, an expert on East Asia at the Brookings Institution, an American think tank, as saying that since the US and China established comprehensive diplomatic relations in 1979, he could not think of any move comparable to the US action against the Chinese Consulate General in Houston.
Hong Kong's South China Morning Post reported that this move by the US is unprecedented in the more than 40 years of diplomatic relations between China and the US.
Analysts believe that this move could cause lasting damage.
The Chinese Consulate General in Houston was established in 1979 and is the first Chinese Consulate General in the United States.
At present, China has one embassy and five consulates - general in the United States.

In 1696, Tsar Peter the Great set out to form a maritime fleet, which started the history of the Russian Navy.
The Russian Navy Day is celebrated on the last Sunday of July every year.
In view of the new changes in epidemic prevention and control, since July 17, trade unions at all levels in Xinjiang have responded to the call of the Federation of Trade Unions of the Autonomous Region and actively participated in epidemic prevention and control work.
Trade union cadres, workers, and model workers in the north and south of Tianshan entered the streets, communities, and residents to carry out activities such as delivering food and medicine, disinfection and sterilization, and propagating knowledge about epidemic prevention, so as to serve the workers and the masses, and to demonstrate the "hard nuclear force" of trade unions with practical actions.
Recently, the condolence group of the Tianshan District Federation of Trade Unions in Urumqi delivered a batch of urgently needed epidemic prevention and control living materials to the staff at 12 quarantine points.
After the outbreak of the epidemic, Tianshan District immediately invested more than 1.05 million yuan, which was urgently allocated to 23 directly affiliated grass - roots trade unions.
After receiving the company's notice on epidemic prevention and control, Zhao Xiangguo, deputy secretary of the Party Committee and chairman of the trade union, volunteered to stay on duty in the unit to protect the workers.
He delivered cooking utensils, food, and daily necessities to the newly employed workers living in the dormitory of the unit, and organized the personnel to deliver essential supplies to them every two days.
"From July 21, the cadres and workers who adhere to the front line of the fight against the'epidemic 'will be surveyed, and 704 front - line workers in Urumqi will be provided with supplementary anti - epidemic supplies and living materials through online orders and door - to - door delivery by businesses."
The head of the Xinjiang Transportation Trade Union told reporters that in the face of the sudden epidemic, they made every effort to ensure epidemic prevention and control services, steadily promote the development of transportation, and create a strong atmosphere to fight the "epidemic" together.
At present, when the summer heat is high, trade unions at all levels keep an eye on front - line workers in key areas for epidemic prevention and control, and put "cool" care into practice.
On July 19, the Urumqi County Federation of Trade Unions launched a condolence campaign to "send cool" to front - line workers in epidemic prevention and control, and the county's police stations, card points, and health systems received drinks, fruits, and other condolence items.
"Trade union cadres should further improve their political standing, strengthen their responsibility, warm people's hearts with care, and inspire their fighting spirit with action.
We should give full play to the role of trade unions in rallying and uniting workers, do a good job in ensuring epidemic prevention and control services, actively safeguard the health rights and interests of workers, and send care to front - line workers. "
Relevant person in charge of the Federation of Trade Unions of the Autonomous Region said.
Direct recruitment of non - commissioned officers in full swing in 2020 - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26 (Reporter Jia Qilong) - The Political Work Department of the Military Commission and the National Defense Mobilization Department of the Military Commission recently jointly issued a notice to deploy and launch the direct recruitment of non - commissioned officers from graduates of ordinary institutions of higher learning in 2020.
This year's direct recruitment of non - commissioned officers covers more than 270 general military and local majors in 64 categories, including computers, automation, and machinery, with emphasis on increasing the recruitment of unmanned aerial vehicles, navigation, aerospace, electronic information, minor languages, and other majors, and the recruitment scale has increased by nearly 2,000 compared to last year.
This year, the direct recruitment of non - commissioned officers was organized and implemented simultaneously with the recruitment of conscripts, which began on August 1 and ended on September 30.
Through the National Conscription Network (website: http://www.gfbzb.gov.cn), young conscripts can inquire about the conditions for direct recruitment of non - commissioned officers and the distribution of recruitment specialties in various regions, submit registration information online if they meet the scope of specialties and recruitment conditions, and participate in the follow - up recruitment work such as medical examination and political assessment in accordance with the unified requirements of the land - requisitioned military service organs.
Qualified young people who are unable to be recruited as non - commissioned officers due to enrollment majors and program restrictions may participate in the recruitment of conscripts, and when they are selected as non - commissioned officers at the end of their compulsory military service, the number of years of study in ordinary institutions of higher learning according to the prescribed academic system shall be regarded as the length of service.
This year, the recruitment of non - commissioned officers will be uniformly organized by the conscription offices of provincial or prefectural and municipal people's governments, and majors with rich registration potential will be selected on the basis of merit on the basis of comprehensive measurement of the academic level of the applicants, the achievements of professional courses while in school, and the obtaining of professional qualification certificates; scarce majors will be targeted for local colleges and universities that meet professional requirements and have recruitment advantages.
According to the requirements of normalized epidemic prevention and control, this year's direct recruitment of non - commissioned officers will not arrange to report on their own in principle, and will organize transportation into the camp in tandem with conscripts.
The time for direct enlistment of non - commissioned officers will be calculated from September 1, 2020, and the time for the army to issue the order for non - commissioned officers to serve will be December 1, 2020.
The receiving units of the army will scientifically formulate enlistment and professional training programs, and conscientiously organize training; after the training is completed, the recruited non - commissioned officers will be uniformly and accurately assigned to the corresponding professional and technical positions in accordance with the principle of professional counterparts and consistent recruitment.
Spokesperson of the Embassy in the UK: The Chinese Government is a staunch defender of cyber security - chinanews.com
chinanews.com, July 26 according to the website of the Chinese Embassy in the UK, the spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in the UK answered a reporter's question on the wrong remarks about the cyber attack on July 25.
The spokesman stressed that the Chinese government is a staunch defender of cyber security and has always resolutely opposed and cracked down on any form of cyber attacks and cyber crimes.
A reporter asked: According to the media, China - related hacking groups have interfered with the network system of a British company, attacked British and American technology companies with patent data, and hacked into the government networks of EU countries.
The spokesman said that the Chinese government is a staunch defender of cyber security and has always resolutely opposed and cracked down on any form of cyber attacks and cyber crimes.
Cyberspace is highly virtual, difficult to trace its origins, and diverse actors, so when investigating and characterizing cyber events, sufficient evidence should be produced, and no groundless speculation should be allowed.
The spokesman said that a series of events such as "Prism Gate" in the past proved that the United States has been carrying out the world's largest cyber espionage operation.
Maintaining peace and stability in cyberspace serves the common interests of all countries.
The spokesman pointed out that China's achievements in scientific and technological innovation were not stolen or stolen, but achieved through self - reliance and hard work.
In 2019, China filed about 59,000 patent applications through the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), with an annual growth rate of 10.6%, making it the country with the largest number of international patent applications.
China has become a major country in innovation and intellectual property rights.
Data from the Urumqi Central Branch of the People's Bank of China shows that in the first half of the year, new loans for agriculture - related and small and micro enterprises in Xinjiang exceeded the annual increase in 2019.
In the first half of this year, the Urumqi Central Branch of the People's Bank of China used a variety of monetary policy tools to guide the banking industry to continuously increase loan investment, providing sufficient financial guarantee for epidemic prevention and control and the resumption of work and production.
Most districts in Urumqi have basically completed secondary testing in high - risk areas - chinanews.com
chinanews.com, Urumqi, July 26 (Reporters Sun Tingwen Zhao Yamin) Zhang Wei, director of the Urumqi Health Commission, reported on the latest epidemic situation and nucleic acid testing in Urumqi on July 26, saying that at present, most districts in Urumqi have basically completed free nucleic acid testing.
The expert group of the State Council and experts from the autonomous region and Urumqi are making further assessments of the development of the epidemic based on the results of nucleic acid testing and epidemiological investigation.
The Information Office of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region held a press conference on the 26th to inform about the epidemic situation and prevention and control in Xinjiang.
According to him, from 0:00 to 24:00 on July 25, there were 22 new confirmed cases of new coronavirus pneumonia in Urumqi (of which 5 were confirmed cases of asymptomatic infections) and 38 new asymptomatic infections.
As of 24:00 on July 25, there were 135 confirmed cases and 147 asymptomatic infections in Urumqi.
The new asymptomatic infections on the 25th were also basically detected through free nucleic acid testing and active screening in the city.
Zhang Wei, director of the Urumqi Municipal Health Commission, said on the 26th that most districts in Urumqi have basically completed free nucleic acid testing.
He also said that from the experience of other regions in China, there are many factors that affect the results of nucleic acid testing, such as the sensitivity of the testing reagent, the time of infection and detoxification of the tested person, the cooperation of the tested person when the specimen is taken (poor cooperation may lead to the specimen not being taken in place), the testing environment, and the proficiency of the testing personnel.
Due to various reasons, nucleic acid tests can also produce false negative results.
The so - called false negative means that the person tested is indeed infected, but the nucleic acid test results are negative.
In addition, people who have been in close contact with confirmed and suspected cases usually need two nucleic acid tests to exclude them.
For people who have been to high - risk areas of the epidemic, if fever and respiratory symptoms occur, a negative nucleic acid test may lead to false negatives, so two nucleic acid tests are also needed to eliminate them.
He said that in view of the above situation, and for the sake of the health of the people of all ethnic groups in the city, Urumqi will conduct a second free nucleic acid test in key areas such as Tianshan District and Shaybak District from today, and at the same time carry out "checking heritage and filling gaps".
It is reported that Tianshan District and Shaybak District are high - risk areas for the epidemic.

(Chief Reporter Wang Yan) Yesterday, the 2020 Shanghai International Film and Television Festival, held against the backdrop of strict epidemic prevention measures, opened the curtain of the 23rd Shanghai International Film Festival with an industry summit forum on "Running Well - off in an All - round Way and Building a Dream for a New Era".
As the first international film and television festival to be held since the global epidemic continued to spread and epidemic prevention and control in China became normalized, this year's Shanghai International Film Festival is of great significance.
On the basis of normalizing epidemic prevention and control, holding the Shanghai International Film and Television Festival is not only a sign of confidence, but also a declaration of determination - our confidence and determination to overcome the epidemic will remain unchanged, our confidence and determination to successfully run the people's festival will remain unchanged, and our confidence and determination to build a global film and television production center and launch the "Shanghai Culture" brand will remain unchanged.
Every year, the Shanghai International Film Festival, with its attitude of continuous innovation and progress, is a new start.
Therefore, it is necessary to take every step to serve the people's spiritual life and the high - quality development of the film and television industry.
This is even more so this year.
In order to cherish the hard - won epidemic prevention and control situation, the Shanghai International Film Festival, on the one hand, strictly adheres to epidemic prevention requirements and implements epidemic prevention and control measures in detail; on the other hand, with the vision of gathering wisdom for Chinese film creation and meeting the viewing needs of film fans, it has launched multi - sector activities both online and offline.
On the first day of the opening ceremony, the relevant epidemic prevention policies were strictly implemented in the activities related to the festival, from offline film viewing to industry forums.
The activities of the forum are limited to 50 people, and the attendance rate is strictly limited to 30% for each viewing session.
As the organizing committee of the festival upholds, in any case, "putting people's lives and health first" is the main premise.
Offline activities have been greatly streamlined, and "on the cloud" has become a lot more lively.
To implement the important concept of "the people's city is built by the people, and the people's city is for the people", and as a festival for the people, this year's Shanghai International Film Festival seeks innovation and transformation, and uses online "cloud screenings", master classes, "cloud sharing", and other measures to meet the diverse needs of film fans.
On the first day of the opening ceremony, Migu Video, the official partners of the festival, and Blockbuster, the Oriental Pearl, sent a number of "Belt and Road" films to the clouds to give back to fans.
In the evening, the Golden Goblet Opening Forum and Jia Zhangke Master Class were also launched on multiple platforms, including Central Video, Learning Powerhouse, and Wenhui App, so that people could follow the latest trends of Chinese films without leaving their homes.
At the opening forum yesterday, Yan Xiaoming, member of the Party Group and deputy director of the Central Radio and Television Station, delivered a speech and announced the opening of the festival, Zhou Huilin, member of the Standing Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and head of the Propaganda Department, delivered a speech, and Zong Ming, deputy mayor, attended.
White House outbreak expert Fauci: Cautiously optimistic about vaccine development in early 2021
Fauci made the remarks at an online video conference hosted by the International Leadership Foundation on the 25th.
He cautioned that it is not clear how the new coronavirus outbreak will develop in autumn and winter, nor what the ultimate impact of the epidemic will be, "and the only way to end all this is for each of us to choose to be part of the solution."
According to Johns Hopkins University, as of 21:00 on the 25th, the number of confirmed new coronavirus cases in the United States has reached 4.176,000, with 146,000 deaths.
Fauci said that some parts of the United States are currently struggling with the rebound of the pandemic.
Although the epidemic situation varies from region to region and needs to be adapted to local conditions, diverse anti - epidemic strategies do not mean that there is no close connection between regions.
Outbreaks in one region will eventually affect other regions.
"Now is not the time for complacency," Fauci said. "Our work has not been completed, we must step up our efforts, and we must be vigilant about the uncertainty of the future."
He Dayi, a Chinese - American medical expert and founder of "cocktail therapy" for the treatment of AIDS, pointed out at the meeting that the new coronavirus outbreak in the United States has not yet reached its peak.
"Each of us must do our part to slow down the spread of this virus."
He called on the public to use their practical actions to buy time for scientists to step up research and development of new coronavirus therapeutics and vaccines.
The International Leadership Foundation is a non - profit organization dedicated to promoting international exchange activities in the United States and the Asia - Pacific region, and is committed to elevating the status of Asian - Pacific Americans and cultivating young international leaders.
On the same day, U.S. Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao, U.S. Representative Meng Zhaowen, and founding president of the International Leadership Foundation Dong Jiling spoke at the meeting.
They paid special tribute to the Asian - Pacific medical workers and volunteers fighting the epidemic on the front line, and called on the American public to continue to adhere to epidemic prevention guidelines such as "social distancing" to contain the spread of the epidemic.

Brazilian study shows hydroxychloroquine is ineffective in treating mild - to - moderate COVID-19 pneumonia - chinanews.com
Recently, a Brazilian study showed that hydroxychloroquine was ineffective in patients with mild - to - moderate COVID-19.
The study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
The Pakistani researchers divided 667 patients from 55 hospitals across the country into three groups and conducted clinical trials; they mainly compared the treatment effect of hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with another antibiotic, azithromycin, and analyzed whether it could help improve the condition of mild and moderate patients with COVID-19.
The results showed that hydroxychloroquine not only has no therapeutic effect, but may have damaging side effects on organs.
The study was conducted by several leading hospitals in Brazil, such as Hospital Israel Albert Einstein, Heart Hospital (HCor), and Hospital Syria - Lebanon, in collaboration with the Brazilian Clinical Research Institute (BCRI) and the Brazilian Critical Care Research Network (BRICNet).
On the 25th local time, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro announced through social platforms that the fourth nucleic acid test result was negative.

It is reported that this round of app governance work was jointly carried out by the Cyberspace Administration of China, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the Ministry of Public Security, and the State Administration for Market Regulation.
According to reports, the special governance working group composed of four departments accepted more than 12,000 valid reports from netizens last year, verified more than 2,300 Apps, and took punitive measures such as public exposure, interviews, and removal of 260 Apps with large user sizes and prominent problems.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Cyberspace Administration of China, the current number of Apps has exceeded 5 million, and the problem of illegal collection and use of personal information has not yet been fundamentally solved.
In 2020, the governance work will be further intensified, and on the basis of app verification, the scope of governance will be further expanded to include SDKs (software development kits) and mini - programs.

On the 25th, the 2020 Hunan Red Tourism and Culture Festival and the first Red Culture Industry Expo in Xiangtan kicked off in Shaoshan.
In recent years, the demand for red tourism has gradually increased.
However, the development of the red tourism industry also faces difficulties such as a small number of young people, homogenization of tour projects, and a single commercial channel.
Especially this year, when the epidemic hit, the cultural and tourism industry across the country suffered a serious setback, and the red tourist attractions also faced severe challenges.
For example, the use of technological means such as drone shooting and VR immersion experience can meet the tourist demand of "people have not arrived and the scenery has arrived "; the introduction of live webcast means to promote the famous and excellent specialties of red scenic spots can directly enhance the economic benefits of red tourism; the introduction of" cloud "technology to create boutique displays with prominent themes, distinct orientation, and rich connotations to fully display and enhance the propaganda and education functions of red scenic spots; and the innovation of the communication methods of red culture to bring revolutionary cultural relics" to life ", make red tourism popular, pass on the red gene, and enhance the attractiveness of red scenic spots.
This cultural festival uses the popular "county, city (district) chief + professional anchor special promotion" method to promote red cultural tourism specialties, and uses 5G technology to provide services such as real - time viewing and smart city demonstration to promote red cultural tourism attractions, all of which are efforts to put smart wings on red tourism, and it is expected that Hunan's red tourism will become more and more popular.
U.S. - China Trade Talks Representatives Transcript for Meeting in August
Hong Kong's South China Morning Post quoted an anonymous person familiar with the matter as saying that Liu He, the head of the Chinese trade negotiation team and Vice Premier of the State Council, and Lai Haizhe, the co - leader of the US team and trade representative, are expected to hold formal talks in August to assess the implementation of the first phase of the China - US trade agreement.
The report said that although China has significantly increased its purchases of U.S. agricultural products in the past few months, due to the new coronavirus outbreak and other factors, China's purchases are still some way from the amount promised in the trade agreement.
Analysts say the recent closure of each other's consulates by the United States and China, together with other disputes, could derail any progress on trade between the two sides.
The first phase of the trade agreement between China and the United States came into force one month after its signing on January 15, and the agreement stipulates that the high - level trade framework group of the two sides should hold talks every six months.
Informed sources said the meeting would be "an important turning point", allowing both sides to assess the progress of the agreement.
However, this person also said that if tensions between the United States and China lead to a low willingness to talk at this time, the two sides may agree that the conference call between Lai Haizhe and Liu He on May 8 has met the semi - annual terms of the trade agreement.
Since the beginning of this year, China - US relations have deteriorated rapidly, with disputes between the two sides including the origin of the new coronavirus, trade, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, the South China Sea, and ideology.
Although US President Donald Trump bragged about his achievements in the first phase of the agreement at the beginning of the year, his attitude has recently changed.
He said at the White House press conference on the 23rd that although China has recently purchased a record amount of U.S. corn and bought a lot of soybeans in a single day, "this trade agreement is no longer as meaningful to me as it was when it was reached".
An anonymous Beijing government adviser also said that due to the poor relationship between the United States and China, a new round of trade negotiations is unlikely, and that "trade issues have lost weight in China - US relations".
However, he revealed that the relevant Chinese economic and trade units still met on the 23rd to discuss a series of issues, including how to increase imports from the United States, "We have tried our best to buy, so any additional purchases will be difficult".
Peng Jining, vice president of the U.S. - China Trade National Committee, said that it is "more important than ever" to maintain the momentum of the first phase of the agreement, and pointed out that China has made progress in further opening its financial markets to U.S. companies this year.
Analysts at Plenum, an independent research firm, said, "It is better to talk than not talk, although it may only be regarded as routine."
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26 (Reporter Wei Yukun) The reporter learned from the Ministry of Emergency Management on July 26 that the State Defense Office and the Ministry of Emergency Management, together with the State Administration of Food and Material Reserves, have once again urgently dispatched 1.35 million woven bags, 1.2 million square meters of woven cloth, and 130,000 square meters of geotextile to Anhui to support the flood prevention and rescue work in Anhui.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Ministry of Emergency Management, at present, the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the Huaihe River basin maintain high water level fluctuations, and the "Yangtze River No. 3 Flood of 2020" formed in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River on the 26th, increasing the risk in some areas.
The meteorological department predicts heavy rainfall in Chongqing, Guizhou, and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in the next three days, and the flood prevention situation is still severe and complex.
According to reports, since the flood, the Ministry of Emergency Management has deployed national comprehensive fire and rescue teams to pre - position professional rescue forces in key flood prevention areas, and has participated in 10,364 flood prevention and rescue operations, deployed more than 130,000 commanders and soldiers, 17,778 fire trucks, and 11,887 boats, rescued 37,777 people trapped in distress, and evacuated and transferred more than 107,000 people trapped.
Hao Yusheng, Chief Representative of Nasdaq China: Now is the Best Time for Chinese Companies to IPO in the United States - Economic Watch - Professional Financial News Website
Zhang Bin, a reporter from the Economic Observer Network, said that because of the Ruixing coffee fraud incident, the U.S. market has imposed stricter supervision on Chinese stocks, and because of the long - term pressure on valuation, Chinese stocks listed in the U.S. are under pressure, and Chinese stocks such as NetEase and JD.com have recently started their journey back to Hong Kong for listing.
Recently, companies such as Shell and Ideal Automobile have become enthusiastic about going public in the United States.
Is it the best time for Chinese companies to go public in the United States amid the epidemic and the Chinese stock market crisis?
"As far as recent IPO cases and the situation of companies going public in the United States are concerned, IPOs in the United States have not been affected in any way, but the market is now very good, and even now this is the best time for Chinese companies to go public in the United States in the past 10 years."
Hao Yusheng, chief representative of Nasdaq Stock Exchange China, said at the "2020 Listed Company Leaders Summit" hosted by Snowball.
In April this year, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the U.S. Public Company Accounting Regulatory Board (PCAOB) issued the Statement on Audit Quality and the Important Role of Regulatory Access to Audit and Other International Information - Discussion on Current Information Access Challenges for U.S. Listed Companies with Large Business in China.
The statement said that although international cooperation and coordination have increased significantly in recent years, the U.S. regulatory authorities still have problems in obtaining information, and the SEC and PCAOB still face legal and practical challenges; in contrast to the document, the PCAOB website details the list of listed companies and their audit institutions that have encountered audit obstacles, and a large number of Chinese companies are listed.
In addition, in May this year, the U.S. Senate passed the Foreign Companies Accountability Act, which imposes additional information disclosure requirements on foreign companies listed in the United States.
In Hao Yusheng's view, the Chinese stock market crisis has not affected investors' appetite.
"When this news first came out, everyone was panicking, and everyone was asking if they could go public in the United States in the future, but then we found that these questions were not a matter for investors, and investors might ask these questions during the recent IPO roadshow in the United States, or even become standardized questions, but this was not regarded as an important factor for investors to invest in or not invest in a Chinese company.
It is suggested that everyone should try to view the current situation with a sense of normalcy.
Of course, this may appear to be the worst situation in the past two years, but as far as investors' appetite is concerned, it has not been affected in any way.
So from now until the end of this year or before the U.S. election, the rush to IPO in the U.S. will continue. "
On May 9 this year, Jinshan Cloud was officially listed on the Nasdaq in the United States, becoming the first Chinese company to IPO in the United States after the epidemic.
"The listing of Jinshan Cloud gives great confidence to Chinese companies preparing for IPOs in the future."
Hao Yusheng said.
According to Snowball's China Stock Data Report for the first half of 2020, in the first half of this year, a total of 20 Chinese companies went to the United States for IPOs, an increase of 17.6% over the same period last year; in terms of total initial fund - raising, 20 companies raised a total of 2.725 billion, an increase of more than 52.4% over the same period last year; in terms of industry distribution, the number of IPOs in the health care industry was outstanding in the first half of this year, an increase of 100% over the same period last year.
According to Hao Yusheng, the quality of Chinese companies IPO in the United States in the first half of this year is higher, and high - quality companies with excellent fundamentals and growth will be more favored by investors.
In the short, medium, and long term, Hao Yusheng continues to be optimistic about the IPO of Ming Chinese companies in the United States.
"In the short term, the rush to IPO in the United States continues; in the medium term, Chinese companies have more choices, A - shares, Hong Kong stocks, and U.S. stocks, and everyone will consider the U.S. election and China - U.S. relations as market choices and time choices; in the long term, everything will return to normal, and market fluctuations are cycles, both political and economic, and will eventually return to normal, and the stock market has always been volatile."
Hao Yusheng also said, "There are many uncertain factors this year, but for high - quality companies, no matter whether the market is good or bad, as long as they are solid and have growth that investors can see, other factors are relatively minor, and investors need to invest in excellent Chinese companies."

Commentator of People's Daily: Concentrate on Doing Your Own Business Well and Build New Advantage for Future Development - - On Studying and Implementing General Secretary Xi Jinping's Important Speech at the Entrepreneurs Symposium - - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 25, People's Daily, July 26 Commentator's Article: Concentrate on Doing Your Own Business Well and Build New Advantage for Future Development
At present, the global epidemic and the world economic situation are still severe and complex, and China faces unprecedented challenges in its development.
Maintaining strategic determination, enhancing confidence to win, and concentrating on doing our own business well are the key to meeting all kinds of risks and challenges.
At the Entrepreneurs Symposium held recently, General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed that under the current external environment of rising protectionism, sluggish world economy, and shrinking global market, we must concentrate on doing our own business well, give full play to the advantages of the domestic super - large market, gradually form a new development pattern in which the domestic cycle is the main body and the domestic and international cycles are mutually reinforcing, improve the modernization level of the industrial chain and supply chain, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation, accelerate the research of key core technologies, and create new advantages for future development.
He who watches the situation is wise, and he who dominates the situation wins.
Under the external environment of deepening economic globalization, the market and resources have played an important role in China's rapid development.
Now, the world under the impact of the epidemic is undergoing profound changes, facing more unstable and uncertain factors, and economic globalization is encountering headwinds and waves.
To prepare for changes in the external environment for a long time, and to push China's economy to ride the wind and waves and move steadily, an extremely important aspect is to take expanding and meeting domestic demand as the strategic basis for development, give full play to its own advantages, and add impetus to China's economic development and drive world economic recovery through the prosperity of the domestic economy and the smooth circulation of the domestic economy.
We should deeply realize that building a complete domestic demand system is related to China's long - term development and long - term peace and stability.
The CPC Central Committee took stock of the situation and clearly proposed to firmly implement the strategy of expanding domestic demand, which is the need to cope with the impact of the epidemic, to maintain the long - term sustained and healthy development of China's economy, and to meet the people's growing need for a better life.
The advantage of a large economy is that it is internally recyclable.
With the world's most complete and largest industrial system, strong production capacity, and perfect supporting capabilities, China has more than 100 million market entities and more than 170 million people with higher education or various professional skills, as well as a super - large domestic demand market formed by 1.4 billion people, including more than 400 million middle - income groups, and is in the stage of rapid development of new industrialization, informatization, urbanization, and agricultural modernization, with huge potential for investment demand.
The socialist market economy system and other basic socialist economic systems can not only stimulate the vitality of various market entities, liberate and develop social productive forces, but also promote the organic unity of efficiency and equity, and continuously achieve common prosperity.
We should firmly grasp the strategic basis of expanding domestic demand, make production, distribution, and circulation more dependent on the domestic market to achieve a virtuous circle, clarify the strategic direction of supply - side structural reform, and promote a dynamic balance between total supply and total demand at a higher level.
It is necessary to accelerate the construction of a complete domestic demand system, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation and other aspects of innovation, accelerate the promotion of strategic emerging industries such as digital economy, smart manufacturing, life and health, and new materials, so as to form more new growth points and poles, and gradually form a new development pattern in which the domestic cycle is the main body and the domestic and international cycles are mutually reinforcing.
Openness leads to progress, while closure inevitably leads to backwardness.
General Secretary Xi Jinping has repeatedly stressed that China's opening door will not be closed, but will only open wider and wider.
Taking the domestic circulation as the main body, it is by no means a closed operation, but by giving full play to the potential of domestic demand, the domestic market and the international market will be better connected, and both international and domestic markets and resources will be better utilized, so as to achieve stronger and more sustainable development.
At the same time, there is no contradiction between expanding domestic demand and opening up, and the smoother the domestic circulation, the more conducive it is to building a new pattern of opening up, and the more conducive it is to forming new advantages for participating in international cooperation and competition.
Although protectionism is on the rise in the world, we should stand on the right side of history, adhere to deepening reform and opening up, strengthen openness and cooperation in the field of science and technology, promote the building of an open world economy, and promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.
The Chinese nation has experienced many tribulations in its history, but it has never been crushed, but has become more and more brave, and has continued to grow and rise from tribulations.
On the way forward, with the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, the significant advantages of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, strong mobilization capacity and comprehensive strength, and the unity and struggle of the entire Party, the army, and the people of all ethnic groups in China, we will surely overcome all difficulties and obstacles, maintain the sound momentum of China's economic and social development, build a moderately prosperous society in all respects, and successfully embark on a new journey of building a modern socialist country in all respects!
Yuanbao's income declined after the "90s, but instead" retaliated "to save money?
As the income of Yuanbao declined, the "post-90s" not only did not flee Yuanbao, but began to save money "vindictively"?
In the first half of the year, the "post-90s" were more likely to save money: the amount of money saved per capita increased by nearly 40% compared to 2019, according to the 2020 edition of the Balance Bao Savings Report released by the China New Economy Research Institute and Alipay.
Interestingly, the "post-90s" are more inclined to save from a single stroke of "small money", with 60% saving less than 20 yuan per stroke on average...
Saving money with balance treasure has also become the saving habit of the "post-90s".
Data shows that of the 700 million Yuanbao users, 134 million are "post-90s".
There are 174 million "post-90s" in China, which means that about 3 out of every 4 "post-90s" in China are saving money with their balance treasure.
At present, the 7 - day annualized return of money funds such as Yuanbao has slipped from above 2% at the beginning of the year to around 1.5%.
Even so, it did not affect the pace of saving money for the "post-90s".
Against the backdrop of the increase in the "saving effect" of Yuanbao, many young people who are used to using Yuanbao have also been directly transformed into "base people".
Alipay data shows that as of July 13, the number of new "base people" on Alipay has more than doubled year - on - year in the past month, and more and more young people are achieving "advanced" financial management on Alipay.
Some analysts believe that the inflow of funds from Yuanbao into the stock market is also an important reason for the clear decline in the share of money funds in June.
The report also shows that "post-90s" girls are more likely to save more money, saving an average of 20% more than boys; 60% of users who hold funds on the Alipay platform are men, and women tend to choose more robust financial management methods than men.
What are the plans of the "post-90s" after saving money?
Alipay data shows that the "post-90s" have the habit of saving money for their goals, and the largest number of users take travel as their goal.
Affected by the epidemic, many "post-90s" have saved money to prepare for travel after the epidemic; the reopening of cinemas has also provided a new way to shift from saving money to consumption.

France increases military investment in space - Xinhuanet
French Defense Minister Florence Parly said on the 24th that France will add hundreds of millions of euros to its space defense budget and develop military forces in space to prevent "unfriendly moves" that other countries may make in outer space.
Parly told La Provence on the same day that between 2019 and 2025, France's budget for military space projects will increase from 3.6 billion euros ($4.2 billion) previously proposed to 4.3 billion euros ($5 billion).
According to the French Military Planning Act 2019 - 2025, which was approved by the French Parliament in 2018, France is expected to update its existing observation satellites and communications satellites, launch three electromagnetic listening satellites, and improve the modernization of its space surveillance radar.
French President Emmanuel Macron announced in July last year that a space military command and an "aviation and space force" would be established within the French Air Force.
Parly said she will officially announce the establishment of the space force when she visits a military academy in Salon - en - Provence later.
Parly said that the space force belongs to the Air Force and will have a strength of 500 personnel by 2025.
She said, "In the past, people thought that space served the common interests of science, but this idea is gone forever. Today, space is a place where countries compete for global hegemony."
Parly reiterated Macron's previous statement, saying that France has no intention of provoking an arms race.
"We are by no means engaged in an arms race, but it is my responsibility to fully recognize the threats we may face."
Parly revisited the surveillance of a military satellite shared by France and Italy in 2017.
She said that it was a Russian satellite that was "peeping".
The Russian side denies this claim.
Parly said that France will "soon" have small patrol satellites that can detect and target "those behind unfriendly moves".
French media believe that France sought to establish a space force because US President Donald Trump asked the US Department of Defense to draft a bill to establish the Pacific Air Force in February last year.
Trump signed the National Defense Authorization Act in December last year, approving the establishment of the Pacific Air Force, the sixth military branch of the United States.
Some experts fear that these measures by the US have accelerated the militarization of space in the US and may lead to a new arms race in space.

The report says the shared accommodation market has picked up since March - chinanews.com
(Reporter Yang Zhaokui) The China Shared Accommodation Development Report 2020 (hereinafter referred to as the Report) recently released by the Sharing Economy Research Center of the National Information Center shows that due to the impact of the epidemic, the transaction value of China's shared accommodation market fell by 72.1% year - on - year in the first five months of 2020.
However, the shared accommodation market began to pick up in March, and the market turnover, order volume, and number of people received gradually recovered.
The report shows that the transaction value of the shared accommodation market has fallen sharply, on the one hand, due to the sharp decline in the demand for travel accommodation under epidemic prevention and control, and the sharp decrease in the number of orders, with the total number of orders falling by 65% year - on - year in the first five months and the number of visitors falling by 63% year - on - year; on the other hand, the weak demand has also led to a significant decline in overnight prices, with the average overnight price falling by 16% year - on - year in the first five months.
However, in March, April, and May, the market turnover increased by 78%, 199%, and 35% respectively; the number of orders increased by 141%, 152%, and 50% respectively; and the number of visitors increased by 81%, 112%, and 28% respectively.
The report points out that the development of the shared accommodation industry has been promising for a long time, but there are still many uncertainties in the near future.
In this regard, Yu Fengxia, deputy director of the Sharing Economy Research Center of the National Information Center, told the Worker's Daily reporter that the development of shared accommodation needs stronger policy support, and on the one hand, it is necessary to do a good job in implementing policies already introduced in the early stages, further strengthen policy publicity, and pay attention to creating a better business environment; on the other hand, it is also necessary to further strengthen policy guidance and support in terms of stimulating consumer demand, enriching the supply of tourism and accommodation services, innovating service methods, and strengthening cooperation between the government and platform enterprises.

chinanews.com, Xiamen, July 26 (Yang Fushan Zhang Shushan Xu Jingyi) - The vascular surgery department of Shanghai Changhai Hospital of the Naval Medical University, a well - known vascular surgery center in China, signed a contract with the vascular surgery department of Zhongshan Hospital affiliated to Xiamen University here on July 25 to jointly set up a collaboration center to promote exchanges and cooperation between the two sides in the field of vascular surgery, especially in the field of acute and severe aorta.
Zhongshan Hospital affiliated to Xiamen University said that after the vascular surgery departments of the two hospitals officially formed a collaborative unit, they will conduct remote consultations, conduct real - time online consultations with Changhai Hospital to formulate treatment plans, select talents for further training, and jointly carry out weekly surgical technical exchanges, teaching rounds, and so on; for complex cases, Changhai experts can be invited to the hospital to perform surgery according to the needs of patients, so that patients in southwest Fujian can enjoy the top medical resources in China without leaving the province.
The two hospitals will also work together to carry out innovative surgical research, popular science and early screening of aortic diseases, and so on.
A special seminar on aorta hosted by the Beijing Health Promotion Association and hosted by Zhongshan Hospital affiliated to Xiamen University was held in Xiamen on the same day.
The two well - known hospitals in Shanghai and Xiamen held the signing ceremony of the Vascular Surgery Collaboration Center at the same time at the meeting, and announced the formation of a collaborative unit to jointly improve the treatment level of vascular surgery - related diseases in southwest Fujian.
The vascular surgery department of Shanghai Changhai Hospital is the only research institute of vascular surgery in the army and the only clinical medical center for vascular system diseases in Shanghai, as well as the first national key discipline of vascular surgery, and has led the establishment of the professional committee of endovascular science of the Chinese Medical Association, which is a top team with deep experience in the industry.
Professor Huang Xiaojin, Director of Vascular Surgery at Zhongshan Hospital affiliated to Xiamen University, gave an interview to the media.
Vascular surgery at Zhongshan Hospital affiliated to Xiamen University is the first vascular surgery established by an independent discipline in Fujian Province, and has been committed to the diagnosis and treatment of aortic and peripheral vascular diseases for a long time, and was approved to build a provincial - level clinical key specialty in 2018.
In the treatment of aortic diseases, in addition to the treatment of dissecting aneurysms and aortic aneurysms, he has extensive experience in the treatment of emergency ruptured aortic aneurysms.
"Vascular surgery at Zhongshan Hospital affiliated to Xiamen University is outstanding in the region in terms of its history of development, the breadth, difficulty, and complexity of surgery, so this time we set up a collaboration center to carry out in - depth medical, teaching, and scientific research cooperation in the diagnosis and treatment of lower extremity arteries, carotid arteries, and other diseases, in addition to aorta."
Professor Feng Rui, deputy director of vascular surgery at Shanghai Changhai Hospital, said.
Zhongshan Hospital affiliated to Xiamen University and Shanghai Changhai Hospital signed a contract to establish the "Li Zhaoshen Famous Medical Studio" in gastroenterology in 2018.
Professor Huang Xiaojin, the director of the vascular surgery department of the hospital, said in an interview with CNNMoney that the vascular surgery department of the hospital has also had a long history of exchanges with Changhai Hospital, and that the two hospitals officially formed a collaborative unit this time, bringing the cooperation and exchange between the two sides to a new level.
He said that the hospital will regularly invite Shanghai experts to Xiamen to carry out surgical technical exchanges, teaching rounds, and discussion of difficult cases, and at the same time further carry out remote consultations, and currently plans to conduct remote consultations once a week; in addition, the department will also send personnel for further training and exchange to strengthen the training and development of the subject talent team.
The reporter learned at the meeting that vascular disease is the number one cause of death in China, and that the aorta, as the main artery of various organs of the human body, flows from the heart to the whole body, and plays an important role.
The occurrence of aortic disease is often accompanied by high risk, high mortality, and difficult treatment; the thickest section of the aorta is 4 cm in diameter, and once a hemangioma is formed, a rupture occurs, or the lining of the blood vessel ruptures, resulting in a dissection, it will cause haemorrhage, which is very dangerous.
In recent years, as people's lifestyles have changed and the pace of life has accelerated, China has become the world's largest country for high blood pressure, and aortic diseases have also increased, and today, with the development of surgical techniques and industrial materials, the treatment of aortic diseases continues to develop in the direction of minimally invasive, rapid, and efficient treatment.
Doctors can properly "channel" the blood flow by piercing the thigh and placing a stent in the aorta, thereby avoiding the impact of aneurysms or ruptured dissections and achieving good treatment results, and some surgeries even require local anesthesia.
More than 10 domestic experts were invited to the symposium to discuss new advances in the treatment of aortic diseases, and to conduct cutting - edge technical training and discussion of difficult cases in the form of conference salons.
The reporter learned at the meeting that with the development of surgical technology and industrial materials, the current treatment of aortic diseases continues to develop in the direction of minimally invasive, rapid, and efficient treatment.

chinanews.com, Chongqing, July 26 (Reporter Han Lu) The reporter learned from China Railway Chengdu Bureau Group Co., Ltd. on July 26 that the Little Three Gorges Tunnel of the Zheng - Wan high - speed railway, with a total length of about 18.9 kilometers, was completed on the same day.
It is understood that the Little Three Gorges Tunnel is not only the longest high - speed rail tunnel within the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, but also the longest single - hole, two - line high - speed rail tunnel with a design speed of 350 km / h among the projects currently under construction in China.
The Zheng - Wan high - speed railway is located in Henan, Hubei, and Chongqing provinces and cities, and is connected to the Beijing - Guangzhou and Xulan high - speed railway in the north of Zhengzhou, and to Chongqing by the Yuwan high - speed railway in the south of Wanzhou, and is an important part of China's "eight vertical and eight horizontal" high - speed railway network along the river and the Hunan high - speed railway.
The Little Three Gorges Tunnel of the Zheng - Wan high - speed railway was completed on the 26th.
The picture shows the connection site.
The Zheng - Wan high - speed railway starts in Zhengzhou City, Henan Province, and runs southwest through Pingdingshan City, Nanyang City, and Xiangyang City, Hubei Province, to Wanzhou District, Chongqing, with a total length of about 818 kilometers and a design speed of 350 kilometers per hour, and about 184 kilometers in Chongqing.
Among them, the Zhengzhou - Xiangyang section was opened in advance on December 1, 2019, and the Chongqing section is stepping up construction.
The Little Three Gorges Tunnel, which was completed on the 26th, is a control project for the entire Zheng - Wan high - speed railway, and is located at the junction of Fengjie County and Wushan County in Chongqing, with a total length of about 18.9 kilometers and a maximum depth of 890 meters.
Construction of the tunnel began in February 2017, and the entire tunnel was completed on July 26, 2020.
According to Wang Guojun, the head of the Zheng - Wan high - speed rail tunnel design at China Railway Eryuan Engineering Group Co., Ltd., the surveyor and designer, the location of the Little Three Gorges Tunnel is very complex in terms of topography and geological conditions, and it faces risks such as karst, sudden mud and water inrush, and large deformation of soft rock, making it a high - risk tunnel, making tunnel design and construction extremely difficult.
"During the construction of the project, we used geological survey methods, geophysical exploration methods, and advanced drilling methods to advance geological forecasts, and adopted special design schemes for more than 30 caverns of various types. For example, a bridge with a length of 24 meters was designed and built to cross large caverns with a longitudinal length of more than 10 meters and a depth of more than 55 meters in the tunnel to avoid tunnel subsidence," said Wang Guojun.
According to the construction party, China Railway Tunnel Bureau, during the construction of the tunnel, a combination of diversion and plugging was adopted to ensure the orderly progress of the project through the construction of horizontal tunnels, grouting to block water, strengthening the support of the tunnel structure, and the construction of a sewage treatment station, while also avoiding the damage caused by construction drainage to the water bodies of the Little Three Gorges Scenic Area, and at the same time successfully overcoming construction problems such as bad geology such as large deformation of soft rock up to 7 kilometers long, and multi - burst mud and water inrush with a maximum daily water inrush of 157,000 cubic meters.
When the entire Zheng - Wan high - speed railway is completed and opened to traffic, it will become a new convenient and fast passenger transport corridor from southwest China to the Central Plains, North China, and Northeast China, which is of great significance for improving the capacity and quality of the northeast - to - northeast railway corridor in southwest China, improving the layout of the regional road network, accelerating the development of tourism resources and urbanization along the route, promoting coordinated regional development, and promoting the implementation of the western development strategy.
Experts say collecting immigration data through the U.S. Census for the allocation of seats in the House of Representatives is unconstitutional
A number of civil rights organizations and several U.S. cities and counties have sued the U.S. federal government, saying that the Trump administration's attempt to exclude undocumented immigrants from the U.S. census is unworkable and unconstitutional.
The United States Census will determine the distribution of seats in the House of Representatives of the United States Congress.
Sarah Brannon, executive attorney of the American Civil Liberties Union, told VOA, "This will not work."
She went on to say that Trump's request to determine the citizenship status of people on the census was difficult to do and "not very reliable."
Another civil liberties organization, Common Cause, filed a lawsuit Thursday challenging Trump's executive order.
Some cities in New Jersey and Georgia joined the lawsuit.
Arlington County, Virginia, also joined the lawsuit Friday.
Garvey, chairman of the Arlington County Board of Management, said, "The U.S. Constitution requires an accurate count of our population every 10 years. We must accurately count everyone living in Arlington County, and this illegal attempt to scare people away and reduce the size of our immigrant community cannot be allowed to succeed."
Other organizations and individuals praised President Trump's executive order.
Marshall, the Alabama attorney general, called the decree a "victory" for the state.
He said, "The allocation of seats in the House of Representatives and the Electoral College in each state must be based on the number of residents living in each state, and the number of residents who are legally resident."
The U.S. Supreme Court last year blocked the Trump administration from including the citizenship question on the 2020 census form.
President Trump signed an executive order earlier this week directing Commerce Secretary Ross, who oversees the U.S. Census Bureau, to submit data on the undocumented population from the census so that the administration can exclude these undocumented people from the census figures of each state, and thus determine whether each state will increase, decrease, or maintain seats in the House of Representatives.
The United States redistributes seats in the House of Representatives every 10 years according to demographic changes.
Heavy rains fell in 33 districts and counties in Chongqing, and local flood prevention emergency response was initiated - chinanews.com
Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, July 26 (Reporters Ke Gaoyang, Li Song) The reporter learned from the Chongqing Flood Control and Drought Relief Command that Chongqing has seen a new round of heavy rainfall since July 25, with torrential rain falling in 33 districts and counties, and 4 small and medium - sized rivers experiencing floods above the warning level, and the local flood prevention emergency response has been initiated.
According to the Chongqing Hydrological Monitoring Station, from 8:00 am on the 25th to 8:00 am on the 26th, most of Chongqing received heavy to torrential rain, and 33 districts and counties, including Jiangjin, Qijiang, and Wulong, experienced torrential rain, including 16 districts and counties, including Wanzhou, Yunyang, and Nanchuan.
The maximum daily rainfall was 197.5 mm in Longshan Village, Jinshan Town, Nanchuan.
Affected by heavy rainfall, four sub - small and medium - sized rivers - Donzi Creek in Jiangjin District, Yaojiang River in Fuling District, Yingyang River in Kaizhou District, and Tuantan River in Yunyang County - experienced floods above the warning level, and the water level is still rising.
Heavy rainfall also caused a landslide in Liujing Village, Land Township, Wulong District, which disrupted the passage of village roads and highways, and the landslide slid into the tributaries of the Wujiang River along the Canghe River, blocking the river to form a quake lake, and the local government has urgently organized the transfer of people downstream.
In response to the torrential rain, the Chongqing Flood Control and Drought Relief Command issued flood warning information at 13:00 on the 26th, and initiated flood prevention emergency response, requiring relevant districts, counties, and units to strengthen inspection and duty, mobilize emergency rescue teams and materials in a timely manner, and evacuate and transfer people in threatened areas.
Moving in Response to the Situation and Promoting the Construction of Industrial Projects - Viewpoint Headline - Hunan Daily Online - Huasheng Online
In Hunan in the middle of summer, there is a heatwave.
The enthusiasm released by the on - site observation meeting to promote the construction of industrial projects in the province overshadowed the heat of the three days, and the clear orientation of "comparing strength with industry and heroes with projects" encouraged Sanxiang and Sishui.
The development of Hunan always depends on the construction of projects and the cultivation of industries.
In the face of a very unusual first half of the year, under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, the whole province stuck to a game of chess, went all out to fight the two tough battles of epidemic prevention and flood prevention, and took industrial projects as the "first chess" to implement the "six stability" and "six guarantees".
From a year - on - year GDP decline of 1.9% in the first quarter to a year - on - year growth of 1.3% in the first half of the year, it is self - evident that the period has been difficult and the effort enormous.
On this precious report card, the construction of industrial projects is the key support for Hunan to accelerate economic recovery and develop steadily.
The potential is smooth and irreversible.
The construction of industrial projects should be placed in the overall situation, and should not only be good at accumulating, preparing, and planning potential, but also be good at recognizing, seeking, and responding to change.
Against the backdrop of the current complex and severe international situation, in addition to painstaking efforts to attract investment, it is also necessary to study the current new situation and new characteristics, better grasp the laws, be more scientific and precise, and better integrate into the new development pattern in which the domestic cycle is the main body and the domestic and international cycles are mutually reinforcing.
Pay more attention to enhancing the industrial base capacity.
In the first half of the year, not only did a large number of heavyweight investment projects in emerging industries break ground and sow hope in our province, but also enterprises in industries with traditional advantages accelerated the transformation of digital, intelligent, and green industries.
The Yiyang Oskang Third Science Park project has transformed existing production lines, and the intelligent production line of high - end printed circuit boards has taken the lead; the new factory of Hunan Zhongyan Changde Cigarette Factory is committed to intelligent transformation and the construction of a modern factory, which is also a vivid portrayal of "old trees sprout new shoots"... Focusing on major national strategies and "two new and one heavy", efforts should be made to consolidate and upgrade advantageous industries, actively cultivate and develop emerging industries, and comprehensively increase scientific and technological innovation and localization substitution, so as to continuously consolidate the basic conditions and accumulate transformation momentum.
Pay more attention to cultivating and developing new economies, new forms of business, and new models.
The sudden new coronavirus outbreak has brought the popularity of the "cloud economy", stimulated the potential of the digital economy, and provided new opportunities for industrial transformation: in the first half of the year, the province's computer and office equipment manufacturing industry, electronics and communication equipment manufacturing industry increased by 12.6%, the online retail sales of wholesale and retail enterprises above the quota increased by 32.2% year on year, and the online meal revenue of catering enterprises increased by 35.6% year on year.
It is an irresistible trend to cultivate new opportunities in times of crisis, open new bureaus in times of change, actively promote digital industrialization and industrial digitization, and guide the integrated development of the digital economy and the real economy.
Pay more attention to optimizing and stabilizing the industrial chain supply chain.
Construction machinery is the main force of Hunan's industry, but two - thirds of the supporting enterprises are outside the province, and there is still space and potential in the supporting chain.
To strengthen the industrial chain thinking project, it is necessary not only for leading enterprises to continue to accumulate and achieve technological breakthroughs in the key links of the industrial chain; it is also necessary for all regions to devote themselves to cultivation, stimulate the "chain" lock reaction by strengthening the chain and extending the chain, promote the coordinated layout of related supporting industries, and accelerate the construction of an independent, controllable, safe and reliable industrial chain supply chain.
To overcome difficulties and support enterprises, Hunan is still a hot and promising land with a good business environment and emerging market opportunities.
All parts of the province have made frequent moves, new moves, and practical moves, thinking that the "burden reduction" of enterprise relief will lead to the "acceleration" of high - quality development; Shaoyang implements "shareholder - style" services, and does not prevaricate for enterprises, does not discount policies, and does not solve problems overnight... In the process of recovering the losses caused by the epidemic, all kinds of "every effort" has been made to identify shortcoming and pain points, and to achieve a living story of turning danger into opportunity.
Focusing on studying, cultivating, and developing industries, and optimizing the business environment, will surely win the favor of more investors.
The wind and waves are still ahead, but the state of riding the wind and waves has become the norm for the province to focus on the construction of industrial projects and promote high - quality development.
During this critical period, we must study and implement the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's series of important instructions, effectively cope with external uncertainties with the certainty of our own work, persevere in promoting the construction of industrial projects, and work together with enthusiasm and sweat to ensure the successful conclusion of the 13th Five - Year Plan and the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects.

Cultivate new forms of business and open up new space for employment - chinanews.com
New forms of employment continue to emerge, opening up new space for employment, and a number of innovative service policies continue to be launched to help new forms of employment thrive.
According to the latest data from the National Bureau of Statistics, the national urban survey unemployment rate was 5.7% in June, down 0.2 percentage points from May.
This is also the second consecutive decline in the national urban survey unemployment rate since April, and behind the month - on - month decline in the unemployment rate is the emergence of new employment opportunities in new forms of business.
Now, with a monthly salary of more than 5,000, and the novelty of embracing information technology, Guo Mei is becoming more and more motivated.
In the Innovation Incubation Base of Shanxi Transformation and Comprehensive Reform Demonstration Zone, there are more than 2,300 data annotators.
Not only data annotators, but since the beginning of this year, the state has also defined 25 occupations, including nucleic acid testers and online learning service providers, as new occupations, developed vocational skills standards, and launched skills training programs to support the development of practitioners.
For new employment methods and new entrepreneurial paths, the state is also innovating employment services.
Recently, 13 departments, including the National Development and Reform Commission, jointly issued the Opinions on Supporting the Healthy Development of New Business Forms and Models, Activating the Consumer Market and Driving the Expansion of Employment, to provide diverse employment opportunities for workers.
Multiple departments will jointly cultivate new individuals in the market, further reduce the cost of online entrepreneurship and employment for self - employed persons, make new forms of business more secure, and policies such as rights and interests protection and social security for flexible employment will be introduced one after another.

The overall stability of employment and prices highlights the "temperature" of the economy - chinanews.com

The overall stability of employment and prices highlights the "temperature" of the economy
Lin Huocan, reporter of China Economic Network, Economic Daily
In the first half of this year, in the face of the impact of the new coronavirus outbreak, China coordinated efforts to promote epidemic prevention and control and economic and social development, the epidemic prevention and control situation continued to improve, the economy steadily recovered, employment and price performance, which are closely related to people's livelihood, were generally stable, and the Chinese economy delivered a warm report card on economic performance.
In the first two months of this year, the survey unemployment rate increased.
Especially in February, the production and operation activities of many enterprises were basically shut down, the employment demand of enterprises was reduced, recruitment was delayed or cancelled, and the urban survey unemployment rate rose.
As the epidemic prevention and control situation gradually improved, the production and living order of the whole society continued to be restored.
The CPC Central Committee adheres to the general tenor of seeking progress while maintaining stability, further strengthens macro - policy hedging, comprehensively strengthens the employment priority policy, and actively promotes the work of helping to stabilize jobs and expand employment.
China has increased its policies to hedge and stabilize jobs, played a policy combination of "relief, deferral, and compensation", reduced the contributions of three social insurance units in stages, allowed the deferral of social insurance premiums, expanded the benefits of unemployment insurance for MSMEs, and provided employment subsidies and trainee subsidies to enterprises to absorb key groups.
With the implementation of various employment stabilization policies, the employment demand of enterprises has steadily picked up, the employment situation has gradually improved, and the urban survey unemployment rate has gradually declined, and in June, the survey unemployment rate was 5.7%.
Zhang Yi, Director of the Population and Employment Statistics Division of the National Bureau of Statistics, said that in the second quarter, various employment policies continued to bear fruit, and that the labor force that withdrew in the early stages due to the impact of the epidemic returned one after another, and that the urban labor participation rate in June increased by about 10 percentage points compared to February, which is close to the level of the same period last year.
Data showed that the total urban employment in June increased by more than 19% compared to February, and most industries reached pre - epidemic levels; the average weekly working hours of employees in enterprises reached 46.8 hours, 6.6 hours higher than in February, and 0.1 hours higher than in January.
Prices are also related to thousands of households.
In January this year, the CPI increased by 5.4% year - on - year, a multi - year high.
In February, the year - on - year increase in CPI fell slightly, but it was still in the "5 range".
The year - on - year increase in CPI is at a high level, driven by consumer demand before the Spring Festival, as well as by the wrong month of the Spring Festival and a low year - on - year base.
However, the impact of the new coronavirus outbreak on prices is particularly pronounced.
Affected by epidemic prevention and control, all parts of the country experienced delays in logistics, untimely supply of materials, and increased transportation costs in January and February, as well as some citizens hoarding and buying, resulting in a significant increase in the prices of some daily necessities.
To cope with the disturbance caused by epidemic prevention and control to the price situation, the relevant departments have included important living materials in the scope of emergency transportation guarantee to ensure smooth transportation of materials.
Thanks to a series of policies and measures, the market supply of vegetables, melons, and fruits has been effectively guaranteed.
In response to the rapid increase in pork prices at the beginning of this year, after the central government introduced the policy of ensuring supply and stabilizing prices, all regions and departments quickly implemented it, the release and supply of pork reserves improved significantly, the production capacity of pigs was restored in an orderly manner, and the production and marketing order gradually became normal.
Since March, pork prices have continued to decline, and in May, the year - on - year increase in food prices fell to 10.6%; in June, pork prices rose slightly month - on - month due to factors such as the slowdown of pig production, the reduction of imports, and the recovery of group consumption demand.
Fresh vegetable prices fluctuate seasonally, with an average increase of 3.4% in the first half of the year.
Affected by the high comparison base in the same period last year, fresh fruit prices continued to decline year - on - year, with an average decline of 13.3% in the first half of the year.
The basic livelihood of the masses has been effectively guaranteed, and the overall economic and social situation has remained stable and orderly.
With the gradual recovery of transportation and logistics, all regions have stepped up efforts to ensure supply, and the market supply and demand situation has improved.
Since March, the CPI has declined month - on - month for four consecutive months, and the year - on - year increase has also fallen from 4.3% in March to 2.5% in June, and the price level has generally returned to stability.
In the second half of the year, China's prices will continue to remain moderate, and the overall inflationary pressure will be low, but we should still promote the restoration of production and living order under the premise of normalizing epidemic prevention and control.
We will effectively respond to natural disasters such as floods and droughts in major agricultural production areas such as grain, fruits and vegetables, strengthen market supervision, and resolutely crack down on acts that disrupt market order, such as hoarding and price gouging.

chinanews.com, Qinghai, Hainan, July 26: "Flower Sea Live Room" on the shores of Qinghai Lake: "Sweet" brings goods to help farmers increase their income
Author Hu Guilong Pan Yujie
"In the middle of summer, the shores of Qinghai Lake are full of golden flowers and thousands of bees, where the altitude is high, the temperature difference between day and night is large, and the air pollution is low, and the intense light gives birth to the most tenacious and generous bee colonies, creating the characteristics of Qinghai royal jelly, which is high in activity, high in protein, rich in nutritional value, low in sugar and low in fat."
On the 26th, Zhang Jianxun, deputy director of the Industry and Information Administration of Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Qinghai Province, said.
On the same day, the "Together to Fight Epidemic Spring Pulp and Help Farmers" bee product live - streaming event was held on the shores of Qinghai Lake, where representatives of the China Bee Products Association, entrepreneurs, bee farmers, and other parties gathered to promote the characteristic bee products of Qinghai, and sold nearly 10,000 bottles of Qinghai Plateau royal jelly online and offline, with a total of nearly 3.8 million yuan in goods.
The picture shows bee farmers displaying bee products on the spot.
It is reported that with the help of Beijing Houdeli Bee Chain Network, Quickhand, Taobao and other well - known domestic bee product retail enterprises, live broadcast, and e - commerce platforms, the event facilitated the exchange and cooperation of "enterprises + beekeepers + growers", and continued to issue "Qinghai Plateau Spring Pulp Vouchers" to consumers through online and offline channels, and the total annual profit of the enterprise is expected to be nearly 5.28 million yuan.
Una, President of Beijing Houdeli Bee Industry Co., Ltd., said, "This will expand the popularity of Qinghai bee products, attract more consumers to understand and like non - added natural bee products, and drive bee farmers to increase their income."
At present, the company has signed production cooperation strategic agreements with Qinghai Cloud Bee Industry Co., Ltd. and Qinghai Huabao Bee Industry Co., Ltd., hoping to jointly promote the rapid development of the local bee industry in Qinghai.
The picture shows a sea of rapeseed flowers on the shores of Qinghai Lake.
This spring, due to the need to set up road checkpoints for epidemic prevention and control, beekeepers' journey to "chase flowers for honey" was blocked, and many bees died due to missing the flowering period and lack of food, which seriously affected the income of beekeepers.
"Throughout the year, beekeepers travel long distances to follow the flowering season, from Yunnan and Sichuan all the way north to the northwest, and they sleep rough and live in limbo, which is very hard work.
As a business, we have a responsibility to help them. "
Una said.
"Bees are'environmental scouts', and bees can't survive in heavily polluted areas," said Zhao Xiaochuan, executive vice president of the China Bee Products Association, adding that bee pollination is an important link in the ecological chain and plays an irreplaceable role in protecting plant diversity and improving the ecological environment.
At the same time, bee pollination can increase the yield and improve the quality of crops, especially in areas with a wide range of species and poor management conditions, which is of greater significance.
Research data shows that pollination can increase canola production by about 15% - 30%.
The picture shows Zhao Xiaochuan (right), executive vice president of the China Bee Products Association, promoting Qinghai bee products.
"The economic, ecological, and social benefits created by bee pollination far outweigh the value of bee products themselves, and the bee industry has great potential in human health, crop production, vegetation reproduction, and ecological protection, which people have always known little about."
Zhao Xiaochuan said.
Today, however, the number of beekeepers is dwindling, and in addition to beekeepers who travel all year round, there are still many poor households with mobility problems who choose to take shares in cooperatives with beehives.
"The state has financial support, and we contact technical personnel for help and guidance, and beekeepers lack understanding and judgment of the market environment, so they also need the help and coordination of the government, enterprises, and industry associations to open up markets."
Zhao Xiaochuan said.
"We hope that everyone will pay more attention to and help beekeeping groups in the future," said Una. "Our bee products are also screened and controlled in strict accordance with national standards to ensure quality and protect the rights and interests of consumers while helping beekeepers."
Affected by continuous rainfall, since July 22, the soil at the trailing edge of the Zhongbao landslide in Zhongtai Group, Liujing Village, Land Township, Wulong District, Chongqing, has cracked, resulting in large - scale slip deformation, completely blocking the flow along the Canghe River, and forming a weir plug with a water level of 13 meters in front of the dam and an estimated storage capacity of about 550,000 cubic meters.

To ensure the safety of navigation, the Chongqing Maritime Department decided to implement temporary traffic control in the waters from the boundary stone plate of the Yangtze River to Guanyin Beach.
After an emergency consultation between the Chongqing Municipal Defense Office and meteorological, water conservancy, hydrological, and other departments and units, the Chongqing Flood Control and Drought Relief Command decided to issue early warning information for river floods and initiate emergency response for flood prevention.
The Chongqing Flood Control and Drought Relief Command requires that Chongqing Jiangbei, Shapingba, Tongnan, Wulong and other districts and counties, as well as the relevant member units of the Chongqing Defense Bureau, should pay close attention to the rain situation, especially the changes in the rising water of the Yangtze River, Jialing River, and Wujiang River, analyze and judge in advance, issue early warnings, strengthen inspection and duty, resolutely and decisively evacuate and transfer the people in the threatened areas, mobilize emergency rescue teams and materials in a timely manner, quickly and efficiently handle the disaster (risk) situation, and avoid mass deaths and injuries.
Zheng Thi Xin, Minister Counselor of the Vietnamese Embassy in Laos, representatives of the Vietnamese Buddhist Association in Laos, the Lao Vietnamese Association, the provincial government of Vientiane, the Lao Veterans Association, and other representatives attended the ceremony.
The memorial ceremony for the heroes and martyrs was held in a solemn atmosphere, and the delegates offered incense to the heroes and martyrs one after another to remember their great achievements and the special solidarity between Vietnam and Laos.
Minister Counselor Zheng Thi Xin said in his speech that this is an opportunity for the Vietnamese and Lao people to jointly remember the revolutionary heroes and martyrs of the two countries and express their gratitude to the heroes and martyrs who died for the independence and freedom of the two countries, and it is also a good opportunity for the two peoples to recall that the two countries worked side by side to fight the common enemy, strive for national independence, national reunification, jointly build national development, and consolidate bilateral relations.
Seventy-four years ago, on January 23, 1946, 28 soldiers of the Lao - Vietnam Combat Alliance died heroically while attacking the Phonehe stronghold.

Liu Yunlong, an Old Face of Spy Drama, Plays a Stumbling Actor - Xinhuanet
Produced by Liu Yunlong, directed by Yin Fei, and starring Liu Yunlong, Su Qing, Liang Guanhua, and Li Liqun, the large - scale spy drama "The Chance of Winning" landed at Guangdong Satellite TV's "Vibrant Theatre" at 7:30 p.m. on July 16.
The play tells the story of Tang Fei (Liu Yunlong), an underground member of the Communist Party of China who lurks in a Japanese pseudo - police station, who, together with Soviet agents, assassinated the leader of the Japanese agents and crushed the Japanese army's startling plot.
The Chance of Winning is based on historical facts, and the material is taken from the dusty Soviet military archives.
During the defense of Moscow, the Soviet Red Army's Far East elite advanced westward to help, and at this time, the "northward advance faction" of the Japanese Kwantung Army thought it was an opportunity to take advantage of the situation and intended to send troops.
The Chinese Communist Party and the intelligence agents of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union jointly implemented the "Mudanullah" plan to solve the danger of being defeated by the enemy.
According to this historical background, Deng Yuan, a well - known screenwriter, has been polished several times, which makes the plot twists and turns burn the brain.
Liu Yunlong served as both producer and leading actor in "The Chance of Winning".
In the play, he plays Tang Fei, the head of the criminal section of the Linhe Police Department, a stuttering policeman who feels happy and even a little ruffian, while his real identity is that of an underground member of the Communist Party of China.
Cai Meng, the heroine who plays opposite her, is the head of the Linhe Security Bureau, and is appreciated by her Japanese boss, Fukuhara, and has a delicate relationship with Tang Fei that is both enemy and friend, and ambiguous.
Su Qing has tried many different types of roles in recent years, from Lu Ruowen in "We Are Young in Those Years" to Erqing in "Yanxi Raiders", all of which impressed the audience and were recognized for their acting skills.
This time, Su Qing and Liu Yunlong were paired for the first time, and the setting of a stuttering sheriff paired with a charming policewoman was interesting and innovative.
In addition to the two main characters, Liang Guanhua, Li Liqun, Qian Bo, Lei Han, Shen Junyi, and many other powerful actors joined in "The Chance of Winning", and the old play "Bone Racing" is also one of the highlights of the play.
It is understood that "The Chance of Winning" is also very well produced, with the cast and crew shooting nearly 2,000 kilometers across Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Liaoning provinces.
In order to restore the strange urban features of the Northeast during the Japanese period, the production team worked day and night to carefully polish every detail of the scene construction and props, so that the scenes in the play were exquisite and rich in historical texture.

Combining the classic Hollywood sports film story mode with the strong cooperation of professional teams from China and Thailand, "Jedi Strike" not only presents an international effect, but will also impress different types of audiences.

The price of the shares to be transferred shall not be lower than the higher of the following: the arithmetic average of the daily weighted average price for the 30 trading days preceding the indicative announcement date (July 27, 2020); and the audited net asset value per share of the company for the most recent fiscal year.
At present, the new strategic investors in Greenfield are still inconclusive, and according to the information published in the announcement, the new strategic investors need to pay about 14 billion yuan to take the 17.5% equity transferred in the mixed reform of Greenfield.
It is worth noting that after the completion of the share transfer, it is expected that Greenfield will still have no controlling shareholder or actual controller, but the control structure may change significantly.
Since its establishment, Greenfield Holdings has carried out many institutional reforms: from 1992 to 1997, it operated in accordance with market - oriented rules under a purely state - owned system; from 1997 to 2013, it established and continuously improved the shareholding system of state - owned holding and employee - owned shares; from 2013 to 2015, it introduced strategic investors to form a mixed ownership system of cross - shareholding and mutual integration of state - owned and non - public capital; and from 2015 to the present, it has been listed as a public company.
Greenfield's current mixed reform plan is similar to that of Gree, and in December 2019, Zhuhai Mingjun, led by Gaolin Capital, took over 15% equity of Gree Electric Appliance (000651. SZ) for 41.662 billion yuan, and Gree Group retired as a minority shareholder, and after completing the mixed reform, Gree Electric Appliance implemented modern enterprise management methods such as executive incentive plan and no real controller structure.
Both Shanghai Real Estate and Shanghai City Investment are state - owned enterprise groups wholly owned by the State - owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) of Shanghai, and Zhang Yuliang, chairman and president of Greenfield Holdings, said that Greenfield's move is an important measure for Shanghai to promote the comprehensive reform of state - owned assets and state - owned enterprises and accelerate the reform of state - owned assets and state - owned enterprises in the new stage in accordance with the requirements of the CPC Central Committee, which fully demonstrates the new idea of reform tailored to local conditions, and by introducing new outstanding strategic shareholders to listed companies, it supports enterprises to further improve the degree of marketization, enhance the freedom of management, and accelerate the full release of reform vitality.

White House Adviser "Bites" States to Resume Work Prematurely - chinanews.com
White House adviser "bites back" at states for resuming work too early
On July 23 local time, the number of confirmed new coronavirus cases in the United States exceeded 4 million, accounting for 30% of global cases.
For months, US President Donald Trump has repeatedly asked states across the country to resume work and school, but only recently did he change his attitude and take the initiative to wear masks in public, and his advisers have "bitten back" that some state governments are resuming work too early.
On the 22nd, White House presidential adviser Kellyanne Conway said at a press conference that some state governments failed to comply with the resumption of work standards and reopened bars and other places prematurely.
Conway also mentioned that the previous claim that the president has "absolute power" to decide on the resumption of work in the states was a false rumor.
"The president is a federalist, and he believes that all states have autonomy."
She defended Trump.
However, the "rumor" in Conway's mouth was uttered by Trump at the White House briefing on the outbreak on April 13.
This self - punching operation was mocked by netizens as "rewriting history".
Kellyanne Conway wants to rewrite history, she is a liar.
Trump called Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer a dictator because she followed medical guidelines and insisted on work stoppages.
Trump wants to push for the resumption of work so that he can hold rallies.
This is not the first time Kellyanne Conway has caused controversy.
On April 15, in an interview with Fox News, Conway blurted out, "This is COVID-19, not COVID-1, friends!"
She seemed to understand "19" as a version number, and was frantically teased by netizens: Look at the newspaper without common sense!
Is it reasonable for a 3 - year - old child to sue the university after being smashed playing in the college playground?
2020-07-26 05:01:11 Source: Legal Daily Author: Wang Sishuo Responsible Editor: Wang Sishuo
The playground was smashed, and the child was compensated before suing the school
This is not the case, but it is the case that this is the case.
Three - year - old Xiao Wen was playing in a college playground when he was accidentally hit in the head by Chen Mou of the softball team while pitching.
After Chen compensated, Xiao Wen's father, Mr. Wen, as Xiao Wen's legal representative, sued the school to the court, demanding an apology from the school where the playground was located, as well as payment of medical expenses and compensation for emotional damage totaling 20,000 yuan.
Recently, after hearing the case, the Haidian District People's Court of Beijing held that the school had set up a protective net in the playground at the time of the incident, that it had fulfilled its proper safety and security obligations, and that Chen had made compensation, and dismissed the plaintiff's claim accordingly.
Mr. Wen claimed that during the summer vacation of 2019, he took Xiao Wen to play in the school playground while the softball team was training in the playground.
In order to avoid this risk, Xiao Wen, Mr. Wen, and many other children and parents moved in the safe area designated by the softball team.
However, Chen Mou, a member of the softball team, lost his hand while pitching, causing the softball to fly over the net into the above - mentioned safe area and hit Xiao Wen in the back of the head.
Mr. Wen immediately took Xiao Wen to the hospital for treatment and was diagnosed with head trauma.
Mr. Wen believed that the facilities of the school stadium did not meet the relevant safety regulations, and that the team and related facilities were not effectively managed.
The school's negligence led to the above - mentioned incident, which caused Xiao Wen great physical and mental pain, as well as great pain to his family, for which the school should bear legal responsibility.
In this regard, the school argued that the school had set up a protective net in the playground and posted management regulations and training notices, informing them that entering the playground must maintain a safe distance from the training ground and reminding them to pay attention to their own safety, and that the plaintiffs could not prove that the school "failed to fulfill its safety and security obligations", so they did not agree to compensation.
After the trial, the court held that the site of the incident was a site open to the public free of charge by the university involved, and that although the school had safety and security obligations for the management of the playground, such safety and security obligations only needed to meet the general duty of care.
At the time of the incident, the school had set up a protective net in the playground, and had fulfilled its proper safety and security obligations, and Chen also compensated Xiao Wen for medical expenses, transportation expenses, and other losses of more than 2,000 yuan in accordance with the compensation agreement previously reached, and the two parties agreed to resolve the dispute at one time.
Afterwards, Xiao Wen's parents once again claimed compensation from the school, but there was no legal basis, and the court dismissed all of the plaintiffs' claims.
After the verdict, neither party appealed, and the verdict is now in effect.
According to Article 37 of China's Tort Liability Law, schools, as managers of public places, bear the obligation of safety and security; if the actions of a third party cause damage to others, the third party bears the liability of tort, while the managers of public places who fail to fulfill the obligation of safety and security shall bear the corresponding supplementary liability.
The judge said that since, as the manager of a public place, he is most likely to understand the actual situation of the whole place, foresee possible dangers and damage, and thus is most likely to take necessary measures to prevent the occurrence of losses or mitigate the extent of damage, and that the cost of avoiding and mitigating the occurrence of damage is the lowest, the law stipulates that he shall bear the corresponding guarantee obligations for engaging in social activities.
In this case, the safety and security obligations of the school should be compatible with the social activities of non - specific entrants in the playground, which is open to the public free of charge, and specifically, the school should take basic safety measures and have the obligation to inform about hidden dangers.
In judicial practice, it is not appropriate to impose excessive safety and security obligations on managers of public places.
If the school has set up a protective net and fulfilled its obligation to inform, it can be determined that the school is not at fault and should not bear legal responsibility.
In addition, for third - party infringement, even if managers of public places such as schools fail to fulfill their safety and security obligations, their liability is a supplement to compensation for damages, and according to the newly promulgated Civil Code, managers can also recover compensation from third parties after assuming supplementary liability.
Therefore, in such accidents, the victims should not expand the scope of their claims after they have received compensation from the direct infringer.
With epidemic prevention and control normalized, people's enthusiasm for exercise and fitness is high.
With the gradual liberalization of inter - provincial tourism business, the tourism market is about to usher in a recovery.
Fujian Province resumed inter - provincial tourism business on July 21, and on the first weekend after opening, Xiamen, a popular tourist destination, saw a peak passenger flow.
As a popular tourist destination city, many tourists arrive in Xiamen on weekends.
Xiamen Railway Station is expected to send 3.7 million passengers during the summer transportation, while the airport's passenger flow is dominated by students, tourists, and family visits.
The tourism market has gradually picked up, and in July, Xiamen Airport operated an average of 440 flights per day, and domestic flights have returned to 80% of pre - epidemic levels.
Airlines have encrypted air express lines from Xiamen to Shanghai, Beijing, Kunming, Xi'an, and other major cities to seize the recovering tourism market.
At present, a number of travel agencies in Xiamen have launched a number of domestic inter - provincial tourism products in the summer, and the group trips mainly focus on outdoor attractions.
In view of the peak summer passenger traffic at railway stations and airports, the relevant units have deployed additional personnel to guide people in check - in counters, security channels, and other areas where people are easy to gather, and Fujian has also optimized and upgraded the "Eight Fujian Health Code" to realize health data sharing and mutual recognition with 31 provinces, and to promote the orderly recovery of the tourism market.
Can Andy Lau and Liu Qingyun "dismantle" a new spark - Xinhuanet
Bomb Disposal Expert 2 was recently announced to be released on December 24, making it the first film scheduled for the New Year's Eve season.
The second film is still directed by Qiu Litao, produced and starring Andy Lau, and opens with a brand new story.
It is reported that the addition of the "nuclear bomb" element in the second film has also made the challenge faced by bomb disposal experts even more difficult, and several glimpses in the preview have made the scene quite shocking, such as the mushroom cloud of the big explosion and the airport engulfed by fire.
Three years ago, "The Bomb Disposal Expert", produced by the original cast, won the top five box office awards that year, and won seven nominations at the Hong Kong Film Awards, and Yau Lai Tao and Andy Lau also became the gold medal partner in the eyes of the audience.
This time, "Bomb Disposal Expert 2" also raises the prospect of a new spark between the ace duo.
Bomb Disposal Expert 2 tells a new story: Pan Zhifeng (Andy Lau), a former bomb disposal expert, fainted at the scene of the bombing and was listed as a suspect by the police.
In order to find the truth, he has to ask his friend Dong Zhuowen (Liu Qingyun), who is also a bomb disposal expert, for help.
Pang Ling (Ni Ni), a female inspector who is eager to solve the case and is also Pan's ex - girlfriend, is also involved.
He is still a bomb disposal expert, but the complexity of Andy Lau's new role can be felt in the preview: he broke a leg, put on a prosthetic limb, and was pursued by Liu Qingyun, who is also a bomb disposal expert, while being directed by his ex - girlfriend Ni Ni.
What is the relationship between the three, what Andy Lau did at the Xiangdao Hotel, what kind of cases he was involved in, and what ups and downs his career as a bomb disposal expert has gone through, all kinds of mysteries make people curious.
It is understood that the highlight of the film is the world landmark buildings in Hong Kong, which, together with the top - notch special effects production team, bring a shocking and realistic visual impact.

chinanews.com, Chongqing, July 26 (Reporter Liu Xian) The Chongqing Development and Reform Commission announced on July 26 that the city has so far withdrawn 4,404 fishermen, accounting for 42.54% of all fishermen involved.
This year, 53 - year - old Li Daiguo said in an interview with a reporter from China News Service that his grandfather had been fishing in the Longxi River, and that he had been fishing with his father since he was 11 years old, rocking a small boat, along the Longxi River, up to Liangping, Chongqing, and down to Longevity, and that every time he left his home for 10 days and a half months, he relied on fishing to support his family.
However, since 1997, as the rural population has gradually poured into the town, there have been more and more residents in the town, resulting in more and more serious environmental pollution.
Paper mills, chemical plants, and farms have been built along the Longxi River, which also pollutes the river.
By 2007 and 2008, the Longxi River had become a stinking ditch.
"The fish scales caught are all black, and when cut open, they are also black inside."
Li Daiguo said that fishing is becoming more and more difficult after the river is polluted.
The local government has begun to make great efforts to control the pollution of the Longxi River, including clearing the river, patrolling the river, and managing aquatic resources.
Li Daiguo also retired from fishing and converted to production, and became a member of the river patrol team to manage aquatic resources.
From January 1, 2020, Chongqing Aquatic Biological Reserve and the relevant waters of the main urban areas have implemented a total ban on fishing.
According to the Chongqing Development and Reform Commission, up to now, Chongqing has withdrawn a total of 3,403 fishing boats and signed a withdrawal agreement for 4,643 fishing boats, accounting for 63.3% and 86.3% of the total three - year task, respectively.
4,404 fishermen have been withdrawn, accounting for 42.54% of all fishermen involved.
Of the 4,404 people who have retired, 4,267 have achieved employment, accounting for 96.89% of the fishermen who have retired.
Pension insurance covers 2,691 people, accounting for 61.10% of retired fishermen.
In the next step, Chongqing will carry out in - depth special rectification actions, accelerate the clean - up and rectification of the shoreline utilization projects of the main stream of the Yangtze River, complete a new round of survey of sewage outlets entering the Yangtze River and carry out corresponding rectification actions, basically complete the rectification task of "three phosphorus" (referring to phosphate rock, phosphorus chemical industry, and phosphogypsum reservoirs), clean - up and rectification of small hydropower, promote the special action of afforestation and greening on both sides of the Yangtze River, strengthen the construction of green mines, consolidate the achievements of the special rectification of illegal wharves and illegal sand mining on the main stream of the Yangtze River, and further promote the prohibition and withdrawal of fishing in the Yangtze River basin.
Israel strengthens prevention and control of repeated outbreaks - chinanews.com

Israel strengthens prevention and control of repeated outbreaks
At the beginning of the new coronavirus outbreak, Israel's prevention and control measures were effective.
However, with the gradual lifting of prevention and control measures, the number of confirmed new coronavirus cases in Israel has increased significantly recently, and the Israeli government has repeatedly taken emergency measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic.
On February 28, the first case of the new coronavirus was confirmed in Israel itself, and Israel quickly adopted measures such as closing all entry and exit ports, suspending non - essential industries, switching schools to online classes, restricting public transportation and non - essential social activities, sealing off cities severely affected by the epidemic, and jointly maintaining prevention and control measures by military police.
This series of measures quickly achieved positive results, and by mid - May, the number of confirmed new coronavirus cases in a single day in Israel had fallen to single digits.
With the epidemic under control and all prevention and control measures in Israel fully unsealed, the number of new confirmed cases of COVID-19 has gradually rebounded since June.
Especially since the beginning of July, the spread of the epidemic has been accelerating.
In recent days, the number of new daily cases in Israel has been above 1,500 for eight days, and by the time of writing on July 25, the number of new cases on that day had reached 916.
As of July 25, there have been 59,745 confirmed cases and 448 deaths in Israel.
Faced with the rapid rebound of the epidemic, the Israeli government has repeatedly taken emergency measures to strengthen prevention and control of the epidemic.
On July 6, after the number of confirmed cases exceeded 30,000, the Israeli government closed gyms, swimming pools, bars, nightclubs, and other public entertainment venues, and at the same time introduced a policy to restrict public transportation, stipulating that the maximum number of passengers per bus should not exceed 20.
On the 17th, the Israeli government announced a series of new restrictions, including the implementation of the "city closure" on weekends, and stipulated that the "city closure" would be implemented from 17:00 on Fridays to 5:00 on Sundays.
During this period, people can go out, but places such as shops, shopping malls, barbershops, beauty salons, libraries, zoos, museums, exhibition halls, swimming pools, and tourist attractions will be closed, while basic service places such as supermarkets and pharmacies will remain open.
At the same time, gatherings of more than 10 people will be prohibited on all dates and time periods, gyms, studios, and other places will be closed, restaurants and cafes will not be allowed to eat, and only takeaway services will be allowed.
At the same time, the Israeli people did not pay enough attention to the seriousness of the epidemic and failed to join forces with the government in the fight against the epidemic.
After repeated outbreaks in Israel, many people took to the streets to protest and march because the government's prevention and control measures affected their economic interests.
On July 11, tens of thousands of people demonstrated in Tel Aviv, arguing that anti - epidemic policies affect the economy.
On the evening of the 21st, thousands of protesters gathered in front of Prime Minister Netanyahu's official residence in Jerusalem to protest against Prime Minister Netanyahu's ban on restaurants, cafes, and other prevention and control measures without corresponding compensation.
In addition, many people did not abide by the rules of wearing masks and maintaining a safe social distance of two meters when outdoors, and to avoid being fined by the police for not wearing masks, many people only wore masks on their chins or hung them on their wrists.
During the epidemic, the school was the hardest hit area for the spread of the new coronavirus, and according to a recent visit by a reporter to the kindergarten here, the teachers and students of the kindergarten did not wear masks as required by the government, nor did they maintain a safe social distance of two meters from each other, laying hidden dangers for a large number of teachers and students to be infected with the virus.
Professor Eli Waxman, a member of the expert advisory group on the fight against the epidemic of the National Security Council of Israel, believes that Israel is moving towards a "dangerous situation", and points out that the current epidemic prevention and control measures taken by Israel are not enough, and that all leisure and entertainment venues and summer schools should be closed to control the further spread of the epidemic.
Waxman said that Israel lacks a master plan to fight the epidemic, and that the Knesset and various government departments should abandon their respective interests as soon as possible, reach an agreement on the issue of fighting the epidemic, and formulate clear steps including relevant restrictions in different departments.
Tel Aviv, July 25: Wang Jiong, our correspondent in Tel Aviv
Wu Fengfang, a farmer in Guyuan, Ningxia, was embarrassed by his old companion Dai Tianfu, and the two drove from their home 20 miles away to the Liangyun Cultural Compound.
Despite the inconvenience of his legs and feet over the past two years, 77 - year - old Dai Tianfu still expects to "come here at intervals and get addicted to tricks".
This is an unremarkable courtyard in Yuanzhou District, Guyuan City, and unlike ordinary farmyards, melodious Qin cavities are often heard in the courtyard, as well as brilliant shadow puppets, embroidery works, traditional Qin cavities, and eyebrow and Hu dramas.
The owner of the compound, Liang Yun, was a carpenter.
More than 10 years ago, he loved shadow puppets and singing, and began planning the construction of a cultural compound.
With the Liangyun Cultural Compound, the cultural life of the villagers has become rich and colorful.
The reporter had not yet entered the Liangyun Cultural Compound, and the tunes of the Qin cavity had already been transmitted.
Peri Lixiang, a villager from a neighboring village, is singing excerpts from the Qin cavity for the villagers.
She loved the Qin cavity since she was a child, and now she is well - known in the area, and whenever she has free time, she will come to the Cultural Compound to perform programs for the villagers.
Recently, Peri Lixiang also played a live webcast.
Peri Lixiang said, "It is a very happy thing to have a stage for more people to see their performance."
On the stage, the singers looked at each other and the players played one tune at a time, and although they were amateurs, their enthusiasm remained undiminished.
Just like the rustic style of the farmyard, in addition to the Qin cavity, the "grassroots" art and intangible heritage culture of the Liangyun Cultural Complex come to the fore.
The compound also has a collection of more than 300 agricultural utensils of different ages, traditional and handmade tile sculptures, paper - cutting, embroidery, shadow puppets, and other objects.
Liang Yun led the reporter into the exhibition hall in the courtyard, where he displayed his collection of old objects, such as old wine jugs, three strings, and spinning wheels.
Why did an ordinary farmer build a cultural compound?
"Shadow puppetry is my family craft, and I have been learning this craft since I was 15 years old."
Established in 2012, the Liangyun Cultural Compound has become the first rural "intangible cultural heritage exhibition hall" in Ningxia, and is also a demonstration compound for the protection of intangible cultural heritage in Guyuan City.
In addition to the Liangyun Cultural Compound, more than 120 cultural compounds and 79 folk performance groups have sprung up in Yuanzhou District of Guyuan City, including more than 50 cultural compounds of a certain size, such as the Shen Jiahe Cultural Compound, the Wang Yonghong Cultural Compound, and the Yang Lang Cultural Compound, covering towns and streets in Yuanzhou District, with more than 5,000 participants.
These grassroots entertainers are active in the fields, enriching the cultural life of the masses and meeting their spiritual needs.
"As life gets better and better, traditional culture cannot be left behind in this way."
"Liu's Spy Drama" Returns "The Chance of Winning" to See Liu Yunlong and Li Liqun's Opponents "Drama" - Xinhuanet
The 40 - episode spy drama "The Chance of Winning" will land on Beijing Satellite TV from July 16.
"The Chance of Winning" is based on real historical facts and is based on the Soviet military archives, which have been dusty for many years and have been published for the first time.
Actor Liu Yunlong, known to the audience for his "spy drama", broke through his image in the play and challenged a "stuttering agent" who was quite happy.
In recent years, the popularity of dramas such as "The Pretender," "The Mask," and "The Kite" has proved that spy dramas have exuberant vitality.
Unlike previous spy works, "The Chance of Winning" looks around the world and extends the story's setting to the Soviet Far East.
It is set in the final stages of the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression in 1944, and tells the story of Tang Fei (Liu Yunlong), a secret intelligence worker of the Communist Party of China, who, under the leadership of the secretary of the Linhe Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Underground Party and the director of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Service, carried out the "Mudanulla" strategic operation of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Service.
In many spy dramas, the male protagonist, as a senior spy, appears as a perfect image of handsome, high IQ, and maturity.
However, in Liu Yunlong's view, such a person is not suitable to be a spy, "A spy should be the kind of person who can't be found in a pile of people, and if you appear to be very handsome, I would like everyone to pay attention to you, and can you still lurk?" There is a line in "Kite", 'If you don't come to arrest me, I forget that I am a Kuomintang', and spies should be de - elitist. "
So in "The Chance of Winning", Liu Yunlong ingeniously designed his protagonist, Tang Fei, as a "stuttering agent" with a sense of joy.
The other camp in "The Chance of Winning" is supported by Japanese Fukuhara, played by Liang Guanhua, and Fang Shibao, the director of the National Police Agency, played by Li Liqun.
Two powerful actors, one from the south and one from the north, add a lot of skill to the whole play.
Director Yin Fei used the term "drag drama" to describe the play between Li Liqun and Liu Yunlong, "It's definitely a drag drama, and the two of them have a very tacit understanding, and this tacit understanding in them is very impactful to me. Many times their plays are'hanging ', for example, we only wrote half a page in length, and when I don't stop filming, they can continue to perform."
When the actors are in the role and ensure the state of their characters, they can not only shape the characters from the perspective of the characters, but also bring more viewing possibilities to the audience, and Yin Fei said that such a play is brilliant enough.
Many familiar faces from "Liu's Spy Drama" can also be seen in the play, and "Mountain City F4", which is famous and majestic in "Kite", has also gathered three people in "The Chance of Winning".
Hou Yu and Liu Mingyang, who played Song Xiaoan and Zhao Jianzhi, reprise their roles as Tang Fei's right - hand man.
Director Yin Fei said, "There is no inferiority in these two people, they just drift with the current in that era and environment."
Liu Yunlong also offered, "We should have a human touch, which means that the people around me must be both good and bad, and that the bad people are the enemy, but we should also develop them, and our team should also grow."
The ending of these two people in the play was also carefully designed by Liu Yunlong, who believed that he would deliver a satisfactory answer to the audience.

Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, July 25 - Xu Zhengyu, Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, said that Hong Kong's financial market remains active and orderly.
He expressed optimism about Hong Kong's financial stability and economy.
Xu Zhengyu said at a webinar jointly organized by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Toronto and the Hong Kong - Canada Chamber of Commerce (Canadian Federation) on the 24th (Toronto time) that Hong Kong is experiencing a difficult situation because of the "law storm" and the new coronavirus outbreak.
The exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar is stable and favors the strong exchange guarantee level.
There are no obvious signs of capital outflow from the banking system; on the contrary, more than $11 billion has flowed in since June.
The total amount of bank deposits has also continued to increase in the past few months, and there have been a series of public offering fund - raising activities in the stock market, and market transactions have repeatedly increased.
Xu Zhengyu said that the new coronavirus outbreak has put pressure on the global economy and financial markets, but Hong Kong's basic advantages remain unchanged.
Hong Kong's many advantages, including geography, the rule of law, high - speed communication, free circulation of information and capital, and a simple and low tax system, have made Hong Kong a leading international financial center.
Xu Zhengyu pointed out that the SAR Government has set aside HK $6 billion in the "Epidemic Prevention and Anti - Epidemic Fund" to create about 30,000 time - bound jobs in the public and private sectors in the next two years, covering people with different skills and academic qualifications.
To support the development of fintech, the SAR Government has also launched the "Thousand Talents Program" to support local fintech companies, start - ups, and other enterprises with fintech - related businesses to create 1,000 new jobs, hire local talents, and enrich Hong Kong's fintech talent pool.
Looking ahead, Xu Zhengyu expressed optimism about Hong Kong's financial stability and economy.
He encouraged Canadian enterprises to make good use of Hong Kong's advantages and its position as an international financial center, an international asset and wealth management center, and a global offshore RMB business hub to develop and invest in the Guangdong - Hong Kong - Macao Greater Bay Area and nearby areas.
The Lancet article praises China's anti - epidemic efforts and encourages countries to learn from their experiences - chinanews.com
The Lancet magazine published an article on the 25th stating that China, as a country with a population of 1.4 billion and a size similar to that of Europe or the United States, has effectively controlled the new coronavirus outbreak at this stage, without widespread transmission, and has largely controlled the domestic epidemic.
According to the article, over the past decade or so, China has invested heavily in domestic research and public health construction, which has made China much more prepared for the new coronavirus than it was for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).
The authors say that when SARS broke out in 2002, China was initially ill - prepared, especially because the pathogen could not be determined.
When the new coronavirus was discovered in December 2019, Chinese scientists were quickly able to identify the virus species and shared the genome sequencing data with the international community on January 11, 2020.
By the end of January, doctors from mainland China and Hong Kong had clarified the clinical characteristics of the virus and warned the world about the threat of the new coronavirus through research papers published in The Lancet.
China has also been at the forefront of vaccine research, and under the state of emergency declared, such research was carried out very quickly and rigorously through close domestic cooperation, and the results of the early trials of the new coronavirus vaccine developed by China were published in The Lancet in May and July respectively.
China's experience shows that it is very important to invest in national health and research systems to effectively improve laboratory capacity.
This is the basis for rapid and effective national responses to health emergencies and global health security.
Other countries, especially low - and middle - income countries, are worth learning from.
In addition, China's experience has proved that on the basis of strong research, it is necessary for powerful high - level officials to decisively make correct decisions based on scientific basis, so that the new coronavirus outbreak can be effectively controlled.
The article emphasizes that governments and their leaders must respect science, understand its value, and take action against it in a way that is most beneficial to society.
At the beginning of the outbreak, China's National Health and Construction Commission sent three groups of infectious disease experts to Wuhan to investigate the risk and spread of the new coronavirus, and their suggestions provided the basis for the decision to "seal the city" in Wuhan on January 23; when some experts suggested the necessity and urgency of building a cabin hospital, the government quickly made the decision and quickly implemented it; at the same time, the extensive participation of the community and the masses also enabled the epidemic to be controlled quickly and effectively.
Finally, the article emphasizes that to deal with global health emergencies, countries need to strengthen global cooperation and jointly respond to them.

Director Dapeng's "Good luck" shortlisted for Golden Goblet Award - Xinhuanet
On July 18, the 23rd Shanghai International Film Festival announced the official list of films selected for the Golden Goblet Award.
The first realistic film directed by Dapeng, "Good luck", was shortlisted for the Golden Goblet Award at the Shanghai Film Festival, and the film officially released its first poster.
Photo of the poster
The film "Good luck" is director Dapeng's first realistic - themed work, and it is also his second bond with the Golden Goblet Award.
The film tells the story of a comedy film director who, on a whim, returned to his hometown in rural Northeast China, hoping to make a literary film about his family's New Year, only to encounter a series of accidents.
The family members, who had gathered for the film, completed the final party.
In the movie poster released today, one of the family members, "Uncle Three" Wang Jiang, sits in the center of the picture smoking a cigarette, with the black land of Northeast China covered in silver in the background, and the red lantern that Chinese people must hang during the Chinese New Year holidays in the foreground.
The red lantern, which symbolizes festive and reunion, is in great contrast to the lonely figure of Wang Jiang, and seems to reveal the complexity and tangle of this big family relationship.
It is reported that in the film, except for the daughter of "Uncle Three" Wang Jiang, who is played by actor Liu Lu, the rest of the scenes are done by the real director's family, and the film's experimental audio - visual style breaks the boundary between drama and reality, bringing the audience a new immersive viewing experience.
According to director Dapeng, the creation of "Good luck" originated from "a providence", and a series of sudden family changes during filming forced the original shooting plan to be changed, and life without a script was eventually recorded as a film, but it released tension beyond the design.
How does director Dapeng face this "providence", and how should he continue to meet the changes brought about by this providence?
There is no doubt that "Good luck" is experimental, and the almost all - vegetarian lineup and innovative audio - visual style turn the life in front of the camera into a film, and wrapped in real images, the audience will also find the shadow of themselves and their families in the family presented in the film, and as the family party in the film comes to an end, it evokes a series of thoughts.

At the Barong Zhuokang sentry post, platoon commander Yu Wang and a soldier stood guard on duty.
In this place, where the average annual temperature is minus 10 degrees, a simple row of barracks stands on a mountain pass, and not far from the barracks, a national flag flutters in the wind, and soldiers stand guard in the wind every day, while regularly patrolling higher elevations.
The soldiers had to use both hands and feet to climb the steep slope of the rock pile.
It was late July, when flowers and plants flourished in low - altitude areas, and in Barong Zhuokang, only the gully behind the barracks had a relatively dense green color.
Gao Peng, a soldier who has been stationed at the outpost for six years, pointed to the ravine and said that it was their back garden, and that only in July and August could the grass grow slowly, and that soon after, it turned yellow and was covered with snow.
It can take about 9 hours to patrol on foot.
In the harsh plateau environment, the soldiers stationed here are accompanied by snow - capped mountains and glaciers all year round, and they also patrol higher mountain passes on a regular basis.
A few days ago, a patrol of eight soldiers, led by instructor Liang Yixin, once again took to the patrol road.
Each soldier carried about 30 pounds and headed for the target point early in the morning.
On the way, a soldier stood up, and his comrades in arms rushed to rescue him.
In addition to patrol duties, the soldiers at the Barong Zhuokang sentry post conduct tactical and physical training every day.
As the minutes ticked by, the altitude was rising, the oxygen content was getting lower and lower, and the physical strength was constantly overdrawn, these factors tested the will of the patrol team members.
They clenched their teeth and insisted, crossing several landslides and dangerous beaches one after another.
At about 16:00, it was lunch time for the patrol team members, who took out their own dry food and sat on the spot at an altitude of more than 5,700 meters, accompanied by sleet and snow, to replenish their strength with food.
The soldiers at the Barong Zhuokang sentry post conducted tactical and physical training.
During the break, they will play cards together, and the losers will do push - ups, which can be both entertaining and physical.
After a short rest in the cold wind, they climbed up to the target point of the patrol, took out the national flag on the mountain pass, and solemnly took an oath.
Behind them are snow - capped mountains, and in front of them are tens of kilometers of no man's land, and they are the safest guardians of the country.
Beijing consumption season restarts - Xinhuanet
Beijing restarted the activities of the Beijing consumption season in accordance with the principle of "comprehensive restart, key planning, orderly promotion, and strict organization".
On July 26, 1.5 million government and enterprise vouchers were issued, including 1 million offline catering vouchers and 500,000 smart product vouchers, which consumers can collect on the JD.com APP.
Liu Meiying, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Commerce, said at a media briefing held on the 25th that the restarted consumption season will further reduce the allocation of capital by enterprises on the basis of maintaining the existing preferential subsidies for vouchers and card packages.
From early August, the current 1: 1 allocation between the government and enterprises will be adjusted to 2: 1, for example, if consumers receive a card package and spend it in the store, they will enjoy a discount of 120 yuan, of which the government will subsidize 60 yuan and the enterprise will make 60 yuan; after the adjustment, the government will subsidize 80 yuan and the enterprise will make 40 yuan.
During the consumption season, the three major operators will subsidize traffic and terminals around 5G consumption to further promote new 5G infrastructure and new 5G consumption in Beijing.

The SAR Government once again calls on owners of all sizes to reduce rents and share difficulties with retailers, restaurants, and small and medium - sized enterprises.
Chen Maobo published an article entitled "The Rugged Road to Recovery" on the Internet on the same day.
He said that the number of confirmed cases of new coronavirus pneumonia in Hong Kong has been high recently, and the situation is severe, which has affected people's livelihood and troubled the economy.
When the epidemic is repeated, the first priority is to strictly prevent imported cases, and to deal with and interrupt the virus transmission chain as quickly as possible; when the epidemic is under control, economic activities should be resumed in a timely and corresponding manner.
He pointed out that in the face of the new wave of the epidemic, business exchanges and economic activities, which had shown signs of recovery, have also been hit.
In addition to the spirit of the contract, social responsibility is equally important to the business community, especially those groups that have received large government subsidies under the Employment Protection Scheme.
He mentioned that the economic situation in Hong Kong was still very severe in the second quarter of this year, but the trend of contraction seemed to slow down slightly.
In terms of exports, he believes that the external situation in Hong Kong is still severe.
Chen Maobo said that the development of Hong Kong over the past few decades shows that every crisis hides new opportunities, and every difficulty hides the key to future development.

"Chinese Doctor" Pays Tribute to Anti - Epidemic Heroes - Xinhuanet
Recently, with the respect of Chinese filmmakers fighting the epidemic, Yu Dong, the chairman of Bona Film Group, and Liu Weiqiang, the director (pictured left), had a discussion and exchange with academician Zhong Nanshan in Guangzhou on the filming and production of the anti - epidemic film "The Chinese Doctor".
Through "The Chinese Doctor", Bona Pictures hopes to pay tribute to all medical and epidemic prevention workers who are fighting in the front line of epidemic prevention and control!
In 2021, the film will be released nationwide as a tribute film to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China.
At present, under the arrangement and deployment of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Film Administration, and with the support of the Guangdong Provincial Film Bureau and the Hubei Provincial Film Bureau, Bona Pictures has organized the original cast of the film "Captain China" to prepare the film "The Chinese Doctor", which reflects the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the unity of the people of the whole country to fight the new coronavirus outbreak.
Focusing on the front line of the fight against the epidemic in Wuhan, the film will take the medical staff of Wuhan and the medical teams of provinces and cities in Hubei as the background, and from the perspective of human nature, the film will use a unique narrative, as well as an impactful lens language, to show the moving stories of the Chinese medical staff who are full of dedication and sacrifice in the front line of the fight against the epidemic.
It is understood that as soon as Wuhan was unsealed, Bona overcame many difficulties and sent a team of photographers to go deep into the front line of the epidemic to meet hundreds of medical workers face - to - face to understand and collect information, and so far has interviewed academician Zhong Nanshan himself, the first person from Guangzhou to help Wuhan, the Guangdong medical team to help Hubei, as well as white - clad angels at the forefront of the anti - epidemic front, such as Wuhan Jintan Hospital, Wuhan Union Hospital, Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital, and Wuhan Central Hospital, and captured a large number of precious first - hand video materials.
Academician Zhong Nanshan also raised expectations and hopes for the filming of the film during the symposium: "I look forward to it, and I hope that you will not only visit some experts who have made a lot of appearances, but also interview more medical staff who are working hard on the front line, and they are the majority."
He said that he had seen "Me and My Motherland" and "Captain China" before, and thought it was a good way to tell the story of the big pattern from the perspective of ordinary people.
"Now some foreign friends still have some misunderstandings about China," he said.
When talking about the spread of the film, academician Zhong Nanshan said that at present, some people in foreign countries like to label the virus as politicized, and he hoped that the film would impress the audience from the perspective of human nature: "In addition to being shown in China, this film should also be shown abroad, and should impress the audience with true humanistic spirit in a way that both domestic and foreign audiences can understand."
Academician Zhong Nanshan also fondly recalled the film "Man to Middle Age" from the 1980s, "After so many years, I was most impressed by the film" Man to Middle Age "after the reform and opening up, and at that time, my foreign doctor friends all watched and cried, and if" The Chinese Doctor "could play such a role, it would be great."
Academician Zhong Nanshan said that if "The Chinese Doctor" can resonate with foreign audiences, it will be very successful.
During the discussion and exchange, academician Zhong Nanshan also shared his opinions and suggestions on the current international epidemic prevention and control, "I believe that people will always be smarter than viruses."
Academician Zhong Nanshan said that although the virus is difficult to predict, human beings have weathered thousands of difficulties and dangers since primitive society, and that today's modern society has developed medical technology and social management measures, coupled with the fact that medical staff and even ordinary people all over the world have a basic understanding of the scientific response to the new coronavirus outbreak, people will no longer be as passive as before, "Next, we should pay attention to two aspects of work, one is to study how the world can strengthen cooperation, and the other is to pay attention to soothing people's hearts".

Cultural Tourism "Red Fruit" Gathers in Shaoshan - The First Red Fair in Xiangtan - Today's News - Hunan Daily Online - Huasheng Online
Hunan Daily New Hunan Client Reporter Jiang Rui Correspondent Xiao Yan
Jiaxing Red Boat Mold, Shaoshan Bronze Statue of Mao Zedong, Yan'an Fabric Flower Crafts, Yongshun Bacon in Western Hunan... On July 25, the 2020 Hunan Red Tourism and Culture Festival opened in Shaoshan.
As one of the main activities, the first Red Cultural Industry Expo in Xiangtan was held at the Shaoshan Tourism Consulting and Distribution Center.
The exhibition area is full of red cultural and creative products, as well as local products from the old revolutionary areas, attracting tourists from all over the world to buy them.
"This Red Expo is not only a display of the achievements of the national red culture industry, but also an important platform for exhibitors and enterprises to exchange experiences and discuss development paths."
According to the relevant person in charge of the Executive Committee of the First Red Fair in Xiangtan, with the theme of "Promoting Red Culture and Boosting the Rise of Cultural Tourism", the total exhibition area of the fair is nearly 3,000 square meters, and an atmosphere - building area, an exhibition area for scenic spots, and an online shopping experience area for Red Cultural Tourism were set up.
137 enterprises and units from eight other provinces, including Jiaxing in Zhejiang Province, Zunyi in Guizhou Province, and Yan'an in Shaanxi Province, as well as Changsha, Zhuzhou, Yueyang, Chenzhou and other places in our province, were invited to participate in the exhibition, exhibiting a total of 768 kinds of exhibits, including red cultural relics, handicrafts, food specialties, tourist routes, red training courses, and red cultural and creative products.
The exhibition and sales area will be on display until July 29.
As the host of the Red Expo, the Xiangtan exhibition area is full of highlights.
According to the person in charge of the exhibition area, the Xiangtan exhibition area is divided into two parts: the red industry and the development of the red cultural industry.
The Red Industry Exhibition Area displays 31 exhibits from 6 enterprises, including Valin Xianggang, Valin Cable, and Xiangdian Power, and the Red Cultural Industry Development Exhibition Area displays nearly 200 products from 27 units, including the Red Series of Books, the Red Series of Food, and the Red Series of Cultural and Creative Products.

The total number of confirmed new coronavirus cases in Japan exceeds 30,000 - Xinhuanet
According to statistics, there were 239 new confirmed cases in Tokyo on the 26th, with more than 200 new cases in a single day for six consecutive days, and a total of 11,214 cases.
In addition, 141 new confirmed cases were reported in Osaka Prefecture, 90 in Fukuoka Prefecture, and 80 in Aichi Prefecture.
The crime of telecom network fraud rose by 70% in the first half of the year - chinanews.com
chinanews.com, July 26 According to the website of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, in the first half of this year, procuratorates across the country prosecuted 58,101 people for fraud crimes, an increase of 35% year - on - year.
Especially among the crimes against epidemic prevention and control, fraud crimes are frequent, and the number of fraud crimes prosecuted by the procuratorate accounts for 43.4% of the total number of crimes against epidemic prevention and control.
The Supreme People's Procuratorate has carried out targeted guidance, and of the ten typical cases related to epidemic prevention and control that have been released so far, a total of 9 cases have involved fraud.
Judging from the handling of cases by the procuratorate in the first half of the year, there are a wide range of crimes involving fraud, ranging from national macro - policies to people's clothing, food, shelter, and travel, including epidemic - related fraud, "medical care" fraud, "health care products" fraud, "enrollment intermediary" fraud, "routine loan" fraud, fraud to obtain state subsidies, fraud to unfreeze national assets, and so on, and they continue to "innovate", covering education, medical care, employment, old - age care, social security, land acquisition and demolition, precision poverty alleviation, financial credit, and other fields, which not only cause economic losses to victims, but also seriously affect economic and social development.
In particular, some telecom network frauds break through national boundaries, geographical boundaries, and personnel restrictions, and have the characteristics of stakeholder, cross - border, remote, and electronic payment, with a large number of non - specific victims and great harm.
For example, some have set up special companies, rented high - end office buildings, set up multiple departments or positions, used legal online platforms to promote and recruit, trained and assessed recruiters, and adopted enterprise operation mode management, which is more confusing under the guise of "legality".
It is incumbent on the procuratorate to punish and prevent crimes in accordance with the law, and to issue early warnings to the public and relevant departments in a timely manner.
In handling judicial cases, the procuratorial organs conscientiously perform their duties, not only maintain a high - pressure situation against fraud crimes, but also refine various law enforcement measures in a targeted manner, and promote social governance through the production and issuance of procuratorial suggestions.
The procuratorial organs strictly control the facts, evidence, procedures, and application of the law in the approval of arrest and prosecution of fraud cases, and take the facts as the basis and the law as the yardstick to ensure that they are not wronged.
Especially for the crime of telecom network fraud, attention should be paid to the central role of electronic data in the determination of facts, and efforts should be made to build a chain of evidence in which electronic data, verbal evidence, and documentary evidence corroborate each other.
For example, in the case of epidemic - related fraud handled by the Yinzhou District Procuratorate of Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province, the procuratorate immediately intervened in advance, and it took only 5 days from the occurrence of the case to its completion, reflecting the attitude and determination to handle the case quickly and strictly and maintain the overall stability of society.
In the process of reviewing arrests and reviewing prosecutions, attention was paid to the prosecution of missing offenders in cases, and 733 people were missed by the public security organs, and 1,113 accomplices were missed by the public security organs.
In the first half of the year, procuratorial organs across the country issued 298 procuratorial suggestions for fraud crimes, promoting joint efforts to prevent fraud crimes and promote in - depth governance.
For example, the Guangzhou Municipal Procuratorate and the Dongguan Municipal Procuratorate of Guangdong Province put forward procuratorial suggestions in a timely manner in view of the loopholes found in the supervision of telecommunications networks by communication enterprises, banks, and intermediary organizations in handling cases, and urged relevant units to strengthen supervision, improve mechanisms, and boost long - term system construction.
Fourth, we should make every effort to recover stolen goods and repair damage.
Local procuratorial organs seize important links such as intervention in investigation, guidance in obtaining evidence, examination and prosecution, urge the investigation organs to actively recover the stolen money, cooperate with relevant departments to do a good job in recovering the stolen money, and strive to minimize the economic losses caused by the crime of fraud to the people.
For example, in the case of Lin's routine loan handled by the Beijing Municipal Procuratorate, the case involved 22 real estate units waiting to be sealed up, and when the real estate might be disposed of first by other cases, the Beijing Municipal Procuratorate initiated the production and issuance of a "Letter of Suspension of Execution", which was delivered to the relevant court in a timely manner, and suggested that the previously sealed - up court suspend the execution of the real estate involved, and deal with it uniformly after the facts of the crime were found out, so as to make the greatest efforts to recover the real estate involved and recover the victims' losses.
The prosecutor reminded everyone to be very vigilant against the crime of fraud, not to expect "pie in the sky", not to be gullible if you think it is cheap, and to keep your "money bag" well.

In the scorching heat, a reporter from Economic Daily - China Economic Network walked into Zhonghai Village, Yina Town, Weining County, Guizhou Province.
Under the blazing sun, Li Yuanzhong, a villager, weeded in the base, and although his face was red, he hummed a few ditties in his mouth from time to time.
Weining County, where Yina Town is located, has a certain popularity in the surrounding areas because of its low latitude, high altitude, sufficient light, large temperature difference between day and night, high sugar content and good taste, but also because of its small size and many spots, it has not been able to sell at a good price and has not been able to form an industrial scale.
Yina Town was once a poor township with "Baogu polenta in spring and autumn", and 10 years ago, the local poverty incidence rate was as high as 25.8%.
As the fight against poverty enters a critical period of decisive victory, it is urgent to change traditional planting habits, adjust industrial structure, and increase farmers' income.
After many visits, Chen Chao, the party secretary of Yina Town, and a group of people in the town believed that industrial development could no longer follow the old path.
To this end, Yina Town has introduced leading enterprises to grow apples in a modern way.
Hou Jianwen, deputy general manager of Weining Beyond Agriculture Co., Ltd., came to Yina Town from Shaanxi Province in 2015 for research, and immediately noticed the local planting conditions, and began planting apple trees there in 2016.
At first, the village mobilized Li Yuanzhong to transfer the land to plant apple trees, and Li Yuanzhong and his wife muttered in their hearts, "After planting apples for so many years, they haven't seen anyone in the village grow apples and make money."
"The apples grown are dwarf apples, which will not make the apple tree grow too tall."
To Li Yuanzhong's surprise, a new method was adopted for apple planting, in which irrigation pipes were laid under each apple tree, and water and fertilizer were poured into the roots, and when the fruit was harvested in autumn, the tractor drove directly into the orchard and could pick the fruit while standing.
At present, the Apple base has gradually entered a period of high yield, and as Hou Jianwen expected, Apple is not worried about selling, and is loved by consumers in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and other cities.
The growing apple industry has brought new changes to Li Yuanzhong's life, and although he is still farming, he has a new source of income.
Li Yuanzhong's family has transferred more than 9 acres of land to the Apple Base, and every year, in addition to the guaranteed land transfer fee, there is also a profit dividend after hanging fruit, and the couple usually work in the base, "one person can get 80 yuan a day, and work all year round".
Li Yuanzhong told reporters that last year's profit dividend was more than 2,800 yuan, and with the addition of land transfer fees and the couple's income from working, the family earned more than 80,000 yuan, "I don't worry about food and clothing, and I'm already living a well - off life".
"At present, the annual output value of one acre of apples is more than 15,000 yuan, which is about 10 times that of corn."
Chen Chao told reporters that at present, 20,000 mu of apples have been planted in Yina Town, and 6,000 mu in Zhonghai Village alone, covering 4,056 farmers and 17,200 people, including 656 poor households and 2,952 people with slotting cards, and paying more than 6 million yuan in wages a year, which has truly realized that the base is built at the doorstep and that there is no need to go out to work.
Li Yuanzhong, whose pockets were bulging, also began to realize his "wish".
During the Lunar New Year this year, Li Yuanzhong bought an off - road vehicle and now drives his car to and from work every day, "There are still more than 10 acres of land at home, and when the Apple base expands in the next step, all of it will be transferred to them, and the income will be even more."

Membrane Separation Technology Helps Solve the "Greenhouse Effect" - chinanews.com
Membrane Separation Technology Helps Solve the "Greenhouse Effect"
Schematic diagram of a new hybrid matrix membrane preparation technology
Our reporter Shang Rui reported: Recently, the atmospheric environment and bioenergy team of Tianjin University has made significant progress in "membrane separation to capture carbon dioxide", and has successfully developed a new hybrid matrix membrane preparation technology to greatly improve the carbon dioxide capture performance of membrane materials.
The results have been published as the cover article of the international journal Greenhouse Gases: Science and Technology.
The "greenhouse effect" is a major environmental problem plaguing human development, and carbon dioxide emissions are responsible for the "greenhouse effect".
How to efficiently capture and utilize the carbon dioxide emitted by humans is the focus of scientists' attention.
"Membrane Separation" is an emerging carbon dioxide capture technology, which separates carbon dioxide gas with the help of membrane materials, and has the characteristics of high efficiency, energy saving, and simple operation.
How to make the membrane material "breathe deeply" and improve the efficiency of gas separation is the bottleneck and difficulty in capturing carbon dioxide by membrane separation.
The research team of Tianjin University innovated and explored the influence of different solvents on membrane gas separation performance through repeated experiments.
The experimental results show that with N - methylpyrrolidone as the preparation solvent, the carbon nanotubes in the membrane material are more evenly distributed and "more breathable", which effectively improves the gas separation efficiency and rate of the membrane material.
The carbon dioxide separation performance of mixed matrix membranes prepared with this new technology is close to the theoretical upper limit of such membrane materials at present.
"The new technology provides a new idea for the capture of carbon dioxide by membrane separation."
Li Run, a member of the atmospheric environment and bioenergy team at Tianjin University, said, "We hope that this technology will provide strong support for coal - fired power plants and chemical enterprises to treat flue gas in the future, and will play a significant role in controlling greenhouse gas emissions and other fields."
Understand what is a professional grade difference before filling in a volunteer - chinanews.com

Understand what is a professional grade difference before filling in a volunteer
Every year, students or parents fill in the college entrance examination volunteers because they do not understand the nouns involved in the volunteer filling, which in turn affects the volunteer filling.
This year, five universities - Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing University of Science and Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing Forestry University, and Beijing University of Chemical Technology - jointly issued their 2020 enrollment policies to eliminate professional grade differences.
What is the meaning of professional grade difference, and what is its significance in volunteer filling?
There are three ways to assign professional rules
Experts reminded that before filling in a volunteer, we must read the Admissions Charter of our favorite school in detail, and understand the admission rules of colleges and universities, including the transfer ratio, professional allocation rules, and so on.
The rules for the assignment of majors refer to the three main ways for the admission of majors after the transfer of colleges and universities, namely, the priority of majors, the priority of scores, and the difference in the grade of majors.
The specific method to be used by colleges and universities will be clarified in the Admissions Charter.
However, the admission principle of some colleges and universities is that the overall score is preferred, and there is no grade difference between majors.
This means that candidates within the scope of admission will be queued up according to the total score, and when the score does not reach the first professional volunteer admission cut - off, it will be determined whether they have reached the second professional volunteer admission cut - off, and so on until they are admitted to the last professional volunteer, and there will be no grade difference between the professional volunteers.
The so - called "professional grade difference" means that when colleges and universities arrange candidates' majors, they determine the admission majors of volunteer candidates in different majors according to one or more scores published in the enrollment charter, and this score is called "professional grade difference".
That is, the difference in scores between first - major volunteers and non - first - major volunteers, and the difference in scores between volunteers in each major, such as 3 points, 2 points, 1 point, etc.
For example.
Suppose the student Xiaoming applied for the A university and scored 560 points, and his professional volunteers were computer science, international trade, automation, mechanical engineering, and e - commerce, and the A university's professional admission was based on the method of professional grade difference, which was divided into 2 points, 1 point, 1 point, and 0 points.
When assigning majors, if Xiaoming's first major volunteer meets the professional admission requirements and the major has a planned balance, then Xiaoming will be admitted to the "computer" major; if the computer is not admitted, his score will be subtracted by 2 points, and his score will be ranked with the first major volunteer applicants for the "international trade" examination according to the score of 558 points to determine whether he meets the professional admission conditions; if it is still not met, the score will be subtracted by 1 point (i.e. 557 points) for the "automated" admission of the third major volunteer; if it is still not met, the score will be subtracted by 1 point (i.e. 556 points) for the admission of the fourth major, and if the subsequent major still does not meet its professional volunteer, the score will not be subtracted, and so on.
Different universities have different levels of majors
With the popularization of parallel volunteering, many colleges and universities have now eliminated professional grade differences, but some colleges and universities still retain this method this year, and judging from the Admissions Charter published by each university, more than 20 universities have set professional grade differences this year.
For example, Sichuan Agricultural University, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Heilongjiang University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Jiangxi Normal University, Chengdu Medical College, Northeast Electric Power University, Jimei University, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing University of Technology, Ningxia University, Shandong University of Technology, China Civil Aviation Flight Academy, etc.
Among these colleges and universities, each university has a different level of majors.
Some colleges and universities have grade differences in each major, such as Ningxia University, where candidates whose files have been submitted to the university are admitted by one point in descending order according to the order in which the candidates fill in their professional volunteers.
Some universities, on the other hand, have set different professional grade differences between different majors.
For example, at Jimei University, the total grade difference between professional volunteers is 4 points, that is, the grade difference between first professional volunteers and other professional volunteers is 3 points, and there is no grade difference between other professional volunteers, which is considered to be parallel volunteers, and the grade difference between other professional volunteers and transfer professional volunteers is 1 point.
When filling in a volunteer, candidates and their parents must carefully read the admission policy of the school to see if there is a major grade difference and what the form of the grade difference is, and while fully considering the scores, they should also rationally analyze the schools and majors to be selected, and if colleges and universities clearly adopt the grade difference method for admission in the enrollment charter, candidates should pay attention to the gradient between majors when choosing majors to improve the chances of admission.

"Editor: Chen Haifeng"
Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, July 25 - Edward Yau, Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, said on July 25 that all APEC member economies should act in unison to fight the epidemic and promote economic recovery, and should avoid the establishment of unnecessary trade barriers in accordance with the rights and obligations set by the World Trade Organization.
Edward Yau made the remarks while participating in a video conference of trade ministers to fight the new coronavirus outbreak held by the Asia - Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) on the 25th.
During the meeting, the participating ministers exchanged views on the substantive measures that APEC can take to cope with the impact of the new coronavirus outbreak and promote economic recovery in the region.
Edward Yau said that the public health and economic crisis triggered by the epidemic has had an unprecedented and far - reaching impact on society and the economy.
"We are in a double battle, and we must overcome the epidemic before we can recover the economy.
We need to have a clear goal, the virus is our common enemy, and only by working together can we win, and vice versa, we will only lose. "
Edward Yau said that the series of trade restrictions triggered by the new coronavirus outbreak did not help to control the epidemic.
Trade is the key solution to the current problem, and should not be regarded as the problem.
He condemned all discriminatory and divisive policies and measures, and urged all economies to keep their borders open, maintain the smooth operation of supply chains, and avoid erecting trade barriers or adopting irrational trade policies at this critical moment.

People in Chengdu gather to watch US consulate police stop people from "looking too happy"
In response to the US closing the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, China announced the closure of the US Consulate General in Chengdu on Friday.
On Saturday, the badge of the U.S. Consulate was removed, and on Sunday, a dark - glass car left the Consulate amid boos from passers - by.
On Sunday, many people from Chengdu gathered in front of the US Consulate to take photos, and those who had not been there were also driven by curiosity about current affairs.
A reporter from the AFP Chengdu Station also visited the US Consulate in Chengdu and sent back news that there was a steady stream of curious people, and that many parents brought their children for a walk to see the Consulate, take photos of the building, or take selfies.
The consulate was surrounded by guards, and the police "corrected" people's behavior from time to time, and they did not seem to allow any outrageous behavior: a woman was stopped as soon as she was ready to sing a red song, and a guard confiscated a banner.
However, residents of a nearby residential building successfully pulled up a giant Chinese flag on their balcony and shouted slogans in support of China.
The U.S. Consulate in Chengdu opened in 1985 and covers all U.S. consular - related affairs in southwestern China, especially in the Tibet Autonomous Region.
A reporter from the Chengdu station of the AFP news agency said that the Chinese government's response to the United States was relatively restrained: many Chinese people asked the government to close the U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong online, but officials only said, "The closure of the U.S. Consulate in Chengdu is a necessary and legal response to the unreasonable behavior of the United States".
In addition to Chengdu, the United States currently has consulates in Guangdong, Shanghai, Shenyang, Wuhan, and Hong Kong.
Large - scale financial media action "Walking the Village Live and Watching Poverty Alleviation" - Today's News - Hunan Daily Online - Huasheng Online
Hunan Daily, New Hunan Client, July 25 (our reporter) On July 25, the large - scale financial media action "Walking the Village Live and Watching Poverty Alleviation", hosted by the Financial Program Center of the Central Radio and Television Station, set off from Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province, and two caravans carrying the 5G new media mobile cloud production and broadcasting system slowly drove out of the scene under the watchful eye of the guests.
General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out that "2020 is a milestone year, and we will build a moderately prosperous society in all respects and achieve the first centenary goal, and 2020 will also be a decisive year in the fight against poverty".
The large - scale financial media action "Walking the Village Live and Watching Poverty Alleviation" is an important measure of the Financial Program Center of the Central Radio and Television Station to promote the fight against poverty in line with this major theme.
The campaign will go into poverty - stricken villages in more than 20 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government, excavate vivid poverty - stricken stories, directly attack the great changes in the appearance of villages, and show how villagers can break through the predicament of survival and development and become rich.
The operation will last for more than three months.
From Xuzhou, the reporter took the southwest route through Anhui, Hubei, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangxi, Guizhou, Sichuan, Chongqing, Yunnan, Tibet, and other places, and the northwest route through Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Hebei, and other places, covering more than 10,000 kilometers.
In terms of reporting form, "Walking the Village Live and Watching Poverty Alleviation" is boldly integrated.
The economic development of the villages visited by the caravan will be broadcast through the Central Radio and Television Station's CCTV Financial Channel, the Central Radio and Television Station's Economic Voice, China Traffic Radio, and CCTV Financial New Media.
Among them, the live TV broadcast will be mainly completed in the midday news program "World Finance" of CCTV Financial Channel (premiere time: Monday to Sunday 12:00 - 13:00), and the prime - time news program "Economic Information Network" of CCTV Financial Channel will open a poverty alleviation report column (premiere time: Monday to Sunday 20:30 - 21:30).
At the same time, each village visited by the caravan will be broadcast live on the CCTV financial client for up to one hour, and viewers can watch the live broadcast and participate in the raffle by downloading the CCTV financial APP.
In terms of technology application and studio design, "Walking the Village Live and Watching Poverty Alleviation" has the courage to break through and pioneered the "Outfield New Media Caravan".
The vehicle is equipped with a 5G new media mobile cloud production and broadcasting system, and uses 5G + 4K / 8K + AI technology to realize the organic combination of online and offline, large and small screens, and TV broadcasting.
The broadcast area is converted from a container, with a length of 12 meters, a width of 2.55 meters, and a height of 3.98 meters, and the box body adopts a hydraulic automatic expansion structure, which can be turned up to 120 degrees.
The broadcast area can also be expanded automatically and is connected to an external expansion platform, covering an area of more than 50 square meters, which can meet the scene requirements of most programs.
At present, Dongchuan District of Kunming is already scorching in the summer, and what is hotter than the weather is the poverty alleviation workshop next to the relocation settlement.
Lv Ling, an employee of Kunming Asford Electronic Technology Company, said, "Now, as soon as you leave your home, you enter the factory and make money to take care of your family, thanks to the free vocational skills training organized by the trade union."
Walking into the electronic components processing and poverty alleviation workshop in Tongdu Street, Dongchuan District, a busy picture came into view.
Lv Ling, who is in her 40s, is a single mother who takes care of her elderly parents while taking care of her children alone.
At her most difficult time, the Dongchuan District Federation of Trade Unions helped to come up with ideas to find a way to "help" her before and after running.
Since 2018, Lv Ling has enjoyed support policies such as housing, schooling, social security, and employment, as well as support payments issued by trade unions at all levels.
This year, her child has successfully graduated and is employed, and she herself has a job and income after participating in skills training, and was released from poverty at the end of April.
It is reported that the Dongchuan District General Organization's special skills training project to help combat poverty is part of the skills training work of the Yunnan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions.
In light of the characteristics of workers in difficulty in the relocation of poverty alleviation settlements in the district, the district has thoroughly investigated and understood training needs, identified training types, and plans to train a total of 450 electricians, welders, and noodle makers in the near future.
Recently, Li Yi, an employee of the Menglian County Branch of the Agricultural Bank of Yunnan, wrote a sincere letter of thanks to the County Federation of Trade Unions.
In her letter, she sincerely thanked the union for the golden autumn grant she received from August 2013 to January 2017 to help her complete her studies.
In 2004, Li Yi's father died in a car accident, and her mother was included in the file of workers in difficulty, and since then, she has enjoyed the care of the slotting card policy.
With the help of the local trade union, Li Yi successfully completed her studies.
Since 2016, 3,809 households have been rescued through institutional guarantees and precise assistance.
The success of the Lv Ling family and Li Yi is a microcosm of the work of the Yunnan trade union to promote the relief of workers in difficulty.
According to Duan Kaiyuan, a staff member of the Legal and Rights Protection Work Department of the Yunnan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the provincial government has strengthened the dynamic management of files of workers in difficulty, promoted the normalization of file - building work, and promptly included the support system for workers in difficulty who meet the conditions for file - building; broadened the application channels for workers in difficulty, and opened an online file - building service platform for workers in difficulty using WeChat to facilitate workers in difficulty to declare on their own initiative in a timely manner.
During the epidemic, it was difficult to go out to work, and in order to help workers in difficulty ease their living pressure, Yunnan Province arranged a total of more than 13 million yuan to send warm funds, and implemented special warm condolence activities for more than 6,000 workers in difficulty at the national level and more than 1,000 workers in difficulty at the provincial level in accordance with the national standard of 2,000 yuan per household and 1,500 yuan per household at the provincial level.
At the same time, the Provincial General Administration connects with various Internet recruitment platforms such as the Human Resources and Social Security Department and Zhilian Recruitment, pushes recruitment information to workers in difficulty, and provides employment consultation, employment guidance, and other services.
