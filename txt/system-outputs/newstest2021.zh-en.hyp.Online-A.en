Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 26th, issue: To make outstanding returning migrant workers into a rural revitalization force
Zhang Xiong, 34, who lives in an orchard village in Meishan, Sichuan Province, quit his job in 2010 to start a business on tens of thousands of dollars a month in Beijing.
After several years of hard work, now he operates a grape-growing family farm annual income of more than one million yuan, become a small well-known leader of wealth, but also selected into the village "two committees" team.
In recent years, under the inspiration of a series of policies to support farmers and benefit farmers, such as national poverty alleviation and rural revitalization, more and more outstanding migrant workers like Zhang Xiong have chosen to return home to start their own businesses, activating a pool of spring water in the countryside.
Sichuan, a large population province in western China and a large labor export province, has implemented the "Excellent Migrant Workers Back-to-Bring Training Project" because of snobbish guidance, and in 2019 alone, more than 8000 village party branch secretaries have been produced from the outstanding migrant workers who have been brought back, 61,000 village reserve forces have been cultivated, and more than 20,000 Party members have been developed to provide a strong guarantee for winning the battle against poverty and implementing the strategy of rural revitalization.
Well-off is not well-off, the key to see the fellow.
Since the reform and opening up, a large number of young and middle-aged workers in rural areas of our country have gone out to work to increase income, and some have set up their own enterprises through hard work.
But objectively also led to the rural "hollowing" to varying degrees, especially the weakening of rural grass-roots organizations, village party branch secretaries and party members have shown a "one old and one low" characteristics, that is, aging, low academic qualifications, the village party organization leader team is not strong, green and yellow do not answer the problem prominent.
If rural talent and other elements have been one-way flow to the city, the countryside has long been in the "blood loss" "anemia" state, revitalization is an empty word.
To attract those migrant workers who have the ability, awareness and ambition to serve their hometowns back, guide them to return home and start their own businesses to become leaders in getting rich, train them from the best to become party members, rural cadres, and enrich the cadres at the grass-roots level, which is the solution to the rural party members and grass-roots party organizations green and yellow.
Excellent migrant workers to attract back, but also let them stay, do a good job.
In recent years, Sichuan from the hard work of the peasant labor force to start, on the basis of strict candidate standards, the establishment of excellent migrant workers orientation, service guarantee, training, selection and use of the system mechanism, so that they have the ability to improve, work on the guarantee, life has hope, really take root in the countryside, officers have a sense of achievement in entrepreneurship.
This year is the year of the final battle to get rid of poverty, do a good job of fighting poverty and rural revitalization of the link, talent is the key factor.
Party committees and governments at all levels should attach great importance to the group of outstanding returning migrant workers, and through comprehensive measures, they will be turned into a surviving, fighting, unable to take away the task force, the army, for the rural poverty relief and well-off and development and revitalization to provide a strong organizational guarantee and talent support.

BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- On July 18, the famous St. Peter's and St. Paul's Cathedral, a treasure of religious history and architecture in Nantes, France, was badly damaged in a fire and the organ was completely destroyed, foreign media reported.

Comprehensive news: U.S. unilateralism undermines bilateral relations International public opinion supports China's reaction to the U.S.-China-Xinhua network
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- On the morning of July 24, the Chinese Foreign Ministry informed the U.S. Embassy in China that China had decided to revoke the license for the establishment and operation of the U.S. Consulate General in Chengdu and to make specific requests for the Consulate General to cease all operations and activities.
International public opinion holds that the unilateralist measures taken by the United States have caused serious problems in Sino-US relations, and that China's response to unreasonable provocations by the United States is legitimate and necessary.
Andres Borks, director of the Center for Chinese Studies at the Institute of International Studies at the University of Chile, said the unilateralist measures of the United States have damaged the bridge of understanding between the Chinese and American peoples and put relations between the two countries at risk.
China's notification of the U.S. closure of its consulate general in Chengdu is a counter-measure against unilateral U.S. measures and is in line with diplomatic practice.
Patricio Justo, a professor at the Catholic University of Argentina and director of the Center for Arab-Chinese Studies, said China's decision was a legitimate and necessary counter-measure against previous provocations by the United States and not aimed at ordinary Americans.
The U.S. is trying to divert attention from the U.S. by pressuring China to cover up its failure to respond to the new crown outbreak.
Bambang Surjono, chairman of the Center for Asian Innovation Studies, an Indonesian think-tank, said the provocative diplomatic stance by the United States has caused serious problems for U.S.-China relations, which face serious challenges.
China's notification of the closure of the U.S. Consulate General in Chengdu is a normal counter-measure, in line with diplomatic practice, and reflects both China's principled position of resolutely safeguarding its own interests and the reasonable and beneficial manner of China's diplomacy.
Tanzanian current affairs commentator Francis Semwenza said China's decision was a legitimate and necessary response to U.S. provocations.
If China-U.S. relations are to return to normal, the U.S. side should take the initiative to improve relations with China and stop interfering in China's internal affairs.
The United States should focus on how to achieve economic and political win-win results with China and how to benefit the two peoples and the international community as a whole.
Ali Yusuf, executive director of the Sudan-based Federation of Arab-Chinese Friendship Associations, said China's forced countermeasures were a legitimate and necessary response to U.S. unreasonable practices, in line with international law and the basic norms of international relations, and diplomatic practice.
The U.S. demanded the closure of the Chinese Consulate General in Houston in grave violation of international law and basic norms of international relations.
It is hoped that the U.S. side will reverse the previous decision and create the necessary conditions for the normal return of bilateral relations.
Singapore's Union Morning Post said in an editorial that the bigger U.S. strategic intention was to contain China and prevent its continued rise.
In the face of the U.S. push, China, while reluctant to see China-U.S. relations continue to deteriorate, has had to take counter-measures.

Poland will withdraw from the European Treaty on the Prevention of Violence against Women
Poland will take steps next week to withdraw from the European Treaty on the Prevention of Violence against Women, the country's justice ministry said Saturday.
Poland's right-wing government cabinet says the treaty, which requires schools to teach students about gender issues, tramples on the rights of parents.
Poland's justice minister, Joblo, told a news conference that his justice ministry would make a request to the Ministry of Labour and Family on Monday to begin withdrawing from the treaty.
That treaty is also known as the Istanbul Convention.
"The treaty contains elements of a morphological nature that we consider harmful," Gioblo said. ”
Poland's ruling Law and Justice Party and its coalition partners have close alliances with the Roman Catholic Church to promote a conservative social agenda.
Poland's President Jorda Duda has made homophobia one of the main issues during his successful re-election campaign this month.
On Friday, thousands of Poles, most of them women, protested against withdrawal from the convention in Warsaw and other cities.
"The purpose of withdrawing from the treaty is to legalize domestic violence," said Lempat, one of the organizers of the protest, at a protest march in Warsaw.
Some protesters held banners that read "Law and Justice is a woman's hell."
The Law and Justice Party has long complained about the Istanbul Convention.
Poland's previous centrist government ratified the convention in 2015.
The Law and Justice government says the treaty does not respect religion and requires liberal social policy to be taught in schools.
But so far the party has not decided to withdraw from the convention.

For the first time, the US has launched a countervailing investigation into China for "undervaluing the renminbi"
In response to the U.S. Department of Commerce recently announced that it has decided to launch anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations into china-origin tie (band) products, and to launch an investigation into the "undervaluation of the RMB exchange rate" project.

A new drug developed by the University of Australia is expected to be used to treat vascular blockages caused by new crowns - Xinhua
SYDNEY, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Researchers at Monash University in Australia are developing a new drug to help prevent heart disease and stroke, and hope it can be used to treat blood vessel blockages caused by the new coronavirus.
Researchers have found that an enzyme in platelets accelerates platelet coagulation before a heart attack or stroke.
They developed a drug that temporarily inhibits platelet clotting, avoiding blockages in blood vessels and preventing heart disease and stroke.
The researchers say the drug only inhibits platelet clotting when signs of heart disease or stroke appear.
Because studies have shown that similar vascular blockages are one of the leading causes of death in patients with new coronary severe illness, the researchers hope the drug could be used in the future for the treatment of such severe patients.
Currently, the drug has worked well in animal model experiments, and researchers are preparing for the next phase of human clinical trials.
The results of the study have been published in the American Journal of Science Translational Medicine.
He became the first spectator to enter the CBA league rematch after allowing spectators to watch live.
On the same day, in Qingdao, Shandong Province, the 2019-2020 season of the Chinese Men's Basketball Professional League (CBA) rematch of the second stage (Lushan District) competition, medical personnel, teachers, public security front personnel through the official ticket purchase platform, including nucleic acid testing, including the relevant process to enter the stadium to watch the Shanghai Long-Term Team against the Mountain East-West King team.
During the spectators, the spectators must wear masks throughout the race, take a seat on the number, and strictly maintain a one-meter interval to take a seat.

China News Agency, Xinjiang Hami, July 26th, issue: Xinjiang deep cultivation of "sunflower fields" with good clean energy
More than 6000 pentagonal fixed-day mirrors, each 48 square meters, a circle arranged neatly, such as a silver "sunflower field", with the sun turning, the sun reflects to the center more than 200 meters high heat-absorbing tower, to achieve power generation.
Reporter 25 in The town of Yiwu County, Xinjiang, the CLP project Hami melt salt tower-type photothermal power plant, see this scene.
"The so-called molten salt tower-type photothermal power generation is the reflection of sunlight through the mirror to the heat-absorbing tower to form heat, and then through traditional power generation technology to convert heat energy into electricity."
Zhang Yong, deputy general manager of CLP Hami Solar Thermal Power Co., Ltd., said the design principle is similar to the solar stove used in rural areas in northwest China, all of which gather sunlight.
Construction of the plant began in October 2017 and was connected to the grid at the end of last year, covering an area of 6,600 acres, with a total of 14,500 fixed-day mirrors planned for installation.
"The biggest advantage over conventional solar power is that it stores the gathered heat and generates electricity at night."
Zhang Yong said that the project is equipped with a 13-hour heat storage system, so that the generator set can maintain continuous and stable operation, not affected by light changes, but also according to the demand of the grid load peak and valley, can quickly participate in the peak of the grid.
When completed, the project will achieve an annual power generation capacity of 198 million degrees, saving more than 60,000 tons of standard coal per year, reducing emissions of sulfur dioxide by more than 60 tons, nitrogen oxides by more than 60 tons, soot about 20 tons, carbon dioxide more than 150,000 tons, to provide a continuous stream of clean energy.
In addition, there is another silver "sunflower field" in the Shicheng Zi PV Industrial Park in Hami City.
The Hamifer photovoltaic power station covers an area of more than 2,300 acres, and 714 power generation units have been built to follow the sun's rotation, always maintaining a 90-degree right angle between the sun's light and the surface of the concentrator.
"We use dual-axis tracking spotlight power generation technology, and with unified, integrated control, all power generation equipment adjusts its angle to the height of the sun to maintain power generation efficiency."
Duan Mengqi, director of the station, said that in good lighting weather conditions, the power generation technology than traditional photovoltaic power generation efficiency can be improved by about 20%.
In the first half of this year, the plant has generated more than 7 million degrees of electricity, supplementing local demand for electricity.
Shicheng Sub-Photovoltaic Industrial Park is currently the largest single-body in Xinjiang, the most complete type of photovoltaic modules, a photovoltaic industry demonstration park, a total of 38 PV projects, a total installed 820,000 kilowatts.
In the first half of this year, more than 110 million degrees of power generation was generated, an increase of 6% over the same period in 2019.
Hami is one of the best areas in China for solar energy resources.
The average annual total solar radiation is more than 6200 megajoules per square meter, with about 3,200 hours of sunshine per year.
In recent years, the city vigorously develop the photovoltaic industry, planting a good "sunflower field."
More than 2.5 million kilowatts of solar power have been installed, and the city's photovoltaic capacity exceeded 1.4 billion degrees in the first half of this year, an increase of about 14% year-on-year.
At present, Xinjiang grid-connected photovoltaic power station more than 330, installed capacity of more than 10 million kilowatts.
Photovoltaic power generation is expected to reach 15 billion degrees this year, replacing more than 6 million tons of standard coal.

U.S. media uncovered the truth about the U.S. side's unprovoked demand that China close its consulate general in Houston - ChinaNews.com

U.S. media have uncovered the truth about the U.S. side's unprovoked demand that China close its consulate general in Houston
On the 24th, the Chinese Foreign Ministry informed the U.S. Embassy in China that China had decided to revoke the license for the establishment and operation of the U.S. Consulate General in Chengdu and to make specific requests for the Consulate General to cease all operations and activities, as a counter-measure against the U.S. side's sudden request to china to close its Consulate General in Houston on the 21st.
The U.S. government's actions have attracted much attention, and its political motivations have been questioned by foreign media and scholars.
Why is the Chinese side asked to close the Consulate General?
Several foreign media said it was not clear why the United States would choose the Chinese consulate general in Houston, but for the purpose of the move, foreign media bluntly said: for the election.
CNN reported Wednesday that the U.S. move to ask China to close its consulate general in Houston has raised questions about its political motives.
The article said the U.S. government's disastrous response to the new crown outbreak has led to a sluggish pre-election poll ratings for President Donald Trump.
White House officials privately say the tough strategy against China is designed to save Mr. Trump's popularity and to shift the Blame for the Failure of the White House's response to the outbreak.
The article argues that the Chinese Consulate General in Houston was a "politically driven and very cautious" target chosen by the United States and chosen by the U.S. government "to create a tough stance while avoiding the risk of major conflicts."
The BBC also believes that Mr Trump sees a "political advantage" in playing the 'China card' at a time when the US election season is approaching and the US economy is being hit hard by the epidemic.
The current situation is "a spiralling, tit-for-tat struggle", driven in part by the US government's domestic considerations and only exacerbating tensions between the US and China.
CBS News reports that Mr. Trump's re-election prospects have been under pressure from the outbreak, which he has repeatedly blamed on China.
Almost daily, the United States has new actions against Mr. Trump's absurd claim that China is exploiting the United States.
"The Consulate General of Houston is very important in establishing ties between the two countries"
The Associated Press commented that U.S. demands for China to close its consulate in Houston have heightened tensions between the world's two largest economies.
In addition to diplomatic implications, Chinese citizens in the southern United States face difficulties in obtaining consular services, as do U.S. citizens seeking visas and other services.
A business group in Houston has expressed regret over U.S. demands for China to close its consulate general in Houston, saying it played an important role in establishing trade, investment and cultural ties between the two countries.
According to the Associated Press, this reflects the importance of China's economy.
According to foreign policy magazine's website, the move is "part of a series of provocative moves that will only worsen U.S.-China relations".
Jonathan Pollack, an East Asia expert at the Brookings Institution, a U.S. think tank, was quoted by Reuters as saying that since the U.S. and China established full diplomatic relations in 1979, he could not think of anything comparable to the U.S. action against the Chinese consulate general in Houston.
Hong Kong's South China Morning Post reported that the U.S. move is unprecedented in more than 40 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries.
Analysts believe the move could cause lasting damage.
Founded in 1979, the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is the first Chinese Consulate General to open in the United States.
Currently, China has an embassy and five consulates-general in the United States.

Urumqi City Health And Wellness Commission Director Zhang Wei 26, Said That Urumqi City Free Nucleic Acid Testing Work In Most Areas Have Been Basically CompleteD.
He also said that from the experience of other parts of the country, there are many factors affecting the results of nucleic acid testing, such as test reagent sensitivity, tested personnel's infection time and detox time, specimens when the sample material tested with the situation (poor fit may lead to the specimen is not in place) and testing environment, testing staff's operational proficiency.
For a variety of reasons, nucleic acid testing can also have false negative results.
The so-called false negative, that is, the testee is indeed infected, but the nucleic acid test results are negative.
In addition, two nucleic acid tests are usually required for people who have been in close contact with confirmed and suspected cases.
For people who have been to high-risk areas of the outbreak, if there is fever and respiratory symptoms, a nucleic acid test negative there is a false negative possibility, so it also requires two nucleic acid tests to be eliminated.

Representatives of the U.S.-China Trade Talks met in August
Hong Kong's South China Morning Post on the 25th quoted an anonymous person familiar with the matter as saying that Liu He, head of China's trade negotiation team, Vice Premier Liu He, and U.S. side co-leader and trade representative Lai Haizhe are expected to hold formal talks in August to assess the implementation of the first phase of the U.S.-China trade agreement.
The report says that while China has sharply increased its purchases of U.S. agricultural products in the past few months, the amount it has purchased is still some way from what was promised in the trade agreement because of factors such as the new coronavirus outbreak.
Analysts say the recent closure of each other's consulates by the United States and China, along with other disputes, could undermine any progress on trade.
The first phase of the U.S.-China trade agreement, which came into effect a month after it was signed on January 15, stipulates that a high-level trade framework group should meet semi-annually.
The meeting will be "an important turning point" for both sides to assess the progress of the agreement, according to people familiar with the matter.
But the person also said that if U.S.-China tensions lead to a low willingness to talk at this time, the two sides may agree that the May 8 conference call between Lai and Liu He has met the terms of the semi-annual meeting in the trade agreement.
Since the beginning of this year, China-U.S. relations have deteriorated rapidly, with disputes over the origin of the new virus, trade, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, the South China Sea and ideology.
U.S. President Donald Trump, who touted his achievements in the first phase of the agreement earlier this year, has recently changed his tune.
He said at a White House press conference on the 23rd, although China recently purchased a record amount of U.S. corn and bought a lot of soybeans, "but this trade agreement now means less to me than it did when it was reached."
An anonymous Beijing government adviser also said a new round of trade talks was unlikely because of poor U.S.-China relations, and that "trade issues have lost weight in China-U.S. relations."
But he revealed that China's economic and trade related units still met on the 23rd to discuss a series of issues, including how to increase imports from the United States, "we have tried to buy, so any additional procurement will be difficult."
Peng Jennings, vice president of the U.S.-China Trade Council, said it was "more important than ever" to maintain momentum for the first phase of the agreement, noting that China has made progress this year in further opening up its financial markets to U.S. companies.
"It's better to talk than not to talk, although it may just be routine, " says a Plenum analyst at The Independent Research Firm. ”

Yu Sheng, chief representative of nasdaq stock exchange China, said at the 2020 Listed Companies Leaders Summit, hosted by Snowball.
In April, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Public Company Accounting Regulatory Commission (PCAOB) issued a Statement on the Important Role of Audit Quality and Regulatory Access to Audit and Other International Information , a Discussion on the Current Information Access Challenges of U.S. Public Companies with Large Business in China.

In Mr Yu's view, the crisis has not affected investors' appetite.
"When the news first came out, everyone panicked and everyone was asking if they could go public in the U.S. in the future, but then we found out that these questions were not a problem for investors, and investors might ask them at a recent roadshow to U.S. IPOs, or even become standardized questions, but that wasn't seen by investors as an important factor in investing in or not investing in a Chinese company."
It is suggested that we should try to look at the present situation with a common heart.
This may seem like the worst of the past two years, of course, but in terms of investor appetite, it hasn't had any impact.
So the boom in IPOs in the U.S. will continue between now and the end of this year or the U.S. election. ”
On May 9 this year, Jinshanyun officially listed on NASDAQ, becoming the first Chinese company to go to the U.S. IPO after the outbreak.

According to Yu Sheng, the first half of this year to the U.S. IPO of Chinese companies of high quality, have strong fundamentals and growth of high-quality companies, will be more favored by investors.
In the short, medium and long term, Mr. Yu continues to be optimistic about the IPO of Ming Chinese companies to the United States.
"The short-term boom in IPOs in the U.S. continues; in the medium term, Chinese companies have more options, A-shares, Hong Kong-shares, U.S.-shares, and everyone will consider the U.S. election and China-U.S. relations as market choices and time options; in the long run, everything will return to normal, and market volatility will be cyclical, both political and economic, and eventually return to normal, and the stock market has always been volatile."
"There are a lot of uncertainties this year, but for high-quality companies, regardless of whether the market is good or bad, as long as they are solid and have growth that investors can see, other factors are relatively secondary, investors need to invest in excellent Chinese companies." ”

At present, the global epidemic and the world economic situation are still grim and complex, and the challenges facing China's development are unprecedented.
Maintaining strategic determination, enhancing confidence to win, and focusing on doing our own thing are key to our ability to meet the challenges of risk.
At a recent entrepreneurs' symposium, General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed that in the current external environment of rising protectionism, the global economic downturn and shrinking global markets, we must focus our efforts on doing our own thing, give full play to the advantages of the domestic super-large-scale market, gradually form a new development pattern with the domestic large-scale cycle as the main body, domestic and international dual-cycle mutual promotion, upgrade the level of industrial chain supply chain modernization, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation, accelerate the key core technology, and build new advantages for future development.
The power-checker is wise, and the power-maker wins.
Under the external environment of the deepening development of economic globalization, the "two-headedness" of market and resources plays an important role in china's rapid development.
Now, the world under the impact of the epidemic is undergoing profound changes, facing more uncertainties of instability, economic globalization encountered headwinds and back waves.
To prepare for the changes in the external environment for a long time, to promote China's economy to ride the wind and waves, steady and far away, a very important aspect is to expand and meet domestic demand as a strategic basis for development, give full play to their own advantages, through the prosperity of the domestic economy, smooth domestic circulation for China's economic development to add momentum, drive the world economic recovery.
We should deeply realize that building a complete domestic demand system is related to China's long-term development and long-term stability.
The CPC Central Committee reviewed the situation and clearly put forward the firm implementation of the strategy of expanding domestic demand, which is the need to deal with the impact of the epidemic, the need to maintain the long-term sustained and healthy development of China's economy, but also to meet the people's growing need for a better life.
The advantage of a large economy is that it is internally recyclable.
China has the world's most complete and largest industrial system, strong production capacity, perfect supporting capacity, with more than 100 million market subjects and more than 170 million highly educated or have all kinds of professional skills, as well as 1.4 billion people, including more than 400 million middle-income groups, the formation of a large-scale domestic demand market, is in a new industrialization, information technology, urbanization, agricultural modernization and rapid development stage, investment demand potential is huge.

We should firmly grasp the strategic basis of expanding domestic demand, so that production, distribution and circulation links rely more on the domestic market to achieve a virtuous circle, clear the strategic direction of supply-side structural reform, and promote the total supply and aggregate demand to achieve a higher level of dynamic balance.
We should speed up the construction of a complete domestic demand system, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation and other innovations, accelerate the promotion of digital economy, intelligent manufacturing, life health, new materials and other strategic emerging industries, form more new growth points, growth poles, and gradually form a domestic and international double cycle as the main body, domestic and international dual-cycle mutual promotion of the new development pattern.
Opening brings progress, and closure is bound to lag behind.
General Secretary Xi Jinping has repeatedly stressed that China's open doors will not close, but will only get bigger and bigger.
To the domestic cycle as the main body, is not closed to operate behind closed doors, but through the realization of domestic demand potential, so that the domestic market and the international market better connected, better use of the international and domestic two markets, two kinds of resources, to achieve stronger and more sustainable development.
At the same time, expanding domestic demand and expanding opening up is not contradictory, the smoother the domestic cycle, the more conducive to the construction of a new pattern of opening up, the more conducive to the formation of participation in international cooperation and competition of new advantages.
Although there is an uptick in international protectionism, we should stand on the right side of history, persist in deepening reform, expanding opening-up, strengthening open cooperation in science and technology, promoting the construction of an open world economy and building a community of human destiny.
The history of the Chinese nation has experienced many hardships, but has never been crushed, but more and more frustrated and brave, and constantly grow in the suffering, from the suffering.
On the way forward, with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core of the Party Central Committee's strong leadership, with the remarkable advantages of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, with strong mobilization capacity and strong comprehensive strength, with the unity of the whole Party and the people of all ethnic groups, we will certainly be able to overcome all difficulties and obstacles, maintain the sound momentum of economic and social development of our country, build a well-off society in an all-round way, and smoothly embark on a new journey of building a socialist modern country in an all-round way!

France increases military investment in space - Xinhua
France will add hundreds of millions of euros to its space defense budget and develop a space military force to guard against possible "unfriendly moves" by other countries in outer space, Defense Minister Florence Parry said Thursday.
Paley told Le Provence newspaper the same day that between 2019 and 2025, France's space military project spending budget will be increased from the previously proposed 3.6 billion euros (about $4.2 billion) to 4.3 billion euros ($5 billion).
Under the French Military Planning Act 2019-2025, approved by the French Parliament in 2018, France is expected to update existing observation and communications satellites, launch three electromagnetic listening satellites and modernize its space surveillance radar.
French President Emmanuel Macron announced last July that a space military command and "air and space forces" would be established within the French air force.
Paley said she would formally announce the creation of the space force when she visits a military academy in Salon, Provence, later.
Parry said the space force is part of the Air Force and will have 500 troops by 2025.
"The idea that space serves the common good of science is gone forever," she said. Today, space is a place where nations compete for global hegemony. ”
Paley reiterated Macron's previous statement that France had no intention of provoking an arms race.
"We are by no means engaged in an arms race. But it is my responsibility to fully recognize the threats we may face. ”
Paley revisited the surveillance of a military satellite shared by France and Italy in 2017.
She said it was a Russian satellite that was "sneaking".
Russia denies this.
Parry said France "will soon have" small patrol satellites capable of detecting and targeting "the underdops behind those unfriendly moves."
French media believe that France's quest for a space force stems from U.S. President Donald Trump's request last February for the U.S. Department of Defense to draft a bill to create a space force.
Trump signed the Defense Authorization Act in December, approving the creation of the space force, the sixth-largest U.S. military.
Some experts worry that the moves have accelerated the militarization of U.S. space and could trigger a new arms race in space.

Experts say collecting immigration data through the U.S. Census for allocation of House seats is unconstitutional
Civil rights groups and several U.S. cities and counties have sued the federal government, saying it would be unworkable and unconstitutional for the Trump Administration to try to exclude undocumented immigrants from the U.S. Census.
The U.S. Census will determine the allocation of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Sarah Brannon, executive attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, told VOA, "It's not going to work." ”
She went on to say that Mr. Trump's request to determine the citizenship of those who were surveyed in the census was difficult and "not very reliable." ”
Another civil liberties group, Common Cause, filed a lawsuit Thursday challenging Trump's executive order.
Several cities in New Jersey and Georgia joined the lawsuit.
Arlington County, Virginia, joined the lawsuit Friday.
"The U.S. Constitution requires an accurate inventory of our population every 10 years," said Garvey, chairman of the Arlington County Board of Management. We must accurately count everyone living in Arlington County and not allow this illegal attempt to scare away and reduce the number of our immigrant communities to succeed. ”
Others praised President Trump's executive order.
Alabama Attorney General Marshall called the executive order a "victory" for the state.
"The allocation of seats in the House of Representatives and the Electoral College in each state must be based on the number of residents living in the states and the number of residents who are legally resident," he said. ”
The U.S. Supreme Court last year blocked the Trump administration from including citizenship in the 2020 census.
President Trump signed an executive order earlier this week directing Ross, the U.S. Census Bureau's commerce secretary, to submit data on undocumented people from the census so that the administration can exclude them from state census numbers and determine whether each state is increasing or reducing or retaining house seats.
Every 10 years, the United States redistributes seats in the House of Representatives based on demographic changes.

In response to the trend, promote the construction of industrial projects - viewpoint headlines - Hunan Daily Network - Huasheng Online
In Hunan in the summer, the heat wave hit the surface.
And the province's industrial project construction to promote the scene of observation will release the enthusiasm, over the three-volt heat, "to industry than strength, to project hero" the distinctive guidance of the three Xiang four water.
Hunan's development, always rely on construction projects, training industry.
In the face of the highly unusual first half of the year, under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as its core, the whole province adhered to a game of chess, went all out to play a good fight against epidemic prevention and prevention, and took industrial projects as the "first hand chess" for the implementation of the "six stable" and "six guarantees".
From a year-on-year decline of 1.9% in GDP in the first quarter to a year-on-year increase of 1.3% in the first half of the year , it is self-evident that the difficulties and efforts of the period were enormous .
In this valuable report card, the construction of industrial projects is the key support for Hunan to accelerate economic recovery and develop stability.
It's smooth and irreversible.
Industrial project construction, to put into the overall situation, not only good at building momentum, building momentum, seeking momentum, but also good at understanding change, change, strain.
In the current international situation complex and severe background, in addition to hard work to attract investment, but also need to calm down to study the current new situation of new characteristics, more grasp the law, more scientific and accurate, better integrated into the domestic large cycle as the main body, domestic and international double cycle mutual promotion of the new development pattern.
Pay more attention to improving the basic ability of the industry.
In the first half of the year, our province not only has a large number of new industrial heavyweight investment projects to break ground, sow hope, but also the traditional advantages of industrial enterprises in digital, intelligent, green industrial transformation to accelerate the cloth point, fall like flying.
Yiyang Auscon Third Science Park project to the existing production line transformation, high-end printed circuit board intelligent production line to seize the opportunity; Hunan Zhongyan Changde cigarette factory new factory is committed to intelligent transformation, the construction of a modern factory process, but also "old trees sprouting new" vivid portrayal ... ... Focusing on the country's major strategy and "two new and one priority", we will focus on consolidating and upgrading the dominant industries, actively cultivate and develop emerging industries, and comprehensively increase the efforts of scientific and technological innovation and localization to replace them, so as to continuously consolidate the basic conditions and build up momentum for transformation.
Pay more attention to cultivating and developing new models of new economic patterns.
The sudden new crown epidemic has brought about the popularity of the "cloud economy", stimulated the potential of the digital economy, and provided new opportunities for industrial transformation: in the first half of the year, the manufacturing of computer and office equipment, electronic and communications equipment in our province grew by 12.6%, the online retail sales of wholesale and retail enterprises above the quota increased by 32.2% YoY, and the online meal expenses revenue of catering enterprises increased by 35.6% YoY.
In the crisis to educate new machines, in the change of the new situation, and actively promote digital industrialization, industrial digitalization, to guide the digital economy and real economic integration and development is the general trend.
Pay more attention to optimizing and stabilizing the supply chain of the industrial chain.
Construction machinery is the main force of Hunan industry, but two-thirds of the supporting enterprises outside the province, supporting the chain still has space and potential.
Strengthen the industrial chain thinking grasp project, not only have the head enterprise continue to accumulate, in the key link of the industrial chain to achieve technological breakthrough; It is also necessary to cultivate all over the place, to strengthen the chain to complement the chain extension chain to stimulate the "chain" lock reaction, promote the relevant supporting industries coordinated layout, accelerate the construction of independent control, safe and reliable industrial chain supply chain.
Crossing difficulties, quite enterprises, Hunan is still a good business environment, market opportunities emerging hot land, happy land.
All over the province frequently out of recruitment, out of new tricks, out of practical tricks, for enterprises to bail out the "reduce the burden" to promote high-quality development of "acceleration"; Puyang implementation of "shareholder-style" services, for the enterprise do not push, policy cashing not discount, problem solving overnight ... In the process of recovering the damage caused by the epidemic, all kinds of "do everything possible" to find the right short board pain point, the achievement of the dangerous into a living story.
A mind to study the industry, cultivate industry, develop industry, solidly optimize the business environment, will certainly win the favor of more investors.
The wind and waves ahead are still there, but the state of wind and waves has become the normal state of the whole province to grasp the construction of industrial projects and promote high-quality development.
At this critical time, we must learn and carry out the spirit of the important instructions and instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping, effectively deal with external uncertainty with the certainty of our own work, constantly promote the construction of industrial projects, work with enthusiasm and sweat, and ensure the successful conclusion of the 13th Five-Year Plan and the comprehensive construction of a well-off society.

Is it reasonable for a 3-year-old to have a bad game on the college playground and sue the school after he is compensated?
26 Jul, 2020 05:01:11 Source: Legal Daily Author: Wang Sishuo Responsible Editor: Wang Sishuo
The playground was smashed and the child was compensated before suing the school
□ this newspaper correspondent Zhao Yifan
While playing on a college playground, 3-year-old Xiaowen was accidentally hit in the head by a softball team's Chen.
After Chen's compensation, Xiaowen's father, Mr. Wen, as Xiaowen's legal representative, took the school to court, demanding an apology from the school where the incident took place, and paying medical expenses, compensation for mental damage, etc. totalling 20,000 yuan.
Recently, the Haidian District People's Court in Beijing, after hearing the case, held that the school set up a protective net in the playground at the time of the incident, has fulfilled the appropriate safety and security obligations, and Chen has made compensation, according to which the judgment rejected the plaintiff's claim.
Mr. Wen complained that during the summer vacation of 2019, he took Xiaowen to play on the school playground while the softball team was training on the playground.
To avoid the resulting risks, Xiaowen, Mr. Wen and many other children and parents operate in the safe areas designated by the softball team.
But then the softball team member Chen some in the pitching, causing the softball to fly over the net to the above-mentioned safety area and hit Xiaowen in the back of the head.
Mr. Wen immediately took Xiaowen to the hospital for treatment and was diagnosed with head trauma.
Mr. Wen believes that the facilities of the school stadium do not comply with the relevant safety regulations and do not effectively manage the team and related facilities.
The school's negligence led to the above-mentioned incident, resulting in Xiaowen suffered great physical and mental suffering, but also to his family brought greater pain, for which the school should bear legal responsibility.
In response, the school argued that the school has set up a protective net in the playground, and posted management regulations, training notices, informed that access to the playground must be kept a safe distance from the training ground and remind attention to their own safety, the plaintiff can not prove that the school "failed to meet the obligation of safety and security", so do not agree to compensation.
The court heard that the site of the incident is the university involved in the free opening of the premises to the public, although the school on the management of the playground there is a security obligation, but this security obligation only needs to meet the general duty of care.
At the time of the incident, the school set up a protective net in the playground, has done the appropriate safety and security obligations, and Chen also in accordance with the previously reached compensation agreement to Xiaowen compensation for medical expenses, transportation costs and other losses of more than 2,000 yuan, the two sides agreed to a one-time settlement of the dispute.
Afterward, Xiaowen's parents once again claimed compensation from the school, which was unfounded, and the court's decision rejected all the plaintiff's claims.
Neither side appealed after the verdict, which is now in force.
According to Article 37 of China's Tort Liability Law, schools, as administrators of public places, have the obligation of safety and security, and in the case of damage caused by the actions of third persons, third persons shall bear tort liability, while public place managers who fail to fulfill their obligations for safety and security shall bear corresponding supplementary responsibilities.
The judge stated that since, as the administrator of a public place, he was most likely to know the actual situation of the entire premises, anticipate possible dangers and damage, and thus most likely to take the necessary measures to prevent the occurrence of the loss or mitigate the extent of the damage, and to avoid and mitigate the lowest cost of the damage, the law provided for the corresponding safeguard obligations for engaging in social activities.
In this case, for the non-specific access to the public in the playground open to the public free of charge, the school's obligation of safety and security should be commensurate with the social activities it is engaged in, in particular, basic security measures should be taken and the obligation to inform of hidden dangers.
In judicial practice, it is not appropriate to impose excessive safety and security obligations on public place managers.
If the school has taken the protection net and fulfilled its obligation to inform, it can be found that the school is not at fault and should not be held legally responsible.
In addition, for third-party infringement, even if the school and other public places managers fail to fulfill their obligations for safety and security, their responsibility is also as a supplement to damages, according to the newly promulgated Civil Code, managers can assume additional liability, can also be recovered from third party.
Therefore, in such accidents, the victim should not expand the scope of the claim after receiving compensation from the direct infringer.
Under the normal situation of epidemic prevention and control, people's enthusiasm for sports and fitness is high.
With the gradual liberalization of cross-provincial tourism business, the tourism market is about to usher in a recovery.
Fujian Province resumed cross-provincial tourism business from July 21, the first weekend after the opening, as a popular tourist destination xiamen ushered in a peak passenger flow.

After repeated outbreaks in Israel, many people took to the streets to protest against the impact of government control measures on their own economic interests.
On 11 July, tens of thousands of people demonstrated in Tel Aviv, arguing that the anti-epidemic policy was affecting the economy.
On the evening of the 21st, thousands of protesters gathered in front of Prime Minister Netanyahu's official residence in Jerusalem to protest against Prime Minister Netanyahu's ban on restaurants, cafes and other preventive measures without compensation.

There's a line in Kite that says, 'If you don't come to catch me, I'll forget I'm a Kuomintang', and the spy is going to be elite. ”

A lot of times their plays are 'hanging up', for example, we only write half a page of length, when shooting I do not shout stop, they can continue to play. ”
Masters do not rob each other, the director also do not stir up the play, when the actors are in the role and ensure their character status, not only from the point of view of the characters to shape the role, but also to bring more viewing possibilities to the audience, Yin Fei said such a play is enough to shine.
In the play, you can also see a lot of "Liu's spy war drama" familiar face, "kite" in the famous shock, the mighty "mountain city F4", in the "odds of victory" also gathered three.
Hou Wei and Liu, who have played Song Xiao'an and Zhao Jane, play Tang Fei's left arm again.
Director Yin Fei introduced, "These two people have no bad roots, they are just in that era, that environment with the flow." ”
Liu Yunlong also offered, "We want human touch." This person's feelings mean that the people around me must have good and bad, bad people are enemies, but also to develop them, our team should also grow up. ”

The Lancet praised China's efforts to fight the epidemic and encourage countries to learn from their experiences - ChinaNews.com
The Lancet said in an article on the 25th that China, with a population of 1.4 billion and a similar size to Europe or the United States, has effectively controlled the new crown outbreak at this stage, without a large-scale spread, to a large extent to control the domestic outbreak.
The article said that in the past decade or so, China has invested heavily in domestic research and public health construction, which has made it much more prepared for the new crown than it was for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that year.
When SARS broke out in 2002, China was initially ill-prepared, especially as pathogens could not be identified, the authors said.
When the new coronavirus was discovered in December 2019, Chinese scientists were soon able to identify the virus species and shared genomic sequencing data with the international community on January 11, 2020.
By the end of January, doctors from Chinese mainland and Hong Kong had clarified the clinical characteristics of the virus and warned the world of the threat of the new coronavirus through a research paper published in The Lancet.
China has also been at the forefront of vaccine research, and through close domestic cooperation under the state of emergency, such research has been carried out very quickly and rigorously, with early trials of the new crown vaccine developed in China published in the Lancet in May and July, respectively.
China's experience shows that it is important to invest in national health and research systems and effectively improve laboratory capacity.
This is the basis for a rapid and effective national response to health emergencies and global health security.
Other countries, especially low- and middle-income countries, are well worth learning from.
In addition, China's experience has shown that, on the basis of strong research, there must be strong senior management to make the right decisions with scientific basis, which can effectively control the new crown outbreak.
The article stresses that governments and their leaders must respect science, understand its values and act in the best way for society.
In the early stages of the outbreak, China's National Health and Construction Commission sent three groups of infectious disease experts to Wuhan to investigate the risk and spread of the new coronavirus, their recommendations for January 23 Wuhan "seal city" decision to provide the basis;
Finally, the article emphasizes that in response to global health emergencies, countries need to strengthen global cooperation and joint response.

In the first half of the year, telecommunication network fraud crime increased by 70% The highest inspection summary feature - China New Network
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- In the first half of this year, the national procuratorate prosecuted 58,101 fraud crimes, up 35% year-on-year, according to the website of the Supreme Prosecutor's Office.
In particular, in the crime of obstructing the epidemic prevention and control, fraud crime is frequent, and the number of crimes prosecuted by the procuratorial organs for fraud accounts for 43.4% of the total number of crimes against the prevention and control of the epidemic.
The Supreme People's Procuratorate has carried out targeted guidance, and has now issued 10 batches of typical cases related to epidemic prevention and control, involving a total of 9 cases of fraud.
From the first half of the prosecution case situation, involving a wide range of fraud crimes, up to the national macro-policy, down to the people's food and clothing, including epidemic-related fraud, "medical care" fraud, "health care products" fraud, "admission intermediary" fraud, "set of Road loans "fraud, fraud of state subsidies, national assets unfrozen fraud, etc., and so on, constantly "pushing out new", covering education, health care, employment, old-age care, social security, land acquisition and demolition, precision poverty alleviation, financial credit and other fields, not only to the victims caused economic losses, It also seriously affects economic and social development.
In particular, some telecommunication network fraud broke through national boundaries, geographical and personnel restrictions, with stakeholders, cross-border, remote, electronic payment and other characteristics, not specific victim groups, great harm.
For example, some set up specialized companies, rent high-end office buildings, set up a number of departments or posts, the use of legitimate network platform publicity, recruitment, recruitment training and assessment of recruiters, the use of enterprise operation mode management, wearing a "legitimate coat", more confusing.
It is the duty of the procuratorial organs to punish and prevent crimes in accordance with the law and to give timely warning to the public and relevant departments.
In the judicial case, the procuratorial organ earnestly performs its duties, not only adheres to the high-pressure situation of fraud crime, but also refines the various law enforcement measures in a targeted manner, and promotes social governance through the issuance of prosecutorial recommendations.
The procuratorial organs strictly control the facts, evidence, procedures and the application of the law in cases of arrest and prosecution of fraud cases, and take the facts as the basis and the law as the criterion, so as not to indulge.
Especially for telecommunication network fraud crime, pay attention to the core role of electronic data in fact determination, and strive to build electronic data, rhetorical evidence, documentary evidence between mutually corroborated evidence chain.
Such as Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province, Zhangzhou District Prosecutor's Office should be a case of epidemic-related fraud, the first time the procuratorate early intervention, from the occurrence of the case to the completion, only 5 days, reflects from the fast and strict handling, maintain the overall stability of the society attitude and determination.
In the examination of arrest and examination of prosecution links, pay attention to the case of missing offenders prosecution work, correct the public security organs miss 733 people, correct the public security organs missing the examination and prosecution of co-offenders 1113 people.
In the first half of the year, the national procuratorate issued 298 prosecutorial recommendations for fraud crimes, promoting joint efforts to prevent fraud crimes and promote deep-level governance.
For example, in response to the loopholes found in the case of communication enterprises, banks, intermediary organizations and so on in the supervision of telecommunications networks, the Guangzhou Municipal Prosecutor's Office of Guangdong Province, Dongguan City Prosecutor's Office timely put forward prosecutorial recommendations, urging the relevant units to strengthen supervision, improve the mechanism to promote the construction of long-term system.
Fourth, do a good job in the pursuit of stolen goods.
Local procuratorial organs seize the important links of intervention in investigation to guide evidence collection, examination and prosecution, urge the investigation organs to actively recover stolen money, cooperate with relevant departments to do a good job in recovering stolen goods and damage, and strive to minimize the economic losses caused by fraud crimes to the people.
Such as the Beijing Municipal Prosecutor's Office handled a certain set of road loan cases, the case involves 22 sets of real estate waiting to be sealed, in the case that the property may be disposed of in advance of other cases, the first production of "suspended execution letter", timely delivery to the relevant courts, recommended that the previous seizure of the court of the property involved in the suspension of execution, pending the identification of the facts of the crime after unified disposal, in order to recover the property involved in the case, to recover the loss of victims to make the greatest efforts.
Prosecutors remind everyone to be very vigilant about fraud, do not expect "the pie in the sky", do not think cheap on credulity, keep their own "money bag."

Heat, Economic Daily - China Economic Network reporter walked into the town of Weining County, Guizhou Province, Zhonghai Village.
Against the hot sun, villager Li Yuanzhong in the base grass, although the face is red, but from time to time in his mouth humming a few small songs.
Weining County, where the town is located, because of low latitude, high altitude, adequate lighting, day and night temperature difference, the apple produced high sugar content, good taste, in the surrounding area has a certain degree of visibility, but also because of small head, spots, has not been able to sell a good price, failed to form an industrial scale.
The town was once a poor town with a "Baogu potato spring and autumn", and 10 years ago the incidence of poverty in the area was as high as 25.8%.
In the key period of fighting out of poverty and entering the decisive battle, it is urgent to change the traditional planting habits, adjust the industrial structure and increase the income of farmers.
Chen Chao, secretary of the party committee of the town of Yanna, and a group of people in the town, after many visits, believe that industrial development can no longer go the old way.
To this end, the town of Yanna introduced leading enterprises, in a modern way to grow apples.
Hou Jianwen, deputy general manager of Weining Transcend Agriculture Co., Ltd., came to the town of Yanna from Shaanxi in 2015 to investigate and catch a glimpse of the local planting conditions, starting in 2016 to plant apple trees locally.
At first, the village mobilized Li Yuanzhong to transfer the land out to plant apple trees, Li Yuanzhong and his wife made a mutter: "planted so many years of apples, also did not see the village who planted apples to make a fortune." ”
"The apples are dwarfed and don't make the apple tree grow too tall."
What Li Yuanzhong didn't expect was that this time the apple planting adopted a new method, irrigation pipes spread under each apple tree, water and fertilizer together poured to the roots of the tree, autumn fruit harvest, tractors directly into the orchard, standing can pick fruit.
At present, the Apple base has gradually entered the productive period, the market is also as Hou Jianwen expected, Apple is not worried about selling, by Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and other cities consumers love.
The growing Apple industry has brought about new changes in Li Yuanzhong's life, and although he is still planting land, he has a new source of income.
Li Yuanzhong family has more than 9 acres of land transferred to the Apple base, in addition to the bottom of the annual land transfer fee, hanging fruit after the profit dividends, the couple usually work in the base, "one person can get 80 yuan a day, year-round work."
Li Yuanzhong told reporters that last year's profit dividend received more than 2800 yuan, plus land transfer fees and the couple's income from work, an income of 80,000 yuan, "eat and wear worry, the well-off days have passed."
"It's starting to bear fruit, with an annual output value of more than 15,000 yuan per acre of apples, about 10 times that of corn."
Chen Chao told reporters that the town is currently planted 20,000 mu of apples, in Zhonghai Village alone there are 6000 mu, covering 4056 households, 172,000 people, including 656 households, 2952 people, a year to pay more than 6 million yuan, the real realization of the base built on the doorstep, work do not have to go out.
Li Yuanzhong, whose pockets are growing, has also begun to realize his "wish".
This year's Lunar New Year, Li Yuanzhong bought an off-road vehicle, now driving to and from work every day, "the family still has more than a dozen acres of land, and so on the next step Apple base to expand the scale, all flow to them, income is more." ”

Membrane separation technology helps crack the "greenhouse effect" - China New Network
Membrane separation technology helps crack the "greenhouse effect"
A diagram of the new hybrid matrix film preparation technology
This newspaper reporter Shang Rui reported: Recently, Tianjin University's atmospheric environment and bioenergy team for the "membrane separation method to capture carbon dioxide" made significant progress, successfully developed a new hybrid matrix film preparation technology, greatly improve the film material carbon dioxide capture performance.
The results have been published as a cover article in the international journal Greenhouse Gases: Science and Technology.
"Greenhouse effect" is a major environmental problem that plagues human development, and carbon dioxide emissions are the main cause of "greenhouse effect".
How to efficiently capture and utilize human carbon dioxide emissions is the focus of scientists.
Membrane separation method is a new carbon dioxide capture technology, which separates carbon dioxide gas with the help of membrane material, and has the characteristics of energy saving and simple operation.
How to make membrane material "deep breath" and improve the efficiency of gas separation is the bottleneck difficulty of using membrane separation method to capture carbon dioxide.
Tianjin University's scientific research team innovated its ideas and explored the effects of different solvents on membrane gas separation performance through repeated experiments.
The experimental results show that the carbon nanotube distribution in the resulting membrane material is more uniform and "more breathable" with N-methyl pyridoxaneone as the preparation solvent, which effectively improves the gas separation efficiency and rate of membrane material.
With this new technology, the co2 separation performance is close to the theoretical separation limit of such film material.
"New technologies offer new ideas for membrane separation to capture carbon dioxide."
"We hope this technology will provide strong support for future coal-fired power plants and chemical companies in dealing with flue gas and play a major role in controlling greenhouse gas emissions," said Li Run, a member of Tianjin University's atmospheric environment and bioenergy team. ”
Volunteer before filling in the report first understand what is professional grade difference - Zhongxin network
27 Jul, 2020 02:22:36 Source: Chongqing Morning Post Author: Yu Xiao Responsible Editor: Yu Xiao
Before volunteering to fill in the report, first understand what is a professional grade difference
Every year to fill in the college entrance examination volunteer, there are students or parents because of the voluntary filling in the nouns involved in the lack of understanding, and thus affect voluntary filling.
This year, five universities, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing University of Science and Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing Forestry University and Beijing University of Chemical Engineering, jointly issued a 2020 admissions policy to eliminate professional grade differentials.
What does professional grade difference mean and what is the significance of voluntary filing?
There are three ways to assign professional rules
Experts remind that before filling in the voluntary, we must read the favorite school's "admission charter" to understand the admission rules of colleges and universities, including the transfer ratio, professional distribution rules.
Professional distribution rules, refers to the transfer of colleges and universities, for professional admission mainly have professional priority, score priority, professional grade difference three ways.
Which method colleges and universities use will be specified in the Admissions Charter.
But there are some colleges and universities admission principle is the total score priority, there is no grade difference between majors.
That is to say, the admission range candidates in accordance with the total score queue, when the score did not reach the first professional voluntary admission score line, it is to see whether the second professional voluntary admission score line, and so on until the admission to the last professional volunteer, the professional volunteer between the level difference.
The so-called "professional grade difference" is the institution in the arrangement of candidates for professional, according to the admissions charter published in one or several points of value, to determine the selection of different professional volunteer candidates for admission to the professional, this score value is "professional grade difference."
That is, the difference between the scores of colleges and universities when accepting candidates for the first major and non-first major volunteers, the difference between the levels of volunteers in each major, such as 3 points, 2 points, 1 point, etc.
For example.
Suppose that students Xiaoming applied to A university, tested 560 points, its professional volunteers are: computer, international trade, automation, mechanical engineering, e-commerce, A university professional admission to implement the professional grade difference method, grade difference is divided into 2 points, 1 point, 1 point, 0 points.
In the professional distribution, if Xiaoming's first major volunteer meets the professional admission requirements and the professional has a planned balance, then Xiaoming is admitted to the "computer" major With the first professional voluntary examination of "international trade" candidates to determine whether to meet the professional admission conditions, if still not satisfied, the score minus 1 point (i.e. 557 points) for the third professional voluntary "automation" admission, if still not satisfied, Scores are subtracted by one point (i.e. 556 points) for admission to the fourth major, and follow-up majors will not be reduced if they still cannot meet their professional volunteers, and so on.
Different university professional grade difference settings are different
With the popularity of parallel volunteering, many colleges and universities have now eliminated the professional grade difference, but this year there are still some colleges and universities still retain this method, from the school published the "Admission Charter", this year, there are mainly more than 20 universities set up professional grade difference.
For example, Sichuan Agricultural University, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Heilongjiang University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Jiangxi Normal University, Chengdu Medical College, Northeastern Electric Power University, Jimei University, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing University of Technology, Ningxia University, Shandong University of Technology, China Civil Aviation Flight College, etc.
In these universities, each university has a different level of professionalism.
Some colleges and universities in each major have a grade difference, such as Ningxia University, the file has been cast to the university candidates, according to the order in which candidates fill in the professional volunteer in order to reduce by 1 point after the order of admission by score.
And some universities in different majors, set different professional grade differences.
For example, Jimei University, the total score difference between professional volunteer level is 4 points, that is, the first professional volunteer and other professional volunteer level difference of 3 points, other professional volunteers do not have a grade difference, as parallel volunteer, other professional volunteer and transfer professional volunteer professional grade difference of 1 point.
When filling in the voluntary, candidates and parents must carefully read the reported school admission policy, to see if there is no professional grade difference, grade difference form is how, in full consideration of the score at the same time, but also reasonable analysis of the school and professional selection, if the institutions in the admission charter clearly adopt the score difference approach to admission, candidates in the choice of majors, should pay attention to the gradient between the majors, improve the chances of admission.
