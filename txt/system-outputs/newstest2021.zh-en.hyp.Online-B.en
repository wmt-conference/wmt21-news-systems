Where to find talents?
Outstanding returning migrant workers are an indispensable force.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 26th. Topic: Turn outstanding returning migrant workers into a new force for rural revitalization
Zhang Xiong, 34, lives in Guoyuan Village, Meishan City, Sichuan. In 2010, he quit his job in Beijing with a monthly salary of tens of thousands and returned to his hometown to start a business.
After several years of hard work, the annual income of his grape-growing family farm now exceeds one million yuan. He has become a well-known leader in getting rich. He has also been selected to join the village's "two committees" team.
In recent years, inspired by a series of policies to support agriculture and benefit agriculture, such as national poverty alleviation and rural revitalization, more and more outstanding migrant workers like Zhang Xiong have chosen to return to their hometowns to start their own businesses, which has activated a pool of spring water in the countryside.
Sichuan, a province with a large population in western my country and a large labor exporting province, has implemented the "Excellent Migrant Workers Recruitment Training Project" according to the situation. In 2019 alone, more than 8,000 village party branch secretaries were generated from the outstanding migrant workers to cultivate village reserve forces. There are 61,000 members and more than 20,000 party members will be recruited to provide a strong guarantee for winning the battle against poverty and implementing the strategy of rural revitalization.
Whether or not a well-off society is well-off, the key depends on the fellow villagers.
Since the reform and opening up, a large number of young and middle-aged laborers in rural my country have gone out to work to increase their income, and some have established their own enterprises through hard work.
However, objectively it has also led to the emergence of "hollowing" to varying degrees in rural areas, especially the weakening of rural grassroots organizations. The village party branch secretaries and party members all show the characteristics of "one old and one low", that is, aging, low education, and the village party The team leader is not strong, and the problem of non-compliance is prominent.
If rural talents and other factors have been flowing unidirectionally to the cities, and the rural areas have been in a state of "blood loss" and "anemia" for a long time, revitalization is empty talk.
Attracting back those migrant workers who are capable, conscious, and aspiring to serve their hometowns, guide them to return to their hometowns to start businesses and become wealthy leaders, and select the best to train them into party members and rural cadres, and enrich the grassroots cadre team. This is to solve the problem of rural party members. A permanent solution that is not in contact with the grassroots party organizations.
Excellent migrant workers can be attracted back, but they must be retained and done well.
In recent years, Sichuan has begun to pay close attention to the party building of migrant workers. On the basis of strict selection criteria, it has established systems and mechanisms for outstanding migrant workers’ directional referral, service guarantee, training and promotion, selection and use, etc., so that they can improve their abilities and work. There is a guarantee of security, a hope in life, a real root in the countryside, and a sense of accomplishment in starting a business.
This year is the final year of the decisive battle against poverty. To make the connection between poverty alleviation and rural revitalization, talents are the key factor.
Party committees and governments at all levels should attach great importance to the group of outstanding returning rural migrant workers, and through comprehensive measures, build them into a team and a new force that can be retained, fight, and cannot be taken away, so as to provide the rural areas with poverty alleviation and prosperity and development and revitalization. Strong organizational guarantee and talent support.
Due to the epidemic, this year’s college graduates are very special. On the evening of July 11, the bilibili summer graduation song will bring a special online live show for the graduates, Lao Lang, Pu Shu, Li Yuchun, Mao Buyi Waiting for musicians to send singing and blessings to recent graduates.

The capital's natural ecology continues to improve, attracting wild animals to settle in the city
More than 500 species of wild animals in Beijing
News from our newspaper (Reporter Wang Bin) A reporter from the Beijing Youth Daily learned from the Municipal Landscaping Bureau that in recent years, as the capital's natural ecological environment continues to improve, the types and numbers of wild animals have also continued to increase.
At present, the number of terrestrial spine wild animals inhabiting Beijing has increased to more than 500 species, including national first-class protected animals such as brown horse chicken and black stork, as well as national second-class protected animals such as goral, whooper swan, gray crane and mandarin duck.
Whether it is planted into the urban forests in the second ring road or the small wetlands embedded in the buildings, it not only brings the wildness of nature to the citizens of the capital, but also attracts wild animals to "settle" in the city.
In the midsummer season, the Songshan National Nature Reserve, located in the Yanshan Mountains in the northwest of Yanqing District, is full of vitality.
A raccoon is playing leisurely by the mountain stream, and two badgers are fighting each other.
Looking back, a wild boar couldn't help but scratching his body and was rubbing hard against the bark. According to Hu Qiaoli, Director of the Management Office of Songshan National Nature Reserve, as of the end of 2019, in this green sea with a total area of more than 6,200 hectares, there are living in this green sea, including the national first-class protected animal golden eagle and the national second-class protected animal spoon chicken and goral. Of the 178 species of wild animals in the city, nearly one-third of the city’s wild animal species can be seen here.
"In Songshan, wild animals are the real'owners', and our staff can only be regarded as people's'bodyguards' at best."
Hu Qiaoli said that in order to understand the situation of wild animals and plants in the reserve, more than 30 professional patrol team members will patrol along 16 carefully formulated protection routes every day. I walked almost the entire reserve in a whole day.
"During inspections, not only check and record the biodiversity, but also check the installation of artificial bird nests, rescue injured wild animals, install field infrared cameras and so on."
More than 200 infrared cameras have been installed in Songshan National Nature Reserve to record the living conditions of wild animals in the forest.
Hu Qiaoli introduced that with the continuous enrichment of biodiversity in the reserve in recent years, more and more wild animals have appeared in the lens. Ocelots, raccoon dogs and pig badgers have become "resident guests" and the national second-level protected animals goral. The "appearance rate" is also getting higher.
Zhang Zhiming, director of the Wildlife and Wetland Protection Division of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Landscaping, introduced that the number of terrestrial spine wild animals in Beijing has increased from 461 species in 1994 to more than 500 now. The types and numbers of wild animals in Beijing have continued to increase in recent years. .
The appearance of wild animals in cities has become more common, which is closely related to the continuous upgrade of the capital city's greening in recent years.
In particular, the new round of afforestation and greening construction of one million acres started in 2018, which proposes to reshape the urban ecological environment, enhance the ecological function of woodland and green space, and highlight the concept of "near nature".
In the planning, we strive to achieve interconnection and interaction with the surrounding green space, so that wild animals can "visit relatives and friends". The trees planted are also the honey and food plants that animals love.
Black soil "plants" agricultural modernization-Xinhua Net
Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 26, report title: Black soil "plants" agricultural modernization
In midsummer, two spraying planes passed by the 10,000-mu high-yield demonstration field in the second operation station of the fifth management zone of Youyi Farm, forming two white lines. The green field was planted with black rice seedlings as the "first in the world" A few big characters are particularly eye-catching.
Kong Lingqiang, head of the operation station, said that this kind of aircraft can spray chemicals on more than 6,000 acres of cultivated land a day, and the efficiency is about 8 times that of drones and hundreds of times that of manpower.
This farm is located in Youyi County, Heilongjiang Province, my country's largest grain-producing province. From the sound of rice cutting in the past to the sound of rumbling motors in the past, traditional Chinese farming and farms have been transformed on this black soil belt.
In addition to airplanes, satellites are also used in the modern agricultural production of Friendship Farm.
Kong Lingqiang introduced that on the one hand, they use satellite remote sensing technology to achieve precise fertilization, reduce agricultural input and reduce pollution; on the other hand, satellite navigation technology can improve the level of standardized farm machinery field operations.
In this year’s rice production process, the farm expanded the operating area of the satellite-navigation unmanned rice transplanting technology from 3,000 acres last year to 30,000 acres.
This technology makes the planting of seedlings more uniform, maximizes the use of sunlight and arable land resources, and saves 16 yuan in labor costs per mu.
The farm tried new technologies such as informatization and intelligence in agricultural production, forming the largest agricultural machinery group in my country from the ground to the sky.
According to statistics, the total number of agricultural machinery in the farm is 49,000 units (pieces), and the comprehensive mechanization rate in the field reaches 99.8%.
Agricultural machinery operations achieve 100% GPS satellite navigation, 100% precision seeding in dry fields, and 100% high-horsepower locomotive operations in dry fields.
"Green agriculture, smart agriculture, and digital agriculture are the path-finding directions for agricultural modernization."
Said Liu Hualian, director of the Friendship Farm.
The key to agricultural modernization lies in scientific and technological progress.
In recent years, Heilongjiang Agricultural Reclamation, represented by farms, has played a role in the demonstration and leading role of modern large-scale agricultural "aircraft carrier", and has initially established a modern agricultural industrial system led by large-scale planting, standardized production, and industrialized management.
In the suburbs of Youyi County, there is an Agricultural Machinery Expo Park covering an area of 350,000 square meters.
More than 140 agricultural machinery and tools introduced and used by Heilongjiang Nongken over the years are exhibited here.
These agricultural machinery and farms have witnessed the development of my country's agricultural modernization.

Xinhua News Agency reporters Chen Shangying, Wang Liwu, Liu Xiacun
At around 4 pm on July 25, Fu Kunbao wore muddy rubber shoes and was busy packing things back and forth with his wife Zhou Yan from the front room to the back room.
"After receiving a call from the village cadre to transfer, I was still stalking the grass in the field."
Fu Kunbao said that he has transferred more than 60 acres of land and planted rice, and he is now growing well. "I took the medicine yesterday, and I haven't cleaned up all the tools."
Fu Kunbao pointed to the pesticide sprayer placed in the corner, "No one wants their home to be flooded, let's leave a small home for everyone."
In order to cope with the continued high water pressure and possible heavy rainfall in Chaohu Lake, Hefei, Anhui Province, plans to use the Jiangkouhe Lianwei flood diversion storage facility where Fu Kunbao's family is located on the 26th.
Jiangkouhe Lianwei is located in Feixi County, next to the Chaohu Dike.
There are thousands of villagers involved in Yandian Township and Sanhe Township who need to be transferred.
As of 16:00 on the 25th, the water level of Chaohu Lake, my country's fifth largest freshwater lake, remained at a high level of 13.2 meters, 0.7 meters above the guaranteed water level.
The kitchen in Fu Kunbao's house is clean and tidy. There is a pot of pumpkin head vegetables on the table, and there are eggs and some stewed vegetables in the refrigerator.
"I didn't expect to move, the water in Jiangkou River looks good at the moment."
Zhou Yan said that the house is a bungalow, and I haven't decided where to put some large objects.
"Clean up your valuables first. Large items such as refrigerators and TV sets can be temporarily placed in neighbors or relatives on high ground."
Village leader Wang Liwen gave Fu Kunbao an idea.
Wang Liwen was responsible for the transfer and resettlement of 13 villagers, and notified each household to confirm the resettlement plan for each person.
The nearest resettlement site to Fu Kunbao’s home is Su Xiao Primary School in Yandian Township, about 2 kilometers away.
In addition to the big items, the more than 1,000 catties of grain and some newly bought furniture were also a headache for Fu Kunbao and his wife.
"The food is going to be dragged to the relative's house, and the furniture cannot be moved.
The couple negotiated, put a stool under the newly bought bed, and raised the bed by about half a meter.
At 6 o'clock in the afternoon, Fu Kunbao began to use a tricycle to transport things to his relatives, and Zhou Yan continued to clean up at home.
After 11 o'clock in the evening, the couple looked around at home, turned on the switch, and prepared to go to the resettlement site.
"I hope the water will withdraw soon."
Fu Kunbao said.
At 9:30 a.m. on July 26, the reporter saw at the Jiangkouhe Lianwei site that the local area had made various preparations before flood diversion.
Zhang Jikelin Xiaozhai team up to support muscular teenagers-Xinhua English.news.cn
Sports youth hot-blooded competition show "Sports Boys" officially landed on Hunan Satellite TV on July 11.
Sports leader Zhang Jike and sports assistant Lin Xiaozhai cross-border on the same stage, Lin Dan and Fu Yuanhui commented on their own styles, and the hard core of the "colossal" force pulling device makes the show more "burning".
In the first episode, 11 athletic teenagers appeared on the power track, and their appearance was amazing to the audience. At the same time, the "strong conflict", "strong confrontation" and "strong heart" on the arena also attracted attention.
Among them, the "strong conflict" comes from Super A sports student Qiao Wenyi. He openly challenged Xu Zhibin, who is known as the "Beautiful Man" on the track before the game. He choked that Xu Zhibin's appearance conditions should be sung and danced, and even released "lost." Don’t cry your makeup."
The remarks made the teenagers and the sports leaders on the field take a breath.
The "strong confrontation" is more like a fight between the gods. Sun Jianqi, known as the "big devil", meets the equally powerful Zhang Xindong and staged a strong confrontation.
And their identities are unexpected. Sun Jianqi is an actor who loves fitness, and Zhang Xindong is a retired special forces member and three-time Warrior Medal winner.
At the beginning of the game, the two teenagers tried their best to quickly pull out the small pole. The long-lasting confrontation on the big pole made the audience sweat for them.
In the tense situation, Zhang Jike, as one of the sports leaders of "Sports Boy", also watched the game seriously.
In the comment section, he was also very careful, patiently encouraged the teenager who lost the game, and helped every mistake in the process of resuming the game.
Sports assistant Lin Xiaozhai is a fancy assist, and she makes no secret of her appreciation for the youngsters who are online.
When I learned about the daily training that sports teenagers are overloaded with, I admire them even more.
Lin Dan and Fu Yuanhui, who are also the sports leaders, have their own styles. One is a "prophet" of the calm and relaxed school, and the other is a "preliminary girl" who uses a smile to dispel the tension.
In addition, Jike Junyi and Liu Ye, as sports assistants, also created a lot of hilarious topics around sports teenagers.
Church fire in Nantes, France: Diocese volunteers admit that arson is usually kind and reticent-Chinanews.com
China News Service, July 26. According to foreign media reports, on July 18, the famous religious and historical architectural treasures of Nantes, France, the famous Cathedral of St. Peter and St. Paul, was severely damaged in a fire and the large pipe organ was completely destroyed.
On the 26th local time, the Nantes prosecutor announced that a diocese volunteer who was responsible for the security of the cathedral had been charged with "arson and destruction."
He has admitted that he was lighting the fire in the church.
According to the report, the local prosecutor Cenas said that the 39-year-old volunteer from the diocese of Rwanda admitted that he had set fire to three places in the cathedral at night.
The person’s lawyer said that the arsonists now regret doing such a thing.
This person entered France through the route of asylum a few years ago, was sheltered in the parish where the fire happened, and taken in in the church.
The prosecutor pointed out that recently, he tried to renew his visa and was in dialogue with the police station.
But the church said that he still couldn't believe that this very kind, smiling, but quiet believer would destroy the church he loves so much.
On the day the fire broke out on July 18, the volunteer had already been questioned and investigated by the police because of a logically unreasonable problem in the narrative, but he was later released.
The picture shows firefighters at the scene rescue.
On the evening of the 25th, because professional engineers from the laboratory of the Central Police Department in Paris obtained new evidence, this person was once again interrogated.
This time, the man admitted to his arson.
According to reports, if the crime of deliberate arson and destruction is convicted, the suspect may face 10 years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros.
According to reports, the fire caused serious damage to the Cathedral of St. Pierre and St. Paul. The pipe organ in the church was completely burned and the stained glass window behind the pipe organ was also badly damaged.
Brunel, the chief architect of the French historical preservation building, believes that it is conservatively estimated that the restoration of the Nantes Cathedral will take at least three years.
Comprehensive news: U.S. unilateralism undermines relations between the two countries, international public opinion supports China's counter-control against the U.S.-Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26. Xinhua News Agency’s foreign correspondents reported: On the morning of July 24, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs notified the U.S. Embassy in China that China had decided to withdraw its approval for the establishment and operation of the U.S. Consulate General in Chengdu. The consulate ceased all business and activities to make specific requirements.
International public opinion believes that the unilateral measures taken by the United States have caused serious problems in Sino-US relations. China has responded to the unreasonable provocations by the US and it is legitimate and necessary to take countermeasures.
Andrés Borques, director of the China Studies Center of the Institute of International Studies at the University of Chile, said that the unilateral measures of the United States have destroyed the bridge of understanding between the people of China and the United States, and caused a crisis in the relationship between the two major powers.
China's notification to the United States to close its consulate in Chengdu is a countermeasure to the US unilateral measures and conforms to diplomatic practice.
Patricio Giusto, a professor at the Catholic University of Argentina and director of the Argentina-China Research Center, believes that China's above decision is a legitimate and necessary countermeasure against the previous provocation of the United States, and is not directed at ordinary Americans.
The United States tried to use pressure on China to cover up its ineffective response to the new crown epidemic and divert the attention of the American people.
Bambang Suryono, chairman of the Asian Innovation Research Center, an Indonesian think tank, said that the provocative diplomatic stance of the United States has caused serious problems in Sino-US relations, which are facing severe challenges.
China’s notification of the United States to close its consulate in Chengdu is a normal countermeasure and conforms to diplomatic practice. It not only reflects China’s principled position of resolutely safeguarding its own interests, but also reflects the rationality and integrity of China’s diplomacy.
Francis Semwenza, a current affairs commentator in Tanzania, said that China's above decision is a legitimate and necessary response to the provocation of the United States.
If Sino-US relations are to return to normal, the US should take the initiative to improve relations with China and stop interfering in China's internal affairs.
The United States should focus on how to achieve a win-win situation with China economically and politically, and how to benefit the two peoples and the entire international community.
Ali Youssef, executive director of the Arab-Chinese Friendship Association Federation based in Sudan, said that the countermeasures China was forced to take were a legitimate and necessary response to the unreasonable actions of the United States, and conformed to the basic norms of international law and international relations, as well as diplomatic Convention.
Previously, the US request to close the Chinese Consulate General in Houston seriously violated international law and the basic norms of international relations.
It is hoped that the U.S. side will withdraw the previous relevant decisions and create necessary conditions for the return of bilateral relations to normal.
Singapore’s "Lianhe Zaobao" published an editorial saying that the greater strategic intention of the United States is to contain China and prevent China from continuing to rise.
In the face of the United States’ pressing steadily, although China is very reluctant to see Sino-US relations continue to deteriorate, it has to take countermeasures.

"Screw on the Jiangnan" to pursue the poetic "Yellow River Dream"-Chinanews.com
(Chinese Poverty Reduction Story) "Screw on the South of the Yangtze River" Pursuing the Poetic "Yellow River Dream"
China News Service, Yinchuan, July 26 (Yang Di) "The Nine-curved Yellow River has tens of thousands of li sands, and the waves and wind rush from the end of the world."
The Yellow River, which aroused countless literati's lofty passions, gave birth to the beautiful and fertile Ningxia Plain. Today, Ningxia, which has the reputation of "Stopping Jiangnan", is adhering to the concept of "ecology first, green development" and pursuing the poetic "Yellow River Dream".
The beautiful "Bibo Dream" of the river
"The Yellow River in the world enriches Ningxia", the Yellow River flows 397 kilometers through Ningxia and is the "mother river" for nurturing a party.
However, with the rapid advancement of industrialization and urbanization, the development, utilization, management and protection of rivers and lakes have become unbalanced, and chaos such as excessive sewage discharge, lake reclamation, and infringement of waters have emerged, resulting in black and odorous water, excessive water quality, dirty environment, and ecological degradation.
Now, Ningxia is promoting the restoration of diverse water ecology and working hard to make the Yellow River beautiful and clear.
Water control must start from the source.
In Yinchuan, Ningxia, the local government adopted the method of "standard improvement + pollution control + strict management". All sewage in the industrial parks were treated in a centralized manner. The urban sewage treatment plants all achieved Class A discharge standards. The black and odorous water bodies in urban built-up areas were basically eliminated, and the application was successfully declared The third batch of China's black and smelly water demonstration cities.
In addition, Ningxia fully implemented the river and lake chief system in 2017, and now it has achieved full coverage of the five-level river and lake chief responsibility system in districts, counties and villages, and long patrols of rivers and lakes have become the norm.
64-year-old Gu Jincheng lives in a village by the Yellow River. He has witnessed the changes in the Yellow River: “The previous water smelled like a smell, but after the rectification, the smell disappeared.”
Gu Jincheng said that the ecological environment is better and his life is more comfortable. Now he often walks by the Yellow River with his family and feels the blue water and blue sky.
Sha Ouxiang's "Wetland Dream"
Birds, green trees, plank roads, clear water... The beauty of Fan Zhongyan's "Sand Gulls Xiangji" has become a reality in the Yellow River Wetland Park in Yinchuan, Ningxia.
The Yellow River flows through Ningxia, forming river wetlands, lake wetlands, marsh wetlands and other wetlands along the way, which play an important role in promoting the rational use of water resources and the water ecological balance. It has also become an important international bird migration channel.
Since 2009, relevant departments in Ningxia have invested a total of 3.45 billion yuan in wetland protection projects. At present, Yinchuan wetland covers an area of 19,200 hectares, with a wetland protection rate of 78.5%. There are nearly 200 natural lakes and marsh wetlands. There are 5 national wetland parks, 1 national urban wetland park, 6 autonomous region-level wetland parks, and 8 municipal-level parks.
Lu Jinhu, deputy director of the Yinchuan Wetland Conservation Center, told reporters that wetland protection has increased biodiversity, which is particularly evident in birds. “The relict gull is an endangered bird, and there are only more than 20,000 in the world. Among them, the Yinchuan Wetland There are more than 2,000 inhabitants."
At the same time, Ningxia has delineated a 500-meter red line for the wetland protection areas on both sides of the Yinchuan section of the Yellow River in accordance with the law, stipulating that no unit or individual may conduct development, construction and business activities within the protected area except for public welfare projects.
Zhao Shaoyong, deputy director of Yinchuan Water Conservancy Service Center, introduced that through pollution source treatment, comprehensive improvement of river and lake ecology, and terminal wetland construction, 100% of the water quality of Ningxia’s nine main drainage ditches into the Yellow River has reached Class IV standards. “Now the water is clear. The fish swam and the flowers bloomed."
The "Drinking Dream" of Inclusive People's Livelihood
Yinchuan City in Ningxia used to have the title of "embarrassing": the only city along the Yellow River that "guarded the water shortage of the Yellow River".
Since 2010, Yinchuan City has been facing persistent water shortages during the peak summer period. The pain of water shortage in the past ten years has become a painful summer experience for many high-floor residents. Under the current situation that a large area of groundwater over-exploitation funnel area has formed under the limit of mining and urban underground, water shortage has become a problem that plagues Yinchuan City.
Thanks to the improvement of the water quality of the Yellow River, drinking purified Yellow River water has become a good way to solve the drinking water problems of local residents.
According to Ding Ming, deputy director of Yinchuan Water Affairs Bureau, in order to improve the water demand of urban and rural residents in Yinchuan, Ningxia started the water supply project of the West Line of Yinchuan Metropolitan Area at an appropriate time to replace the original underground water source with high-quality Yellow River water.
"On December 29, 2019, the water supply project officially provided water to the three districts of Yinchuan City. In 2020, residents of Minning Town and Helan County will also drink water from the Yellow River."
Ding Ming said that the Yinchuan Water Conservancy Department will make overall plans to consider the integration of rural drinking water and urban water supply in the region. “In the next step, we will integrate all the scattered water supply points in rural areas and connect them to the west line water supply project. It is expected that the Yinchuan area will be basically achieved by the end of this year. Integrated urban and rural water supply."

The U.S. launches an anti-subsidy investigation against China for the first time with "undervaluation of the RMB exchange rate"
In response to the recent announcement of the US Department of Commerce, it decided to initiate an anti-dumping and countervailing investigation against cable ties (cable ties) products originating in China, and to initiate an investigation on the "RMB undervaluation" project.
The Ministry of Commerce of China pointed out that this is the first time that the United States has initiated an investigation into the so-called "RMB undervaluation" project in an anti-subsidy case. China firmly opposes this.
China’s Ministry of Commerce issued a press release on the evening of the 23rd, stating that China implements a managed floating exchange rate system based on market supply and demand, with reference to a basket of currencies, and that the market plays a decisive role in the formation of the exchange rate.
The press release emphasizes that overall, the RMB exchange rate is at a reasonable equilibrium level and has not been undervalued.
Since 2005, the RMB has appreciated against the US dollar by more than 17%.
According to data released by the Bank for International Settlements, from the beginning of 2005 to May 2020, the nominal effective exchange rate of RMB appreciated by 38%, and the real effective exchange rate appreciated by 49%. It is the strongest currency in the G20 economy and the largest appreciation in the world. One of the currencies.
The Ministry of Commerce pointed out that the exchange rate issue is beyond the competence of members to conduct countervailing investigations in accordance with the rules of the World Trade Organization.
The United States revised its regulations in February this year to conduct countervailing investigations on the exchange rates of other countries. It has been suspected of violating WTO rules and has been opposed by many quarters.
The press release stated that even in accordance with U.S. regulations, the applicant’s complaint contained a large number of errors and did not possess the necessary elements of countervailing, such as financial assistance, benefit granting, and specificity.
China urges the US to abide by existing international rules and stop anti-subsidy investigations into the so-called "undervaluation of the RMB exchange rate."
Affected by the further increase in tensions in Sino-US relations, the offshore and onshore RMB exchange rates against the US dollar fell sharply on the 22nd, and both fell below the US$1 to RMB 7.0 mark.
Whether the US Department of Commerce's move is intended to force the yuan to rise is worthy of attention.
The spot exchange rate of the RMB against the US dollar rose above the 7.0 mark on the 23rd to close at 6.9961.
The central parity of the renminbi against the U.S. dollar under official regulation was lowered by 17 basis points to 6.9938 on the 24th.

Lewis family: John Lewis is a fighter "fighting for the weakest"
The U.S. Congressman, the civil rights fighter John Lewis, was remembered as a fighter "fighting for the weakest" at a memorial service held for him on Saturday (July 25).
Lewis' public memorial service has been held in Alabama since Saturday.
There were two memorial services on the first day.
At a public memorial service at Troy University in Alabama on Saturday, Lewis' five siblings and a grandson talked about him as a caring, fearless, family-oriented man.
Henry "Grant" Lewis, Lewis's youngest brother, said at the meeting: "He has devoted his life to helping others."
Samuel Lewis said his mother had warned John "Don't make trouble, don't make trouble."
He added that John didn’t heed his mother’s warning. He said: “We all know that John always gets into trouble, always getting into trouble, but that’s because he insists on the right thing, which is a good trouble. ."
Lewis’ brothers and sisters reminded the people at the memorial service that John’s most famous argument was to create “good troubles”, that is, as long as it was for justice, he would not shy away from provoking trouble.
John once applied to Troy University in Troy, Alabama, where he was born, but Troy University, an all-white school at the time, rejected his application.
John Lewis, who preached the gospel to chickens on his farm as a child, eventually earned a degree in religion and philosophy from Fisk University.
Many years later, the University of Troy awarded Lewis an honorary doctorate.
Senator Doug Jones from Alabama said that the current protesters are "protesting peacefully and non-violently," just like Lewis did in the civil rights movement.
Jones said: "Even if President Trump overturned a boat and described all protesters as thugs, he was wrong.
The protesters are patriots, and they want the United States to move towards a more equal country. "
A series of six-day events to commemorate Lewis will culminate at the funeral in Georgia this week.
On Saturday, Lewis’s coffin was parked at a public memorial service at Troy University. People came to pay tribute to the pioneer of the civil rights movement.
Later on Saturday, a private ceremony paid tribute to him in a small church in Selma, Alabama, followed by a public memorial service.
On Sunday, Lewis' body will pass the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma.
In 1965, he and the demonstrators who demanded the right to vote for blacks were beaten up by the Alabama police in front of this bridge, and the police also released tear gas on the demonstrators.
Lewis was almost killed at the time.
This day will be called "Bloody Sunday" in the future.
Lewis' remains will be transported to Montgomery, the capital of Alabama.
Mayor Steven Reed encouraged people to line up on the sidewalk to complete the final journey with Lewis.
At the same time, officials asked the public to wear masks and maintain social distancing when participating in activities.
Alabama Governor Kay Ivey ordered that the flag be lowered at half-mast on Saturday and Sunday to commemorate Lewis.
During the nearly week-long commemorative event, Lewis's body will be placed briefly in the Alabama State Capitol in Montgomery, the Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta, and the U.S. Capitol in Washington for the public to express their condolences.
The Speaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced last week that people can go to the US Capitol on Monday and Tuesday to pay tribute to Lewis.
Due to the coronavirus epidemic, public events to commemorate Lewis will be held outdoors.

Hoh Xil Tibetan antelope enters migration season-Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, July 25 (Reporter Wang Jinjin) The reporter learned from the Wudaoliang Protection Station, Hoh Xil Management Office, Yangtze Source Park, Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration, that monitoring showed that Tibetan antelopes had migrated to the Zhuonai Lake area in the hinterland of Hoh Xil to give birth. The littering is gradually ending, and the cubs are beginning to return to their original habitat.
Monitoring pictures near the Wudaoliang Conservation Station showed that on July 25, about 40 female Tibetan antelopes led three Tibetan antelope cubs through the 3002 kilometers of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway and the Wudaoliang North Bridge on the Qinghai-Tibet Railway. The Tibetan antelopes have begun to move back .
According to expert analysis, in recent years, the number of Tibetan antelope cubs in the relocating flock accounts for one-quarter to one-fifth of the total number of Tibetan antelope flocks.
Lian Xinming, an associate researcher at the Northwest Plateau Institute of Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, said: "In the early stage of the migration, Tibetan antelopes face a higher risk of predation, so the number of cubs in the flock will be relatively small, and there may even be no cubs."
According to the statistics of the Kekexili Management Office of the Yangtze River Source Park of the Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration, the number of Tibetan antelopes returning has been increasing year by year. In 2019, the number of Tibetan antelopes returning was 4860, an increase of 338 from 2018.
Lian Xinming said: "It is expected that this year's relocation of Tibetan antelopes will end in early September, and the number of relocated Tibetan antelopes is expected to continue to increase."
Tibetan antelope is a national first-class protected animal.
At the end of May every year, Tibetan antelopes from the Sanjiangyuan of Qinghai, Qiangtang of Tibet, Altyn Mountains of Xinjiang and other places go to Zhuonai Lake, located in the hinterland of Hoh Xil, to lamb.
Wu Xiaomin, a Tibetan antelope conservation expert in my country and a researcher at the Shaanxi Institute of Zoology (Northwestern Endangered Animals Institute), said: “Tibetan antelope migration is a process in which the female Tibetan antelope returns to the habitat with the cubs after the female Tibetan antelope has finished giving birth. The relocation groups of the young land are relatively large, but then the Tibetan antelopes will return to their respective habitats along different paths according to different geographic populations."
In order to ensure the safe relocation of the Tibetan antelope herd, the reporter learned that the Kekexili Management Office of the Yangtze River Source Park of the Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration has arranged staff to continue to carry out video surveillance and patrols in the main relocation area.
If a flock of Tibetan antelopes is found trying to cross the highway, the mountain patrol team will conduct temporary traffic control as soon as possible to allow the flock to safely pass through the wildlife passage and ensure that it is as little as possible to be disturbed by humans on the way back.

University of Australia develops new drug that is expected to treat blood vessel blockage caused by new crown-Xinhua English.news.cn
Xinhua News Agency, Sydney, July 26 (Reporter Chen Yu) Researchers at Monash University in Australia are developing a new drug that helps prevent heart disease and stroke, and hope that this drug can be used to treat blood vessels caused by the new coronavirus Blocked.
Researchers have found that before a heart attack or stroke, an enzyme in platelets accelerates platelet clotting.
As a result, they developed a drug that can temporarily inhibit platelet clotting, thereby avoiding clogging of blood vessels and preventing heart disease and stroke.
The researchers said that this drug will only inhibit the clotting effect of platelets when there are signs of heart disease or stroke.
Since studies have shown that similar blood vessel blockage is one of the main causes of death in severely ill patients with new coronary disease, researchers hope that this drug can be used in the treatment of such severely ill patients in the future.
At present, the drug has achieved good results in animal model experiments, and researchers are preparing for the next phase of human clinical trials.
The research results have been published in the American journal "Science and Translational Medicine" a few days ago.

China News Service, Hami, Xinjiang, July 26th, title: Xinjiang is deeply plowing the "sunflower field" and making good use of clean energy
More than 6000 pentagonal heliostats, each 48 square meters, are neatly arranged in a circle, like a silver "sunflower field", which rotates with the sun and reflects the sunlight to the 200-meter-high heat-absorbing tower in the center to realize power generation .
The reporter saw this scene on the 25th at the CLP Engineering Hami molten salt tower solar thermal power plant in Naomaohu Town, Yiwu County, Hami City, Xinjiang.
"The so-called molten salt tower solar thermal power generation is to concentrate sunlight through the mirror surface to the heat absorption tower to form heat energy, and then convert the heat energy into electric energy through traditional power generation technology."
Zhang Yong, deputy general manager of CLP Hami Solar Thermal Power Generation Co., Ltd., said that its design principle is similar to the solar cookers used in rural areas in Northwest China, which must gather sunlight.
The power plant started construction in October 2017 and was connected to the grid at the end of last year. It covers an area of 6,600 mu and plans to install 14,500 heliostats.
"Compared with traditional solar power generation technology, its biggest advantage is that it can store the concentrated heat energy and generate electricity at night."
Zhang Yong said that the 13-hour heat storage system configured in the project can keep the generator set in continuous and stable operation without being affected by changes in light; it can also quickly participate in grid peak shaving according to the demand of grid load peaks and valleys.
After the project is completed, it can generate 198 million kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, save more than 60,000 tons of standard coal, reduce more than 60 tons of sulfur dioxide, more than 60 tons of nitrogen oxides, about 20 tons of soot, and more than 150,000 tons of carbon dioxide each year. Provide a steady stream of clean energy for the local area.
In addition, there is another silver "sunflower field" in the Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park in Hami City.
The Hami Fuguang Solar Photovoltaic Power Station covers an area of more than 2,300 acres. The 714 power generation equipment that have been built also follow the sun and always maintain a 90-degree right angle between the sunlight and the surface of the concentrating panel.
"We use dual-axis tracking concentrating power generation technology. Through unified integrated control, all power generation equipment will adjust the angle according to the sun's height to maintain power generation efficiency."
Duan Mengqi, the station's head, said that in good weather conditions, the power generation technology can increase the efficiency of conventional photovoltaic power generation by about 20%.
In the first half of this year, the power station has achieved power generation of more than 7 million kWh, supplementing local electricity demand.
Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park is currently a photovoltaic industry demonstration park with the largest monomer scale and the most complete types of photovoltaic modules in Xinjiang. There are 38 photovoltaic power generation projects and a total installed capacity of 820,000 kilowatts.
The power generation completed in the first half of this year exceeded 110 million kWh, an increase of 6% over the same period in 2019.
Hami is one of the regions with the best solar energy resources in China.
The annual average total solar radiation is more than 6,200 megajoules per square meter, and the annual sunshine hours are about 3,200 hours.
In recent years, the city has vigorously developed the photovoltaic industry and planted "sunflower fields."
A solar power generation scale with installed capacity of more than 2.5 million kilowatts has been built. The city's photovoltaic power generation capacity exceeded 1.4 billion kWh in the first half of this year, an increase of about 14% year-on-year.
At present, there are more than 330 grid-connected photovoltaic power stations in Xinjiang, with installed capacity exceeding 10 million kilowatts.
It is estimated that this year's photovoltaic power generation will reach 15 billion kWh, which can replace more than 6 million tons of standard coal.

U.S. media revealed the truth about the U.S. unprovoked request for China to close the Consulate General in Houston
On the 24th, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs notified the US Embassy in China that the Chinese side decided to revoke the permission for the establishment and operation of the US Consulate General in Chengdu, and made specific requirements for the consulate general to stop all business and activities, as a response to the US’s sudden request for China’s closure on the 21st. Countermeasures taken by the Consulate General in Houston.
This behavior of the US government has aroused many concerns, and its political motives have been questioned by foreign media and scholars.
Why is China required to close the consulate general?
Many foreign media said that it is not clear why the United States chose the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, but for the purpose of this move, foreign media bluntly stated: for the general election.
CNN reported on the 23rd that the U.S. request that China close the Consulate General in Houston has aroused public doubts about its political motives.
The article stated that the disastrous response of the US government to the new crown epidemic has caused President Trump's pre-election poll support rate to be relatively low.
White House officials said privately that the tough strategy adopted against China was to save Trump's approval rate and also to shift the responsibility of the White House's failure to respond to the epidemic.
The article believes that the Chinese Consulate in Houston is a "political-driven and very cautious" target chosen by the United States. The US government chose it "to create a tough attitude while avoiding the risk of major conflict."
The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) also believes that when the US election season is approaching and the US economy is severely hit by the epidemic, Trump believes that "playing the'China card' has a political advantage."
The current situation is "a spiraling, tit-for-tat struggle", which is promoted to a certain extent by the US government from the perspective of domestic considerations, and will only worsen the tension between China and the United States.
CBS reported that Trump’s re-election prospects are under pressure due to the outbreak, and he has repeatedly accused China of the outbreak.
Almost every day, the United States takes new actions against Trump's absurd thesis that "China exploits the United States".
"The Consulate General of Houston is very important in establishing ties between the two countries"
The Associated Press commented that the United States' request for China to close its consulate in Houston has aggravated tensions between the two largest economies in the world.
If the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is closed, in addition to diplomatic impact, Chinese citizens located in the southern United States will face difficulties in obtaining consular services, as will American citizens seeking visas and other services.
A Houston business group expressed regret over the US request of China to close the Consulate General in Houston, saying that the Consulate General has played an important role in establishing trade, investment and cultural ties between the two countries.
The Associated Press believes that this reflects the importance of China's economy.
The website of the US "Foreign Policy" magazine believes that the US move "is part of a series of provocative measures that will only worsen US-China relations."
Reuters quoted Jonathan Pollack, an expert on East Asia issues at the Brookings Institution, a US think tank, as saying that since the establishment of comprehensive diplomatic relations between the United States and China in 1979, he could not think of any action that would be compatible with the United States’ attack on the Chinese Consulate in Houston. This action comes on par.
Hong Kong’s "South China Morning Post" reported that this move by the United States was unprecedented in the more than 40 years of diplomatic relations between China and the United States.
Analysts believe that this move may cause lasting damage.
The Chinese Consulate General in Houston was established in 1979 and was the first Chinese Consulate General in the United States.
Currently, China has one embassy and five consulates-generals in the United States.

The spokesperson emphasized that the Chinese government is a staunch defender of cyber security and has always resolutely opposed and combated any form of cyber attacks and cyber crimes.
A reporter asked: According to the media, hacker organizations related to China have interfered with the network system of a British company, launched attacks on British and American technology companies with patent data, and invaded the government networks of EU countries.
The spokesperson said that the Chinese government is a staunch defender of cyber security and has always resolutely opposed and cracked down on any form of cyber attacks and cyber crimes.
Cyberspace is highly virtual, difficult to trace, and diverse actors. Sufficient evidence should be presented when investigating and identifying cyber incidents, and no unreasonable guesses should be made.

Free nucleic acid testing in Urumqi, most districts have basically completed secondary testing in high-risk areas
China News Service, Urumqi, July 26 (Reporter Sun Tingwen and Zhao Yamin) Zhang Wei, director of the Urumqi Health Commission, reported on the latest outbreak and nucleic acid testing in Urumqi on the 26th, saying that at present, most areas of Urumqi’s free nucleic acid testing work have been basically completed. carry out.
The expert group of the State Council and the experts of the autonomous region and Urumqi city are making further assessments of the development of the epidemic based on the results of nucleic acid testing and epidemiological investigations.
The Press Office of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region held a press conference on the 26th to report on the epidemic situation and its prevention and control in Xinjiang.
According to him, from 0 am to 24:00 on July 25, 22 new cases of new coronary pneumonia were confirmed in Urumqi City (5 of them were asymptomatic infections converted to confirmed cases), and 38 new cases of asymptomatic infections were added.
As of 24:00 on July 25, Urumqi City has 135 confirmed cases and 147 asymptomatic infections.
The newly-added asymptomatic infections on the 25th were basically detected through the city's free nucleic acid test and active screening.
Zhang Wei, director of the Urumqi Municipal Health Commission, said on the 26th that most districts in Urumqi City have basically completed free nucleic acid testing.
He also said that from the experience of other regions in the country, there are many factors that affect the results of nucleic acid testing, such as the sensitivity of the test reagent, the time of infection and detoxification of the tested person, and the cooperation of the tested person when the specimen is taken (poor cooperation may lead to the specimen Not taken in place) and the testing environment, the operating proficiency of the inspectors, etc.
For various reasons, false negative results can also occur in nucleic acid testing.
The so-called false negative means that the tested person is indeed an infected person, but the nucleic acid test result is negative.
In addition, for people who have had close contact with confirmed cases and suspected cases, two nucleic acid tests are usually required to exclude them.
For people who have been to high-risk areas of the epidemic, if they have fever and respiratory symptoms, a negative nucleic acid test may have a false negative, so two nucleic acid tests are needed to rule out.
He said that, in view of the above situation, for the health of the people of all ethnic groups in the city, starting today, Urumqi City will conduct a second free nucleic acid test in key areas such as Tianshan District and Shayibake District, and carry out "checking for omissions" at the same time.
It is reported that Tianshan District and Shayibak District are high-risk areas of the epidemic.

Representatives of the US-China Business Talks meet in August
Hong Kong’s South China Morning Post quoted an anonymous person familiar with the matter as reporting that Liu He, the head of China’s trade negotiation team and vice premier of the State Council, and Lai Haizhe, co-leader of the US team and trade representative, are expected to hold formal talks in August to assess the performance of the two parties. The situation of the first phase of the US trade agreement.
The report said that although China has substantially increased its purchases of American agricultural products in the past few months, due to factors such as the new crown virus epidemic, China's purchases are still some distance from the amounts promised in the trade agreement.
Analysts say that the recent closure of each other's consulates by the United States and China, together with other disputes, may undermine any progress in trade between the two sides.
The first phase of the Sino-US trade agreement came into effect one month after it was signed on January 15. The agreement stipulates that the high-level trade framework group formed by the two sides should hold talks every six months.
According to people familiar with the matter, the meeting will be "an important turning point" for both parties to assess the progress of the agreement.
But this person also said that if the tension between the United States and China leads to a low willingness to talk at this time, the two sides may agree that the May 8 conference call between Lai Haizhe and Liu He has met the terms of the semi-annual talks in the trade agreement.
Since the beginning of this year, Sino-US relations have deteriorated rapidly. Disputes between the two sides include a series of issues such as the origin of the new crown virus, trade, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, the South China Sea, and ideology.
Although US President Trump boasted about his achievements in the first phase of the agreement at the beginning of the year, his attitude has changed recently.
He said at a White House press conference on the 23rd that although China has recently purchased a record amount of US corn in a single day and has also bought a lot of soybeans, "but this trade agreement is not as meaningful to me as it was when it was reached."
An anonymous Beijing government consultant also believes that due to the poor relationship between the United States and China, a new round of trade negotiations is unlikely to take place.
However, he revealed that Chinese economic and trade related units still met on the 23rd to discuss a series of issues, including how to increase imports from the United States. "We have tried our best to buy, so any additional procurement will be difficult."
Peng Jiening, vice chairman of the US-China Business Council, said that maintaining the momentum of the first phase of the agreement is “more important than ever” and that China has made progress this year in further opening its financial markets to US companies.
An analyst at Plenum, an independent research firm, said: "It is better to talk than nothing, although it may only be regarded as a routine matter."

On the contrary, the market is very good now. Even at this point in time, the most recent IPO of Chinese companies in the United States has Good time."
Hao Yusheng, chief representative of the Nasdaq Stock Exchange in China, said at the "2020 Listed Company Leadership Summit China Stocks Branch" hosted by Xueqiu.

Everyone was asking if they could go public in the U.S. in the future, but then we discovered that these problems were not a problem on the investors' side. Investors had a recent roadshow to the U.S. for IPO. These questions may be asked, and even become standardized questions, but they are not regarded by investors as an important factor in investing or not investing in a Chinese company.
It is recommended that everyone treat the current situation with a calm mind as much as possible.
Of course, this may seem to be the worst situation in the past two years, but in terms of investor appetite, it has not been affected in any way.
So from now until the end of this year or before the US general election, the upsurge of going to the US for IPOs will continue. "

Compared with the same period last year, it has rebounded, up by more than 52.4%; in terms of industry distribution, the number of IPOs in the healthcare industry in the first half of this year was outstanding, an increase of 100% over the same period last year.
According to Hao Yusheng, the quality of Chinese companies that went to the US for IPO in the first half of this year is relatively high, and high-quality companies with strong fundamentals and growth potential will be more favored by investors.
From a short-term, mid-term and long-term perspective, Hao Yusheng continues to be optimistic about Ming Chinese companies' IPO in the United States.
"In the short term, the upsurge of going to the U.S. for IPOs continues; in the medium term, Chinese companies have more choices. A-shares, Hong Kong stocks, and U.S. stocks. Everyone will consider the U.S. election and Sino-U.S. relations as market choices and timing considerations. In the long run, , Everything will return to normal. Market fluctuations are cycles. There are political cycles and economic cycles, and they will eventually return to the normal stage. The stock market has always moved forward with volatility."
Hao Yusheng also said, “There are many uncertain factors this year, but for high-quality companies, no matter whether the market is good or bad, as long as they are solid and have growth that investors can see, other factors are relatively minor. Yes, investors need to invest in outstanding Chinese companies."

People's Daily Commentator: Concentrate on doing your own affairs well and create new advantages for future development-on studying and implementing General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech at the entrepreneurs forum-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 25th, People’s Daily, July 26th commentator’s article: Concentrate on doing your own affairs and create new advantages for future development
At present, the global epidemic and the world economic situation are still severe and complex, and the challenges my country faces in its development are unprecedented.
Maintaining strategic determination, enhancing confidence in victory, and focusing our efforts on doing our own affairs are the keys to our response to various risks and challenges.
At the recent entrepreneurs forum, General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized that in the current external environment of rising protectionism, downturn in the world economy, and shrinking global markets, we must concentrate our efforts on our own affairs and give full play to the advantages of the domestic super-large-scale market. , Gradually form a new development pattern with the domestic big cycle as the main body and the domestic and international double cycles mutually promoting each other, improve the modernization level of the industrial chain and supply chain, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation, accelerate key core technology research, and create new advantages for future development.
The one who observes the situation is wise, the one who controls the situation wins.
In the external environment of the in-depth development of economic globalization, the "two ends" of the market and resources have played an important role in the rapid development of our country.
Now, the world under the impact of the epidemic is undergoing profound changes, facing more unstable and uncertain factors, and economic globalization is encountering headwinds and waves of backlash.
To be prepared for a longer period of time to respond to changes in the external environment, and to promote my country’s economy to ride the winds and waves, stabilize and achieve long-term development, an extremely important aspect is to take the expansion and satisfaction of domestic demand as the strategic basis for development, and give full play to its own advantages. Prospering the domestic economy and unblocking the domestic cycle will add impetus to my country's economic development and drive the recovery of the world economy.
We must deeply realize that building a complete domestic demand system has a bearing on my country's long-term development and long-term stability.
The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China reviewed the situation and clearly stated that it is necessary to resolutely implement the strategy of expanding domestic demand. This is the need to cope with the impact of the epidemic, to maintain the long-term sustainable and healthy development of my country's economy, and to meet the needs of the people's ever-growing good life.
The advantage of a major country's economy is that it is internally recyclable.
my country has the world's most complete and largest industrial system, strong production capacity, and complete supporting capabilities. It has more than 100 million market players and more than 170 million people with higher education or various professional skills, including more than 400 million The super large-scale domestic demand market formed by the 1.4 billion middle-income groups is currently in the rapid development stage of new industrialization, informatization, urbanization, and agricultural modernization, with huge investment demand potential.
Public ownership is the main body, multiple ownership economies develop together, distribution according to work is the main body, and multiple distribution methods coexist. The socialist market economic system and other socialist basic economic systems can not only stimulate the vitality of various market entities, liberate and develop social productive forces, It can also promote the organic unity of efficiency and fairness, and continuously realize common prosperity.
We must firmly grasp the strategic basis of expanding domestic demand, make production, distribution, and circulation more dependent on the domestic market to achieve a virtuous circle, clarify the strategic direction of supply-side structural reforms, and promote aggregate supply and aggregate demand to a higher level. Achieve dynamic balance.
It is necessary to accelerate the construction of a complete domestic demand system, vigorously promote technological innovation and other innovations, accelerate the promotion of strategic emerging industries such as digital economy, intelligent manufacturing, life and health, and new materials, form more new growth points and growth poles, and gradually form A new development pattern that takes the domestic cycle as the main body and the domestic and international double cycles promote each other.
Openness brings progress, and closure will inevitably fall behind.
General Secretary Xi Jinping has repeatedly emphasized that China's door to opening up will not close, but will only open wider and wider.
Taking the domestic cycle as the main body, it is by no means a closed door to operate, but by leveraging the potential of domestic demand to better connect the domestic market with the international market, and make better use of the two international and domestic markets and two resources to achieve a stronger and more Sustainable development.
At the same time, there is no contradiction between expanding domestic demand and opening up. The smoother the domestic cycle, the more conducive to building a new pattern of openness, and the more conducive to forming new advantages in participating in international cooperation and competition.
Although the current international protectionist trend is rising, we must stand on the right side of history, persist in deepening reforms, expanding opening up, strengthening open cooperation in the field of science and technology, promoting the building of an open world economy, and building a community with a shared future for mankind.
The Chinese nation has experienced many hardships in history, but it has never been crushed.
On the way forward, there is the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, the significant advantages of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, strong mobilization capabilities and strong comprehensive strength, and the unity of the entire party, the army, and the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country. Struggle, we will be able to overcome all difficulties and obstacles, maintain the momentum of my country's economic and social development, build a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way, and smoothly embark on a new journey of building a modern socialist country in an all-round way!
Yu'ebao's revenue declines, "post-90s" but "retaliatory" to save money?
With the decline in Yu'e Bao's income, the "post-90s" not only did not escape from Yu'e Bao, but began to "retaliate" saving money?
The "Yuebao Post-90s Post-90s Savings Report" (2020 version) recently released by the China New Economic Research Institute and Alipay shows that in the first half of the year, post-90s are more likely to save money: the average amount of money saved per capita has increased by nearly 40% compared to 2019.
What's interesting is that "post-90s" tend to start saving from a small amount of money, and 60% of the savings are less than 20 yuan per transaction...…
Saving money with Yu'e Bao has also become the habit of saving money for "post-90s".
Data shows that among the 700 million Yu'ebao users, 134 million are "post-90s."
There are 174 million "post-90s" in China, that is to say, about 3 out of 4 "post-90s" in the country are using Yu'e Bao to save money.
At present, the 7-day annualized rate of return of currency funds such as Yu'ebao has fallen to around 1.5% from a level of higher than 2% at the beginning of the year.
Even so, it did not affect the pace of saving money for the "post-90s".
In the context of the enhancement of Yu'e Bao's “money saving effect”, many young people who are accustomed to using Yu'e Bao have directly transformed into “basic people”.
According to Alipay data, as of July 13, the number of new "basic people" on Alipay has more than doubled year-on-year in the past month, and more and more young people have achieved "advanced" financial management on Alipay.
Some analysts believe that the inflow of funds from Yu'ebao into the stock market is also an important reason for the clear decline in currency fund shares in June.
The report also shows that "post-90s" girls are more inclined to save more money, which is on average 20% higher than that of boys; 60% of users who hold funds on the Alipay platform are men, and women tend to choose more than men. A more robust financial management method.
After saving money, what plans does the "post-90s" have?
Alipay data shows that "post-90s" have the habit of saving money for their goals, and the most users make travel as their goal to save money.
Affected by the epidemic, many "post-90s" save money to prepare for travel after the epidemic; the resumption of movie theaters also provides a new way to switch from saving money to consumption.

France increases military investment in space-Xinhuanet
French Defense Minister Florence Parley said on the 24th that France will add hundreds of millions of euros to its space defense budget to develop space military forces to prevent "unfriendly moves" that other countries may make in outer space.
Parley told the Provence newspaper that between 2019 and 2025, the expenditure budget for French space military projects will increase from the previously planned 3.6 billion euros (approximately 4.2 billion US dollars) to 4.3 billion euros (5 billion US dollars).
According to the French Military Planning Act from 2019 to 2025 approved by the French Parliament in 2018, France is expected to update its existing observation satellites and communication satellites in the future, launch 3 electromagnetic detection satellites, and improve the modernization level of space surveillance radars.
French President Emmanuel Macron announced in July last year that the French Air Force will establish a space military command and an "Aviation and Space Force."
Parley said that she will formally announce the establishment of the space force when she visits a military academy in Salon, Provence.
Parley said that this space force is affiliated to the Air Force and will have 500 personnel by 2025.
She said: "In the past, people thought that space serves the common interests of science. This idea is gone forever. Now space is a place where countries compete for global hegemony."
Parley reiterated Macron's previous statement, saying that France has no intention to provoke an arms race.
"We are by no means engaged in an arms race. But it is my responsibility to thoroughly recognize the threats we may face."
Parley revisited the surveillance of a military satellite shared by France and Italy in 2017.
She said that the "spy" was a Russian satellite.
The Russian side denies this statement.
Parley said that France "soon" will have small patrol satellites that can detect and lock "the black hands behind those unfriendly actions."
French media believe that the reason why France is seeking to establish a space force is due to US President Donald Trump's request in February last year that the US Department of Defense draft a bill to establish a space force.
Trump signed the National Defense Authorization Act in December last year, approving the establishment of the sixth largest U.S. service, the Space Force.
Some experts worry that these US measures have accelerated the pace of US space militarization and may trigger a new round of space arms race.

China News Service, Chongqing, July 26 (Reporter Han Lu) The reporter learned from the China Railway Chengdu Bureau Group Co., Ltd. on the 26th that the Zhengwan High-speed Railway Small Three Gorges Tunnel with a total length of about 18.9 kilometers was completed on the same day.
It is understood that the Small Three Gorges Tunnel is not only the longest high-speed rail tunnel within the Three Gorges Reservoir area, but also the longest single-hole double-track high-speed rail tunnel with a design speed of 350 km/h among the projects currently under construction in China.
Zhengzhou-Wanzhou high-speed railway is located in the three provinces and cities of Henan, Hubei and Chongqing. It is connected to the Beijing-Guangzhou and Xulan high-speed rails in the north of Zhengzhou, and the Yu-Wanzhou high-speed rail is connected to Chongqing in the south of Wanzhou. An important part of the Hunan Passage.
The Zhengwan High-speed Railway Small Three Gorges Tunnel was fully completed on the 26th.
The picture shows through the scene.
The Zhengzhou-Wanzhou high-speed railway starts in Zhengzhou City, Henan Province, and runs southwest through Pingdingshan City, Nanyang City, and Xiangyang City in Hubei Province to Wanzhou District of Chongqing City. The new line is about 818 kilometers long, with a design speed of 350 kilometers per hour, and about 184 kilometers in Chongqing.
Among them, the Zhengzhou-Xiangyang section has been opened for operation in advance on December 1, 2019, and the Chongqing section is stepping up its construction.
The Small Three Gorges Tunnel, which passed through on the 26th, is a full-line control project of Zhengwan High-speed Railway. The project is located at the junction of Fengjie County and Wushan County in Chongqing City.
Construction of the tunnel began in February 2017, and the tunnel will be completed on July 26, 2020.
According to Wang Guojun, head of Zhengwan high-speed railway tunnel design at the China Railway Second Academy Engineering Group Co., Ltd., the survey and design party, the small Three Gorges Tunnel is located in very complicated terrain and geological conditions. For Class I high-risk tunnels, tunnel design and construction are extremely difficult.
“During the construction of the project, we used geological survey methods, geophysical methods, and advanced drilling methods to make advance geological predictions, and adopted special design plans for more than 30 caves of various types. For example, we designed and built a 24-meter-long bridge across the tunnel. Large karst caves with a longitudinal length of more than 10 meters and a depth of more than 55 meters can avoid tunnel settlement." Wang Guojun said.
According to the construction party, China Railway Tunnel Bureau, the construction of the tunnel adopted a combination of dredging and blocking, through the construction of horizontal tunnels, grouting, water blocking, strengthening of the tunnel structure support, and construction of sewage treatment stations, which ensured the orderly progress of the project. It also avoids the damage of construction drainage to the water body of the Small Three Gorges Scenic Area. At the same time, it successfully overcomes the construction problems of 7 kilometers long soft rock large deformation and other bad geology, and daily maximum water inflow of 157,000 cubic meters. .
After the Zhengzhou-Wanzhou high-speed rail line is completed and opened to traffic, it will become a new convenient and fast passenger transport channel from Southwest China to the Central Plains, North China, and Northeast China. The process of resource development and urbanization is of great significance to promote coordinated regional development and to promote the implementation of the strategy for the development of the western region.
Experts say it is unconstitutional to collect immigration data through the U.S. Census for seat allocation in the House of Representatives
Some civil rights organizations and several U.S. cities and counties filed suits against the U.S. federal government, claiming that the Trump Presidential Palace’s attempts to exclude undocumented immigrants from the U.S. Census are unworkable and unconstitutional.
The U.S. Census will determine the distribution of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Sarah Brannon, the executive attorney of the American Civil Liberties Alliance, told VOA, "It won't work."
She went on to say that Trump's requirement to determine the citizenship of the census in the census is difficult and "not very reliable."
Another civil liberties organization Common Cause filed a lawsuit on Thursday to challenge Trump's executive order.
Some cities in New Jersey and Georgia joined the lawsuit.
Arlington County, Virginia, also joined the lawsuit on Friday.
Arlington County Board of Management Chairman Garvey said, "The U.S. Constitution requires an accurate count of our population every 10 years. We must accurately count everyone who lives in Arlington County, and we must not let this illegal attempt scare away. People and shrinking the number of our immigrant communities succeeded."
Other organizations and individuals praised President Trump's executive order.
Alabama Attorney General Marshall called the executive order a "victory" for the state.
He said, "The allocation of seats in the House of Representatives and electoral college seats in each state must be based on the number of residents living in each state, and the number of residents living legally."
The US Supreme Court last year prevented the Trump administration from including citizenship issues in the 2020 census form.
President Trump signed an executive order earlier this week instructing the Secretary of Commerce of the U.S. Census Bureau to submit data on the undocumented population obtained from the census so that the administration can exclude these undocumented populations from the state census In addition to the number, and to determine whether each state will increase or decrease or maintain the seats of the House of Representatives.

Acting in response to the trend and advancing the construction of industrial projects-Viewpoint Headline-Hunan Daily-Huasheng Online
In the midsummer of Hunan, the heat wave is blowing.
The enthusiasm released by the provincial industrial project construction promotion on-site observation meeting overwhelmed the heat of the dog days, and the clear orientation of "comparing the strength of the industry and the hero of the project" agitated the three Hunan and four rivers.
The development of Hunan always depends on building projects and training industries.
Facing the extremely unusual first half of the year, under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, the whole province insisted on a game of chess, went all out to fight the two tough battles of epidemic prevention and flood prevention, and implemented industrial projects as the implementation of "six stability". The "first move" of "six guarantees".
From a year-on-year decline of 1.9% in GDP in the first quarter to a year-on-year growth of 1.3% in the first half of the year, it is self-evident that the period was difficult and the effort was huge.
In this precious report card, the construction of industrial projects is the key support for Hunan's rapid economic recovery and stable development.
The situation can be smooth and irreversible.
The construction of industrial projects should be put into the overall situation. It is not only good at accumulating, accumulating, and seeking momentum, but also good at recognizing changes, seeking changes, and adapting to changes.
In the current complex and severe background of the current international situation, in addition to the hard work of attracting investment, it is necessary to calm down to study the new characteristics of the current new situation, to grasp the rules, to be more scientific and accurate, and to better integrate into the domestic and international markets. A new development pattern in which dual cycles promote each other.
Pay more attention to improving the basic capabilities of the industry.
In the first half of the year, not only did a large number of heavyweight investment projects in emerging industries break ground and sow hopes in our province, but also enterprises in traditional advantageous industries accelerated their deployment in digital, intelligent, and green industrial transformation.
The Yiyang Aoshikang Third Science Park project transforms the existing production line, and the intelligent high-end printed circuit board production line takes the lead; the new factory area of Hunan China Tobacco Changde Cigarette Factory is committed to intelligent transformation and the process of building a modern factory. Vivid portrayal of "old trees sprout"... Only by focusing on the major national strategy and the "two new and one heavy" strategy, focusing on consolidating and upgrading advantageous industries, actively cultivating and developing emerging industries, and comprehensively increasing technological innovation and localization substitution, can we continue to consolidate basic conditions, Accumulate momentum for transformation.
Pay more attention to cultivating and developing new economics, new business forms and new models.
The sudden new crown epidemic has brought about the popularity of the "cloud economy", stimulated the potential of the digital economy, and provided new opportunities for industrial transformation: in the first half of the year, the province's computer and office equipment manufacturing, electronic and communication equipment manufacturing industries grew by 12.6 %, the online retail sales of wholesale and retail enterprises above designated size increased by 32.2% year-on-year, and the online meal fee income of catering companies increased by 35.6% year-on-year.
It is the general trend to nurture new opportunities amidst the crisis, open a new game amidst changes, actively promote digital industrialization and industrial digitization, and guide the integrated development of the digital economy and the real economy.
Pay more attention to optimizing and stabilizing the supply chain of the industrial chain.
Construction machinery is the main force in Hunan's industry, but two-thirds of the supporting enterprises are outside the province, and there is still room and potential in the supporting chain.
Strengthening industrial chain thinking and grasping projects requires not only the continuous accumulation of leading companies and the realization of technological breakthroughs in key links of the industrial chain, but also the efforts of various regions to cultivate and stimulate the "chain" reaction by strengthening the chain to supplement the chain and promote the coordination of related supporting industries. Layout, and accelerate the construction of an independent, controllable, safe and reliable industrial chain supply chain.
To overcome difficulties and support enterprises, Hunan is still a hot spot and paradise where business environment is good and market opportunities emerge.
All parts of the province have frequently recruited, new and practical measures, in the belief that the "burden reduction" of corporate relief has led to the "acceleration" of high-quality development; Shaoyang implements "shareholder-style" services, and does not shirk shirkiness for enterprises, and does not discount policies. , The problem is not solved overnight... In the process of restoring the losses caused by the epidemic, various "do everything possible" to pinpoint shortcomings and pain points, and turn crises into opportunities.
Focusing on researching, cultivating, and developing industries, and optimizing the business environment steadily, will surely win more investors' favor
The wind and waves are still ahead, but the state of riding the wind and waves has become the norm for the province to focus on the construction of industrial projects and promote high-quality development.
At this critical time, we must learn and implement the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping’s important instructions, effectively respond to external uncertainties with the certainty of our own work, persevere in promoting industrial project construction, share enthusiasm and sweat to ensure " The 13th Five-Year Plan and the completion of a moderately prosperous society in all respects came to a successful conclusion.

Employment and prices are generally stable, showing that the economy has "temperature"-Chinanews.com

Employment and prices are generally stable, demonstrating the "temperature" of the economy
Lin Huocan, reporter of Economic Daily and China Economic Net
In the first half of this year, facing the impact of the new crown pneumonia epidemic, my country has coordinated efforts to promote epidemic prevention and control and economic and social development. The epidemic prevention and control situation has continued to improve, the economy has been recovering steadily, and the performance of employment and prices that are closely related to people's livelihood are generally stable. , China's economy has handed over a report card of economic performance with warmth.
In the first two months of this year, the surveyed unemployment rate increased.
Especially in February, many enterprises' production and operation activities were basically in a state of suspension of work and production, and enterprises' labor demand decreased, recruitment was delayed or cancelled, and the surveyed unemployment rate in cities and towns increased.
With the gradual improvement of the epidemic prevention and control situation, the production and life order of the whole society has been continuously restored.
The Party Central Committee adheres to the general tone of seeking progress while maintaining stability, further intensifies macro-policy hedging, comprehensively strengthens the employment priority policy, and actively promotes assistance to enterprises to stabilize jobs and expand employment.
my country has stepped up policy hedging to stabilize jobs, hit the "reduction, exemption, delay, return and compensation" policy combination, phased reduction and exemption of three social insurance unit payment parts, allowing deferred payment of social insurance premiums, and expanding the unemployment insurance for small and medium-sized enterprises to reimburse the stable jobs and pay for workers. For the benefit of the training policy, enterprises will be given subsidies for absorbing the employment of key groups, subsidies for internships, etc.
With the implementation of various employment stabilization policies, the demand for employment by enterprises has steadily picked up, the employment situation has gradually improved, and the surveyed unemployment rate in urban areas has gradually decreased. In June, the surveyed unemployment rate was 5.7%.
Zhang Yi, director of the Population and Employment Statistics Department of the National Bureau of Statistics, said that in the second quarter, various employment policies continued to be effective. The labor force who withdrew due to the impact of the epidemic in the early stage returned one after another. The urban labor participation rate in June increased by about 10 percentage points compared with February. The level was close to the same period last year.
Data show that the total urban employment in June increased by more than 19% compared with February, and most industries reached the pre-epidemic level; the average weekly working hours of corporate employees reached 46.8 hours, an increase of 6.6 hours from February and slightly higher than January by 0.1 hours.
Prices are also related to millions of households.
In January this year, the CPI rose by 5.4% year-on-year, setting a new high for many years.
Entering February, although the year-on-year increase of CPI fell slightly, it was still in the “5 range”.
The year-on-year growth rate of CPI is at a high level, due to factors driving consumer demand before the Spring Festival, as well as factors such as the wrong month of the Spring Festival and a low year-on-year base.
However, the impact of the new crown pneumonia epidemic on prices is particularly obvious.
Affected by the prevention and control of the epidemic, in January and February, there were delays in logistics, untimely supply of materials, and increased transportation costs of materials in various parts of the country. In addition, some citizens were hoarding and rushing to buy, and the prices of some daily necessities increased significantly.
In response to the disturbances caused by the epidemic prevention and control to the price situation, relevant departments included important living materials into the scope of emergency transportation guarantee to ensure smooth transportation of materials.
Thanks to a series of policy measures, the market supply of vegetables and fruits has been strongly guaranteed.
In response to the rapid increase in pork prices at the beginning of this year, after the central government promulgated the policy of ensuring supply and stabilizing prices, various regions and departments quickly implemented them. The supply of pork reserves has improved significantly, the production capacity of live pigs has been restored in an orderly manner, and the order of production and sales has gradually become normal.
Since March, pork prices have continued to fall. In May, the year-on-year increase in food prices fell to 10.6%; in June, affected by factors such as the slowdown in slaughter of live pigs, the reduction in imports, and the rebound in group consumer demand, pork prices rose slightly from the previous month.
The seasonal changes in fresh vegetable prices are obvious, with an average increase of 3.4% in the first half of the year.
Affected by the high comparison base in the same period last year, the price of fresh fruits continued to decline year-on-year, with an average drop of 13.3% in the first half of the year.
The basic lives of the people are effectively guaranteed, and the overall economic and social situation remains stable and orderly.
With the gradual recovery of transportation and logistics, various regions have increased their efforts to ensure supply, and the market supply and demand situation has improved.
Beginning in March, the CPI fell for four consecutive months, and the year-on-year growth rate dropped from 4.3% in March to 2.5% in June. The overall price level returned to stability.
In the second half of the year, my country's prices will continue to remain at a moderate level, and overall inflationary pressure will not be large, but it is still necessary to promote the restoration of production and living order under the premise of normalizing epidemic prevention and control.
Effectively respond to natural disasters such as floods and droughts in the main agricultural production areas such as grains, fruits and vegetables, strengthen market supervision, and resolutely crack down on behaviors that disrupt market order such as hoarding and price hikes.

This spring, because of the need for epidemic prevention and control to set up road access barriers in various places, the path of beekeepers "chasing flowers and honey" was blocked. Many bees died due to missed flowering and lack of food, and the income of beekeepers was seriously affected.
"At the end of the year, the beekeepers traveled long distances from Yunnan and Sichuan all the way north to the northwest region following the flowering period.
As a business, we have a responsibility to help them. "
Wu Na said.
"Little bees are'environmental scouts', and bees cannot survive in heavily polluted areas." Zhao Xiaochuan, executive vice president of China Bee Products Association, introduced that bee pollination is an important link in the ecological chain, which is important for protecting plant diversity and improving ecology.

"The economic, ecological and social benefits created by bee pollination are far greater than the value of bee products themselves. The bee industry has huge potential in human health, crop production, vegetation reproduction, and ecological protection, and people have always been little aware of this."

Nowadays, the number of beekeepers is decreasing. In addition to beekeepers who are always on the move, there are still many poor households with limited mobility who choose to use beehives to invest in cooperatives.
"The state has financial support. We contact technical personnel for help and guidance. The beekeepers lack understanding and judgment of the market environment. To open a market, they also need the help and coordination of the government, enterprises, and industry associations."
Zhao Xiaochuan said.
"I hope everyone will pay more attention to and help beekeepers in the future," said Wu Na. "Our bee products are also screened and controlled in strict accordance with national standards to ensure quality and protect consumer rights while helping beekeepers."

I slap myself?
U.S. White House advisers "bite" back to work prematurely in various states-Chinanews.com
U.S. White House consultants "bite back" states to resume work too early
On July 23, local time, the number of confirmed cases of new coronary pneumonia in the United States exceeded 4 million, accounting for 30% of global cases.
Over the past few months, US President Trump has repeatedly asked all states across the country to resume work and school. It was only recently that he changed his attitude and took the initiative to wear masks in public, and his consultants even "bited back" and said that some state governments resumed work too early.
On the 22nd, White House presidential adviser Kellyanne Conway stated at a press conference that some state governments had failed to comply with resumption standards and had restarted places such as bars prematurely.
Conway also mentioned that the previous claim that the president has the "absolute power" to decide the resumption of work in each state is a misrepresentation.
"The president is a federalist, and he believes that all states have autonomy."
She defended Trump.
However, the "rumors" in Conway's mouth were personally spoken by Trump at the White House epidemic briefing on April 13.
This self-slapped operation was mocked by netizens as "rewriting history."
Kylian Conway wants to rewrite history. She is a liar.
Trump called Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer a dictator because she followed medical guidelines and insisted on stopping work.
Trump wants to promote the resumption of work so that he can hold a rally.
This is not the first time Kylian Conway has caused controversy.
On April 15, when Conway was interviewed by Fox News, he blurted out: "This is COVID-19, not COVID-1, friends!"
She seemed to understand "19" as a version number and was frantically ridiculed by netizens: read the newspaper without common sense!
Is it reasonable for a 3-year-old child to be smashed while playing in the college playground.

The playground was smashed, and the child was compensated before suing the school
□ Correspondent Zhao Yifan
The 3-year-old Xiaowen was accidentally hit in the head by Chen of the softball team while playing in the playground of a certain university.
After Chen made the compensation, Xiaowen's father, Mr. Wen, served as Xiaowen's legal representative to the school to the court, demanding an apology from the school where the incident occurred, and payment of medical expenses, mental damage relief, etc. totaling 20,000 yuan.
Recently, after hearing the case, the People’s Court of Haidian District of Beijing held that the school had set up a protective net on the playground at the time of the incident, and that it had fulfilled its obligations to ensure proper safety, and Chen had already paid compensation. Based on this judgment, the plaintiff’s decision was rejected. Claims.
Mr. Wen claimed that he took Xiaowen to play on the school playground during the summer vacation of 2019, when the softball team was training on the playground.
In order to avoid the risks posed by this, Xiaowen, Mr. Wen and many other children and parents play in safe areas designated by the softball team.
But then the softball player Chen dropped his hand while pitching, causing the softball to fly over the guard net into the above-mentioned safe area and hit the back of Xiaowen's head.
Mr. Wen immediately took Xiaowen to the hospital for treatment and was diagnosed with head trauma.
Mr. Wen believes that the school stadium facilities do not comply with relevant safety regulations, and the team and related facilities have not been effectively managed.
The school’s negligence caused the above incidents to occur, which caused Xiaowen to suffer tremendous physical and mental pain, and at the same time brought greater pain to his family. The school should bear legal responsibility for this.
In response, the school argued that the school had set up a protective net on the playground, and posted management regulations and training notices, informing them that entering the playground must keep a safe distance from the training site and reminding their own safety. The plaintiff could not prove that the school was “not enough. "Safety guarantee obligation", so I do not agree to compensation.
After the trial, the court held that the site involved in the incident was a site open to the public free of charge by the university involved. Although the school has a safety guarantee obligation for the management of the playground, this safety guarantee obligation only needs to meet the general duty of care.
At the time of the incident, the school set up a protective net on the playground, and has fulfilled its proper safety guarantee obligations. Chen also compensated Xiaowen for various losses including medical expenses and transportation expenses in accordance with the previously reached compensation agreement. Both parties It is agreed that this dispute will be resolved at one time.
After the incident, Xiaowen's parents again claimed compensation from the school. There was no basis in the law. The court ruled that all the plaintiff's claims were rejected.
After the verdict was pronounced, neither party appealed, and the verdict is now in effect.
According to Article 37 of my country’s Tort Liability Law, schools, as managers of public places, have the obligation to ensure safety; in the event that the actions of a third party cause damage to others, the third party bears tort liability, but the safety protection is not fulfilled. The responsible public place manager shall bear corresponding supplementary responsibilities.
The judge stated that as a manager of a public place, he is most likely to understand the actual situation of the entire place and foresee possible dangers and damages, so that he is most likely to take necessary measures to prevent the occurrence of losses or reduce the extent of damage, and to avoid and mitigate them. The cost of damage is the lowest, so the law stipulates that it shall bear the corresponding guarantee obligations for engaging in social activities.
In this case, for unspecified people entering the playground that is free to the public, the school’s safety guarantee obligations should be compatible with the social activities it engages in. Specifically, it should take basic safety measures and deal with hidden dangers. Have the obligation to inform.
In judicial practice, it is not appropriate to impose excessive safety guarantee obligations on managers of public places.
If the school has set up a protective net and fulfilled its obligation of notification, it can be determined that the school is not at fault and should not bear legal responsibility.
In addition, for third-party infringements, even if the administrators of public places such as schools fail to fulfill their obligations to ensure safety, their liability is a supplement to compensation for damages. According to the latest civil code, after the administrator assumes additional liability, You can also claim compensation from a third party.
Therefore, in such accidents, the victims should not expand the scope of compensation after they have received compensation from the direct infringer.
Under the normalization of epidemic prevention and control, people's enthusiasm for exercise and fitness is high.
With the gradual liberalization of inter-provincial tourism business, the tourism market is also about to usher in a recovery.
Fujian Province has resumed its inter-provincial tourism business from July 21. In the first weekend after opening, Xiamen, a popular tourist destination, ushered in a peak in passenger flow.
As a popular tourist destination city, many tourists arrive in Xiamen on weekends.
Xiamen Railway Station expects that Shuyun will send 3.7 million passengers, while the passenger flow at the airport is dominated by students, tourists, and visiting relatives.
The tourism market is gradually picking up. In July, Xiamen Airport operated an average of 440 flights per day, and domestic flights had recovered to 80% of the pre-epidemic value.
Airlines have encrypted the air express lines from Xiamen to Shanghai, Beijing, Kunming, Xi'an and other major cities to seize the revived tourism market.
At present, many travel agencies in Xiamen have successively launched a batch of domestic cross-provincial tourism products during summer vacations, and the group itinerary is mainly based on outdoor attractions.
In response to the summer passenger traffic peaks in railway stations and airports, relevant units have deployed additional manpower in areas where people are easy to gather such as check-in counters and security check lanes. Fujian has also optimized and upgraded the "Bamin Health Code" to achieve a 31 Health data sharing and mutual recognition between the provinces have promoted the orderly recovery of the tourism market.

Israel strengthens prevention and control of repeated epidemics
In the early stage of the outbreak of the new crown pneumonia, Israel's prevention and control measures were effective.
However, with the gradual lifting of the ban on prevention and control measures, the number of confirmed cases of new coronary pneumonia in Israel has recently increased significantly. The Israeli government has repeatedly taken emergency measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic.
On February 28, the first case of new coronary pneumonia was confirmed in Israel. It quickly closed all entry and exit ports, suspended non-essential industries, schools changed to online teaching, restricted public transportation and non-essential social activities, and blocked cities with severe epidemics. The military and police jointly maintain prevention and control measures, etc.
This series of measures quickly achieved positive results. By mid-May, the number of new confirmed cases of new coronary pneumonia in Israel fell back to single digits in a single day.
With the epidemic under control, Israel’s various prevention and control measures have been fully unblocked. Since June, the number of newly diagnosed new coronary pneumonia has gradually rebounded.
Especially since July, the spread of the epidemic has continued to accelerate.
In recent days, there are more than 1,500 new cases in Israel every day for 8 days. As of the time of publication on July 25, there were 916 new cases on that day.
As of July 25, there have been 59,745 confirmed cases and 448 deaths in Israel.
Facing the rapid rebound of the epidemic, the Israeli government has repeatedly taken emergency measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic.
On July 6, after the number of confirmed cases exceeded 30,000, the Israeli government closed public entertainment venues such as gyms, swimming pools, bars, nightclubs, and introduced a policy to restrict public transportation, stipulating that each bus cannot have more than 20 passengers. .
On the 17th, the Israeli government announced a series of new restrictive measures, including the implementation of "closure of the city" on weekends, etc., stipulating that the "closure of the city" shall be implemented from 17:00 every Friday to 5:00 every Sunday.
During this period, people can go out, but shops, shopping centers, barber shops, beauty salons, libraries, zoos, museums, exhibition halls, swimming pools and tourist attractions will be closed, while supermarkets, pharmacies and other basic services will remain open .
At the same time, on all dates and time periods, gatherings of more than 10 people are forbidden, gyms, studios and other places will be closed, restaurants and cafes are forbidden to eat in, and only takeaway services are allowed.
At the same time, the Israeli people did not pay enough attention to the severity of the epidemic and failed to form a joint force with the government in fighting the epidemic.
After the recurrence of the Israeli epidemic, many people took to the streets to protest and march because the government's prevention and control measures affected their economic interests.
On July 11, tens of thousands of people held a demonstration in Tel Aviv, believing that the anti-epidemic policy would affect the economy.
On the evening of the 21st, thousands of protesters gathered in front of Prime Minister Netanyahu’s residence in Jerusalem to protest against Prime Minister Netanyahu’s promulgation of prevention and control measures such as the prohibition of restaurants and cafes without giving corresponding compensation.
In addition, many people also fail to observe the regulations on wearing masks and maintaining a safe social distance of two meters during outdoor activities. In order to avoid being fined by the police for not wearing masks, many people only wear masks on their chins or on their wrists.
During the recurrence of the epidemic, the school was the hardest hit by the spread of the new crown virus. According to a reporter’s recent visit to this kindergarten, it was discovered that neither the teachers nor students in the kindergarten had worn masks as required by the government, nor had they maintained a safe social distance of two meters from each other.

Professor Eli Waxman, a member of the Israeli National Security Council’s expert advisory group to combat the epidemic, believes that Israel is moving towards a “dangerous situation” and pointed out that Israel’s current epidemic prevention and control measures are not enough, and all leisure and entertainment venues and summer vacations should be closed. Schools to control the further spread of the epidemic.
Waxman said that Israel lacks an overall plan to fight the epidemic. The parliament and government departments should abandon their own interests as soon as possible, reach an agreement on the fight against the epidemic, and formulate clear steps that include relevant restrictions on different departments.
Tel Aviv, July 25th, by reporter Wang Jiong in Tel Aviv
Wu Fengfang, a farmer in Guyuan, Ningxia, couldn't help but his wife Dai Tianfu. The two rushed to the Liangyun Cultural Compound from their home 20 miles away in a car.
Despite the inconvenience of legs and feet in the past two years, 77-year-old Dai Tianfu still counts on "come here every other way and get addicted to tricks."
This is an inconspicuous courtyard in Yuanzhou District of Guyuan City. Different from ordinary farmyards, the courtyard often spreads the melodious Qin opera, as well as wonderful shadow puppet shows, embroidery works, traditional Qin opera, and eyebrow opera.
The owner of the compound is called Liang Yun, who was a carpenter.
More than 10 years ago, he loves shadow puppets and sings operas and started planning to build a cultural compound.
With Liangyun Cultural Compound, the cultural life of the villagers has become rich and colorful.
Before the reporter entered the Liangyun Cultural Compound, the tune of Qinqiang had already spread.
It is Bai Lixiang, a villager from the neighboring village, who is singing excerpts from Qinqiang for the folks.
She has loved Qinqiang since she was a child, and now she is well-known in the local area. As long as she has free time, she will come to the cultural compound to perform for the folks.
Recently, Bai Lixiang also played a webcast.
Bai Lixiang said: "It is a very happy thing to have a stage for more people to see themselves performing."
On the stage, the singer gave a stern look, and the player tuned every tune. Although he was an amateur, his enthusiasm was undiminished.
Just like the pristine style of the farmyard, outside of Qinqiang, the "grassroots" art and intangible cultural heritage in the Liangyun Cultural Courtyard are rushing to the face.
The compound also houses more than 300 real objects such as farming utensils of different ages, traditional and hand-made tile sculptures, paper-cutting, embroidery, and shadow puppets.
Liang Yun led the reporter into the exhibition hall in the courtyard, where his collection of old objects, old hip flasks, sanxianzi, and spinning wheels were displayed.
Why does an ordinary farmer build a cultural compound?
"Shadow puppetry is my family handicraft, I have been learning this craft since I was 15 years old."
Liangyun Cultural Courtyard was established in 2012, becoming the first rural "intangible cultural heritage exhibition hall" in Ningxia, and it is also a demonstration compound for intangible cultural heritage protection in Guyuan.
In addition to the Liangyun Cultural Complex, more than 120 cultural complexes and 79 folk performance groups have emerged in Yuanzhou District of Guyuan City. Among them, there are more than 50 cultural complexes of a certain scale, such as Shenjiahe Cultural Complex and Wang Yonghong Cultural Complex. The courtyard, Yanglang Cultural Complex, etc., cover all towns and streets in Yuanzhou District, with more than 5,000 participants.
These grassroots artists are active in the fields, enriching the cultural life of the masses and satisfying their spiritual needs.
"As life gets better, traditional culture cannot just be left behind."
"Liu's spy war drama" is back again, "Odds" to see Liu Yunlong and Li Liqun's opponents "boom show"-Xinhuanet.com
The 40-episode spy war drama "Odds" will be available on Beijing Satellite TV from July 16.
"Success" is adapted from real historical facts and is based on the Soviet military archives that have been sealed for many years and first appeared.
The actor Liu Yunlong, who is well-known to the audience in the "spy war drama", broke through his image in the play and challenged a "stuttering agent" with a sense of joy.
In recent years, the popularity of dramas such as "The Pretender", "Mask", and "Kite" has all proved that the spy war genre has strong vitality.
Different from previous spy war works, "Chance of Winning" looks at the world and extends the background of the story to the Soviet Far East battlefield.
It is set against the background of the final stage of the Anti-Japanese War in 1944. It tells that Tang Fei (played by Liu Yunlong), a CCP’s secret intelligence worker, under the leadership of the Secretary of the Chinese Underground Party Linhe Provincial Committee and the Director of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Agency, executed the Soviet Far East Intelligence Agency’s The story of "Mudan Ula" strategic action.
In many spy war dramas, the male protagonist, as a senior spy, has a perfect image of handsome, high IQ, and maturity.
But in Liu Yunlong’s view, such a person is not suitable for being a spy. "Spy should be someone who can’t be found in the pile of people. If they appear on the scene, they will have a very handsome image. I wish everyone would want it. Pay attention to you, can you still be lurking? There is a line in "Kite", "If you don't come to catch me, I will forget that I am a Kuomintang." The spy is going to be elitist."
Therefore, in "Odds", Liu Yunlong ingeniously designed his protagonist Tang Fei as a "stuttering agent" with a sense of joy.
The other camp in "Winning" is supported by the Japanese Fukuhara played by Liang Guanhua and Fang Shibao, the chief of the National Police Agency played by Li Liqun.
The two powerful actors, one south and one north, add a lot of highlights to the whole show.
Director Yin Fei used the term "Biao Opera" to describe the rivalry between Li Liqun and Liu Yunlong in the play. "It is definitely a Biao Opera. The two of them have a special tacit understanding. The tacit understanding between them is very impactful to me. Many times their The scenes are all'off-the-shelf'. For example, we only wrote half a page in length. If I didn't call to stop during filming, the two of them could continue to perform."
The masters do not rob each other, and the director does not disturb the play. When the actors are in the role and ensure their character status, they can not only shape the role from the perspective of the character, but also bring more viewing to the audience. Possibility, Yin Fei said that this kind of drama is enough.
In the play, you can also see many familiar faces from the "Liu's Spy War". The famous and majestic "Mountain City F4" in "Kite" also gathered three people in "Odds".
Hou Yu and Liu Mingyang, who played Song Xiaoan and Zhao Jianzhi, once again played Tang Fei's right arm.
Director Yin Fei said, "These two people have no inferiority in them. They just drifted with the crowd in that era and that environment."
Liu Yunlong also took the initiative to propose, "We must have a human touch. This human touch means that there must be good and bad people around me, and bad people are enemies, but we must develop them and our team must also grow."
The ending of the two people in the play was also carefully designed by Liu Yunlong, and he believes that he will give the audience a satisfactory answer.

"The Lancet" published an article praising China's efforts to fight the epidemic and encouraging countries to learn from experience-chinanews.com
The Lancet magazine published an article on the 25th that China, as a country with a population of 1.4 billion and a scale similar to Europe or the United States, has effectively controlled the new crown epidemic at this stage, and there has been no large-scale spread. China has brought the domestic epidemic under control.
The article said that in the past ten years, China has made a lot of investment in domestic research and public health construction, which makes China's preparation for the new crown much better than that of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).
The author stated that when the SARS outbreak broke out in 2002, China was underprepared at first, especially the pathogen could not be identified.
When the new coronavirus was discovered in December 2019, Chinese scientists were soon able to identify the type of virus and shared genome sequencing data with the international community on January 11, 2020.
By the end of January, doctors from mainland China and Hong Kong clarified the clinical characteristics of the virus and warned the world about the threat of the new crown virus through research papers published in The Lancet.
China has also been at the forefront of vaccine research. When the country declares a state of emergency, through close domestic cooperation, such research has been carried out very quickly and strictly. In May and July, China announced on the "Lancet". Early trials of the developed new crown vaccine are the result of progress.
China’s experience shows that it is very important to invest in national health and research systems to effectively improve laboratory capabilities.
This is the basis for the country to respond quickly and effectively to health emergencies and global health security.
Other countries, especially low-income and middle-income countries, are very worth learning.
In addition, China’s experience proves that on the basis of strong research, there must be a strong high-level decisive and scientific basis to make correct decisions, so that the new crown epidemic can be effectively controlled.
The article emphasizes that the government and its leaders must respect science, understand the value of science, and act on it in the most beneficial way for society.
At the beginning of the outbreak, the National Health and Construction Commission of China sent three groups of infectious disease experts to Wuhan to investigate the risk and spread of the new crown virus. Their suggestions provided the basis for the decision to "close the city" in Wuhan on January 23; when some experts proposed the construction method When the cabin hospital was necessary and urgent, the government quickly made a decision and implemented it quickly; at the same time, the extensive participation of the community and the masses also enabled the epidemic to be quickly and effectively controlled.
At the end of the article, it is emphasized that in response to global health emergencies, countries need to strengthen global cooperation and jointly respond.

Time passed by, the altitude continued to rise, the oxygen content became lower and lower, and the physical strength continued to be overdrawn. These factors tested the patrol members' will.
They gritted their teeth and insisted, stepping over several landslides and several fast and difficult beaches one after another.
At about 16 o'clock, it was lunch time for the patrol members. They took out their own dry food and sat on the spot at an altitude of more than 5,700 meters, accompanied by sleet and sleet, and supplemented their physical strength with food.
The soldiers at the Ba Nong Chokang sentry point conducted tactical and physical training.

After a short rest in the cold wind, they climbed to the target point of the patrol, took out the national flag on the mountain pass, and solemnly swore.
Behind them is the snow-capped mountains. In front of them is a no-man’s land for dozens of kilometers. They are the safest guardians of the country.

Telecom network fraud crimes rose by 70% in the first half of the year
China News Service, July 26. According to the Supreme Procuratorate website, in the first half of this year, prosecutors nationwide prosecuted 58,101 people for fraud, a year-on-year increase of 35%.
In particular, among crimes that hinder the prevention and control of the epidemic, fraud crimes occur frequently, and the number of people prosecuted by the prosecutors for fraud accounted for 43.4% of all crimes that hinder the prevention and control of the epidemic.
The Supreme People's Procuratorate has carried out targeted guidance. Among the ten batches of typical cases involving epidemic prevention and control that have been released, there are 9 cases involving fraud.
Judging from the case handling by the procuratorial organs in the first half of the year, there are many names involved in fraud crimes, ranging from national macro policies to people’s clothing, food, housing and transportation, including epidemic-related fraud, “medical care” fraud, “health care product” fraud, “admission agency” fraud, The “routine loan” fraud, the fraud of obtaining state subsidies, the fraud of national assets unfreezing, etc., continue to “innovate”, covering education, medical care, employment, pension, social security, land acquisition and demolition, targeted poverty alleviation, financial credit and other fields. The victims caused economic losses and also seriously affected the economic and social development.
In particular, some telecommunications network fraud breaks through the restrictions of national boundaries, regions and personnel, and has the characteristics of stakeholder, cross-border, remote, electronic payment, etc., and there are many unspecified victims and great harm.
For example, some set up specialized companies, rent high-end office buildings, set up multiple departments or positions, use legal network platforms to promote and recruit, train and evaluate recruiters, adopt corporate operation mode management, and wear a “legal cloak” to confuse Stronger sex.
Punishing and preventing crimes in accordance with the law, and promptly issuing early warnings to the public and relevant departments are the unshirkable responsibilities of procuratorial organs.
In judicial case handling, the procuratorial organs earnestly perform their duties, not only insisting on maintaining a high-pressure posture against fraud crimes, but also targeting specific law enforcement measures, and promoting social governance through the formulation and issuance of procuratorial recommendations.
The procuratorial organs strictly control the facts, evidence, procedures, and application of law in approving and prosecuting fraud cases, taking facts as the basis and the law as the criterion, so as to be invincible.
Especially for telecommunication network fraud crimes, we pay attention to the core role of electronic data in fact determination, and strive to build an evidence chain that mutually confirms electronic data, verbal evidence, and documentary evidence.
For example, the Yinzhou District Procuratorate of Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province handled an epidemic-related fraud case, and the prosecutors intervened as soon as possible. From the occurrence of the case to the completion of the case, it only took 5 days, which reflected that it was handled quickly and strictly, and the overall social stability Attitude and determination.
In the process of reviewing arrests and reviewing prosecutions, we focused on the prosecution of missed offenders, corrected the missed arrest of 733 people by public security organs, and corrected the missed review and prosecution of 1,113 co-criminals by public security organs.
In the first half of the year, procuratorial organs across the country issued 298 procuratorial recommendations for fraud crimes, promoting joint efforts to prevent fraud crimes and promoting in-depth governance.
For example, in response to the loopholes in the supervision of telecommunications companies, banks, and intermediary organizations found in the handling of the case, the Guangzhou Procuratorate of Guangdong Province and the Dongguan Procuratorate promptly put forward procuratorial suggestions, urging relevant units to strengthen supervision, improve mechanisms, and promote the leaders. Effective system construction.
The fourth is to make every effort to recover stolen goods and restore damages.
Local procuratorial organs seize important links such as intervening in investigations to guide evidence collection, review and prosecution, supervise investigative agencies to actively recover stolen money, cooperate with relevant departments to recover stolen money, and strive to minimize the economic losses caused by fraud crimes to the people.
For example, the Lin Moumou Routine Loan case handled by the Beijing Municipal Procuratorate involved 22 houses waiting to be sealed up. In the case that the real estate may be dealt with in advance by other cases, the original "Letter of Suspension of Execution" was created and sent to the relevant courts in a timely manner. It is recommended that the court previously closed down the real estate involved in the case to suspend the execution, and after the facts of the crime are ascertained, it will be dealt with in a unified manner, so as to make the greatest efforts to recover the real estate involved in the case and recover the losses of the victims.
The prosecutor reminded everyone to be very vigilant against fraud and crimes. Don't expect "pie in the sky", and don't be credulous when you think it's cheap, and keep your "money bag" safe.
Yina Town, Weining County, Guizhou Province: Shorter Apple Trees Wider the Road to Poverty
2020-07-26 11:42:58 Source: China Economic Net Author: Zhu Yanjing Responsible Editor: Zhu Yanjing
In the sweltering heat, a reporter from Economic Daily-China Economic Net walked into Zhonghai Village, Yina Town, Weining County, Guizhou Province.
Under the scorching sun, villager Li Yuanzhong was weeding in the base. Although his face was flushed with sun, he hummed a few small songs from time to time.
Weining County, where Yina Town is located, has low latitude, high altitude, sufficient sunlight, and large temperature difference between day and night. The apples produced have high sugar content and good taste. Failed to sell at a good price, failed to form an industry scale.
Yina Town used to be a poor township that "wrapped the valleys and potatoes to survive the spring and autumn". The local poverty incidence was as high as 25.8% 10 years ago.
As the fight against poverty has entered a critical period of decisive victory, it is urgent to change the traditional planting habits, adjust the industrial structure, and increase the income of farmers.
After many visits, Chen Chao, secretary of the Party Committee of Yina Town, and a group of people in the town believed that industrial development should not go the same way.
To this end, Yina Town introduced leading enterprises to grow apples in a modern way.
Hou Jianwen, deputy general manager of Weining Chaoyue Agriculture Co., Ltd., came to Yina Town from Shaanxi in 2015 for investigation. He saw the local planting conditions at a glance, and began to plant apple trees in 2016.
At first, the village mobilized Li Yuanzhong to transfer the land to plant apple trees. The Li Yuanzhong and his wife murmured in their hearts: "After so many years of apples, they have never seen anyone in the village who has grown apples and made a fortune."
"All the apples are dwarfed apples, which will not make the apple trees grow too tall."
What Li Yuanzhong did not expect was that the new method of apple planting was adopted. Irrigation pipes were laid under each apple tree. Water and fertilizer were poured to the roots of the tree. When the fruit was harvested in autumn, the tractor drove directly into the orchard and stood there. Can pick fruit.
At present, the apple base has gradually entered a high-yield period, and the market is just as Hou Jianwen expected. Apples are not worried about selling, and they are deeply loved by consumers in cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.
The growing apple industry has brought new changes to Li Yuanzhong's life. Although he is still farming, he has a new source of income.
Li Yuanzhong’s family has more than 9 acres of land transferred to the apple base. In addition to the guaranteed land transfer fee, there are profit dividends after the fruit is sold. The couple usually work in the base. ".
Li Yuanzhong told reporters that last year's profit distribution received more than 2,800 yuan, plus the land transfer fee and the couple's labor income, and the family's income was more than 80,000 yuan. "You don't have to worry about food and clothing, and the life of a well-off society is already over."
"At present, initial results have been achieved. The annual output value of 1 mu of apples exceeds 15,000 yuan, which is about 10 times that of corn."
Chen Chao told reporters that the whole town of Yina currently planted 20,000 mu of apples. In Zhonghai Village alone, there are 6,000 mu, covering 4,056 households and 17,200 rural households, including 656 registered poor households with 2,952 people. The annual salary is more than 6 million yuan, which really realized that the base was built in front of the house, and there was no need to go out for work.
Li Yuanzhong, whose pockets are gradually bulging, also began to realize his "wish."
This year's Lunar New Year, Li Yuanzhong bought an off-road vehicle, such as driving a car to get off work today, "there is still more than ten acres of land at home, when the next step is to expand the scale of Apple's base, all will be transferred to them, the income will be more."

Membrane separation technology helps crack the "greenhouse effect"-Chinanews
Membrane separation technology helps crack the "greenhouse effect"
Schematic diagram of new mixed matrix membrane preparation technology
Our reporter Shang Rui reported: Recently, the Tianjin University Atmospheric Environment and Bioenergy Team has made significant progress on the "membrane separation method to capture carbon dioxide" and successfully developed a new hybrid matrix membrane preparation technology, which greatly improves the carbon dioxide capture performance of membrane materials.
Related results have been published as the cover article of the international journal "Greenhouse Gas: Science and Technology".
The "greenhouse effect" is a major environmental issue that plagues human development, and carbon dioxide emissions are the culprit responsible for the "greenhouse effect".
How to efficiently capture and use carbon dioxide emitted by humans is the focus of attention of scientists.
"Membrane separation method" is an emerging carbon dioxide capture technology. It separates carbon dioxide gas with the help of membrane materials. It has the characteristics of high efficiency, energy saving and simple operation.
How to let the membrane material "breathe deeply" and improve the efficiency of gas separation is the bottleneck difficulty in the use of membrane separation to capture carbon dioxide.
The scientific research team of Tianjin University has innovated ideas and through repeated experiments, explored the influence of different solvents on the membrane gas separation performance.
The experimental results show that using N-methylpyrrolidone as the preparation solvent, the carbon nanotubes in the produced membrane material are more uniformly distributed and "more air-permeable", which effectively improves the gas separation efficiency and rate of the membrane material.
The mixed matrix membrane prepared by this new technology has a carbon dioxide separation performance close to the current theoretical separation upper limit of this type of membrane material.
"The new technology provides new ideas for the capture of carbon dioxide by membrane separation."
Li Run, a member of Tianjin University's Atmospheric Environment and Bioenergy Team, said: "We hope that this technology can provide strong support for future coal-fired power plants and chemical companies to deal with flue gas, and play a major role in the control of greenhouse gas emissions.
Understand what is a professional grade difference before volunteering to fill in the report-Chinanews.com

Understand what is a professional level difference before volunteering
Every year when applying for the college entrance examination, there are students or parents who do not understand the terms involved in the voluntary reporting, which affects the voluntary reporting.
This year, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing University of Science and Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing Forestry University, and Beijing University of Chemical Technology jointly issued the 2020 enrollment policy to cancel the major difference.
What is the meaning of professional grade difference, and what is its significance in voluntary reporting?
There are three ways of professional assignment rules
Experts remind that before filling in the application, you must read the "Admissions Regulations" of your favorite school to understand the admission rules of the college, including the transfer ratio, professional distribution rules, etc.
The rules of major distribution refer to the three main methods of major admission, major priority, score priority, and major difference after colleges are transferred.
The specific method used by colleges and universities will be specified in the "Admissions Regulations".
However, the admission principle of some colleges and universities is to give priority to the total score, and there is no difference between majors.
That is to say, candidates in the admission range are queued according to the total score. When the score does not reach the first professional volunteer admission score, it will be determined whether they have reached the second professional volunteer admission score, and so on until the admission to the last professional volunteer, each professional volunteer There is no level difference between them.
The so-called "professional level difference" refers to the "professional level difference" that the colleges and universities determine the admission majors of volunteer candidates of different majors according to one or several points announced in the admissions regulations when arranging candidates' majors. This point value is the "professional level difference".
That is, the difference between the scores of the colleges and universities in the admission of candidates for the first professional volunteer and the non-first professional volunteer, and the number of grade differences between the professional volunteers, such as 3 points, 2 points, 1 point, etc.
for example.
Suppose that student Xiao Ming applied for college A and scored 560 points. His professional volunteers are: computer, international trade, automation, mechanical engineering, and e-commerce. The professional admission of college A adopts the professional grade difference method, and the grade difference is 2 points and 1 point. , 1 point, 0 point.
When assigning a major, if Xiao Ming’s first major volunteer meets the professional admission requirements and the major has a planned balance, then Xiao Ming is admitted to the "computer" major; if the computer is not admitted, his score will be deducted by 2 points , According to the score of 558 points and the first professional volunteers to apply for "international trade" candidates to determine whether they meet the professional admission requirements; if it still cannot be met, the score is subtracted by 1 point (ie 557 points) for the third professional volunteer "automation" If it is still not satisfied, the score will be subtracted by 1 point (that is, 556 points) for admission to the fourth major. If the follow-up major still cannot meet the professional wishes, the points will no longer be reduced, and so on.
Different universities have different professional level differences
With the popularization of parallel volunteering, many colleges and universities have now cancelled the professional level difference, but some colleges and universities still retain this method this year. According to the "Admissions Regulations" announced by each school, there are mainly more than 20 colleges this year. The professional level is poor.
For example, Sichuan Agricultural University, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Heilongjiang University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Jiangxi Normal University, Chengdu Medical University, Northeast Dianli University, Jimei University, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing University of Technology, Ningxia University, Shandong University of Technology, China Civil Aviation Flight Academy, etc.
In these universities, the professional level difference set by each university is different.
Some colleges and universities have a grade difference in each major, such as Ningxia University. Candidates who have already submitted their files to the school will be admitted according to the order in which the candidates fill in the majors.
And some universities have set up different professional level differences between different majors.
For example, Jimei University has a total score of 4 points for the professional volunteer grade, that is, the first professional volunteer and the other professional volunteers have a grade difference of 3 points. There is no level difference between other professional volunteers, which is regarded as parallel volunteers, and other professional volunteers and transfer professional volunteers are majors The level difference is 1 point.
When filling in their volunteers, candidates and parents must carefully read the admission policy of the school reported to see if there is a professional grade difference and what the form of the grade difference is. While fully considering the scores, they must also reasonably analyze the school and major to be selected. , If the college adopts the grade difference method for admission in the admissions charter, candidates should pay attention to the gradient between the majors when choosing a major to increase the chance of admission.

A caravan carrying a 5G new media mobile cloud production and broadcasting system was watched by the guests at the scene and slowly drove to the scene.
General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out that “2020 is a year of milestone significance. We will build a moderately prosperous society in all respects and achieve the first centenary goal. 2020 is also a year of resolute victory in poverty alleviation”.
The large-scale financial media action "Walking the Village Live to Watch Poverty Alleviation" is an important measure taken by the Financial Program Center of China Central Radio and Television General Station to cope with this major theme and promote poverty alleviation.
The action will go into poverty alleviation villages in more than 20 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities across the country, dig out live poverty alleviation stories, directly hit the huge changes in the appearance of the village, and show how the villagers can break through the plight of survival and development and become rich.
This operation will last more than three months.
The reporter departed from Xuzhou and divided into two groups, all the way to the southwest line, passing through Anhui, Hubei, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangxi, Guizhou, Sichuan, Chongqing, Yunnan, Tibet and other places; the other way to the northwest line, passing through Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu , Qinghai, Xinjiang, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Hebei and other places, the travel distance exceeds 10,000 kilometers.
In terms of reporting format, "Walking the Village Live to Watch Poverty Alleviation" boldly integrated.
The economic development of the villages visited by the caravan will be broadcasted through the CCTV Finance Channel, CCTV Economic Voice, China Communications Broadcasting, and CCTV Finance New Media.
Among them, the live TV broadcast will be mainly completed in the noon news program "Tianxia Finance" of the CCTV Finance Channel (first broadcast time: Monday to Sunday 12:00-13:00), and the prime news section of the CCTV Finance Channel "Economic Information Network" will be completed Open a column for poverty alleviation reports (first broadcast time: Monday to Sunday 20:30-21:30).
