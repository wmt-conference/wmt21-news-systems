Where to find talent?
The excellent group of returning migrant workers is an indispensable force.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 26th topic: To make excellent returning migrant workers into a rural revitalization force
Zhang Xiong, 34, lives in Orchard Village, Meishan City, Sichuan Province. In 2010, he quit his job in Beijing, where he paid tens of thousands of dollars a month, and returned to his hometown to start a business.
After several years of hard work, now he runs the wine-growing family farm with an annual income of more than one million yuan, became a famous leader of the rich, and was selected to enter the village“two committees”team.
In recent years, more and more outstanding migrant workers like Zhang Xiong have chosen to return to their hometown to start a business, activating a pool of spring water in the countryside, inspired by a series of policies to support farmers and benefit farmers, such as the country's efforts to eradicate poverty and revitalize the countryside.
In 2019 alone, more than 8,000 village Party branch secretaries, 61,000 village reserve forces and more than 20,000 party members were generated from the outstanding migrant workers returned, providing a strong guarantee for winning the battle against poverty and implementing the strategy of rural revitalization.
Well-off is not well-off, the key to look at fellow countrymen.
Since the reform and opening-up, a large number of young and middle-aged laborers in rural China have gone out to increase their income, and some have set up their own enterprises through hard work.
But objectively, it has also led to the emergence of“hollow”in rural areas to varying degrees, especially the weakening of rural grass-roots organizations, and the“one old and one low”characteristics of the village party branch secretaries and party members, namely the aging of age, low education, and the problem of the lack of leadership in the village party organizations.
If the rural talent and other elements have been one-way flow to the city, the countryside for a long time in the state of“blood loss” and “anemia”, revitalization is an empty word.
Attracting those migrant workers who have the ability, awareness and ambition to serve their hometown, guiding them to return to their hometown to start their own businesses and become leaders in getting rich, training them to become party members and rural cadres on a merit-based basis, and enriching the cadres at the grass-roots level is the strategy to solve the problem of the disparity between the ranks of rural party members and the grass-roots party organizations.
Good migrant workers will be brought back, but also let them stay and do well.
In recent years, Sichuan has started by paying close attention to the party building of migrant workers. On the basis of strict candidate criteria, it has established a system and mechanism for the targeted return of outstanding migrant workers, service guarantee, training and selection, so that they can improve their ability, guarantee their work and hope in their lives, so that they can truly take root in the countryside and have a sense of accomplishment in starting their own businesses.
This year is the final year of the decisive battle against poverty. Talent is the key factor to do a good job of bridging poverty alleviation and rural revitalization.
Party committees and governments at all levels should attach great importance to the group of outstanding returning migrant workers. Through comprehensive measures, they will be built into a team and force that can stay, fight and take away, so as to provide strong organizational guarantee and personnel support for the rural areas to get rid of poverty and achieve a well-off and revitalization of development.

Beijing, July 26, according to foreign media reports, on July 18, Nantes, France, the religious historical architectural treasures,the famous Cathedral of St. Peter and St. Paul, in a fire was seriously damaged, the organ completely destroyed.
On the 26th local time, Nantes prosecutors announced that a parish volunteer in charge of the protection of the cathedral has been charged with“arson destruction.”
He had admitted that he had set the fire in the church.
Local prosecutor Senas said the 39-year-old parish volunteer from Rwanda admitted he set three fires in the cathedral during the night, according to the report.
The man's lawyer said the arsonist now regretted doing so.
The man entered France a few years ago by way of refuge, was sheltered in the parish where the fire occurred, and was taken into custody in the church.
Prosecutors said he had recently tried to renew his visa and was in conversation with the police.
But the church said it still could not believe that the usually very kind, smiling, but not very talkative believer would destroy the church he loved so much.
On the day of the fire on July 18, the volunteer had been questioned by the police because of illogical problems in the narrative, but he was later released.

Comprehensive News: US Unilateralism undermines Bilateral Relations International Public Opinion supports China's counter-system against the United States-Xinhua
Beijing, July 26 (Xinhua) -- On the morning of July 24, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the U.S. Embassy in China that China had decided to revoke the permission for the establishment and operation of the U.S. Consulate General in Chengdu and made specific requests for the Consulate General to cease all operations and activities.
International public opinion believes that the unilateral measures taken by the United States have caused serious distress to the relations between China and the United States, and that it is legitimate and necessary for China to respond to the unjustified provocations of the United States and take counter-measures.
Andres Borkes, director of the Center for China Studies at the Institute of International Studies at the University of Chile, said the unilateralist measures in the United States have undermined the bridge of understanding between the two peoples and put the relationship between the two great powers at risk.
China has informed the United States that the closure of its Consulate general in Chengdu is a response to unilateral measures by the United States and is in line with diplomatic practice.
Patricio Giusto, a professor at the Catholic University of Argentina and director of the Arab-Chinese Research Center, believes that China's decision is a legitimate and necessary counter-measure against the previous provocations of the United States, not against the ordinary American people.
The United States is trying to distract the American public by pressuring China to cover up its weak response to the new crown outbreak.
Banbang Surjono, chairman of the Asian Innovation Research Center, an Indonesian think tank, said the provocative diplomatic gesture by the United States has caused serious distress to relations between the Two countries and faced serious challenges.
China has informed the United States that the closure of its Consulate General in Chengdu is a normal counter-measure and is in line with diplomatic practice. It reflects not only China's principled position of resolutely safeguarding its own interests, but also the rational and beneficial interests of Chinese diplomacy.
Francis Semwenza, a Tanzanian current affairs commentator, said China's decision was a legitimate and necessary response to U.S. provocations.
The U.S. side should take the initiative to improve relations with China and stop interfering in China's internal affairs.
The United States should focus on how to achieve economic and political win-win with China, and how to benefit the people of both countries and the international community as a whole.
Ali Youssef, executive Director of the Sudan－based Federation of Arab-Chinese Friendship Associations, said China's forced countermeasures were a legitimate and necessary response to the unjustified actions of the United States, in line with international law and basic norms of international relations, as well as diplomatic practice.
The U.S. request to close the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is a serious violation of international law and the basic norms of international relations.
It is hoped that the United States will rescind the previous decision and create the necessary conditions for the return of relations between the two countries to normalcy.
Singapore's Lianhe Zaobao said in an editorial that America's greater strategic intention is to contain China and prevent it from continuing to rise.
In the face of US pressure, China is reluctant to see China-US relations continue to deteriorate, but has to take counter-measures.

Poland will withdraw from the European treaty on the prevention of violence against women
Poland will take steps next week to withdraw from the European Treaty on the Prevention of Violence against Women, Poland's justice Ministry said Saturday.
Poland's right-wing government cabinet said the treaty, which requires schools to teach students about gender issues, trampled on the rights of parents.
Poland's Justice Minister Gioblo said at a news conference that his Ministry of Justice would submit a request to the Ministry of Labour and Family on Monday to begin withdrawing from the treaty.
That treaty is also known as the Istanbul Convention.
“The treaty contains some elements that we consider to be harmful to the meaning of morphological nature, " Mr. Gioblo said.”
Poland's ruling Law and Justice Party and its ruling coalition partners are closely allied with the Roman Catholic Church and advocate a conservative social agenda.
Polish President Andrzej Duda has made hostility to gay rights one of the main issues during his successful re-election campaign this month.
On Friday, thousands of Poles, most of them women, staged protests against the withdrawal from the convention in Warsaw and other cities.
“The purpose of withdrawing from the treaty is to legitimize domestic violence,”one of the organizers of the protest, Rempat, said at a protest march in Warsaw.
Some protesters held banners that read " The Law and Justice Party is a hell for women."
The Law and Justice Party has long complained about the Istanbul Convention.
Poland's previous centrist government ratified the convention in 2015.
The Law and Justice Party government says the treaty does not respect religion and calls for liberal social policies to be taught in schools.
But so far the party has not decided to withdraw from the convention.

Engine may Stall FAA Orders 2,000 Boeing airliners-Xinhua
The United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)issued an emergency airworthiness directive on the 24th, requiring emergency inspection of about 2,000 Boeing 737NG and 737Classic aircraft registered in the United States, because the air check valve corrosion of the aircraft may cause the engine to stop in the air.
The FAA said it had so far received four reports of aerial parking of the engines of the 737NG and 737Classic aircraft, resulting in an emergency inspection request for aircraft that had been parked for seven consecutive days or more and for aircraft that had flown less than 11 times since re-entering the aircraft.
The FAA has warned that the Class 5 check valves on all two of the aircraft's engines, if corroded, could become stuck in the open position, causing the aircraft to lose power completely and be unable to restart the engine.
The aviation regulator ordered that if the check valve was found to be corroded, the airline operator must replace the critical component before the aircraft is put into service again.
Boeing responded later in the day that the outbreak of the new crown outbreak led to reduced travel demand, and many airliners were mothballed or used less, “ check valves are more vulnerable to corrosion. ”
Boeing also said it had advised air carriers to inspect the airliners involved in the directive, and if problems were found, Boeing would provide assistance in overhauling and replacing check valves.
airliners owned by major U.S. air carriers usually fly multiple times a day, but a large number of airliners have been grounded after the new crown outbreak, and some have been put back into operation as demand for passenger travel has recently grown slowly, the Associated Press reported.
The FAA did not release the details of the four aerial parking reports.
Alaska Airlines disclosed one of the incidents late on the 24th.
The airline said in a statement that one of its airliners made an emergency landing at Austin Airport on July 15 when an engine suddenly stalled on the way from Seattle, Washington, to Austin, Texas.
Alaska Airlines says it has replaced the engine of the airliner and has inspected the engines of six airliners in accordance with FAA instructions.
American Airlines, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines said on the 24th, respectively, its passenger aircraft did not appear associated with the air check valve engine flameout.
Four of American Airlines ' aircraft will be inspected and 28 of United's aircraft will be inspected.
Delta said it would inspect 20 of its airliners, but did not say whether there had been engine failures.
A number of media reports, the FAA emergency airworthiness directive is another shock to Boeing.
Indonesian Lion Airlines and Ethiopian Airlines each crashed a Boeing 737MAX airliner in October 2018 and March 2019, respectively, killing a total of 346 people.
The series of airliners was subsequently grounded worldwide,discontinued in January and resumed production in May.
FAA Chief Steve Dickson admitted in June that the FAA had“made a mistake” in regulating Boeing on the 737MAX.

The“Blue Wave Dream " of the River Shimizu Show”
The Yellow River flows through Ningxia 397 kilometers and is the“mother River”that nurtures one side.
However, with the rapid advance of industrialization and urbanization, the development and utilization of rivers and lakes and management and protection imbalance, excessive sewage, surrounding lakes and fields, encroachment of water and other disturbances highlight, resulting in black and smelly water, excessive water quality, environmental mess, ecological degradation.
Now, Ningxia is promoting the restoration of water ecological diversity, and trying to restore the Yellow River water show the river Qing.
The water should be treated from the source.
In Yinchuan, Ningxia, the local approach of“standard improvement+pollution control+strict control”has been adopted. All industrial parks have achieved centralized treatment of sewage, all urban sewage treatment plants have achieved level A standard discharge, and the black and smelly water bodies in urban built-up areas have basically been eliminated, and the third batch of Chinese black and smelly water demonstration cities have been successfully declared.
In addition, Ningxia fully implemented the river and lake long system in 2017, and now has realized the full coverage of the five-level river and lake long system responsibility system in districts, cities, counties and villages, and river and lake long patrol has become the norm.

U.S. launches countervailing investigation against China over“undervalued RMB Exchange Rate”for the first time
In response to the recent announcement by the U.S. Department of Commerce, it has decided to launch an anti-dumping and countervailing investigation on cable ties (cable ties) products originating in China, and launched an investigation on the“undervaluation of the Renminbi exchange rate“project.
China's Ministry of Commerce pointed out that this is the first time that the United States has investigated the so-called”undervaluation of the renminbi exchange rate“in a countervailing case, which China firmly opposes.
The Ministry of Commerce of China issued a special press release on the evening of the 23rd, said that China implements a floating exchange rate system based on market supply and demand, adjusted with reference to a basket of currencies, managed by the market, the market plays a decisive role in the formation of the exchange rate.
The press release stressed that, overall, the Renminbi exchange rate is at a reasonably balanced level and is not undervalued.
Since 2005, the renminbi has appreciated more than 17 per cent against the dollar.
According to data released by the Bank for International Settlements, from early 2005 to May 2020, the RENMINBI's nominal effective exchange rate appreciated by 38% and the real effective exchange rate appreciated by 49%, making it the strongest currency in the G20 economies and one of the largest currencies in the world.
The Ministry of Commerce pointed out that the exchange rate issue exceeded the competence of members to conduct countervailing investigations in accordance with World Trade Organization rules.
In February, the United States amended its regulations to conduct countervailing investigations on other countries ' exchange rates, which has been suspected of violating WTO rules and has been opposed by many sides.
Even under U.S. regulations, the applicant's complaint contained numerous errors and did not have the necessary countervailing elements such as financial assistance, grant of benefits, and exclusivity, the press release said.
China urges the United States to abide by existing international rules and stop conducting countervailing investigations into the so-called“undervaluation of the Renminbi exchange rate.”
Affected by the further increase in the tension between China and the United States, the offshore and onshore renminbi against the US dollar exchange rate on the 22nd was a great devaluation, both fell below the US dollar against the US dollar 7.0 yuan mark.
Whether the U.S. Commerce Department's move is intended to force a rise in the renminbi is a matter of concern.
The spot exchange rate of the renminbi against the dollar rose above the 7.0 mark on the 23rd, closing at 6.9961.
The central price of the renminbi against the dollar, which is regulated by the official exchange rate, was cut by 17 basis points on the 24th to 6.9938.

Lewis Family: John Lewis is a warrior who“fights for the weakest”
U.S. Congressman John Lewis, a Civil rights fighter, was remembered as a soldier“fighting for the weakest”at a memorial service for him on Saturday (July 25).
Lewis ' public memorial service has been held in Alabama since Saturday.
There were two memorial services on the first day.
At a public memorial service Saturday at Troy University in Alabama, Lewis's five siblings and a nephew spoke of a loving, fearless, family-oriented man.
Henry“Grant”Lewis, Lewis's youngest brother, said at the meeting: "He has devoted his life to helping others.”
Samuel Lewis said his mother had warned John“not to get in trouble, not to get in trouble."”
He added that John did not heed his mother's warning,saying, " We all know that John is always in trouble,always in trouble,but it is because he insists on the right thing, that is a good trouble."”
Lewis's brothers and sisters reminded people at the memorial service that John's most famous argument was to create "good trouble," that is, not to be shy about provoking trouble for the sake of justice.
John had applied to Troy University in Troy, Alabama, where he was born, but Troy University, an all-white school at the time, rejected his application.
John Lewis, who preached the gospel to chickens on his farm as a child, eventually earned a degree in religion and philosophy from Fisk University.
Years later, Troy University awarded Lewis an honorary doctorate.
Sen. Doug Jones, R-Alabama, said the current protesters are "protesting peacefully, nonviolently," as Lewis did in the Civil rights movement.
“ Even if President Trump knocked over a boat and called all the protesters a thug, he was wrong, " Jones said.
The protesters were patriots who wanted the United States to move towards a more equal country.”
A six-day series of events in Lewis ' memory will culminate this week at a funeral in Georgia.
Lewis ' coffin was parked at a public memorial at Troy University on Saturday, and people came to pay their respects to the pioneer of the Civil Rights movement.
Later Saturday, a private ceremony paid tribute to him in a chapel in Selma, Ala., followed by a public memorial.
On Sunday, Lewis ' body will pass through the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma.
In 1965, he and protesters demanding the right to vote were beaten in front of the bridge by Alabama police, who also fired tear gas at demonstrators.
Lewis was almost killed.
This day will later be called“Bloody Sunday".
Lewis ' body will be transported to Montgomery, the capital of Alabama.
Mayor Steven Reed encouraged people to line up on the sidewalk to join Lewis on this last ride.
At the same time, officials asked the public to wear masks and maintain a social distance when participating in the event.
Alabama Governor Kay Ivey ordered the flag to be lowered at half-mast on Saturday and Sunday in honor of Mr. Lewis.
Lewis ' body will be interred at the Alabama State Capitol in Montgomery, the Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta, and the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., during a nearly week-long commemoration.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced last week that people could pay tribute to Lewis at the U.S. Capitol on Monday and Tuesday.
Due to the coronavirus outbreak, public events in memory of Lewis will be held outdoors.

Pay attention to calcium casting soul, strengthen political leadership.
To strengthen the political leadership of grass-roots governance, it is necessary to implement the“calcium casting soul”project well.
We should take learning and understanding the thought of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era of Xi Jinping as a top priority, take“never forget your original heart and remember your mission”as the eternal theme of party construction and the lifelong theme of party members and cadres, strengthen the principle of reading the original books and learning the original texts, and continue to promote the Party's innovative theory through special training, batch training, seminars and exchanges, and hold lectures, so as to further strengthen the“four consciousness”, firmly“four self-confidence”, achieve“two maintenance”, and better perform their duties and responsibilities.

Focus on practice and exercise,in the process of resolving key difficult problems in the field of grass-roots governance, solve the troubles and troubles of the masses ' attention well, and temper the party's character and ability.
Grasp the norms of promotion, build a battle fortress.
The grass-roots party organization is not only an important part of the grass-roots governance system, but also an important carrier of the performance of the governance capacity.
To promote the standardization of party organizations at the grass-roots level, it is necessary to start with the regulations on the work of party branches, focus on the weakening and blurring of party organizations ' leadership, and strengthen the foundation, fill the short boards and promote development through the establishment of the upper and lower linkage mechanism, the establishment of the form of innovative branches, the normalization of the weak and lax, the establishment and improvement of the decision-making and deliberation mechanism, and the mechanism of serving the masses.
In rural areas, we will strengthen the standardization of party organizations at the village level, standardize organizational forms, learning activities and management mechanisms against the standardized construction standards of party branches, and effectively promote the implementation of the system of“three sessions, one lesson”and thematic party day activities.
In cities, focus on street communities, explore the form of innovative branches, focus on weak areas, "blocking points”and "pain points", and actively build urban party-building alliances, so that the work of the party can be effectively covered.
At the same time, the grass-roots governance system and mechanism will be established and improved, the decision-making and deliberation mechanism led by the grass-roots party organizations will be improved, and the mechanism for contacting party members and cadres to serve the masses will be improved, so as to enhance the sense of gain, happiness, honor and pride of party members and the masses will be enhanced, so that the grass-roots governance will be more warm.
Play the vanguard role, condense the red power.
Party members and cadres at the grass-roots level are the cornerstone of grass-roots governance.

It is necessary to make the improvement of the governance capacity a compulsory course for party members and cadres at the grass-roots level, constantly strengthen ideological quenching, professional training and practical exercise, carry forward the spirit of responsibility in their posts and in the heavy tasks of emergency and risk, and strengthen the foundation and contribute to the modernization of the national governance system and governance capacity.
The activities of“blowing the whistle in the community and reporting for party members”should be carried out extensively, and party members should participate in community construction, management and service by participating in the theme party day activities, contacting the people in need, identifying service items, claiming micro-wishes and making reasonable suggestions, so as to allow party members to play a role in community governance.
We should give full play to the role of unrepresented party members in rural areas. By setting up pioneer posts for unrepresented party members and forming task forces for unrepresented party members, we should guide party members at the grass-roots level to actively participate in poverty alleviation, ecological construction, petitions and visits to maintain stability, and the prohibition of straw burning, so as to better integrate the red power and serve the people.
If the foundation is solid, the building is strong.
The grass-roots party organization is the foundation of the ruling building.
Only by keeping close party-mass relations and increasing the well-being of the people as the focus, and leading party building as the fundamental way to promote innovation and development of grass-roots governance can we build a strong foundation, so that grass-roots party organizations can pull out and top up, and grass-roots party members and cadres can rush up and rush up, and promote grass-roots governance with a“soul”, orderly, powerful and effective.

A new drug developed by the University of Australia is expected to be used to treat blood vessel blockage caused by the new crown-Xinhua
Sydney, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Researchers at Monash University in Australia are developing a new drug to help prevent heart disease and stroke, and hope the drug can be used to treat blockage of blood vessels caused by the new crown virus.
The researchers found that an enzyme in platelets accelerates platelet coagulation before a heart attack or stroke.
So they developed a drug that temporarily inhibits platelet coagulation, thereby avoiding blockage of blood vessels and preventing heart disease and stroke.
Researchers say the drug only inhibits the coagulation effect of platelets in the event of signs of heart disease or stroke.
As studies have shown that similar blockage of blood vessels is one of the leading causes of death in patients with severe new crowns, the researchers hope that the drug can be used in the treatment of such severe patients in the future.
At present, the drug has achieved good results in animal model experiments, the researchers are ready for the next stage of human clinical trials.
The results of the research have been published in the American journal Science Translational Medicine.
He became the first person to enter the CBA league rematch after allowing the audience to watch the game live.
On the same day, during the second stage of the 2019-2020 China Men's Basketball Professional League (CBA) rematch (Laoshan Division) held in Qingdao, Shandong Province, medical staff, teachers and public security front personnel watched the match of Shanghai Jiushi Team against Shandong Xiwang Team through the official ticket purchase platform after completing the relevant procedures, including nucleic acid detection.

China News Agency, Hami, Xinjiang, July 26th topic: Xinjiang deep plowing " sunflower field” with clean energy
More than 6,000 pentagonal heliostats, each 48 square meters, arranged neatly in a circle, such as a silver“sunflower field”, with the sun rotation, the sunlight reflected to the center of more than 200 meters high endothermic tower, to achieve power generation.
Reporters on the 25th in Xinjiang Hami City Yiqi County Nao Maohu Town of China Electric Project Hami molten salt tower solar thermal power plant, see this scene.
"The so-called molten salt tower photothermal power generation, is the concentrated reflection of sunlight through the mirror to the endothermic tower to form thermal energy, and then through the traditional power generation technology to convert thermal energy into electrical energy."”
Zhang Yong, deputy general manager of CLP Hami Solar Thermal Power Co., Ltd., said the design principle is similar to the use of rural solar stoves in northwest China, all to gather the sunlight.
The power plant started construction in October 2017 and was connected to the grid at the end of last year, covering an area of 6,600 mu, with a total planned installation of 14,500 heliostats.
"Compared to traditional solar power technology, its biggest advantage is that the gathered heat energy can be stored,can also generate electricity at night.”
Zhang Yong said that the 13-hour heat storage system configured in the project can keep the generator set running continuously and stably, not affected by changes in light, and can also quickly participate in the peak adjustment of the grid according to the demand for the peak and valley of the grid load.
When the project is fully completed, it can achieve an annual power generation capacity of 198 million degrees, save more than 60,000 tons of standard coal per year, reduce sulfur dioxide more than 60 tons, nitrogen oxides more than 60 tons, about 20 tons of soot, more than 150,000 tons of carbon dioxide, and provide a steady stream of clean energy for the local area.
In addition, there is another silver“sunflower field”in Hami Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park.
Hamifuguang solar photovoltaic power station covers an area of more than 2,300 acres, has built 714 power generation equipment also follow the rotation of the sun, always keep the sunlight and the condenser plate at a 90-degree right angle.
"We use dual-axis tracking concentrator power generation technology, through a unified and integrated control, all power generation equipment will adjust the angle according to the sun height, to maintain power generation efficiency.”
The station manager Duan Mengqi said that in the light of good weather conditions, the power generation technology compared with the traditional photovoltaic power generation efficiency can be increased by about 20%.
In the first half of this year, the power station has achieved more than 7 million degrees of power generation, to supplement the local electricity demand.
Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park is currently the largest single-scale, the most complete type of photovoltaic module type of a photovoltaic industry demonstration park in Xinjiang, a total of 38 photovoltaic power generation projects, the total installed capacity of 820,000 kilowatts.
In the first half of this year, more than 110 million kWh of power generation was completed, an increase of 6% over the same period in 2019.
Hami is one of the best areas for solar energy resources in China.
The average annual total solar radiation per square meter of more than 6200 megajoules, the number of sunshine hours of the year is about 3200 hours.
In recent years, the city vigorously develop the photovoltaic industry, planting a good "sunflower field".
In the first half of this year, the city's photovoltaic power generation exceeded 1.4 billion degrees, an increase of about 14% year-on-year.
At present, Xinjiang grid-connected photovoltaic power plants more than 330, the installed capacity of more than 10 million kilowatts.
It is expected that the annual photovoltaic power generation will reach 15 billion degrees this year, which can replace more than 6 million tons of standard coal.

U.S. Media Reveal the truth about U.S. Unwarranted Demand for China to close Consulate General in Houston-<url>
2020-07-26 14: 40: 44 Source: CCTV Author: Zhu Yanjing Editor: Zhu Yanjing
The US media revealed the truth about the US side's unwarranted demand that China close the consulate general in Houston
On the 24th, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China informed the U.S. Embassy in China that China had decided to revoke the permission for the establishment and operation of the U.S. Consulate General in Chengdu and made specific requests for the Consulate General to cease all operations and activities as a counter measure to the U.S. sudden demand on the 21st for China to close the Consulate General in Houston.
The U.S. government's behavior has aroused many concerns, and its political motivation has been questioned by foreign media and scholars.
Why is China required to close the Consulate general?
A number of foreign media said that it is not clear why the United States will choose the Chinese Consulate general in Houston, but for the purpose of this move, foreign media bluntly said: for the election.
CNN reported on the 23rd that the United States asked China to close the consulate general in Houston, raising questions about its political motives.
According to the article, the US government's disastrous response to the new crown epidemic has caused President Trump to have a relatively low approval rating in the polls before the election.
White House officials say privately that the tough approach to China is designed to save Trump's approval ratings and to shift blame for the failure of the White House's response to the outbreak.
According to the article, the Chinese Consulate General in Houston was a“politically driven and very cautious”target chosen by the US government“to create a tough attitude while avoiding the risk of a major conflict.”
The BBC also believes that Mr. Trump believes that“playing the‘China card’has a political advantage”at a time when the US election season is approaching and the US economy is badly hit by the epidemic.
The current situation is“a spiraling, tit-for-tat struggle,”driven in part by the US government's domestic considerations, which will only exacerbate tensions between China and the United States.
CBS reports that Trump's re-election prospects are under pressure because of the outbreak, which he has repeatedly blamed on China.
Almost every day there are new actions in the United States against the absurdity of Trump's so-called“Chinese exploitation of the United States.”
"The Consulate General of Houston is very important in establishing ties between the two countries”
The Associated Press commented that the U.S. demand for China to close its consulate general in Houston has heightened tensions between the world's two largest economies.
The closure of the Chinese Consulate General in Houston would, in addition to the diplomatic implications, make it difficult for Chinese citizens in the southern United States to access consular services, as well as for U.S. citizens seeking visas and other services.
A business group in Houston expressed regret at the U.S. demand that China close the Consulate General in Houston, saying it played an important role in building trade, investment and cultural ties between the two countries.
This reflects the importance of China's economy, according to the Associated Press.
The US Foreign Policy magazine website described the move as“part of a series of provocative moves that will only worsen relations between the US and China.”
Jonathan Pollack, an expert on East Asia at the Brookings Institution, a US think tank, was quoted by Reuters as saying he could not think of anything comparable to the US action against the Chinese consulate general in Houston since the US and China established full diplomatic relations in 1979.
Hong Kong's South China Morning Post reported that the move was unprecedented in more than 40 years of diplomatic relations between China and the United States.
Analysts believe the move could cause lasting damage.
Built in 1979, the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is China's first consulate general in the United States.
Currently, China has one embassy and five consulates-general in the United States.

Free Nucleic acid detection in Urumqi Most areas have basically completed secondary testing in high-risk areas-<url>
Beijing Urumqi July 26 (reporter Sun Tingwen Zhao Yamin)Urumqi Health and Health Committee director Zhang Wei on the 26th in the briefing Urumqi city of the latest outbreak and nucleic acid testing, said that at present, Urumqi city free nucleic acid testing work in most areas has been basically completed.
The expert group of the State Council and experts from the autonomous region and Urumqi City are making further assessments on the development of the epidemic on the basis of the findings of nucleic acid detection and epidemiology.
The Press Office of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region held a press conference on the 26th to inform the situation of the epidemic and prevention and control in Xinjiang.
According to him, from 00: 00 to 24: 00 on July 25, there were 22 new confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia in Urumqi(5 of which were confirmed cases of asymptomatic infected persons) and 38 new cases of asymptomatic infected persons.
As of 2400 hours on July 25, Urumqi has 135 confirmed cases and 147 asymptomatic infected people.
On the 25th, the new asymptomatic infected people are basically through the city's free nucleic acid test, active screening out.
Zhang Wei, director of the Urumqi Health Committee, said on the 26th that most areas of free nucleic acid testing in Urumqi City have been basically completed.
He also said that from the experience of other parts of the country, many factors affect the results of nucleic acid test, such as the sensitivity of the detection reagent, the time of infection and detoxification of the test personnel, the cooperation of the test when the sample is taken(poor cooperation may lead to the sample is not taken in place), as well as the detection environment, the operation proficiency of the test personnel, etc.
For a variety of reasons, nucleic acid detection will also appear false negative results.
The so-called false negative means that the subject is indeed an infected person, but the nucleic acid test results are negative.
In addition, two nucleic acid tests are usually required to exclude people who have been in close contact with confirmed and suspected cases.
For people who have been to high-risk areas in the outbreak, if there are fever and respiratory symptoms, a nucleic acid test negative there is a false negative possibility, so two nucleic acid tests are also required to rule out.
He said, in view of the above situation, for the health of all ethnic groups in the city, starting today, Urumqi City will be Tianshan District, Shayibak District and other key areas for secondary free nucleic acid testing, while carrying out“check the legacy of leakage.”
It is reported that Tianshan District, Shayibak district is a high-risk area of the epidemic.

U.S.-China Trade Representatives meet in August
Liu He, head of China's trade negotiating team and vice Premier of the State Council, and Lai Haizhe, co-leader of the U.S. team and trade representative, are expected to hold formal talks in August to assess the implementation of the first phase of the trade agreement between the two sides, the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported on the 25th, citing an anonymous person familiar with the matter.
The report said that while China has significantly increased its purchases of U.S. agricultural products in the past few months, China's purchases are still some distance from the amount promised in the trade agreement because of the new crown virus outbreak and other factors.
Analysts say the recent closure of each other's consulates by the US and China, along with other disputes, could undermine any progress on trade.
The first phase of the trade agreement between China and the United States came into force one month after the signing of the agreement on January 15. The agreement stipulates that a high-level trade framework group of the two sides shall hold talks every six months.
People familiar with the matter said the meeting would be“an important turning point”for both sides to assess the progress of the agreement.
But the person also said that if tensions between the United States and China lead to a lack of willingness to talk at this time, the two sides may agree that the May 8 conference call between Mr. Lai and Mr. Liu has met the terms of the semi-annual talks in the trade agreement.
Since this year, relations between China and the United States have deteriorated rapidly, with disputes between the two sides including the origin of the new Crown virus, trade, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, the South China Sea and ideology and a series of other issues.
U.S. President Donald Trump, who boasted at the beginning of the year about his achievements in the first phase of the agreement, has recently changed his attitude.
He said at a White House press conference on the 23rd that although China recently purchased a record number of U.S. corn and bought a lot of large beans in a single day,“This trade agreement now means less to me than it did when it was reached.”
An anonymous Beijing government adviser also believes that a new round of trade talks is unlikely because of poor US-China relations, and that “trade issues have lost their weight in Sino-Us relations.”
But he said that China's economic and trade related units on the 23rd still met to discuss a series of issues, including how to increase imports from the United States, “we have tried our best to buy, so any additional purchases will be difficult.”
Peng Jie Ning, vice-president of the US-China Trade National Committee, said it was“more important than ever” to maintain momentum for the first phase of the agreement, noting that China has made progress this year in further opening up financial markets to US companies.
“It is better to talk than not, although it may only be treated as a routine, " said an analyst at Plenum, an independent research firm.”

NASDAQ China Chief Representative Hao Yusheng: Now is the best time for Chinese companies to go to the United States IPO node-Economic Watch－Professional financial news website
Economic watch network reporter Zhang Bin because of Ruixing Coffee fraud incident, the United States market for the implementation of more stringent supervision of the shares, coupled with long-term valuation pressure, in the United States listed shares feel pressure, Netease, Jingdong and other shares have recently opened the journey back to Hong Kong listing.
The recent shell, ideal car and other companies, to the United States listing enthusiasm is high.
Is now the best time for Chinese companies to go public in the United States under the epidemic and the crisis of China's stock market?
"In terms of recent IPO cases and the next companies to go to the United States, the IPO in the United States has not been affected in nature, but now the market is very good, and even now this time is the best time for Chinese companies to go to the United States IPO in the past 10 years."”
Hao Yusheng, Chief Representative of the Nasdaq Stock Exchange in China, said at the 2020 Listed Company Leaders Summit, hosted by Snowball.
In April, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the U.S. Public Company Accounting Regulatory Commission (PCAOB) released a Statement on Audit Quality and Regulatory Access to Audit and Other International Information — a discussion on Current Challenges to Access to Information for U.S. listed companies with significant operations in China.
While international cooperation and coordination have increased significantly in recent years, U.S. regulators still have problems with access to information, and the SEC and PCAOB still face legal and practical challenges, according to the statement. In contrast to the document, the PCAOB website details a list of listed companies that have encountered audit obstacles and their audit institutions, with a large number of mid-cap companies listed.
In addition, in May, the U.S. Senate passed the Foreign Company Accountability Act, imposing additional disclosure requirements on foreign companies to list in the U.S.
In Hao Yusheng's view, the crisis has not affected the appetite of investors.
"When the news came out, everyone was panicking, and everyone was asking if they could go public in the United States in the future, but then we found that these questions were not a matter for investors, and investors may ask these questions during the recent IPO roadshow in the United States, and even become standardized questions, but this was not used by investors as an important factor in investing in and not investing in a Chinese company.
It is recommended that you try to look at the current situation with a normal mind.
Of course, this may seem to be the worst of the past two years, but in terms of investor appetite, it has not been affected in any way.
So between now and the end of this year or before the US election, the IPO boom in the United States will continue.”
On May 9 this year, Jinshan Cloud officially listed on Nasdaq in the United States, becoming the first Chinese company to ipo in the United States after the epidemic.
"The listing of Jinshan Cloud gives a lot of confidence to Chinese companies that are preparing for IPOs later.”
Hao Yusheng said.
Snowball released the first half of 2020 stock data report shows that in the first half of this year, a total of 20 Chinese companies to the United States IPO, an increase of 17.6% compared with the same period last year; from the total amount of initial capital raised, 20 enterprises raised a total of 2.725 billion, compared with the same period last year, up more than 52.4%; in the industry distribution, the first half of this year, the number of health care industry IPO, an increase of 100% compared with the same period last year.
According to Hao Yusheng, the first half of this year to the United States IPO of Chinese companies of higher quality, with excellent fundamentals and growth of high-quality companies, will be more favored by investors.
In the short, medium and long term, Hao Yusheng continues to be optimistic about the IPO of Ming Chinese companies to the United States.
"In the short term, the IPO boom is still continuing; in the medium term, Chinese companies have more options. A shares, Hong Kong stocks, and US stocks, we will consider the US election and Sino-US relations as market choices and time choices; in the long term, everything will return to the norm, and the market volatility is a cycle, both political and economic cycles, and eventually will return to the normal stage, and the stock market has always been volatile.”
Hao Yusheng also said, " This year there are more uncertainties, but for high-quality companies, regardless of the market, as long as they are solid and have the growth that investors can see, other factors are relatively secondary, investors need to invest in excellent Chinese companies."”

People's Daily commentator: Focus on doing your own business to build new advantages for future Development -- On Learning and Implementing General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech at the Entrepreneurs Forum-Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 25, People's Daily, July 26, commentator's article: Focus on doing their own things to build new advantages for future development
At present, the global epidemic situation and the world economic situation are still grim and complex, and the challenges facing our country's development are unprecedented.
Maintaining strategic strength, enhancing confidence in winning,and concentrating on doing our own business is the key to our response to various risk challenges.
At the entrepreneurs ' forum held recently, General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed that in the current external environment of rising protectionism, the world economy is depressed and the global market is shrinking, we must concentrate on our own business, give full play to the advantages of domestic super-large-scale markets, gradually form a new development pattern with domestic large-scale circulation as the main body and domestic and international double circulation promoting each other, raise the level of modernization of the industrial chain supply chain, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation, accelerate key core technology research and development, and build new advantages for future development.
He who sees the potential is wise,and he who drives the potential wins.
In the external environment of the deep development of economic globalization, the market and resources have played an important role in the rapid development of our country.
Now, the world under the impact of the epidemic is undergoing profound changes, facing more instability and uncertainty, and economic globalization is facing headwinds and backwardness.
One of the most important aspects is to take expansion and meeting domestic demand as the strategic basis for development, give full play to their advantages, and add impetus to China's economic development through the prosperity of the domestic economy and the smoothness of the domestic cycle, so as to promote the recovery of the world economy.
We should deeply realize that building a complete domestic demand system is related to our country's long-term development and long-term stability.
This is the need to cope with the impact of the epidemic, to maintain the long-term sustainable and healthy development of our economy, and to meet the growing needs of the people for a better life.
The advantage of a large economy is that it is internally recyclable.
With the world's most complete and largest industrial system, strong production capacity and perfect supporting capacity, China has more than 100 million market players and more than 170 million highly educated or professional skills, as well as an ultra-large-scale domestic demand market formed by a population of 1.4 billion people, including more than 400 million middle-income groups, and is in the stage of rapid development of new industrialization, information technology, urbanization and agricultural modernization, with great potential for investment demand.
The socialist basic economic system, such as public ownership as the main body, multiple ownership as the common development of the economy, distribution according to work as the main body, coexisting in a variety of distribution modes, and the socialist market economy system, can not only stimulate the vitality of various market entities, emancipate and develop social productive forces, but also promote efficiency, fairness and organic unity and the continuous realization of common prosperity.
We should firmly grasp the strategic basis of expanding domestic demand,so that production, distribution and circulation links rely more on the domestic market to achieve a virtuous circle, clarify the strategic direction of supply-side structural reform, and promote the dynamic balance between total supply and aggregate demand at a higher level.
We need to accelerate the construction of a complete domestic demand system, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation and other aspects of innovation, accelerate the digital economy, intelligent manufacturing, life and health, new materials and other strategic emerging industries, forming more new growth points and growth poles, and gradually form a new development pattern with the domestic large cycle as the main body and the domestic and international double cycle to promote each other.
Openness brings progress,and closure is bound to lag behind.
General Secretary Xi Jinping has repeatedly stressed that China's open door will not be closed,but will only get bigger and bigger.
Taking the domestic cycle as the main body, by no means shut the door to close the operation, but by giving full play to the potential of domestic demand, so that the domestic market and the international market can be better connected, better use of the two international and domestic markets, two kinds of resources, to achieve stronger and more sustainable development.
At the same time, there is no contradiction between expanding domestic demand and opening up. The smoother the domestic cycle, the more conducive to building a new pattern of opening up, the more conducive to forming new advantages for participation in international cooperation and competition.
Although the international trend of protectionism is now on the rise, we should stand on the right side of history, adhere to deepening reform, expanding openness, strengthening open cooperation in the field of science and technology, promote the construction of an open world economy and promote the construction of a community of human destiny.
The Chinese nation has experienced a lot of hardships in history, but has never been crushed, but has grown more and more courageous, constantly growing up in the tribulations and rising up from the tribulations.
Along the way,with the strong leadership of the Central Committee of the Party, with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, the remarkable advantages of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, the strong mobilization capacity and strong comprehensive strength, and the unity and struggle of the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country, we will be able to overcome all hardships and obstacles, maintain the good momentum of our economic and social development, build a well-off society in an all-round way, and smoothly start a new journey towards building a socialist modern country in an all-round way.

France Ramps up military investment in space-Xinhua
French Defense Minister Florence Pali said on the 24th, France will add hundreds of millions of euros in the space defense budget, the development of space military forces, to prevent other countries may carry out“unfriendly moves ” in outer space.
The French budget for military space projects will increase from 3.6 billion euros (约合 4.2 billion) to 4.3 billion euros (5 5 billion) between 2019 and 2025, Pali told Provence newspaper the same day.
In accordance with the French Military Planning Act 2019-2025, approved by the French Parliament in 2018, France is expected to update its existing observation and communication satellites, launch three electromagnetic listening satellites and modernize space surveillance radars.
French President Emmanuel Macron announced last July that a space military command and an“air and space Force”would be established within the French Air Force.
Paley said she will officially announce the formation of the space force when she visits a military academy in Salon, Provence, later.
The space force, which is part of the Air Force, will be 500 by 2025, Mr. Paley said.
“Gone are the days when people thought that space services served the common good of science, " she said.Today, space is a place for nations to compete for global hegemony.”
Pali reiterated Macron's previous statement, saying France has no intention of provoking an arms race.
"We are by no means engaged in an arms race.But it is my responsibility to fully recognize the threats that we may face.”
Pali recalled the surveillance of a military satellite shared by France and Italy in 2017.
She said it was a Russian satellite that was“ peeping on."
The Russian side denies this claim.
France will“soon”have small patrol satellites capable of spotting and targeting“those behind unfriendly moves,”Mr. Paley said.
French media believe that France sought the establishment of a space force, because US President Donald Trump last February asked the United States Department of Defense to draft the establishment of a space army bill.
Trump signed the Defense Authorization Act last December, approving the creation of the United States ' sixth-largest army, the Space Army.
Some experts worry that the US moves have accelerated the pace of US space militarization and could trigger a new space arms race.

"During the construction of the project, we used geological survey method, geophysical exploration method and advanced drilling method to advance geological forecasting, and adopted special design plans for more than 30 types of caves.Such as the design and construction of a 24-meter long bridge, across the tunnel in the longitudinal length of more than 10 meters, depth of more than 55 meters of large caves, to avoid tunnel settlement."Said the Royal Army.
According to the construction party China Railway Tunnel Bureau, the construction of the tunnel, through the construction of horizontal guidance, grouting water blocking, strengthening the tunnel structure support and the construction of sewage treatment station, not only to ensure the orderly progress of the project, but also to avoid the construction of drainage damage to the small three Gorges scenic area water bodies, at the same time successfully overcome the 7 km long soft rock large deformation and other bad geology, the daily maximum amount of water up to 157,000 cubic meters of multi-burst mud gush water and other construction problems.
When the full line of the Zhengwan High-speed railway is completed and opened to traffic, it will become a new main convenient and fast passenger route to the central plains, North China and Northeast China in southwest China. It is of great significance to improve the capacity and quality of the northeast-to-southwest railway route, improve the layout of the regional road network, speed up the development of tourism resources and urbanization along the route, promote regional coordinated development and promote the implementation of the strategy for the development of the Western region.
Experts say the collection of immigration data through the U.S. Census for the allocation of House seats is unconstitutional
Several civil rights groups and several U.S. cities and counties have sued the federal government, saying the Trump Administration's attempt to exclude undocumented immigrants from the U.S. census is unworkable and unconstitutional.
The U.S. Census will determine the allocation of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.
“It's not going to work, " Sarah Brannon, executive counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, told VOA.”
She went on to say that Trump's request to determine the citizenship of people who receive the census in the census is difficult to do and“not very reliable."”
Another civil liberties group, Common Cause, filed a lawsuit Thursday challenging Trump's executive order.
Cities in New Jersey and Georgia have joined the lawsuit.
Arlington County, Virginia, also joined the lawsuit Friday.
“The U.S. Constitution requires an accurate count of our population every 10 years, " said Garvey, chairman of the Board of Management of Arlington County.We must accurately count everyone who lives in Arlington County, and we must not let this illegal attempt to scare people away and reduce the number of our immigrant communities succeed.”
Other organizations and individuals have praised President Trump's executive order.
Alabama Attorney General Marshall called the executive order a“victory”for the state.
“The allocation of seats in the House of Representatives and in the Electoral College in each state must be based on the number of residents living in each state and the number of residents who are legally resident, " he said.”
The U.S. Supreme Court last year blocked the Trump administration from including citizenship issues on the 2020 Census table.
President Trump signed an executive order earlier this week directing the U.S. Census Bureau's Commerce Secretary, Ross Ross, to submit census-generated data on undocumented populations so that the administration can exclude those undocumented populations from census numbers in each state, thereby determining whether each state will increase or decrease or retain seats in the House of Representatives.
Every 10 years, the United States reallocates seats in the House of Representatives based on demographic changes.

The situation of epidemic prevention and control has continued to improve, the steady economic recovery has been obvious, and the performance of employment and prices, which are closely related to the people's livelihood, has been generally stable.

White House advisers " bite back”states to resume work prematurely
Local time on July 23, the number of confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia in the United States exceeded 4 million, accounting for 30% of global cases.
For months, US President Donald Trump has repeatedly asked states to return to work and to school, only recently to change their attitude and take the initiative to wear masks in public, and his advisers have”rebuked " some state governments to return to work too soon.
On the 22nd, White House Presidential adviser Kellyanne Conway said at a news conference that some state governments did not comply with the resumption of work standards, prematurely restart bars and other places.
Mr. Conway also cited earlier claims that the president had the“absolute power”to decide the state's resumption of work as a misinformation.
"The president is a federalist, and he believes in the autonomy of the states.”
She defended Trump.
However, the“rumor”in Conway's mouth was said by Trump himself at the White House briefing on the outbreak on April 13.
This self-face operation was ridiculed by netizens as " rewriting history."
Kellyanne Conway wants to rewrite history. She's a liar.
Trump called Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer a dictator because she followed medical guidelines and insisted on a shutdown.
Trump wants to push for a return to work so he can hold a rally.
This is not the first time Kellyanne Conway has caused controversy.
In an interview with Fox News on April 15, Conway blurted out: "This is COVID-19, not COVID-1, friends!”
She seems to understand”19 " as a version number, by netizens madly ridiculed: no common sense to read the newspaper!
Is it reasonable for a 3-year-old child to sue the school after being hit by a play on the college playground?
2020-07-26 05:01: 11 Source: Legal Daily Author: Wang Sishuo Responsible editor: Wang Sishuo
The playground was smashed,and the children were compensated and then sued the school
□ Newspaper correspondent Zhao Yifan
Xiaowen, 3, was accidentally hit in the head by Chen from the softball team while playing on a college playground.
After Chen's compensation, Xiaowen's father, Mr. Wen, as Xiaowen's legal representative, sued the school to the court, demanding that the school where the playground was located apologize, and pay a total of 20,000 yuan for medical expenses and psychological damage.
Recently, after hearing the case, the People's Court of Haidian District of Beijing held that the school had set up a protective net in the playground at the time of the incident and had fulfilled the appropriate safety and security obligations, and Chen had made compensation, and accordingly the judgment rejected the plaintiff's claim.
Mr. Wen claims that during the summer vacation of 2019, he took Xiaowen to play on the school playground while the softball team was training on the playground.
In order to avoid the risks, Siu Man, Mr. Man and many other children and parents are active in the safe areas designated by the softball team.
But then the softball team member Chen dropped the ball while pitching, causing the softball over the net to fly to the safety area and hit Xiaowen in the back of the head.
Mr. Wen immediately took Xiaowen to the hospital for treatment and was diagnosed with head trauma.
Mr. Man believes that the facilities of the school's stadium do not comply with the relevant safety regulations and do not manage the team and related facilities effectively.
The school's negligence led to the above-mentioned events, resulting in the small tattoo body suffered great pain,but also brought greater pain to his family, for which the school should bear legal responsibility.
In this regard, the school argued that the school has set up a protective net in the playground, and posted management regulations, training notice, telling to enter the playground must maintain a safe distance from the training site and remind attention to their own safety, the plaintiff can not prove that the school“failed to meet the obligations of safety and security”, so do not agree to compensation.
The court heard that the venue of the incident was a free venue open to the public by the university involved. Although the school has a safety and security obligation for the management of the playground, this safety and security obligation only needs to meet the general obligation to pay attention.
At the time of the incident, the school had set up a protective net in the playground, which had fulfilled the appropriate security obligations, and Chen also compensated Xiaowen for medical expenses, transportation expenses and other losses of more than 2,000 yuan in accordance with the compensation agreement reached earlier.
After that, Xiaowen's parents again claimed the school's compensation,and the court ruled that all the plaintiff's claims were dismissed.
After the verdict, neither party appealed,and the verdict is now in force.
According to Article 37 of the Tort Liability Law of our country, the school, as the administrator of public places, has the obligation of safety and security; in the case of damage caused by the actions of a third person, the third person shall bear the tort liability, but the administrator of public places who have not fulfilled the obligation of safety and security shall bear the corresponding supplementary responsibility.
According to the judge, as the administrator of a public place, he is most likely to understand the actual situation of the whole place, foresee the risks and damage that may occur, and thus is most likely to take the necessary measures to prevent the occurrence of loss or to mitigate the extent of the damage, and the cost of avoiding and mitigating the occurrence of the damage is minimal, so the law stipulates that he shall bear the corresponding safeguard obligation to engage in social activities.
In this case, the school's duty of safety and security should be commensurate with the social activities it engages in in the playground, which is open to the public free of charge. In particular, it should mainly take basic security measures and have the obligation to inform about hidden dangers.
In judicial practice, it is also not appropriate to impose excessive safety and security obligations on public place managers.
If the school has taken to set up a protective network and fulfill the obligation to inform, it can be found that the school is not at fault and should not bear legal responsibility.
In addition, even if the administrators of schools and other public places fail to fulfill their obligations of safety and security, their liability is also supplemented by compensation for damages. In accordance with the newly promulgated civil code, the administrators may also recover compensation from the third party after assuming the additional responsibility.
Therefore, in such an accident, the victim shall not extend the scope of the claim after he has received compensation from the direct infringer.
Under the normalization of epidemic prevention and control, people's enthusiasm for exercise and fitness is high.
With the gradual liberalization of cross-provincial tourism business, the tourism market is also about to usher in a recovery.
Fujian Province resumed its cross-provincial tourism business on July 21,and Xiamen, a popular tourist destination, ushered in a peak of passenger traffic in the first weekend after opening.
As a popular tourist destination city, there are a lot of tourists arriving in Xiamen on weekends.
Xiamen Railway Station is expected to send 3.7 million passengers summer transport, airport passenger flow is mainly students, tourism, visiting relatives.
The tourism market gradually picked up. In July, Xiamen Airport operated 440 daily flights, and domestic flights have returned to 80% of the pre-epidemic levels.
Airlines have encrypted air express routes from Xiamen to Shanghai, Beijing, Kunming, Xi'an and other major cities to seize the recovered tourism market.
At present, a number of travel agencies in Xiamen have launched a number of summer domestic cross-provincial travel products, the team itinerary is mainly outdoor attractions.
In response to the summer passenger rush at railway stations and airports, the relevant units have deployed additional manpower to divert people in areas where check-in counters and security checkpoints are easy to gather. Fujian has also optimized and upgraded the“Eight Min Health Code”to achieve health data sharing and mutual recognition with 31 provinces, and promote the orderly recovery of the tourism market.

Israel strengthens prevention and control of repeated outbreaks
In the early days of the outbreak of new crown pneumonia, Israel's prevention and control measures have been effective.
However, with the gradual lifting of the ban on prevention and control measures, the number of confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia in Israel has risen significantly in recent years. The Israeli government has taken several urgent measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic.
On February 28, the first case of new crown pneumonia was confirmed in Israel. It quickly closed all ports of entry and exit, suspended non-essential industries, changed schools to online classes, restricted public transport and non-essential social activities, blocked cities with severe outbreaks, and jointly maintained preventive and control measures by the military and police.
The series of measures quickly paid off, and by mid-May, new confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia in Israel had dropped to single digits in one single day.
Since June, the number of new confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia has gradually rebounded as the epidemic has been brought under control and all Israeli prevention and control measures have been lifted.
Especially after entering July, the spread of the epidemic has been accelerating.
In recent days, Israel has more than 1,500 new cases per day for eight days, and as of press time on July 25, 916 new cases have been added on that day.
As of 25 July, there were 59,745 confirmed cases and 448 deaths in Israel.
In the face of the rapid rebound of the epidemic, the Israeli government has repeatedly taken urgent measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic.
On July 6, after the number of confirmed cases exceeded 30,000, the Israeli government closed gyms, swimming pools, bars, nightclubs and other public entertainment venues, and introduced a policy of restricting public transport, requiring a maximum of 20 passengers per bus.
On the 17th, the government announced a series of new restrictions, including the implementation of“city closures”on weekends, including the implementation of“city closures”between 17: 00 on Fridays and 5: 00 on Sundays.
During this time, people can go out, but shops, shopping centers, barbershops, beauty salons, libraries, zoos, museums, exhibition halls, swimming pools and tourist attractions will be closed, while basic services such as supermarkets and pharmacies will remain open.
At the same time, on all dates and time periods, gatherings of more than 10 people are prohibited, gyms, studios and other places will be closed, restaurants and cafes are prohibited from dine-in, only take-out services are allowed.
At the same time, the Israeli public has not paid enough attention to the severity of the outbreak and has not been able to work with the government to combat it.
After repeated outbreaks in Israel, many people took to the streets to protest against the government's control measures affecting their economic interests.
On July 11, tens of thousands of people staged a demonstration in Tel Aviv, arguing that anti-epidemic policies were affecting the economy.
On the evening of the 21st, thousands of protesters gathered in front of the official residence of Prime Minister Netanyahu in Jerusalem to protest against Prime Minister Netanyahu's promulgation of a ban on restaurants, cafes and other preventive measures without compensation.
In addition, many people do not comply with the requirements of wearing masks and maintaining a safe social distance of two meters when they are outdoors. In order to avoid being fined by the police for not wearing masks, many people only wear masks on their chin or hang them on their wrists.
During the repeated epidemic, schools are the hardest hit areas of the spread of the new crown virus, and according to reporters recently visited this kindergarten found that the kindergarten teachers and students did not wear masks as required by the government, did not maintain a safe social distance of two meters from each other, for a large number of teachers and students infected with the virus buried hidden dangers.
Professor Eli Waxman, a member of the Expert Advisory Group on combating the epidemic of the Israeli National Security Council, believes that Israel is moving towards a“dangerous situation”, noting that the current measures taken by Israel to prevent and control the epidemic are not enough and that all leisure and recreational activities and summer schools should be closed to control the further spread of the epidemic.
Waxman said Israel lacked an overall plan to combat the outbreak. Parliament and government departments should abandon their interests as soon as possible and agree on clear steps to combat the outbreak, including restrictions in different sectors.

Wu Fengfang, a farmer in Guyuan, Ningxia, couldn't beat his wife, Dai Tianfu, and two people took a car from their home 20 miles away to Liangyun Cultural Compound.
Despite the inconvenience of two years, 77-year-old Dai Tianfu is counting on“coming here every once in a while and having a fun game.”
This is a humble yard in the Yuanzhou District of Guyuan City. Unlike the general farm house, the yard often carries melodious Qin cavities, as well as wonderful shadow plays, embroidery works, traditional Qin cavities, Meehu dramas and so on.
The owner of the compound, Liang Yun, was a carpenter.
More than 10 years ago, the love of shadow shadow, singing, he began to plan the construction of cultural compound.
With Liangyun Cultural Compound, the cultural life of the villagers has become rich and colorful.
The reporter has not yet entered the Liang Yun culture compound, the tune of the Qin cavity has been passed out.
The villagers of the neighboring village, Bai Lixiang, are singing Qin excerpts for the townsfolk.
As long as she has free time, she will come to the cultural compound to perform programs for the townsfolk.
Recently, Bai Lixiang also played a webcast.
“It is a very happy thing to have a stage for more people to see themselves perform, " she said.”
On the stage, the singers were single-minded,the strummers a tune, and, despite being amateurs, the enthusiasm was unabated.
Just like the rustic style of the farm house, outside the Qin cavity, the“grass-roots”art and intangible cultural heritage in the Liangyun Cultural Compound fluttered.
The compound also houses more than 300 pieces of agricultural utensils from different eras, traditional and handmade tiles, paper-cutting, embroidery, shadow shadow and other objects.
Liang Yun led the reporter into the courtyard of the exhibition hall, which showed his collection of old objects,old wine jug,three strings, spinning car and so on.
Why did an ordinary farmer build a cultural compound?
"Shadow play is my family's craft, and I've been learning it since I was 15 years old.”
Founded in 2012, Liangyun Cultural Compound has become the first“Intangible Cultural Heritage Exhibition Hall”in Ningxia and the demonstration compound for the protection of intangible cultural heritage in Guyuan City.

"Liu's spy drama" returns again "odds" to see Liu Yunlong Li Liqun opponent "soaring drama" - Xinhua
The 40-episode spy drama "The Odds" will land on Beijing Satellite TV from July 16.
"Odds" is based on real historical facts, based on the dust for many years, the first appearance of the Soviet military archives.
Liu Yunlong, a well-known actor in the“Spy Drama”, broke through the image in the play and challenged a“stuttering agent”with a happy feeling.
In recent years,the popularity of such plays as "Pretender", "mask" and "kite" has proved that the spy war type drama has a strong vitality.
Unlike previous spy works, "Odds" looks at the world and extends the story to the Soviet Far East battlefield.
Set in the final stage of the Anti-Japanese War of 1944, it tells the story of Tang Fei (Liu Yunlong), a secret intelligence worker of the Communist Party of China, under the leadership of the secretary of the Linhe Provincial Party Committee and the director of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Bureau, carrying out the Soviet Far East Intelligence Bureau's“Mudanoula”strategic operation.
Many spy drama, the actor as a senior spy, a appearance is handsome, high iq, mature perfect image.
But in Liu Yunlong's view, such a person is not suitable for spying,“The spy should be the kind of person who can not be found in the pile of people, if the appearance is the kind of very handsome image, I want everyone to pay attention to you, can you still lurk?""Kite" has a line,’You don't come to catch me, I forget that I am a Kuomintang', the spy to elitist.”
So in“Odds”, Liu Yunlong ingeniously designed his hero Tang Fei as a "stuttering agent" with a sense of joy.
The other phalanx in "Odds" is supported by Fukuhara, a Japanese man played by Liang Guanhua, and Fang Shibao, the director of the police Department played by Li Liqun.
One south and one north of the two powerful drama bone, for the whole drama added a lot of master moves to see the point.
Director Yin Fei used the word”drag play“to describe the rival play of Li Liqun and Liu Yunlong in the play, " It is definitely drag play, they two special tacit understanding, their tacit understanding to me is very impactful."A lot of times their plays are’on-the-spot', for example, we only wrote half a page of length, when I do not stop the shooting, they can continue to play.”
When the actors are in the role and ensure their character status, they can not only shape the role from the character's point of view, but also bring more viewing possibilities to the audience. Yin Fei said that such a play is enough to make a difference.
In the play, you can also see a lot of“Liu's spy drama”in the familiar face,“kite”in the famous moment, majestic "mountain City F4", in the "odds" also gathered three.
Hou Yu and Liu Mingyang, who once played Song Xiaoan and Zhao Jianzhi, once again played Tang Fei's right-hand man.
Director Yin Fei introduced, " These two people have no inferior roots, they are just in that era, that environment drift with the current."”
Liu Yunlong also offered, " We have to have a human touch."This human touch means that the people around me must have good and bad, bad people are the enemy, but also to develop them,our team must also grow up.”
The ending of these two people in the play is also carefully designed by Liu Yunlong. He believes that he will give the audience a satisfactory answer.

The Lancet article commends China's anti-epidemic efforts and encourages countries to learn from their experiences-<url>
As a country with a population of 1.4 billion and a size similar to Europe or the United States, China has effectively controlled the new crown epidemic at this stage, without the widespread spread, and has largely controlled the domestic epidemic, the Lancet magazine said on the 25th.
China has invested heavily in domestic research and public health over the past decade, making it much more prepared for the new crown than it was for severe acute respiratory syndrome(SARS), the article said.
At the time of the SARS outbreak in 2002, China was initially unprepared, especially when the pathogen could not be identified, the authors said.
When the new crown virus was discovered in December 2019, Chinese scientists were quickly able to identify the virus species and shared genome sequencing data with the international community on January 11, 2020.
By the end of January, doctors from mainland China and Hong Kong had clarified the clinical features of the virus, warning the world of the threat of the new crown virus through a research paper published in the Lancet.
China has also been at the forefront of vaccine research, which has been carried out very quickly and rigorously through close domestic cooperation under a state of emergency, and in May and July, the Lancet published the results of early trials of the new crown vaccine developed by China, respectively.
China's experience shows that it is very important to invest in the national health and research system to effectively improve laboratory capacity.
This is the basis for a rapid and effective national response to health emergencies and global health security.
Other countries, especially low-and middle-income countries, are well worth learning from and learning from.
In addition, China's experience has proved that on the basis of strong research, there must be a strong high-level decisively and scientifically based to make the right decision, which can make the new crown epidemic is effectively controlled.
The article emphasizes that governments and their leaders must respect science, understand the value of science and act on it in the most beneficial way to society.
In the early stages of the outbreak, China's State Health and Construction Ministry sent three groups of infectious disease experts to Wuhan to investigate the risk and spread of the new crown virus. Their recommendations provided the basis for the decision to“seal the city”of Wuhan on January 23.
At the end of the article, it is emphasized that countries need to strengthen global cooperation and joint response to global health emergencies.

More than 30,000 Confirmed cases of New crown in Japan-Xinhua
According to statistics, there were 239 new confirmed cases in Tokyo on the 26th, more than 200 new cases in a single day for six consecutive days, and a total of 11,214 cases have been recorded.
In addition, there were 141 new confirmed cases in Osaka Prefecture, 90 in Fukuoka Prefecture and 80 in Aichi Prefecture.
Telecom network fraud crimes rose 70% in the first half of the year -- New York, March 15, 2013 / Prnewswire / --
Beijing, July 26, according to the highest prosecution website news, in the first half of this year, the national procuratorial organs prosecuted a total of 58,101 fraud crimes, an increase of 35% year-on-year.
In particular, among the crimes that hinder the prevention and control of the epidemic, fraud crimes are frequent, and the number of fraud crimes prosecuted by the procuratorial organs accounts for 43.4 percent of the total number of crimes that hinder the prevention and control of the epidemic.
The Supreme People's Procuratorate has carried out targeted guidance.Of the 10 typical cases of epidemic prevention and control that have been issued, there are nine cases involving the crime of fraud.
From the case-handling situation of the procuratorial organs in the first half of the year, the number of crimes involving fraud ranged from the macro-policy of the state to the people's clothing, food and housing, including fraud involving the epidemic epidemic,“medical trust”fraud,“health care products”fraud,“enrollment intermediary”fraud,“routine loan”fraud, fraud against state subsidies, national assets thawing fraud, etc., and constantly“introduced new innovations”, covering education, medical care, employment, old-age pension, social security, land acquisition and demolition, precise poverty alleviation, financial credit and other fields, not only causing economic losses to the victims, but also seriously affecting economic and social development.
In particular, some telecommunications network scams break through the limits of national borders, regions and personnel, with stakeholders, cross-border, remote, electronic payment and other characteristics, do not specify the number of victims of the group, the harm is great.
For example, some set up special companies, rent high-end office buildings, set up multiple departments or positions, the use of legal network platform publicity, recruitment, training and assessment of recruiters, the use of enterprise mode of operation management, wearing a“legitimate coat”, more confusing.
It is the duty of the procuratorial organs to punish and prevent crimes according to law, and to issue early warning to the public and relevant departments in a timely manner.
In handling judicial cases, procuratorial organs conscientiously perform their duties, not only insisting on maintaining a high-pressure situation against fraud crimes, but also refining various law enforcement measures in a targeted manner, and promoting social governance through the formulation and issuance of procuratorial recommendations.
The procuratorial organs strictly control the facts, evidence, procedures and the application of law in the arrest and prosecution of fraud cases, taking the facts as the basis and the law as the criterion, so as to be worthy of the task.
Especially for telecommunications network fraud crime, pay attention to the core role of electronic data in the identification of facts, and strive to build a chain of evidence between electronic data, verbal evidence, documentary evidence to confirm each other.
For example, the Procuratorate of Yinzhou District, Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province, handled a case of epidemic-related fraud, the procuratorate first intervened in advance, from the occurrence of the case to the completion of only 5 days, reflecting the attitude and determination to handle quickly and strictly, to maintain the overall stability of the society.
In the process of examining arrests and prosecuting prosecutions, attention has been paid to the work of prosecuting missing criminals in cases, and the public security organs have corrected 733 missing persons and 1,113 co-offenders who have been omitted by the public security organs to examine and prosecute cases.
In the first half of the year, procuratorial organs throughout the country issued 298 procuratorial recommendations on fraud crimes, promoting joint efforts to prevent fraud crimes and promote deep-level governance.
For example, in view of the loopholes found in the supervision of telecommunications networks, such as communications enterprises, banks and intermediary organizations, the Guangzhou Procuratorate and the Dongguan Procuratorate of Guangdong Province put forward timely procuratorial recommendations, urging the relevant units to strengthen supervision and improve the mechanism, so as to promote the construction of long-term systems.
Fourth, to do a good job in the recovery and damage.
Procuratorial organs around the country seize important links such as intervening in investigation, guiding evidence collection, examining and prosecuting, and urge the investigation organs to actively recover the stolen money, cooperate with the relevant departments to do a good job in the recovery and damage of the stolen money, and strive to minimize the economic losses caused by fraud and crime to the people.
In the case where the real estate may be disposed of first in other cases, the first "letter of suspension of execution" shall be issued and served to the relevant courts in a timely manner. It is recommended that the previously sealed court suspend the execution of the real estate involved in the case until the facts of the crime are ascertained, so as to make the best efforts to recover the real estate involved in the case and recover the losses of the victims.
Prosecutors remind everyone to be very vigilant about fraud crimes, do not expect“pie in the sky”, do not think cheap credulity, keep their“money bag”.
Pinna Town, Weining County, Guizhou Province: Dwarf apple trees widen the road to poverty alleviation-<url>

Hot heat, economic Daily-China Economic network reporter into Guizhou Province Weining County, the town of the town in the sea village.
In the hot sun, Li Yuanzhong, a villager, weeded grass in the base. Although his face was red, he hummed a few songs in his mouth from time to time.
Weining County, where the town is located, because of the low latitude,high altitude, plenty of light, large temperature difference between day and night, the apple produced high sugar content, good taste, has a certain popularity in the surrounding area, but also because of the small size, spots, has not been able to sell a good price, failed to form an industrial scale.
Pinna Town was once a”Baogu potato spring and autumn " poor township, 10 years ago the local poverty rate was as high as 25.8%.
It is urgent to change the traditional planting habits, adjust the industrial structure and increase the income of farmers in the critical period of poverty alleviation and decisive victory.
Chen Chao, party secretary of the town, and a group of people in the town, after many visits, believe that the industrial development can no longer go the old way.
To this end, the town of Pinna introduced leading enterprises, in a modern way to grow apples.
Hou Jianwen, deputy general manager of Weining Chaoyue Agriculture Co., Ltd., came to the town from Shaanxi Province in 2015 to investigate, and looked at the local planting conditions at a glance, and began to plant apple trees locally in 2016.
At first, the village mobilized Li Yuanzhong to transfer the land out to plant apple trees. Li Yuanzhong and his wife muttered: "After planting apples for so many years, they did not see who planted apples in the village and made a fortune."”
"All apples are dwarf apples that do not make the apple tree grow too tall.”
What Li Yuanzhong did not expect was that this apple planting adopted a new method,irrigation pipes spread under each apple tree,water and fertilizer poured together to the roots of the tree,when the fruit is collected in the autumn, the tractor directly into the orchard, standing can pick fruit.
At present, the Apple base has gradually entered the period of abundant production, the market is also as expected by Hou Jianwen, Apple does not worry about selling, loved by Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and other urban consumers.
The growing apple industry has made a new change in Li Yuanzhong's life. Although he is still farming, he has a new source of income.
The Li Yuanzhong family has more than 9 acres of land transferred to the apple base. Each year, in addition to the guaranteed land transfer fee, there is a profit dividend after hanging the fruit. The couple usually work in the base,“a person can get 80 yuan a day, and have work all year round.”
Li Yuan advised reporters that last year the profit dividend received more than 2,800 yuan, plus land transfer fees and the couple's income from migrant workers, a family income of more than 80,000 yuan,“eat and wear do not worry, well-off days have passed.”
The annual output value of 1 mu apple is more than 15,000 yuan, which is about 10 times that of maize.”
Chen Chao told reporters that the whole town is currently planting 20,000 acres of apples, only in the sea village there are 6,000 acres, covering 4,056 households, 17,200 farmers, including 656 households, 2,952 people, a year salary of more than 6 million yuan, really realized the base is built in front of the door, do not have to go out to work.
Li Yuanzhong, who is growing up in the fanny pack, also began to realize his "wish".
This year's Lunar New Year, Li Yuanzhong bought an off-road vehicle,and now drives a car to and from work every day.“There are more than a dozen acres of land in the family, and when the next step is to expand the scale of the Apple base, all of them will be transferred to them, and the income will be more."”

Membrane separation technology helps crack the " greenhouse effect”
Schematic diagram of new mixed substrate membrane preparation technology
Today, the atmospheric environment and bioenergy team of Tianjin University has made significant progress in the“membrane separation method to capture carbon dioxide " and successfully developed a new hybrid substrate membrane preparation technology to significantly improve the carbon dioxide capture performance of membrane materials.
Related results have been published as the cover article of the international journal "Greenhouse Gases: Science and Technology".
The "greenhouse effect“is a major environmental problem plaguing human development, and carbon dioxide emissions are the culprit of the”greenhouse effect".
How to efficiently capture and use the carbon dioxide emitted by humans is the focus of scientists ' attention.
"Membrane separation method" is a new carbon dioxide capture technology, it separates carbon dioxide gas with the help of membrane materials, with high efficiency and energy saving, simple operation.
How to make the membrane material "deep breath", improve the efficiency of gas separation, is the use of membrane separation method to capture carbon dioxide bottleneck difficulties.
Through repeated experiments, the research team of Tianjin University explored the influence of different solvents on the separation properties of membrane gas.
Experimental results show that N-methylpyrrolidone as the preparation solvent, the resulting membrane material carbon nanotubes are more uniform distribution“ "more breathable", effectively enhance the membrane material gas separation efficiency and rate.
The carbon dioxide separation performance of the mixed substrate membrane prepared by this new technology is close to the theoretical separation limit of such membrane materials.
"The new technology provides new ideas for the capture of carbon dioxide by membrane separation.”
Li Run, a member of the atmospheric environment and bioenergy team at Tianjin University, said:“ We hope that this technology will provide strong support for the treatment of flue gas in future coal-fired power plants and chemical companies, and play a significant role in controlling greenhouse gas emissions.”
What is a professional grade difference before volunteering to fill in the report-<url>
2020-07-27 02: 22: 36 Source: Chongqing Morning Post Author: Yu Xiao Editor: Yu Xiao
Before you volunteer, figure out what a professional difference is.
Every year, there are students or parents who do not understand the terms involved in the volunteer application, and thus affect the volunteer application.
This year, Beijing Jiaotong University,Beijing University of Science and Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, five universities jointly issued the 2020 enrollment policy, eliminating the professional grade difference.
What is the meaning of professional grade difference,and what is the significance of voluntary filing?
There are three ways of professional assignment rules
Experts remind, before filling in the volunteer, be sure to read the "admissions charter" of your favorite school, understand the admission rules of colleges and universities, including the ratio of adjustment, professional allocation rules and so on.
Professional allocation rules, refers to the college after the shift, for the major admission there are three major priority, score priority, professional grade difference.
The specific method used by colleges and universities will be clear in the "Admissions Charter".
But there are also some colleges and universities admission principle is the overall score priority,there is no difference between the major.
When the score does not reach the first professional volunteer admission score line, then see whether to reach the second professional volunteer admission score line, and so on until the admission to the last professional volunteer, there is no difference between the professional volunteers.
The so-called”professional grade difference“is when colleges and universities arrange candidates for majors, according to one or more of the score values published in the admissions regulations, to determine the admission of candidates for different professional voluntary candidates, this score value is”professional grade difference".
That is, the difference between the scores of the institutions in the admission of candidates in the first professional volunteer and non-first professional volunteer, the difference between the professional volunteer scores, such as 3 points, 2 points, 1 point and so on.
For example.
Suppose the student Xiaoming reported A university, the test of 560 points, their professional volunteers are: computer, international trade, automation, mechanical engineering,e-commerce, A university's professional admission practice professional grade difference method, the difference is divided into 2 points, 1 point, 1 point, 0 points.
If the computer is not accepted, then his score will be subtracted by 2 points, according to the score of 558 points and the first professional volunteer to apply for“international trade”candidates, to determine whether the professional admission requirements are met; if still not met, the score is subtracted by 1 point(i.e. 557 points)for the third professional volunteer“automated”admission; if still not met, the score is subtracted by 1 point(i.e. 556 points)for the fourth professional volunteer“automated”admission If the subsequent major is still unable to meet its professional volunteers, it will no longer reduce the points, and so on.
Different university professional grade difference settings are different
With the popularity of parallel volunteering, many colleges and universities have canceled the professional grade difference, but some colleges and universities still retain this method this year, from the "admissions charter" published by the schools, this year there are mainly more than 20 universities set the professional grade difference.
For example, Sichuan Agricultural University,Shandong University of Science and Technology, Heilongjiang University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Jiangxi Normal University, Chengdu Medical College, Northeast Electric Power University, Jimei University, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing University of Technology, Ningxia University, Shandong University of Science and Technology, China Civil Aviation Flight College, etc.
In these colleges and universities, each university set a different professional grade difference.
Some colleges and universities have a grade difference in each major, such as Ningxia University. Candidates who have been submitted to the university in the file are admitted according to the order in which candidates fill in the professional volunteers and then decrement by 1 point in order to be admitted according to the score.
And some universities have set up different professional grades between different majors.
For example, Jimei University, professional volunteer grade difference is 4 points, that is, the difference between the first professional volunteer and other professional volunteer grade is 3 points, there is no difference between other professional volunteers, regarded as parallel volunteers, other professional volunteers and transfer professional volunteers professional grade difference is 1 point.
When filling out the volunteer application, candidates and parents must carefully read the admission policy of the school to see if there is a professional grade difference and what is the form of the grade difference. While taking full account of the scores, they should also rationally analyze the proposed school and major. If institutions explicitly adopt the grade difference method for admission in the admissions charter, candidates should pay attention to the gradient between the majors and improve the chances of admission.
