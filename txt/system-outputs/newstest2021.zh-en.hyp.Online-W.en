Xinhua Commentary: Make excellent returning migrant workers a force for rural revitalization-Xinhua
Talent is the key to rural revitalization.
Where to find talents?
Excellent migrant workers returning to their hometowns are the indispensable force.
By Shang Haichun, Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The title: Make outstanding returning migrant workers a force for rural revitalization
Zhang Xiong, 34, who lives in Orchard Village, Meishan City, Sichuan Province, quit his job with a monthly salary of tens of thousands of dollars in Beijing in 2010 to start his own business in his hometown.
After a few years of hard work, he now operates a family farm with an annual income of more than one million yuan, and has become a famous wealthy leader, and has been selected to join the village "two committees".
In recent years, in the national poverty alleviation and rural revitalization, a series of policies to support and benefit agriculture have inspired more and more excellent migrant workers like Zhang Xiong to choose to return home and start their own business, activating a pool of spring water in the countryside.
In 2019 alone, more than 8,000 village party branch secretaries, 61,000 village reserves and more than 20,000 party members have been created from the excellent migrant workers returned to Sichuan, a province with a large population in the west of China and a large labor export province, to take advantage of the situation and implement the "excellent migrant workers return to cultivate project", providing a strong guarantee for winning the battle against poverty and implementing the rural revitalization strategy. This will provide a strong guarantee for winning the battle against poverty and implementing the rural revitalization strategy.
The key to a well-off life depends on the villagers.
Since the reform and opening up, a large number of young and strong laborers in China's rural areas have gone out to work to increase their income, and some of them have started their own enterprises through hard work.
But objectively also led to rural "hollowing out" to varying degrees, especially the weakening of rural grass-roots organizations, the village party branch secretary and party members are showing "an old a low" characteristics, that is, ageing, low education, the village party organization leader team is not strong, and The problem of youthfulness is prominent.
If rural talents and other elements keep flowing to the cities in one direction, the villages will be "bloodless" and "anemic" for a long time, and revitalization is just an empty word.
Attracting those migrant workers who are capable, conscious and interested in serving their hometowns, guiding them to return to their hometowns and become wealthy leaders, and training them as party members and rural cadres on merit to enrich the grassroots cadres, is the fundamental solution to the problem of rural party members and grassroots party organizations.
Excellent migrant workers to attract back, but also to let them stay and do a good job.
In recent years, Sichuan started from the party building of migrant workers, based on the strict criteria of the candidates, the establishment of excellent migrant workers directed back, service protection, training to enhance the ability, selection and use of institutional mechanisms, so that they have the ability to enhance, work on the security, life has the hope, really rooted in the countryside, officers have a sense of achievement in business.
This year is the closing year of the decisive battle against poverty, and talent is the key factor to make a good connection between poverty eradication and rural revitalization.
Party committees and governments at all levels should attach great importance to the group of excellent returning migrant workers, and through comprehensive measures, make them a task force and a force that can stay, fight and take away, so as to provide strong organizational guarantee and talent support for rural poverty eradication and development revitalization.

The capital's natural ecology continues to improve, attracting wildlife to "settle" in the city
Beijing wildlife has reached more than 500 species
(Reporter Wang Bin) Beijing Youth Daily reporter learned from the Municipal Bureau of Landscaping that in recent years, as the natural ecology of the capital continues to improve, the species and number of wild animals also continue to increase.
At present, the number of terrestrial vertebrate wildlife inhabiting Beijing has increased to more than 500 species, including brown martens, black storks and other national-level protected animals, as well as gazelles, giant swans, gray cranes, mandarin ducks and other national-level protected animals.
Whether it is an urban forest planted in the second ring road or a small wetland embedded between buildings, it not only brings the wildness of nature to the citizens of the capital, but also attracts wild animals to "settle" in the city.
In the summer, the Song Mountain National Nature Reserve in the Yanshan Mountains in the northwest of Yanqing District is a vibrant place.
A raccoon is playing by a mountain stream, while two dog badgers are playing with each other.
A wild boar is rubbing against the bark of a tree, unable to resist the scratching. Hu Qiaoli, director of the Songshan National Nature Reserve Management Office, said that as of the end of 2019, 178 species of wildlife, including national-level protected animals such as golden eagles and second-level protected animals such as spoonbills and gazelles, live in this green sea with a total area of more than 6,200 hectares, and nearly one-third of the city's wildlife species can be found here.
"In Songshan, wild animals are the real 'masters', and our staff can at best be considered as people's 'bodyguards'."
Hu Qiaoli said, in order to understand the situation of wildlife in the reserve, there are more than 30 professional patrol members every day, along 16 carefully developed protection routes, and every month there will be a trip to "turn the big circle", with a full day almost all over the reserve.
"During the patrols, not only do they check and record the biodiversity, but they also check the installation of artificial bird nests, rescue injured wildlife, install infrared cameras in the field, and so on."
The Songshan National Nature Reserve has now installed more than 200 infrared cameras to record the living conditions of wild animals in the forest.
Hu Qiaoli said that as the reserve's biodiversity has been enriched over the past few years, more and more wild animals have appeared on camera, with leopard cats, raccoons and pig badgers becoming "permanent guests" and the "appearance rate" of gazelles, a Grade II protected animal, also increasing.
Zhang Zhiming, Director of the Wildlife and Wetland Protection Division of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Landscape Architecture, introduced that the number of terrestrial vertebrate wildlife in Beijing has increased from 461 species in 1994 to more than 500 species today, and the number of wildlife species and numbers in Beijing have continued to increase in recent years.
The increasingly common presence of wildlife in the city is closely related to the continuous upgrading of urban greening in the capital in recent years.
In particular, the new round of one million mu of afforestation and greening construction, which began in 2018, proposes to reshape the urban ecological environment, improve the ecological function of woodland green space, and highlight the concept of "near nature".
The planning aims to achieve interconnection and interaction with the surrounding green space, so that wildlife can easily "visit friends and relatives", and the trees planted are the nectar and food source plants that animals love.

France Nantes church fire: parish volunteer admits to arson, usually kind and reticent - CNN
July 26 (Xinhua) -- According to foreign media reports, on July 18, Nantes, France's religious and historical architectural treasures, the famous Cathedral of St. Peter and St. Paul, was severely damaged in a fire, the large organ was completely destroyed.
On July 26, Nantes prosecutors announced that a parish volunteer responsible for guarding the cathedral had been charged with "arson".
He has admitted that he set the fire in the church.
Local prosecutor Senas said the 39-year-old parish volunteer from Rwanda admitted to lighting three fires in the cathedral during the night, according to reports.
The man's lawyer said the arsonist now regrets having done such a thing.
The man entered France several years ago through the asylum route and was given asylum in the parish where the fire took place, where he was taken in at the church.
The prosecution noted that recently, he tried to renew his visa and is in dialogue and communication with the police department about it.
But the church says it still can't believe that this usually very kind, smiling, but not very talkative believer would destroy the church he loves so much.
On the day of the July 18 fire, the volunteer had already been questioned by police for illogical problems in his account, but he was later released.

Comprehensive news: U.S. unilateralism undermines relations between two countries, international public opinion supports China's countermeasures against U.S.-Xinhua
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -- A comprehensive Xinhua correspondent reported: On the morning of July 24, the Chinese Foreign Ministry informed the U.S. Embassy in Beijing that China had decided to revoke the permission for the establishment and operation of the U.S. Consulate General in Chengdu and made specific demands for the consulate to stop all operations and activities.
International public opinion believes that the unilateralist measures taken by the United States have caused serious disturbances in the relations between China and the United States, and that it is legitimate and necessary for China to respond to the unreasonable provocations of the U.S. side and to take countermeasures.
Andrés Borges, director of the Center for Chinese Studies at the Institute of International Studies of the University of Chile, said that the unilateralist measures of the United States have destroyed the bridge of understanding between the peoples of China and the United States and put the relations between the two powers in crisis.
China notified the U.S. of the closure of its Consulate General in Chengdu as a countermeasure to the U.S. unilateral measures, in line with diplomatic practice.
According to Patricio Giusto, professor at the Catholic University of Argentina and director of the Center for Arab-Chinese Studies, the above-mentioned Chinese decision is a legitimate and necessary countermeasure to previous U.S. provocations and is not aimed at the general American public.
The U.S. is trying to distract the U.S. public by pressuring China to cover up its ineffective response to the new crown epidemic.
Bambang Suljono, chairman of the Center for Asian Innovation Studies, an Indonesian think tank, said the provocative diplomatic posture of the United States has caused serious distress in relations between China and the United States, which are facing serious challenges.
China's notification to the U.S. to close its Consulate General in Chengdu is a normal countermeasure and in line with diplomatic practice, reflecting both China's principled position of resolutely defending its own interests and the justifiable and favorable nature of Chinese diplomacy.
Tanzanian current affairs commentator Francis Semwinza said that the above decision of China is a legitimate and necessary response to the provocation of the United States.
If China-US relations are to return to normal, the US should take the initiative to improve relations with China and stop interfering in its internal affairs.
The United States should focus on how to achieve a win-win situation with China economically and politically, and how to benefit the two peoples and the international community as a whole.
Ali Yousuf, executive director of the Sudan-based Federation of Arab-Chinese Friendship Associations, said the countermeasures China was forced to take were a legitimate and necessary response to the unreasonable actions of the U.S. side, in line with international law and basic norms of international relations, as well as diplomatic practices.
The previous request by the U.S. side to close the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is a serious violation of international law and basic norms of international relations.
I hope the U.S. side will revoke its previous decision and create the necessary conditions for the two countries to return to normal relations.
An editorial in Singapore's Union-Tribune said that the larger strategic intent of the U.S. is to encircle China and prevent its continued rise.
In the face of the U.S. step by step, China is reluctant to see Sino-U.S. relations continue to deteriorate, but it has to take countermeasures.

Poland to withdraw from European treaty to prevent violence against women
Poland will take steps next week to withdraw from the European treaty on the prevention of violence against women, the Justice Ministry said Saturday.
Poland's right-wing government cabinet says the treaty tramples on the rights of students' parents by requiring schools to teach them topics about gender issues.
Polish Justice Minister Joe Blow held a press conference and said his Justice Ministry on Monday will ask the Ministry of Labor and Family to begin withdrawing from the treaty.
That treaty is also known as the Istanbul Convention.
Iobulo said, "The treaty contains some elements of what we consider to be a harmful ideological nature."
Poland's ruling Law and Justice Party and its and its ruling coalition partners have a close alliance with the Roman Catholic Church and promote a conservative social agenda.
Polish President Duda made hostility to gay rights one of his main issues during his successful re-election campaign this month.
On Friday, thousands of Poles, most of them women, protested against the withdrawal from the convention in Warsaw and several other cities.
"The purpose of withdrawing from the treaty is to legalize domestic violence," Lempert, one of the organizers of the protest, said at a protest march in Warsaw.
Some protesters carried banners that read, "The Law and Justice Party is a hell for women.
The Law and Justice Party has long complained about the Istanbul Convention.
Poland's previous centrist-run government ratified the convention in 2015.
The Law and Justice government said the pact was not respectful of religion and required liberal social policies to be taught in schools.
But as of now the party has not decided to withdraw from the pact.

The FAA warned that if the 5th stage check valves on all two engines of the airliner were corroded, they could seize in the open position, resulting in a complete loss of power and an inability to restart the engines.
The aviation regulator ordered that once the check valves are found to be corroded, airline operators must replace this critical component before the airliner is put back into service.
Boeing responded later in the day that the new crown outbreak had led to lower demand for travel, and that many airliners had been shut down or used less often, making "check valves more susceptible to corrosion.

The Associated Press reported that the major U.S. air carriers' passenger planes usually fly multiple times a day, but after the outbreak of the new crown outbreak, a large number of passenger planes grounded; with passenger travel demand has been slowly growing recently, some passenger planes back into operation.
The FAA did not release details of the four air parking reports.
Alaska Airlines disclosed one of the incidents later in the day on the 24th.
The carrier said in a statement that one of its airliners made an emergency landing at Austin Airport on July 15 after one of its engines suddenly stalled on a flight from Seattle, Wash. to Austin, Texas.
Alaska Airlines said it had replaced the engine on that plane and had followed FAA instructions to check the engines on six aircraft.
American Airlines, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines said on the 24th that there were no engine flameouts associated with air check valves on their airliners.
American Airlines' four aircraft will be inspected, and United Airlines' 28 aircraft will be inspected.
Delta Air Lines said it would inspect 20 of its planes, but did not say whether there had been engine stalls.
Several media outlets reported that the FAA's emergency airworthiness directive is another blow to Boeing.
A Boeing 737 MAX airliner each from Indonesia's Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashed in October 2018 and March 2019, killing a combined 346 people.
The series of airliners was subsequently grounded globally, discontinued in January and resumed production in May of this year.
FAA Administrator Steve Dixon acknowledged in June that the FAA "made mistakes" in its regulation of Boeing regarding the 737 MAX airliner.

U.S. launches countervailing investigation on China for the first time on the basis of "undervaluation of RMB exchange rate
The U.S. Department of Commerce recently announced its decision to initiate an anti-dumping and countervailing investigation into ties (cable ties) originating in China and to launch an investigation into the "undervaluation of the RMB exchange rate" program.
China's Ministry of Commerce pointed out that this is the first time that the U.S. has opened an investigation into the so-called "RMB exchange rate undervaluation" item in a countervailing case, which China firmly opposes.
China's Ministry of Commerce issued a press release on the 23rd evening, saying that China implements a managed floating exchange rate system based on market supply and demand, adjusted with reference to a basket of currencies, and that the market plays a decisive role in the formation of the exchange rate.
The press release emphasized that, in general, the RMB exchange rate is at a reasonable equilibrium level and is not undervalued.
Since 2005, the RMB has appreciated by more than 17% against the US dollar.
According to data published by the Bank for International Settlements, between early 2005 and May 2020, the nominal effective exchange rate of the RMB appreciated by 38% and the real effective exchange rate by 49%, making it the strongest currency among the G20 economies and one of the most appreciated currencies globally.
The Commerce Department noted that the exchange rate issue is beyond the authority of members to conduct countervailing investigations under World Trade Organization rules.
The U.S. regulation change in February this year to conduct countervailing investigations on other countries' exchange rates has been suspected of violating WTO rules and is opposed by many parties.
Even according to the U.S. regulations, the applicant's complaint contains a large number of errors and does not have the necessary elements of countervailing such as financial support, benefit award and exclusivity, the press release said.
China urged the U.S. side to abide by existing international rules and stop conducting countervailing investigations into the so-called "undervaluation of the RMB exchange rate".
Influenced by the further rise in tensions between the U.S. and China, the offshore and onshore RMB depreciated significantly against the U.S. dollar during the 22nd session, both falling below the RMB7.0 per dollar mark.
Whether the U.S. Department of Commerce's move is intended to force up the yuan deserves attention.
The spot exchange rate of the yuan against the U.S. dollar rose above the 7.0 mark on the 23rd, closing at 6.9961.
The median exchange rate of the yuan against the dollar, which is officially regulated, was lowered by 17 basic points to 6.9938 on the 24th.

Lewis family: John Lewis was a fighter who "fought for the weakest"
U.S. Congressman and civil rights fighter John Lewis was memorialized as a "fighter for the weakest" at a memorial service held in his honor on Saturday (July 25).
Lewis' public memorial service has been held in Alabama since Saturday.
There were two memorial services on the first day.
At a public memorial service Saturday at Troy University in Alabama, Lewis' five siblings and a nephew and grandson spoke of him as a loving, fearless man who put his family first.
"He devoted his life to helping others," said Henry "Grant" Lewis, Lewis' youngest brother, at the service.
Samuel Lewis said his mother had warned John to "stay out of trouble and stay out of trouble."
He added that John did not heed his mother's warning, saying, "We all knew John would always get into trouble, always in trouble, but it was for sticking to the right thing, which was a good trouble."
Lewis' siblings reminded those at the memorial service that John's most famous argument was to make "good trouble," that is, to not shy away from starting trouble as long as it was for the sake of justice.
John applied to Troy University in Troy, Alabama, where he was born, but the then all-white school rejected his application for admission.
John Lewis, who as a boy preached the gospel to chickens on his family's farm, went on to earn a degree in religion and philosophy from Fisk University.
Years later, Troy University awarded Lewis an honorary doctorate.
Sen. Doug Jones (R-Ala.) said the current protesters "are protesting peacefully and non-violently," as Lewis did during the civil rights movement.
Jones said, "Even if President Trump were to turn the tide and call all the protesters thugs, he would be wrong.
The protesting masses are patriots who want America to move toward a more equal nation."
A six-day series of events to honor Lewis will culminate this week with a funeral in Georgia.
On Saturday Lewis' casket rested at a public memorial at Troy University, where people came to pay their respects to the pioneer of the civil rights movement.
Later Saturday, a private ceremony honored him at a chapel in Selma, Alabama, followed by a public memorial.
On Sunday, Lewis' body will pass over the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma.
It was in front of the bridge that he and demonstrators demanding black voting rights were beaten by Alabama State Police in 1965 and tear gas was used on the demonstrators.
Lewis was nearly killed.
The day came to be known as "Bloody Sunday.
Lewis' body will be transported to Montgomery, the capital of Alabama.
Mayor Steven Reed encouraged people to line the sidewalks and walk with Lewis on this final journey.
Meanwhile, officials asked the public to wear masks and maintain a social distance when participating in the event.
Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey ordered flags to be lowered to half-staff on Saturday and Sunday in Lewis' honor.
During the nearly week-long commemoration, Lewis' body will be placed at the Alabama State Capitol in Montgomery, the Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta, and the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., for public memorials.
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) announced last week that people can pay their respects to Lewis at the U.S. Capitol this Monday and Tuesday.
Because of the coronavirus outbreak, public events to honor Lewis will be held outdoors.

Tibetan antelopes in Cocosili enter return season - Xinhua

Monitoring images near the Wudaoliang Protection Station show that on July 25, about 40 female Tibetan antelopes led three Tibetan antelope cubs through the Qinghai-Tibet Highway 3002 kilometers and the Qinghai-Tibet Railway Wudaoliang North Bridge one after another, the Tibetan antelopes have begun to return.
According to expert analysis, in recent years, the number of Tibetan antelope cubs in the returning herd accounts for one-fourth to one-fifth of the overall number of Tibetan antelope herd.
Lian Xinming, an associate researcher at the Northwest Plateau Institute of Biology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said, "At the beginning of the return migration, Tibetan antelope face a higher risk of predation, so the number of young in the herd will be relatively small, and there may even be no young."
According to the statistics of the Yangtze River Source Park of the Three Rivers National Park Administration, the overall number of Tibetan antelopes returning to the park is rising year by year, with 4,860 Tibetan antelopes returning in 2019, 338 more than in 2018.
Lian Xinming said, "The return migration of Tibetan antelope this year is expected to end in early September, and the number of returning Tibetan antelopes is still expected to continue to increase."
The Tibetan antelope is a national-level protected animal.
At the end of May every year, Tibetan antelopes from the Three Rivers Source in Qinghai, Qiangtang in Tibet, and Arjinshan in Xinjiang are going to lamb at the Zhuo Nai Lake located in the hinterland of Cocosiri.
Wu Xiaomin, an expert in Tibetan antelope conservation in China and a researcher at the Shaanxi Zoological Research Institute (Northwest Institute of Endangered Animals), said, "The return migration of Tibetan antelopes is a process in which female Tibetan antelopes return to their habitat one after another with their young after they have finished giving birth. Initially, the herds that leave their litters are relatively large, but then the Tibetan antelope will return to their respective habitats along different paths, depending on the geographic population."
In order to ensure the safe return of the Tibetan antelope herd, the reporter learned that recently, the Yangtze River Source Park of the Three Rivers National Park Administration has arranged staff in the main return migration area, continuous video monitoring and precinct patrols.
If a Tibetan antelope herd is found trying to cross the highway, patrol members will be the first time to carry out temporary traffic control, so that the flock safely through the wildlife channel to ensure that it is on the way back to the migration as little as possible by human interference.

Graduate art exhibition moved into shopping mall for public interest - Xinhua
In the season of "cloud graduation" at major universities, a rare offline art exhibition of graduates opened last weekend.
But it was neither in an art museum nor on campus, but in the public space of Chaoyang Joy City, and was open to the public for free until August 23.
The exhibition space extends from the 2nd floor to the 6th floor, and makes full use of the light boxes in the building to display flat works, so as to maximize the artistic atmosphere of the graduation season.
Under the epidemic, the significance of this exhibition is particularly special.
Ge Ping, the person in charge of the aesthetics of Chaoyang Joy City, said frankly: "We chose to bring the graduation exhibition towards the 'cloud' back to the offline space again, also hoping to let more people see the youth's exploration of themselves and their understanding of the world, and amplify the healing power of art for society and the soul. "
She revealed that the works exhibited in this exhibition were collected from graduates of several art colleges and universities, from which those suitable for commercial space were selected. The works range from traditional easel painting and sculpture to new media installation, interactive animation and VR panorama, with the largest volume and richness ever.
Among them, Li Yunxiao's "The First Battle of 2020" expresses his feelings in the epidemic through a mixture of mechanical and manual creation language; Liu Jiaying's "Sound Money" explores "cryptocurrency", "credit creation", "transaction" and other issues through the ethereum blockchain. Zhang Jiaqi's "Cat Forest" and Qiu Daqiang's "Custody" both show animals that are often accompanied by humans, from which we can see the young artists' understanding of the relationship between humans and animals. Zhu Zhongyou's work "Winter of Faith - Gift" is a reminder to the growing young people, "When one day your career is successful, don't forget the original heart and remember the simplicity and sincerity."
Among the few graduates who set up the exhibition in person was Li Jingyin from the sculpture department of Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts.
"I came to Beijing on July 7, when I was actually a little worried about the epidemic, and also had a nucleic acid test three days in advance, and came to set up the exhibition with alcohol sponges and test reports."
His work "Yesterday is like a mystery" has a complex structure and he had to do it himself.
At the same time, he also took on the task of helping his classmates repair their broken works.
"Setting up the exhibition until 4:30 a.m. and then doing the repair, the time was so tight that I forgot to take a picture with the work, which was also a bit regrettable."
He hopes that when the epidemic is more stable, he and his classmates will come back to Beijing to see the exhibition of his works.

Australian university develops new drug expected to be used to treat blood vessel blockage caused by new crown - Xinhua
SYDNEY, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Researchers at Monash University in Australia are developing a new drug to help prevent heart disease and stroke, and hope the drug can be used to treat blood vessel blockages triggered by the new coronavirus.
The researchers found that an enzyme in platelets accelerates platelet clotting before a heart attack or stroke.
This led them to develop a drug that would temporarily inhibit platelet clotting, thereby preventing blood vessel blockages and acting as a preventive measure against heart disease and stroke.
The researchers said the drug would only inhibit the clotting effect of platelets when there are signs of heart disease or stroke.
Since studies have shown that similar blood vessel blockages are one of the main causes of death in patients with neo-coronary severe disease, the researchers hope the drug could be used in the future for the treatment of patients with such severe disease.
The drug has already shown good results in animal model experiments, and the researchers are preparing for the next phase of human clinical trials.
The results of the study have recently been published in the American journal Science - Translational Medicine.
He became the first spectator to enter the CBA League after the resumption of the tournament allowed spectators to watch the game on site.

Xinjiang Hami, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Xinjiang deep plowing "sunflower fields" with clean energy
More than 6,000 pentagonal fixed sun mirrors, each 48 square meters, a circle of neatly arranged, such as a silver "sunflower field", with the rotation of the sun, the sunlight will be reflected to the center of more than 200 meters high heat-absorbing tower, to achieve power generation.
This reporter saw this scene on the 25th in the town of Nao Mao Lake, Iwu County, Hami City, Xinjiang, in the CLP Engineering Hami molten salt tower-type solar thermal power plant.
"The so-called molten salt tower-type solar thermal power generation, is the sunlight through the mirrors concentrated reflection to the heat-absorbing tower to form thermal energy, and then through the traditional power generation technology to convert thermal energy into electricity."
Zhang Yong, deputy general manager of CLP Hami Solar Thermal Power Co., Ltd. said that the design principle is similar to the solar cookers used in rural areas in northwest China, both of which gather sunlight.
The power farm, which began construction in October 2017 and was connected to the grid at the end of last year, covers an area of 6,600 acres and is scheduled to install a total of 14,500 fixed-sun mirrors.
"Compared with traditional solar power technology, its biggest advantage is that it can store the gathered thermal energy and generate electricity at night."
Zhang Yong said the project is configured with a 13-hour thermal storage system, which allows the generator set to maintain continuous and stable operation, unaffected by changes in light; it can also quickly participate in grid peaking according to the peak and valley demand of the grid load.
After the project is fully completed, it can achieve an annual power generation capacity of 198 million degrees, save more than 60,000 tons of standard coal, reduce more than 60 tons of sulfur dioxide, more than 60 tons of nitrogen oxides, about 20 tons of soot and more than 150,000 tons of carbon dioxide, and provide a continuous source of clean energy for the local area.
In addition, there is another silver "sunflower field" in Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park in Hami City.
Hami Foguang solar photovoltaic power plant covers an area of more than 2,300 acres, and the 714 power generating devices that have been built also follow the sun's rotation, always keeping the sunlight at a 90-degree right angle to the concentrating plate surface.
"We use dual-axis tracking concentrating power generation technology, through unified integrated control, all power generation equipment will adjust the angle according to the height of the sun to maintain power generation efficiency."
Duan Mengqi, station manager of the power station, said that under good weather conditions of light, the power generation technology can increase the efficiency of about 20% compared with traditional photovoltaic power generation.
In the first half of this year, the power station has achieved more than 7 million degrees of power generation, supplementing the local demand for electricity.
Shichengzi photovoltaic industrial park is currently the largest single, the most complete type of photovoltaic modules in Xinjiang a photovoltaic industry demonstration park, a total of 38 photovoltaic power generation projects, with a total installed capacity of 820,000 kilowatts.
The first half of this year completed power generation of more than 110 million degrees, an increase of 6% over the same period in 2019.
Hami is one of the regions with the best solar resource conditions in China.
The annual average total solar radiation is more than 6,200 megajoules per square meter, and the annual sunshine hours are about 3,200 hours.
In recent years, the city vigorously develop photovoltaic industry, planting "sunflower fields".
Has built more than 2.5 million kilowatts of installed solar power generation scale, the city's photovoltaic power generation in the first half of this year more than 1.4 billion degrees, an increase of about 14%.
At present, Xinjiang more than 330 grid-connected photovoltaic power plants, installed capacity of more than 10 million kilowatts.
Photovoltaic power generation is expected to reach 15 billion degrees this year, which can replace more than 6 million tons of standard coal.

U.S. media unveiled the truth about the U.S. side's unwarranted request for China to close its consulate general in Houston - CNN

The U.S. media uncovered the truth about the U.S. side's unwarranted request for China to close its Consulate General in Houston
On the 24th, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the U.S. Embassy in Beijing that China has decided to revoke the permit for the establishment and operation of the U.S. Consulate General in Chengdu and made specific requests for the Consulate General to cease all operations and activities as a countermeasure to the U.S. side's sudden request on the 21st to close the Chinese Consulate General in Houston.
This action of the U.S. government has aroused much concern and its political motives have been questioned by foreign media and scholars.
Why ask the Chinese side to close the Consulate General?
According to several foreign media, it is not clear why the U.S. selected the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, but the purpose of this move, the foreign media said bluntly: for the election.
CNN reported on the 23rd that the U.S. side's move to ask the Chinese side to close the Consulate General in Houston has raised questions about its political motives.
According to the article, the U.S. government's disastrous response to the new crown epidemic has caused President Donald Trump to have a relatively low approval rating in the polls ahead of the election.
White House officials have privately claimed that the tough strategy against China was an attempt to salvage Trump's approval ratings and also to deflect blame for the failure of the White House's response to the epidemic.
The article argues that the Chinese Consulate General in Houston was a "politically driven and very cautious" target chosen by the U.S. government "to create a tough attitude while avoiding the risk of a major conflict.
The BBC also believes that Trump sees "a political advantage in playing the 'China card'" as the U.S. election season approaches and the U.S. economy is hit hard by the epidemic.
The current situation is "a spiraling, tit-for-tat struggle" driven in part by the U.S. government from a domestic perspective that will only worsen tensions between the U.S. and China.
CBS reported that Trump's re-election prospects are under pressure because of the outbreak, and he has repeatedly blamed China for the epidemic.
Almost every day in the U.S. there is a new action against Trump's ridiculous argument that "China is exploiting the U.S."
"The Consulate General in Houston is important in building ties between the two countries."
The Associated Press commented that the U.S. demand that China close its consulate general in Houston has increased tensions between the world's two largest economies.
In addition to the diplomatic implications of closing the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, Chinese citizens located in the southern United States face difficulties in accessing consular services, as do U.S. citizens seeking visas and other services.
A Houston business group expressed regret over the U.S. request that China close its consulate general in Houston, saying the consulate played an important role in building trade, investment and cultural ties between the two countries.
According to the Associated Press, this reflects the importance of the Chinese economy.
The U.S. Foreign Policy magazine website believes the move "is part of a series of provocative moves that will only worsen U.S.-China relations.
Jonathan Pollack, an expert on East Asia at the Brookings Institution, a U.S. think tank, was quoted by Reuters as saying that he could not think of any move comparable to this U.S. action against the Chinese Consulate General in Houston since the two countries established full diplomatic relations in 1979.
Hong Kong's South China Morning Post reported that the U.S. move was unprecedented in the more than 40 years of diplomatic relations between China and the United States.
Analysts believe the move could cause lasting damage.
The Chinese Consulate General in Houston, built in 1979, was the first Chinese consulate general to open in the United States.
Currently, China has one embassy and five consulates general in the United States.

July 26 (Xinhua) -- According to the website of the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom, a spokesman of the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom answered reporters' questions on the wrong remarks about cyber attacks on July 25.
The spokesman stressed that the Chinese government is a firm defender of cyber security and has always resolutely opposed and combated any form of cyber attacks and cyber crimes.
A reporter asked a question: According to the media, China-related hacking groups have interfered with the network systems of a British company, launched attacks on British and American technology companies with proprietary data, and hacked into the networks of European Union governments.
The spokesman said that the Chinese government is a firm defender of cyber security and has always firmly opposed and combated any form of cyber attacks and cyber crimes.
The cyberspace is highly virtual, difficult to trace and has a variety of actors, so sufficient evidence should be produced when investigating and characterizing cyber incidents, and there should be no unfounded speculation.
The spokesman said that the past series of incidents, such as Prism Gate, proved that the United States has been conducting the world's largest cyber-secrecy operation.
Maintaining peace and stability in cyberspace is in the common interest of all countries.
The speaker noted that China's achievements in science and technology innovation are not stolen or robbed, but have been achieved through self-reliance and hard work.
China submitted about 59,000 patent applications through the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) route in 2019, with an annual growth rate of 10.6 percent, making it the country with the largest number of international patent applications submitted.
China has become a major innovation and IPR country.

Free nucleic acid testing in Urumqi has been basically completed in most districts, secondary testing in high-risk areas - CNN
Urumqi, July 26 (Xinhua Sun Tingwen Zhao Yamin) - Urumqi Health Commission Director Zhang Wei said on July 26, while briefing the latest epidemic situation and nucleic acid testing in Urumqi, that at present, free nucleic acid testing in most districts of Urumqi city has been basically completed.
A group of experts from the State Council and experts from the autonomous region and Urumqi are making further assessments of the development of the epidemic based on nucleic acid testing and epidemiological findings.
The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Information Office held a press conference on the 26th to inform about the epidemic situation and prevention and control in Xinjiang.
According to him, from 0:00 to 24:00 on July 25, there were 22 new confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia in Urumqi (including 5 cases of asymptomatic infected to confirmed cases) and 38 new asymptomatic infected cases.
As of 24:00 on July 25, there were 135 confirmed cases and 147 asymptomatic cases in Urumqi.
The new asymptomatic infections on the 25th were also basically detected through free nucleic acid testing and active screening in the city.
Zhang Wei, director of the Urumqi Health Care Commission, said on the 26th that free nucleic acid testing in Urumqi has been largely completed in most districts.
He also said that from the experience of other regions in China, there are many factors that affect the results of nucleic acid testing, such as the sensitivity of the testing reagents, the time of infection and detoxification of the person being tested, the cooperation of the person being tested when the specimen is taken (poor cooperation may result in the specimen not being taken in place), as well as the testing environment and the operational proficiency of the testing personnel.
For various reasons, nucleic acid testing can also result in false negative results.
A false negative means that the person tested is indeed infected, but the nucleic acid test results are negative.
In addition, for people who have had close contact with confirmed or suspected cases, it usually takes two nucleic acid tests to rule them out.
For people who have been to high-risk areas in the outbreak, if they have fever and respiratory symptoms, a single negative nucleic acid test has the potential to be a false negative, so two nucleic acid tests are also needed to rule it out.
He said, in view of the above, for the sake of the health of the city's ethnic groups, starting today, Urumqi will carry out the second free nucleic acid testing in key areas such as Tianshan District and Shaibak District, and also carry out the "check and fill in the gaps".
It is reported that Tianshan District and Shaybak District are high-risk areas for the outbreak.

White House epidemic expert Fauci: cautiously optimistic about developing a vaccine by early 2021
Fauci made the remarks at a web-based video conference hosted by the International Leadership Foundation on 25.
He cautioned that it is unclear how the new crown epidemic will develop in the fall and winter, or what the ultimate impact of the epidemic will be, "and the only way to end this is for each of us to choose to be part of the solution."
According to Johns Hopkins University data, as of 21:00 on the 25th, the number of confirmed cases of the new crown in the United States has reached 4,176,000 and 146,000 deaths.
Fauci said some areas of the United States are currently struggling with the rebounding epidemic.

U.S. and China trade talks representatives rumored to meet in August
Hong Kong's South China Morning Post reported on 25 August, citing an anonymous source familiar with the matter, that the head of China's trade negotiation team, Vice Premier Liu He, and the co-leader of the U.S. team, Trade Representative Lai Hoi-chul, are expected to hold formal talks in August to assess the two sides' implementation of the first phase of the U.S.-China trade agreement.
The report said that although China has significantly increased its purchases of U.S. agricultural products in the past few months, the Chinese purchases are still some distance away from the quantities promised in the trade agreement because of the new coronavirus outbreak and other factors.
Analysts say recent U.S.-China closures of each other's consulates, along with other disputes, could derail any progress on trade between the two sides.
The first phase of the U.S.-China trade deal, which took effect a month after it was signed on Jan. 15, stipulates that a trade framework group of top officials from both sides should meet every six months.
The source said the meeting would be "an important turning point" that would allow the two sides to assess progress on the agreement.
But the source also said that if U.S.-China tensions lead to a lack of willingness to talk at this time, the two sides may agree that the May 8 conference call between Lai Haider and Liu He has met the semi-annual meeting clause of the trade agreement.
Since this year, Sino-US relations have deteriorated rapidly, with disputes between the two sides including a series of issues such as the origin of the new crown virus, trade, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, the South China Sea and ideology.
Although U.S. President Donald Trump bragged about his achievements in the first phase of the agreement at the beginning of the year, his attitude has changed recently.
He said at a White House press conference on the 23rd that although China has recently made record-breaking single-day purchases of U.S. corn and bought a lot of soybeans, "this trade deal is not as meaningful to me now as it was when it was reached."
An anonymous Beijing government adviser also believes that a new round of trade talks is unlikely due to poor U.S.-China relations, and that "trade issues have lost weight in U.S.-China relations.
But he revealed that Chinese economic and trade related units still met on the 23rd to discuss a range of issues, including how to increase imports from the U.S. "We've done our best to buy, so any additional purchases would be difficult."
U.S.-China National Trade Council Vice President Peng Jie-ning said it was "more important than ever" to maintain the momentum of the first phase of the agreement, and said China has made progress this year in further opening its financial markets to U.S. companies.
Analysts at Plenum, an independent research firm, said "talk is better than no talk, even though it may only be treated as routine."

In the short, medium and long term, Hao Yusheng continues to be optimistic about Chinese companies coming to the U.S. for IPOs.

At present, the global epidemic and the world economic situation is still severe and complex, and the challenges facing China's development are unprecedented.
Maintain strategic determination, enhance the confidence of victory, and focus on their own business, is the key to our response to various risks and challenges.
In a recent symposium on entrepreneurs, General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed that in the current external environment of rising protectionism, the world economic downturn, the shrinking global market, we must focus on our own business, give full play to the advantages of the domestic mega market, and gradually form a new development pattern with the main domestic cycle, the domestic and international double cycle to promote each other, and enhance the modernization of the industrial chain supply chain. Vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation, accelerate the key core technology research and development, and create new advantages for future development.
The one who observes the trend is wise, and the one who manages the trend wins.
In the external environment of deepening economic globalization, the market and resources play an important role in the rapid development of China.
Now, the world is undergoing profound changes under the impact of the epidemic, facing more instability and uncertainty, economic globalization has encountered headwinds and backward waves.
Do a good job for a longer period of time to cope with changes in the external environment and work to prepare to promote China's economy to ride the waves, stable and far, an extremely important aspect is to expand and meet domestic demand as a strategic base for development, give full play to its advantages, through the prosperity of the domestic economy, the smooth flow of domestic circulation for China's economic development to add momentum to drive the recovery of the world economy.
We should be deeply aware that the construction of a complete domestic demand system, the long-term development of China and long-term stability.
The Party Central Committee has reviewed the situation and clearly proposed to firmly implement the strategy of expanding domestic demand, which is necessary to cope with the impact of the epidemic, is necessary to maintain the long-term sustainable and healthy development of our economy, but also to meet the needs of the people's growing good life.
The advantage of a large country's economy is that it is internally recyclable.
China has the world's most complete and largest industrial system, strong production capacity, perfect supporting capacity, with more than 100 million market players and more than 170 million talents with higher education or various professional skills, as well as 1.4 billion people, including more than 400 million middle-income groups, formed by the super large-scale domestic demand market, is in the new industrialization, information technology, urbanization, rapid development of agricultural modernization Stage, the investment demand potential is huge.
The basic socialist economic system, such as public ownership as the mainstay, the common development of a variety of economic systems of ownership, the distribution of labor as the mainstay, the coexistence of a variety of distribution methods, and the socialist market economy system, can not only stimulate the vitality of various market players, liberation and development of social productive forces, but also promote the organic unity of efficiency and equity, and continue to achieve common wealth.
We should firmly grasp the strategic base point of expanding domestic demand, so that production, distribution and circulation in all aspects rely more on the domestic market to achieve a virtuous cycle, a clear strategic direction of supply-side structural reform, and promote the total supply and total demand at a higher level to achieve a dynamic balance.
We should accelerate the construction of a complete domestic demand system, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation and other aspects of innovation, accelerate the promotion of the digital economy, intelligent manufacturing, life and health, new materials and other strategic emerging industries, the formation of more new growth points and growth poles, and gradually form a new development pattern with the domestic cycle as the mainstay and the domestic and international double cycle promoting each other.
Openness brings progress, closed is bound to lag behind.
General Secretary Xi Jinping has repeatedly stressed that China's open door will not be closed, will only be opened wider and wider.
With the domestic cycle as the main body, it is never closed to close the door to run, but by giving full play to the potential of domestic demand, so that the domestic market and the international market better connected, better use of the international and domestic markets, two kinds of resources, to achieve a more robust and sustainable development.
At the same time, expanding domestic demand and expanding openness is not contradictory, the smoother the domestic cycle, the more conducive to building a new pattern of openness, the more conducive to the formation of new advantages in international cooperation and competition.
Although protectionist thinking is now on the rise internationally, we must stand on the right side of history, adhere to deepening reform, expanding openness, strengthening open cooperation in the field of science and technology, promoting the construction of an open world economy, and promoting the building of a community of human destiny.
The Chinese nation has experienced many trials and tribulations throughout its history, but it has never been crushed, but has become more and more courageous, and has continued to grow and rise from its trials and tribulations.
On the road ahead, with the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, the significant advantages of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, strong mobilization capacity and strong comprehensive strength, and the unity of the whole Party, the whole army and the people of all nationalities, we will be able to overcome all difficulties and obstacles, maintain the momentum of our economic and social development, build a moderately prosperous society, and successfully start a new journey of building a socialist modernized country a new journey!
The balance of the earnings down "after 90" but "revenge" to save money?
With the balance of the treasure earnings down, "after 90" not only did not flee the balance of treasure, but began to "revenge" to save money?
China New Economy Research Institute and Alipay recently released the "BalancePay Post-90s Money Saving Report" (2020 Edition), which shows that in the first half of the year, the "post-90s" love to save money: the per capita amount of money saved increased by nearly 40% compared to 2019.
Interestingly, the "post-90s" tend to start saving with a "small amount of money", with 60% of them saving less than 20 yuan per pen on average....
Saving money with BalanceBao has also become a saving habit for the post-90s.
The data shows that 134 million of the 700 million users of BalanceBao are "post-90s".
There are 174 million "post-90s" in China, which means that about 3 out of every 4 "post-90s" in the country are using BalanceBao to save money.
At present, the 7-day annualized return of money funds such as BalanceBao has slipped from above 2% at the beginning of the year to about 1.5%.
Even so, it did not affect the pace of the "post-90s" saving money.
And in the context of the "saving effect" of BalanceBao, many young people who are used to using BalanceBao are also directly transformed into "fundies".
Alipay data shows that as of July 13, nearly a month on Alipay new "fundies" year-on-year growth of more than 1 times, more and more young people in Alipay to achieve "advanced" financial management.
Some analysts believe that the flow of funds from Alipay into the stock market is also an important reason for the clear decline in the share of money funds in June.
The report also shows that "post-90s" girls are more inclined to save more money, on average 20% higher than the amount of money saved by boys; 60% of the users who hold funds on the Alipay platform are men, and women tend to choose more stable financial management methods compared to men.
After saving money, what are the plans of the "post-90s"?
Alipay data shows that "post-90s" have the habit of saving money for their goals, and the most users have travel as their saving goal.

France increases military investment in space - Xinhua
French Defense Minister Florence Paley said on the 24th that France will add hundreds of millions of euros to its space defense budget to develop military forces in space to prevent possible "unfriendly moves" by other countries in outer space.
Paley told Le Provençal the same day that the budget for spending on French military space programs will increase to 4.3 billion euros ($5 billion) from 3.6 billion euros ($4.2 billion) previously proposed for the period 2019 to 2025.
According to the French Military Planning Act 2019 to 2025, approved by the French Parliament in 2018, France is expected to update existing observation and communication satellites, launch three electromagnetic listening satellites and improve the modernization of space surveillance radars in the future.
French President Emmanuel Macron announced last July that a military command for space and an "air and space force" would be established within the French Air Force.
Paley said she will formally announce the establishment of this space force when she visits a military school in Saron, Provence, later.
The space force, which is part of the Air Force, will have a strength of 500 by 2025, Paley said.
Gone are the days when people thought space served the common good of science," she said. Today space is a site where nations compete for global hegemony."
Paley reiterated Macron's earlier statement that France has no intention of provoking an arms race.
"We are in no way engaged in an arms race. But it is my responsibility to thoroughly recognize the threats we may face."
Paley revisited the 2017 surveillance of a military satellite shared by France and Italy.
She claimed that it was a Russian satellite that was "spied on."
The Russians deny the claim.
Paley said France would "soon" have small patrol satellites capable of detecting and targeting "those who are behind unfriendly moves.
French media believe that the reason why France seeks to establish a space force, because U.S. President Donald Trump asked the U.S. Department of Defense in February last year to draft a bill to set up a space force.
Trump signed the National Defense Authorization Act in December last year, approving the establishment of the United States' sixth major military service, the TAF.
Some experts worry that these U.S. initiatives have accelerated the pace of U.S. space militarization and may trigger a new round of space arms race.

Experts say collecting immigration data through the U.S. Census for House seat allocation is unconstitutional
Several civil rights groups and several U.S. cities and counties have filed a lawsuit against the U.S. federal government, saying the Trump presidency's attempt to exclude undocumented immigrants from the U.S. Census is unworkable and unconstitutional.
The U.S. Census will determine the allocation of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Sarah Brannon, executive attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, told Voice of America, "It's not going to work to do that."
She went on to say that Trump's demand to determine the citizenship status of people who take the census in the census is difficult to do and "not very reliable."
Another civil liberties group, Common Cause, filed a lawsuit Thursday challenging Trump's executive order.
Several cities in New Jersey and Georgia joined the lawsuit.
Arlington County, Virginia, also joined the lawsuit Friday.
Garvey, chairman of Arlington County's governing board, said, "The U.S. Constitution requires an accurate count of our population every 10 years. We must accurately count every person living in Arlington County and not allow this illegal attempt to scare people away and compress the numbers of our immigrant community to succeed."
Other organizations and individuals praised President Trump's executive order.
Alabama Attorney General Marshall called the executive order a "victory" for the state.
He said, "The allocation of congressional House seats and Electoral College seats for each state must be based on the number of residents who live in each state and who are legally resident."
The U.S. Supreme Court last year blocked the Trump administration from including citizenship questions in the 2020 census form.
President Trump signed an executive order earlier this week directing Commerce Secretary Ross, who oversees the U.S. Census Bureau, to submit data on the undocumented population from the census so the administration can exclude those undocumented people from each state's census numbers and use it to determine whether each state will add or subtract or keep House seats.
Every 10 years, the U.S. has to reallocate House seats based on population changes.

Pay more attention to optimize and stabilize the supply chain of the industrial chain.
Construction machinery is the main force of Hunan industry, but two-thirds of the supporting enterprises outside the province, supporting the chain still has space and potential.
Strengthen the industrial chain thinking to grasp the project, not only to have the head of the enterprise continued to accumulate, in the industry chain key links to achieve technological breakthroughs; also need to be cultivated around the subconscious, to strengthen the chain to complement the chain to extend the chain to stimulate the "chain" lock reaction, promote the relevant supporting industries to collaborate layout, accelerate the construction of independent and controllable, safe and reliable industrial chain supply chain.

U.S. White House adviser "bites back" states to resume work too early - CNN
The U.S. White House adviser "backbite" states to return to work too early
On July 23, local time, the number of confirmed cases of new pneumonia in the United States exceeded 4 million, accounting for 30% of global cases.
For months, President Donald Trump repeatedly asked the country's states to resume work and school, until recently only to change their attitude and take the initiative to wear masks in public, and his advisers are "backbiting" that some state governments resume work too early.
22, the White House presidential adviser Kellyanne Conway said in a press conference, some state governments did not comply with the return to work standards, prematurely restarted the bar and other places.
Conway also mentioned that the previous claim that the president has "absolute power" to decide on the resumption of work in each state is a misleading rumor.
"The president is a federalist, and he believes in state autonomy."
She defended Trump.
However, the "rumor" that Conway described was uttered by Trump himself during an April 13 White House briefing on the epidemic.
This self-contradictory action was mocked by netizens as "rewriting history".
Kellyanne Conway wants to rewrite history, and she's a liar.
Trump called Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer a dictator because she followed medical guidelines and insisted on a work stoppage.
Trump wants to push for a return to work so he can hold rallies.
This is not the first time Kellyanne Conway has caused controversy.
In an April 15 interview with Fox News, Conway blurted out, "It's COVID-19, not COVID-1, folks!"
She seems to have interpreted "19" as a version number, and was wildly teased by netizens: read the newspaper if you don't have common sense!
3-year-old child smashed in university playground, compensated and then sued the university is justified?

The playground was smashed, the child was compensated and then sued the school
□ Our correspondent Zhao Yifan
3-year-old Xiao Wen was playing in a university playground when he was accidentally hit in the head by Chen Mou of the softball team while throwing a ball.
After Chen compensated, Mr. Wen, the father of Xiaowen, as the legal representative of Xiaowen, took the school to court, demanding the school where the playground was located to pay for the damages and apologize, as well as pay medical expenses and moral damage compensation totaling 20,000 yuan.
Recently, the Beijing Haidian District People's Court heard the case and held that the school had set up a protective net in the playground at the time of the incident and had done its duty to ensure proper safety, and Chen had made compensation, according to which the judgment rejected the plaintiff's claim.
Mr. Wen claimed that he took Xiaowen to play in the school playground during the summer vacation in 2019, when the softball team was training in the playground.
In order to avoid the resulting risks, Xiaowen, Mr. Wen and many other children and parents were in the safe area designated by the softball team.
However, Chen, a member of the softball team, took off his hand while throwing the ball, causing it to fly over the safety net and hit Xiao Wen in the back of his head.
Mr. Wen immediately took Xiaowen to the hospital for treatment and was diagnosed with head trauma.
Mr. Wen believed that the school's field facilities did not meet the relevant safety regulations and failed to effectively manage the team and related facilities.
The school's negligence led to the above incident, resulting in great physical and mental suffering for Xiaowen, as well as greater pain for his family, for which the school should be held legally responsible.
In this regard, the school argued that the school has set up a protective net in the playground, and posted the management regulations, training notices, informed the playground to maintain a safe distance from the training ground and reminded to pay attention to their own safety, the plaintiff also can not prove that the school "did not do their duty to ensure safety", so do not agree to compensation.
The court heard that the site of the incident is the University of the public free site, the school although the management of the playground there is a duty of safety, but this duty of safety only need to meet the general duty of care can be.
The school set up a protective net in the playground at the time of the incident, has done its proper safety obligations, and Chen also in accordance with the previously reached compensation agreement to the small Wen compensation for medical expenses, transportation costs and other losses of more than two thousand dollars, the two sides agreed to a one-time settlement of the dispute.
Afterwards, Xiaowen's parents again claimed that the school compensation, there is no basis in law, the court ruled to dismiss the plaintiff's entire claim.
After the verdict, both sides did not appeal, the verdict is now in effect.
According to Article 37 of China's Tort Liability Law, the school, as the manager of the public place, has the duty of safety and security; in the case of damage caused by the actions of a third party, the third party bears the tort liability, while the public place manager who failed to do his duty of safety and security should bear the corresponding supplementary liability.
The judge said, as the manager of the public place, the most likely to understand the actual situation of the whole place, foresee the possible danger and damage, and thus the most likely to take the necessary measures to prevent the occurrence of losses or mitigate the degree of damage, and the lowest cost to avoid and mitigate the occurrence of damage, so the law provides that the corresponding protection obligations by its social activities.
In this case, the school's safety obligations should be adapted to the social activities it engages in, specifically, the basic safety measures and the obligation to inform the public of hidden dangers, for the unspecified group of people entering the playground, which is open to the public free of charge.
In judicial practice, it is not advisable to impose excessive safety obligations on the managers of public places.
If the school has taken the steps to set up a protective net and has fulfilled its duty to inform, the school can be found not at fault and should not be held liable.
In addition, for third party torts, even if the manager of a public place such as a school fails to fulfill its safety obligations, its liability is supplemented by damages, and according to the latest Civil Code, the manager can recover from the third party after assuming supplementary liability.
Therefore, in such accidents, the victim should not expand the scope of the claim after receiving compensation from the direct infringer.

Israel strengthens prevention and control of recurring epidemics -ChinaNews.com

Israel strengthens prevention and control against recurring outbreaks
At the beginning of the outbreak of the new crown pneumonia, Israel's preventive and control measures were effective.
However, with the gradual lifting of the ban on preventive and control measures, the number of confirmed cases of Newcastle pneumonia in Israel has recently increased significantly, and the Israeli government has taken several emergency measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic.
On February 28, the first case of Newcastle pneumonia was confirmed in Israel, and the government quickly took measures to close all ports of entry and exit, suspend non-essential industries, convert schools to online classes, restrict public transportation and non-essential social activities, seal off cities with severe outbreaks, and combine military and police efforts to maintain prevention and control initiatives.
This series of measures quickly yielded positive results, and by mid-May, the number of confirmed new cases of pneumonia in Israel dropped to single digits on a single day.
As the epidemic was brought under control and Israeli preventive and control measures were fully unblocked, the number of confirmed new cases of NCCP gradually rebounded since June.
Especially after July, the spread of the epidemic has been accelerating.
Recently, there were 8 days with more than 1,500 new cases per day in Israel, and as of press time on July 25, the number of new cases reached 916 on that day.
As of July 25, there were 59,745 confirmed cases and 448 deaths in Israel.
In the face of the rapid rebound of the epidemic, the Israeli government has taken several emergency measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic.
On July 6, after the number of confirmed cases exceeded 30,000, the Israeli government closed gyms, swimming pools, bars, nightclubs and other public entertainment venues, while introducing a policy of limiting public transportation to a maximum of 20 passengers per bus.
On the 17th, the Israeli government announced a new series of restrictions, including the implementation of the "city closure" on weekends, which is implemented between 17:00 on Fridays and 5:00 on Sundays.
During this period, people can go out, but stores, shopping centers, barber stores, beauty salons, libraries, zoos, museums, exhibition halls, swimming pools and tourist attractions will be closed, while supermarkets, pharmacies and other basic services will remain open.
At the same time, gatherings of more than 10 people will be banned on all days and hours, gyms, studios and other places will be closed, and restaurants and cafes will be banned from dine-in and only take-out service will be allowed.
At the same time, the Israeli public did not pay enough attention to the severity of the epidemic and failed to join forces with the government in the fight against it.
After the recurrence of the epidemic in Israel, many people took to the streets to protest against the government's preventive and control measures that affected their economic interests.
On July 11, tens of thousands of people demonstrated in Tel Aviv, arguing that anti-epidemic policies were affecting the economy.
On the evening of the 21st, thousands of protesters gathered in front of Prime Minister Netanyahu's residence in Jerusalem to protest against the ban on restaurants and cafes without compensation.
In addition, many people did not comply with the rules of wearing masks and maintaining a safe social distance of two meters when outdoors. To avoid being fined by police for not wearing masks, many people simply wore them on their chins or hung them on their wrists.
According to a recent visit to the kindergarten, teachers and students did not wear masks as required by the government and did not keep a safe social distance of two meters from each other, which laid the groundwork for a large number of teachers and students to be infected with the virus.
Professor Elie Waxman, a member of the Israeli National Security Council's expert advisory group to combat the epidemic, believes that Israel is heading toward a "dangerous situation," pointing out that the current measures taken by Israel to prevent and control the epidemic are not enough, and that all leisure and recreational activities and summer schools should be closed to control the further spread of the epidemic.
Waxman said that Israel lacks a general plan to fight the epidemic and that the Knesset and all government departments should quickly put aside their own interests and agree on the fight against the epidemic and formulate clear steps that include relevant restrictions in different sectors.
Tel Aviv, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Our correspondent in Tel Aviv, Wang Jiong
Ningxia Guyuan farmer Wu Fengfang could not resist his partner Dai Tianfu, and the two of them took a car and rushed to the Liang Yun Cultural Compound from their home 20 miles away.
Despite two years of leg problems, the 77-year-old Dai Tianfu still counted on "every other day to come here, to enjoy the theater".
This is an inconspicuous courtyard in the Yuanzhou District of Guyuan City, and the general farmhouse is different, the courtyard is often heard from the melodious Qin cadence, there are wonderful shadow play, embroidery works, traditional Qin cadence, Meihu drama, etc..
The owner of the compound is called Liang Yun, who used to be a carpenter.
More than 10 years ago, he began to plan the construction of the cultural compound for his love of shadow puppets and opera.
With the Liang Yun cultural compound, the villagers' cultural life has become rich and colorful.
The reporter has not yet entered the Liang Yun cultural compound, the Qin cadence tunes have come out.
The villager who is singing the Qin cadence excerpts for the villagers is the neighboring villager Bo Lixiang.
The company's main goal is to provide the best possible service to its customers.
Recently, Bai Lixiang also played a live webcast.
The company's main business is to provide a platform for more people to see themselves perform, which is a very happy thing.
On the stage, the singer has a board, the player has a tune, despite being an amateur, but the enthusiasm has not lost any.
Just like the simple style of the farmhouse, outside of the Qin cadence, the "grassroots" art and non-foreign heritage culture in the Liang Yun Cultural Compound came to the fore.
The compound also has a collection of more than 300 pieces of farming tools, traditional and handmade tile sculptures, paper cuts, embroidery, shadow and other objects from different eras.
Liang Yun led the reporter into the display hall in the courtyard, which shows his collection of old objects, old wine pots, sanshinzi, spinning wheel, etc.
Why did an ordinary farmer build a cultural compound?
"Shadow play is my family craft, I have been learning this craft since I was 15 years old."
Liang Yun cultural compound was established in 2012, and became the first rural "intangible cultural heritage exhibition hall" in Ningxia, and is also a demonstration compound for the protection of intangible cultural heritage in Guyuan City.
In addition to the Liang Yun cultural compound, Guyuan City, Yuanzhou District also emerged more than 120 cultural compounds, 79 folk performance groups, of which, there are more than 50 cultural compounds of a certain scale, such as Shen Jiahe cultural compound, Wang Yonghong cultural compound, Yang Lang cultural compound, covering all towns and streets in Yuanzhou District, the participants amounted to more than 5,000 people.
These grassroots artists are active in the fields, enriching the cultural life of the masses and meeting their spiritual needs.
"As life gets better and better, traditional culture can't just be left behind."
"Liu's spy drama" is back again "winning" to see Liu Yunlong Li Liqun rival "soaring" - Xinhua
40 episodes of spy war drama "The Odds" will land on Beijing TV from July 16.
The "Winning Odds" is based on real historical facts, taken from the Soviet military archives that have been sealed for years and are available for the first time.
The actor Liu Yunlong, who is well known to the audience for his "spy dramas", broke through the image in the drama and challenged a comical "stuttering agent".
In recent years, the popularity of such dramas as "The Pretender", "Mask" and "Kite" has proved that the spy genre has a strong vitality.
Unlike previous espionage works, "The Winning Count" looks at the world and extends the story to the Soviet Far East.
It is set in the final stage of the war against Japan in 1944, and tells the story of Tang Fei (Liu Yunlong), a secret intelligence agent of the Chinese Communist Party, who, under the leadership of the secretary of the Linhe Provincial Committee of the Chinese underground and the director of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Bureau, carries out the "Mudan-Ula" strategy of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Bureau.
In many spy dramas, the male protagonist, as a senior spy, appears as a handsome, highly intelligent, mature and perfect image.
But in Liu Yunlong's opinion, such people are not suitable for spies, "spies should be the kind of people put in a pile of people simply can not find the person, if the first appearance is the kind of very handsome image of the very pretend, hating everyone to pay attention to you, can still infiltrate? There is a line in "Kite", 'If you do not come to arrest me, I have forgotten that I am a Nationalist', spies have to go to the elite."
Therefore, in "The Odds", Liu Yunlong has taken the initiative to design his protagonist Tang Fei as a "stuttering agent" with a sense of comedy.
The other side of the camp in "The Odds" is held together by Liang Guanhua's Japanese Fukuhara and Li Liqun's police chief Fang Shibao.
The two strongest actors from the north and the south have added many points to the drama.
Director Yin Fei used the word "soaring" to describe the rivalry between Li Liqun and Liu Yunlong in the drama, "absolutely soaring, they are two special tacit understanding, this tacit understanding on them is very impactful to me. Many times their play is 'now hanging', for example, we only wrote the length of half a page, when shooting I do not shout to stop, they can always play."
When the actors are in the role and ensure their own character state, not only can they shape the role from the character's point of view, but also bring more viewing possibilities to the audience, Yin Fei said that this kind of play is brilliant enough.
In the drama, you can also see many familiar faces from the "Liu's spy dramas", "Kite" in the famous and powerful "Mountain City F4", in the "winning calculation" also gathered three.
Hou Yu and Liu Mingyang, who played Song Xiaoan and Zhao Jianzhi, reprise their roles as Tang Fei's right-hand men.
Director Yin Fei said, "These two people do not have bad roots, they just go with the flow in that era and that environment."
Liu Yunlong also volunteered, "We want to have a human touch. This humane taste means that the people around me must have good and bad, bad people are the enemy, but also to develop them, and our team must grow."
The play of these two people towards the end is also Liu Yunlong carefully designed, he believes will give the audience a satisfactory answer.

HONG KONG, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury of the Hong Kong SAR Government, Mr. Hui Ching-yu, said that Hong Kong's financial markets remain active and operate in an orderly manner.
He expressed optimism about Hong Kong's financial stability and economy.
Speaking at a webinar co-organized by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Toronto and the Hong Kong-Canada Business Council (Canadian Chamber of Commerce) on July 24 (Toronto time), Mr. Hui said Hong Kong is going through a difficult situation because of the "amendment controversy" and the new pneumonia epidemic.
The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is stable and tilted towards the strong-side guaranteed exchange rate level.
The banking system shows no clear signs of outflows, but on the contrary, more than $11 billion has flowed in since June.
Total bank deposits have also continued to increase over the past few months, and the stock market has seen a spate of public offering capital raisings and repeated increases in market transactions.
Xu Zhengyu said the new pneumonia outbreak has brought pressure to the global economy and financial markets, but Hong Kong's fundamental strengths remain intact.

Lancet article praises China's efforts to fight epidemic, encourages countries to learn from experience - CNN
China, a country with a population of 1.4 billion and a scale similar to that of Europe or the United States, has largely contained the domestic epidemic at this stage by effectively controlling the new crown epidemic without any further widespread spread, said an article in The Lancet 25.
The article says that China has invested heavily in domestic research and public health construction over the last decade or so, which has made it much more prepared for the new crown than it was for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that year.
When the SARS outbreak occurred in 2002, the authors say, China was initially ill-prepared, especially because the pathogen could not be identified.
When the new coronavirus was discovered in December 2019, Chinese scientists were quickly able to identify the virus species and shared the genome sequencing data internationally on Jan. 11, 2020.
By the end of January, doctors from mainland China and Hong Kong elucidated the clinical features of the virus, warning the world of the threat of the new coronavirus through a research paper published in The Lancet.
China has also been at the forefront of vaccine research, and such research has been conducted very quickly and rigorously through close collaboration within the country in the face of a declared national emergency, with results of progress in early trials of a new coronavirus vaccine developed in China published in The Lancet in May and July, respectively.
The Chinese experience demonstrates the importance of investing in the national health and research system to effectively improve laboratory capacity.
This is the basis for a rapid and effective national response to health emergencies and global health security.
It is well worthwhile for other countries, especially low- and middle-income countries, to learn from and emulate this.
In addition, China's experience proves that a strong research base must be followed by strong top-level decisiveness to make the right decisions based on scientific evidence, which has led to effective control of the new crown outbreak.
The article emphasizes that the government and its leaders must respect science, understand its value, and act on it in the way that is best for society.
In the early stages of the outbreak, China's National Health Construction Commission sent three teams of infectious disease experts to Wuhan to investigate the risk and spread of the New Guinea virus, and their recommendations informed the decision to "seal off" the city on January 23; when experts raised the need and urgency of building the Fangzhai Hospital, the government made a quick decision and implemented it quickly; and At the same time, widespread community and public participation enabled the outbreak to be contained quickly and effectively.
The article concludes by emphasizing that countries need to strengthen global cooperation and joint response to global health emergencies.

'Chinese Doctor' prepares for filming to pay tribute to epidemic heroes - Xinhua
Recently, with Chinese filmmakers' respect for the heroes fighting against epidemics, Bona Film Group Chairman Yu Dong and director Liu Weiqiang (pictured left) had a discussion and exchange with academician Zhong Nanshan in Guangzhou on the shooting and production of the film "Chinese Doctor" on the theme of fighting against epidemics.
Bona Film hopes to use "Chinese Doctor" to pay tribute to all medical and epidemic prevention workers who are fighting on the front line of epidemic prevention and control!
In 2021, the film will be released nationwide as a tribute film to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China.
Currently, under the arrangement and deployment of the Ministry of Propaganda and the National Film Bureau, and with the support of the Film Bureau of Guangdong Province and the Film Bureau of Hubei Province, Bona Film is organizing the original cast of the film "Chinese Captain" to prepare the film "Chinese Doctor", which is a film reflecting the unity of the people of China in the fight against the new pneumonia epidemic under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee.
The film focuses on the front line of Wuhan's fight against the epidemic, and will take Wuhan's medical staff and medical teams from various provinces and cities to aid E. China's medical team as the background of the characters, from the perspective of human nature, using a unique narrative, as well as a very impactful camera language, a panoramic view of the front line of the fight against the epidemic is full of dedication and sacrifice of Chinese medical staff's touching story.
It is understood that the first time when Wuhan was unsealed, Bona overcame many difficulties and sent a film crew to go deep into the front line of the epidemic, communicating with hundreds of medical workers face to face and collecting information, and has already interviewed some of the most important medical professionals on the epidemic front, including academician Zhong Nanshan himself, the first person who rushed to Wuhan from Guangzhou, the medical team from Guangdong who helped E, as well as Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan Union Hospital, Wuhan University Central and South Hospital, Wuhan Central Hospital, etc. A lot of valuable first-hand video information was captured by the angels in white at the forefront of the anti-epidemic front, including Zhong Nan Hospital of Wuhan University and Wuhan Central Hospital.

"Now some foreign friends still have some misconceptions about China."
When it comes to the dissemination of the film, Academician Zhong Nanshan said that some people abroad currently like to label the virus as politicized, and he hopes that the film will impress the audience from a human perspective: " It is better for this film to be shown abroad in addition to China, and to impress the audience with a true humanistic spirit in a way that both domestic and foreign audiences can understand. "
Academician Zhong Nanshan also fondly recalled the film "Man to Middle Age" in the 1980s, "After so many years, my deepest impression of the post-reform and opening-up film is still "Man to Middle Age", when my doctor friends abroad wept, and it would be remarkable if "Doctor China" could play such a role."
Academician Zhong Nanshan said that if "Chinese Doctor" can resonate with foreign audiences, it will be very successful.
During the discussion and exchange, Academician Zhong Nanshan also shared his opinions and suggestions on the current international epidemic prevention and control, " I believe that people are always smarter than viruses."
Academician Zhong Nanshan said, although the virus is unpredictable, but from primitive society to the present, humans have survived thousands of difficulties and dangers, and now modern society has developed medical technology and social management measures, plus medical personnel around the world, and even the people have a basic understanding of scientific response to the new crown pneumonia epidemic, people will no longer be as passive as before, "the next two aspects to pay attention to One is to study how the world can strengthen cooperation, and the other is to focus on soothing people's hearts.

In particular, the crime of obstructing the prevention and control of epidemics, fraud crimes are more frequent, the number of prosecutors prosecuting fraud crimes accounted for 43.4 percent of the total number of crimes obstructing the prevention and control of epidemics.
The Supreme People's Procuratorate has targeted guidance, and has released ten batches of typical cases involving epidemic prevention and control, involving a total of nine cases of fraud.
From the cases handled by the procuratorial authorities in the first half of the year, there were a wide range of fraudulent crimes, ranging from national macro policies to the people's food, clothing and housing, including epidemic-related fraud, "medical trust" fraud, "health care" fraud, " The "student recruitment intermediary" fraud, "lending" fraud, fraudulent state subsidies, national assets thawing fraud, etc., constantly "new", the scope of education, medical care, employment, pension, social security, land acquisition and relocation, the The scope involves education, medical care, employment, pension, social security, land acquisition and relocation, precise poverty alleviation, financial credit and other fields, which not only cause economic losses to victims, but also seriously affect economic and social development.
In particular, some telecommunication network frauds break through national boundaries, geographical and personnel restrictions, with features such as crowd, cross-border, remote, electronic payment, etc., with many unspecified victim groups and great harm.
For example, some set up special companies, renting high-end office buildings, setting up multiple departments or positions, using legitimate network platforms to promote and recruit, training and assessment of recruiters, the use of enterprise operation mode management, cloaked in the "veneer of legality", more confusing.
Punish and prevent crime in accordance with the law, timely warning to the public and relevant departments, the procuratorial organs are obliged to responsibility.

Hot summer heat, Economic Daily - China Economic Network reporter into the Wining County, Guizhou Province, Wining Town, Zhonghai Village.
Under the scorching sun, villager Li Yuanzhong hoeing grass in the base, although his face is red with sunshine, but his mouth hums a few little songs from time to time.
Wining town is located in Weining County, because of the low latitude, high altitude, sufficient light, day and night temperature difference, the apples produced high sugar content, good taste, in the surrounding areas with a certain degree of popularity, but also because of the small size, spots, has not been able to sell a good price, failed to form an industrial scale.
Winding that town was once a "bag of taro degree of spring and autumn" of the poor township, 10 years ago the local poverty incidence rate was as high as 25.8%.
In the fight against poverty into a decisive and crucial period, change the traditional planting habits, adjust the industrial structure, increase the income of farmers is urgent.
Winding the town party secretary Chen Chao and the town of a group of people after many visits that industrial development can no longer take the old road.
To this end, the town of Winding introduced leading enterprises to plant apples in a modern way.

At first, the village mobilized Li Yuanzhong to transfer the land out to plant apple trees, and Li Yuanzhong and his wife muttered: "After so many years of planting apples, I didn't see anyone in the village who made a fortune planting apples."
"The apples are all dwarf apples, so they won't grow too tall."
What Li Yuanzhong did not expect is that this apple planting using a new method, irrigation pipes laid under each apple tree, water and fertilizer together to the roots of the tree, the fall harvest fruit, tractors directly into the orchard, standing on the fruit can be picked.
At present, the apple base has gradually entered the production period, the market is also as Hou Jianwen expected, the apples are not worried about selling, loved by consumers in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and other cities.
The growing apple industry has brought new changes to Li Yuanzhong's life, and although he is still farming, he has a new source of income.

Membrane separation technology helps crack the "greenhouse effect" - China News Network
Membrane Separation Technology Helps Crack the "Greenhouse Effect"
Schematic diagram of the new hybrid substrate membrane preparation technology
By Shang Rui, reporter: Recently, Tianjin University's atmospheric environment and bioenergy team has made significant progress in "carbon dioxide capture by membrane separation" and successfully developed a new hybrid matrix membrane preparation technology, which significantly improves the carbon dioxide capture performance of membrane materials.
The results were published as the cover article of the international journal "Greenhouse Gases: Science and Technology".
The "greenhouse effect" is a major environmental problem plaguing human development, and CO2 emissions are the culprit of the "greenhouse effect".
How to efficiently capture and utilize human carbon dioxide emissions is the focus of scientists' attention.
"Membrane separation" is a new technology of carbon dioxide capture, which is energy efficient and simple to operate with the help of membrane materials.
How to let the membrane material "breathe" and improve the gas separation efficiency is the bottleneck of carbon dioxide capture by membrane separation method.
The research team of Tianjin University innovated and explored the effect of different solvents on the performance of membrane gas separation through repeated experiments.
The experimental results show that using N-methylpyrrolidone as the preparation solvent, the carbon nanotubes in the generated membrane material are more uniformly distributed and "more breathable", which effectively improves the gas separation efficiency and rate of the membrane material.
The hybrid matrix membranes prepared with this new technology have carbon dioxide separation performance close to the theoretical separation limit of such membrane materials currently available.
"The new technology provides a new idea for carbon dioxide capture by membrane separation."
Li Run, a member of the Atmospheric Environment and Bioenergy team at Tianjin University, said, " We hope this technology will provide strong support for the treatment of flue gas in coal-fired power plants and chemical companies in the future, and play a significant role in areas such as controlling greenhouse gas emissions."
Before filling out the volunteer application, first understand what is the professional level difference - CNN

Before filling out the volunteer application, first understand what is the professional grade difference
Every year to fill out the college entrance examination, there are students or parents because of the voluntary application involved in the terminology does not understand, and thus affect the volunteer application.
This year, five universities, including Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing University of Science and Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing Forestry University and Beijing University of Chemical Technology, have jointly released their admission policies for 2020, abolishing the professional gradation.
What is the meaning of professional gradation and what is the significance in voluntary application?
There are three ways of professional allocation rules
Experts remind that before filling out the volunteer application, you must read the enrollment prospectus of your preferred school in detail to understand the admission rules of the university, including the transfer ratio and professional allocation rules.
The rules of professional allocation means that after the college transfer, there are mainly three ways of professional priority, score priority and professional level difference for professional admission.
The specific way which colleges and universities use will be clear in the Admission Regulations.
However, there are some colleges and universities whose admission principle is total score priority and no grade difference between majors.
The first one is the first one, and the second one is the second one, and so on until the last one is admitted.
The so-called "professional grade difference", is the institutions in the arrangement of candidates, according to the admissions regulations announced in one or several points value, to determine the admission of different professional volunteer candidates, this score value is the "professional grade difference".
This is the difference between the first and non-first major, such as 3 points, 2 points, 1 point, etc.
For example.
Suppose student Xiao Ming applied for college A, scored 560 points, and his major volunteers are: computer, international trade, automation, mechanical engineering, e-commerce, and the admission of major in college A is based on the method of major grade difference, which is 2 points, 1 point, 1 point and 0 point.
In the professional allocation, if Xiao Ming's first professional volunteer meets the professional admission requirements and there is a balance of professional plans, then Xiao Ming is admitted to the major of "computer"; if computer is not admitted, then his score will be subtracted by 2 points, and his score will be 558 with the first professional volunteer for " If he still can't meet the requirements, his score will be subtracted by 1 point (i.e. 557 points) and he will be admitted to the third major "Automation"; if he still can't meet the requirements, his score will be subtracted by 1 point (i.e. 556 points) and he will be admitted to the fourth major. If it still can't meet, the score will be reduced by 1 point (i.e. 556 points) for the fourth major.
Different universities set different levels of difference in majors
With the popularity of parallel volunteering, many colleges and universities have abolished the professional grade difference, but this year there are still some colleges and universities still retain this method, from the admissions regulations published by the schools, this year there are mainly more than 20 universities set professional grade difference.
For example, Sichuan Agricultural University, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Heilongjiang University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Jiangxi Normal University, Chengdu Medical College, Northeast Electric Power University, Jimei University, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing University of Technology, Ningxia University, Shandong University of Technology, Civil Aviation Flight Academy of China, etc.
In each of these universities, the level of specialization is set differently.
Some universities have a grade difference in each major, for example, Ningxia University, the file has been cast to the university, according to the order in which candidates fill in the professional volunteers in descending order of 1 point after the score of admission.
And some universities set different professional gradations between different majors.
For example, Jimei University, the total value of the professional volunteer grade difference is 4 points, that is, the first professional volunteer and other professional volunteer grade difference is 3 points, other professional volunteer is not set between the grade difference, as a parallel volunteer, other professional volunteer and transfer professional volunteer professional grade difference is 1 point.
When filling out the volunteer, candidates and parents must carefully read the admission policies of the schools they apply to see if there is a professional gradient, what is the form of the gradient, in full consideration of the score, but also a reasonable analysis of the proposed school and professional, if the institution in the admissions regulations clearly take the score gradient way of admission, candidates in the selection of professional, pay attention to the gradient between the professions to improve the chances of admission.

Chengdu People Pile Up Around U.S. Consulate, Police Stop People From "Looking Too Happy"
In response to the U.S. closing the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, China announced the closure of the U.S. Consulate General in Chengdu on Friday.
On Saturday, the emblem was removed from the U.S. Consulate, and on Sunday, a dark glass car drove away from the consulate amid boos from passersby.

The Consulate was surrounded by guards, and police officers occasionally "corrected" people's behavior, seemingly not allowing any out-of-the-ordinary behavior: a woman was stopped just as she was about to sing a red song, and a guard confiscated a banner.
But residents of a nearby residential building managed to pull up a giant Chinese flag on their balcony and shouted pro-China slogans.
The U.S. Consulate in Chengdu, which opened in 1985, covers all U.S. consular-related matters in southwestern China, particularly the Tibet Autonomous Region.
AFP's Chengdu correspondent said that the Chinese government's response to the U.S. has been relatively restrained: many Chinese have called online for the government to close the U.S. consulate in Hong Kong, but officials have simply said that "the closure of the U.S. consulate in Chengdu is a necessary and legal response to unreasonable U.S. behavior.
In addition to Chengdu, the U.S. consulates in China are in Guangdong, Shanghai, Shenyang, Wuhan and Hong Kong.
