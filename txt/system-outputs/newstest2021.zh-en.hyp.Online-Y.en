Rural revitalization, talent is the key.
Where to find Talent?
Outstanding groups of migrant migrant workers are indispensable forces.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 26: Make outstanding returning migrant workers into villages to revitalize the army
This year, 34-year-old Zhang Xiongjia was in the Orchard Village of Meishan City, Sichuan. In 2010 he quit Beijing's monthly salary of tens of thousands of jobs to go home.
After several years of hard work, now he operates a wine-growing family farm with an annual income of more than one million yuan, becoming a small famous leader in getting rich, and has been selected to enter the village “two committees” team.
In recent years, under the encouragement of a series of pro-agricultural policies such as national poverty alleviation, rural revitalization and other incentives, more and more outstanding migrant workers like Zhang Xiong have chosen to go back to their homes to start business and activate a pool of spring water in the countryside.
Sichuan, a major province of western China's population and labor export province, because of snob guided implementation of “excellent migrant workers back training project”. In 2019 alone, more than 8,000 village party branch secretaries were generated from the outstanding migrant workers cited, cultivating 61,000 village reserve forces, development party members more than 20,000, to win the fight against poverty and fight against poverty. The implementation of the Village Revitalization Strategy provides a strong guarantee.
Well-not well, the key to see the fellow.
Since the reform and opening up, a large number of young and young laborers in China's rural areas have increased their income, and some have created their own businesses through hard work.
However, objectively, it has also led to the emergence of “hollowization” in rural areas to varying degrees. In particular, rural grass-roots organizations have weakened, and village party branch secretaries and party members both show a “old and low” feature, namely, aging age and low education, and the lack of strong leadership of village party organizations, and the lack of green and yellow problems.
If factors such as rural talent have been flowing unidirectional to cities, and the countryside is in a state of “blood loss” and “anaemia” for a long time, revitalization is an empty word.
To attract those migrant workers who have the ability, consciousness, and aspire to serve their hometown, guide them to return to their home businesses to become rich leaders, from which they are cultivated into party members and rural cadres, and enrich grass-roots cadres. This is a cure policy for solving the problems of rural party members and grass-roots party organizations.
Excellent migrant workers are brought back, and they must also keep them and do well.
In recent years, starting with the establishment of the Peasant Labour Party, Sichuan, on the basis of strict criteria for candidates, has set up institutional mechanisms such as targeted return, service guarantee, training, and use of training, enabling them to improve their abilities, have security at work, and have prospects for their lives, and truly take root in rural areas. Officers have a sense of achievement in entrepreneurship.
This year is the year of the end of the battle against poverty, and the linkage between poverty and the revitalization of the countryside. Talent is the key factor.
Party committees and governments at all levels should attach great importance to the group of outstanding returning migrant workers, and through comprehensive measures, they will be built into a task force that can fight and take without taking away, providing strong organizational security and talent support for rural poverty alleviation and development and revitalization.

Chinane.com, July 26 - According to foreign media reports, on July 18, the treasures of religious historical buildings in Nantes, France, and the famous Cathedral of St. Peter and Saint Paul, were severely damaged in a fire, and the large pipe organ was completely destroyed.
On the 26th local time, Nantes prosecutor announced that a parish volunteer in charge of defending the cathedral has been charged for “arson destruction”.
He has admitted that it was himself ignited in the church.
According to the report, local prosecutor Senas said the 39-year-old parish volunteer from Rwanda admitted that he ignited three places in the cathedral at night.
For his part, his lawyer said that the arsonists now regretted doing such things.
A few years ago, he entered France by means of refuge, where he was sheltered in the parish in the area of the fire and received in the church.

Comprehensive News: US Unilateralism Sabotage Relations Between the Two Countries, International Public Opinion Support of China's Reaction Against the US - Xinhuan.com
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26 - Xinhua News Agency reporters abroad reported: On the morning of July 24, the Chinese Foreign Ministry informed the US embassy in China that the Chinese side decided to revoke the authorization for the establishment and operation of the US Consulate General in Chengdu and put specific demands on the consulate-general to stop all operations and activities.
International public opinion believes that the unilateralist measures taken by the United States cause serious distress to Sino-US relations, and that China responds to unjustifiably provocations by the US side, and that it is legitimate and necessary to take countermeasures.
Andrés Borquez, director of the Center for Chinese Studies at the University of Chile Institute of International Studies, said that the unilateralist measures of the United States had destroyed bridges of understanding between the two peoples and caused a crisis in relations between the two major Powers.
China has informed the US that the closure of its consulate general in Chengdu is a counteract to the unilateral measures of the United States and is in keeping with diplomatic practice.
Patricio Giusto, a professor at the Catholic University of Argentina and director of the ACC Research Center, believes that the above Chinese decision is a legitimate and necessary countermeasure against the United States earlier provocation, not against ordinary American citizens.
The US tries to divert the attention of the American population by pressuring China to hide its lack of response to COVID-19.
Bambang Sulyono, Chairman of the Asian Innovation Research Center of Indonesia think tank, said that the United States has taken a provocative diplomatic gesture, causing serious problems to Sino-US relations and facing serious challenges.
China's notification that the closure of its Consulate General in Chengdu is a normal countermeasure, conforms to diplomatic practice, and reflects both China's principled position that firmly defends its own interests, and reflects the reasonable and beneficial nature of Chinese diplomacy.
Tanzanian current affairs commentator Francis Semwinza said China's decision was a legitimate and necessary response to US provocations.
Sino-US relations should return to normal. The US side should take the initiative to improve its relations with China and stop interfering in China's internal affairs.
The US should focus on how to achieve economic and political win-win with China, and how to benefit the people of both countries and the international community as a whole.
Ali Yusuf, Executive Director of the Federation of Arab-China Friendship Associations, headquartered in the Sudan, said that the countermeasures that China had been forced to take were a legitimate and necessary response to the unjustified actions of the United States, in accordance with international law and the basic norms of international relations, and in accordance with diplomatic practice.
Earlier, the US demand for the closure of the Chinese Consulate General in Houston was a serious violation of international law and the basic norms of international relations.
He hoped that the United States would rescind its previous decision and create the necessary conditions for the return of relations between the two countries to normal.
Singapore's United Morning Post editorial said that America's greater strategic intention is to siege China and prevent China from continuing to rise.
Faced with the urgency of the US, although China is very reluctant to see Sino-US relations continue to deteriorate, it has to take countermeasures.

Polish President Dudda made hostility to gay rights one of the main topics during this month's successful re-election campaign.
On Friday, thousands of Poles, most of them women, held protests against withdrawal from the Convention in Warsaw and a number of other cities.
One of the organizers of the protest, Lempat, said in a protest march in Warsaw that “the purpose of withdrawal from the treaty is to legalize domestic violence.”
Some protesters held banners saying “The Law and Justice Party is the hell of women”.
The Law and Justice Party has long complained about the Istanbul Convention.
Poland's former central government ratified the Convention in 2015.
The Government of the Law and Justice Party stated that the treaty did not respect religion and called for liberal social policies to be taught in schools.
To date, however, the party has not decided to withdraw from the Convention.

US first anti-subsidy investigation against China with “renminbi undervaluation”
In response to the US Department of Commerce recently announced its decision to launch anti-dumping countervailing investigation against Chinese origin tie (harness belt) products, and launch an investigation on the “RMB exchange rate underestimation” project.
China's Ministry of Commerce pointed out that this is the first time that the United States is in a countervailing case to investigate the so-called “renminbi exchange rate underestimation” project, and China firmly opposes this.
The Chinese Ministry of Commerce issued a special press release on the evening of the 23rd that China implements a regulated floating exchange rate system based on market supply and demand, with reference to a basket of currencies, and the market plays a decisive role in the formation of exchange rates.
The press release stressed that, overall, the renminbi exchange rate was at a reasonable equilibrium level and had not been underestimated.
Since 2005, the renminbi has accumulated appreciation of more than 17% against the dollar.
According to data released by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), from early 2005 to May 2020, RMB nominal effective exchange rate appreciation of 38%, real effective exchange rate appreciation of 49%, is the strongest currency in the G20 economies, and one of the largest in the world.
The Ministry of Commerce noted that exchange rate issues were beyond the competence of members to conduct countervailing investigations in accordance with World Trade Organization rules.
The US amended its legislation in February to conduct countervailing investigations against the exchange rate of other countries, which has been suspected of violating WTO rules and has been opposed from many sides.
The press release said that even under US regulations, there were numerous errors in the content of the petitioner's complaint and did not have countervailing essential elements such as financial support, grant of interest, and specialization.
China urges the US side to abide by existing international rules and stop its countervailing investigation against the so-called “renminbi exchange rate underestimation”.
Affected by further rising tensions in Sino-US relations, the offshore and onshore RMB exchange rate against the US dollar on the 22nd traded sharply, and both fell below the $1 dollar against the RMB 7.0 mark.
It is a matter of concern whether the US Commerce Department's move is intended to push the renminbi up.
The RMB spot pair against the dollar rose to break the 7.0 level on the 23rd, closing at 6.9961.
The RMB exchange rate against the dollar under official control, the mid-price of the exchange rate, on the 24th down 17 basic points, reported 6.9938.

China News Agency, July 26, Xinjiang Hami: Xinjiang deep plowing “sunflower fields” with clean energy
More than 6,000 pentagonal sunglasses, 48 square meters each, arranged in a circle, such as a silver “sunflower field”, with the sun rotating, reflecting the sun to the center of more than 200 meters high heat absorption tower, to achieve power generation.
The reporter saw this scene at the Hami molten salt tower photothermal power farm in Nao Maohu Town, Yigu County, Hami City, Xinjiang on the 25th.
“The so-called molten salt tower photothermal power generation is the solar light reflected in the mirror to the heat absorption tower to form thermal energy, and then convert heat into electricity through traditional power generation technology.”
Zhang Yong, deputy general manager of China Power Hami Solar Thermal Power Co., Ltd. said that the design principle is similar to the solar stove used in rural areas of northwest China, all have to gather the sun light together.
The farm began construction in October 2017 and was connected to the grid at the end of last year, covering an area of 6,600 acres, and a total of 14,500 fixtures are planned to be installed.
“Compared to conventional solar power generation technology, the biggest advantage is that the aggregate heat can be stored and power generation at night.”
Zhang Yong said the project's 13-hour heat storage system can keep the generator set running continuously and stable, not affected by changes in light. It can also quickly participate in grid peak regulation according to the demand of the grid load peak.
Once completed, the project can achieve an annual power generation of 198 million degrees, saving more than 60,000 tons of standard coal per year, more than 60 tons of sulphur dioxide, 60 tons of nitrogen oxides, 20 tons of smoke and dust, and 150,000 tons of carbon dioxide, providing a continuous source of clean energy.
In addition, there is another silver “sunflower field” in Shicengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park in Hami City.
The Hamiver photovoltaic photovoltaic plant covers an area of more than 2,300 acres. The 714 power generation equipment has been built to follow the solar rotation, always keeping the sun light and the condenser face at 90 degrees right angles.
“We use dual-axis tracked condenser power generation technology, and through unified integrated control, all power generation equipment will adjust the angle to the height of the sun to maintain power efficiency.”
Duan Mengqi, director of the power station, said the power generation technology can improve the efficiency of conventional photovoltaic power generation by about 20% in light weather conditions.
In the first half of this year, the plant has produced more than 7 million degrees of electricity, supplementing local electricity demand.
Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park is currently the largest monomer in Xinjiang, the most complete photovoltaic module type a photovoltaic industry demonstration park, a total of 38 photovoltaic power projects, a total of 82 million kilowatts installed.
In the first half of this year, power generation was over 110 million degrees, up 6% from the same period in 2019.
Hami is one of the best solar resources in China.
The average annual total solar radiation is more than 6,200 MJs per square metre and approximately 3200 hours of sunshine throughout the year.
In recent years, the city vigorously developed photovoltaic industry, good “sunflower field”.
It has built more than 2.5 million kilowatts of solar power generation scale, the city's photovoltaic power generation exceeded 1.4 billion degrees in the first half of this year, up about 14% year-on-year.
At present, Xinjiang grid-connected photovoltaic power plant more than 330 seats, installed capacity of more than 10 million kilowatts.
PV power generation is expected to reach 15 billion degrees this year, which can replace more than 6 million tons of standard coal.

US media unveiled the truth that the US side demanded that China close its Consulate General in Houston - Chinese.com

US media unveiled the truth about the US side's unprodukable demand that China close its Consulate General in Houston
On the 24th, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the US Embassy in China that China decided to revoke the authorization for the establishment and operation of the US Consulate General in Chengdu and put specific demands on the consulate-general to stop all operations and activities, as a countermeasure against the US side's sudden demand that the Chinese side close the Consulate General in Houston on the 21st.
This action by the United States government has attracted many concerns, and its political motives have been questioned by foreign media and scholars.
Why is it asking the Chinese side to close the Consulate General?
A number of foreign media said that it is not clear why the United States will choose the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, but for the purpose of this move, foreign media said frankly: for the general election.
The US Cable News Network (CNN) reported on the 23rd that the US side asked the Chinese side to close the consulate general in Houston caused public questioning of its political motives.
The article said that the US government's disastrous response to COVID-19 caused President Trump's poll support rate before the election was lower.
White House officials privately claimed that the tough strategy against China was to save Trump's support rate, but also to divert responsibility for the White House outbreak's failure.
According to the article, the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is a “politically driven, very cautious” goal chosen by the US government to “create a tough attitude while avoiding the risk of major conflict.”
The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) also believes that in the US election season approaching, the US economy is severely hit by the epidemic, Trump believes that “playing the 'Chinese card' has a political advantage.”
The current situation is “a spiral, tit-for-tat struggle,” driven in part by the US government from a domestic perspective, and will only exacerbate tensions between China and the United States.
The US Columbia Broadcasting Corporation (CBS) reported that Trump's re-election prospect was under pressure due to the outbreak, he repeatedly accused China for the outbreak.
Almost every day, the United States has new actions against Trump's absurd rhetoric of “China's exploitation of America.”
“The Consulate General of Houston is important in establishing ties between the two countries”
The Associated Press commented that the US demand for China to close its consulate-general in Houston has exacerbated tensions between the two largest economies in the world.
If the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is closed, in addition to diplomatic implications, Chinese citizens in the south of the United States face difficulties in obtaining consular services, as do US citizens seeking visas and other services.
A business group in Houston regretted the US demand that China close its Consulate General in Houston, saying that the Consulate General played an important role in establishing trade, investment and cultural ties between the two countries.
The Associated Press believes that this reflects the importance of China's economy.
The US Foreign Policy website believes that this move “is part of a series of provocative initiatives that will only worsen US-China relations.”
Reuters quoted Jonathan Pollak, an expert on East Asia at the Brookings Institute in the United States, saying that since the establishment of full diplomatic relations between the US and China in 1979, he could not imagine anything comparable to the US action against the Chinese Consulate-General in Houston.
Hong Kong's South China Morning News reported that this move by the US side was unprecedented in the diplomatic relations between China and the United States for more than 40 years.
Analysts believe that this move could cause persistent damage.
Built in 1979, the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is the first Chinese consulate-general to open in the United States.
Currently, China has one embassy and five consulates general in the United States.

The spokesman stressed that the Chinese government is a staunch defender of cybersecurity and has always firmly opposed and combated any form of cyber attacks and cybercrime.
A reporter asked: According to the media, hacking groups linked to China had interfered with a British company's network system, launched an attack on British and American technology companies with patent data, and invaded EU government networks.
The spokesman said that the Chinese government is a staunch defender of cybersecurity and has always firmly opposed and combated any form of cyber attacks and cybercrime.
Cyberspace is virtual, traceable and diverse actors. When investigating and characterizing cyberincidents, there should be sufficient evidence and no guesswork.
The spokesman said that a series of incidents such as the “prism door” proved that the United States has been carrying out the world's largest cyber stealing operations.
It is in the common interest of all States to maintain peace and stability in cyberspace.
The spokesman pointed out that China's achievements in science and technology innovation are not stolen, not robbed, but through self-reliance and hard work.

Free nucleic acid testing in Urumqi has basically completed secondary testing in high-risk areas - Chinane.com
Chinane.com, Urumqi, July 26 (Reporter Sun Tingwen Zhao Yamin) Zhang Wei, director of the Sanitary Health Committee of Urumqi City on the 26th, said in his briefing on the latest outbreak and nucleic acid testing situation in Urumqi, that at present, most of the free nucleic acid testing in Urumqi city have been basically completed.
The State Council expert group and experts from the Autonomous Region and Urumqi Municipality are making further assessments of the development of the epidemic based on the results of nucleic acid testing and epidemiological investigations.
The press office of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region held a press conference today to report on the outbreak and control situation in Xinjiang.
According to him, between 000-2400 hours on 25 July, 22 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 (of which 5 were reconfirmed cases of asymptomatic infection) and 38 new asymptomatic infections were added in Urumqi city.
As at 24:00 on 25 July, there are 135 confirmed cases and 147 cases of asymptomatic infection in Urumqi city.
The new asymptomatic infections on the 25th were basically screened through free nucleic acid testing throughout the city.
Zhang Wei, director of the Urumqi Municipal Health and Health Committee, said on the 26th that most areas of free nucleic acid testing in the whole city of Urumqi have been basically completed.
He added that, from experience in other parts of the country, there are many factors influencing nucleic acid test results, such as the sensitivity of the test reagent, the time of infection and detoxification time of the person being tested, the cooperation of the person being tested at the time of the sample (poor fit may result in not being taken), and the testing environment, testing Proficiency in the operation of personnel, etc.
For a variety of reasons, nucleic acid tests also produce false negative results.
False negative means that the person tested is indeed an infected person, but the nucleic acid test result is negative.
In addition, people who have had close contact with confirmed or suspected cases usually require two nucleic acid tests to exclude.
For those who have traveled to high-risk areas in the epidemic, if they have fever and respiratory symptoms, a negative nucleic acid test may be false negative, so two nucleic acid tests are also required to exclude.
He said, in view of the above, for the health of the people of all ethnic groups in the city, from today, Urumqi will carry out two free nucleic acid testing in key areas such as Tianshan District, Shaybak District and other key areas, while carrying out “check the missing”.
It is reported that Tianshan and Shaibak district are high-risk areas of the outbreak.

US-China trade representatives meet in August
Hong Kong's South China Morning Post quoted an anonymous informed person reported on the 25th that Chinese trade negotiation team leader Liu He and US team co-leader Lai Haizhe are expected to hold formal talks in August to assess the implementation of the first stage of the Sino-US trade agreement.
The report said that although China has significantly increased its procurement of US agricultural products in the past few months, due to coronavirus and other factors, China's procurement volume is still a distance from the number promised in the trade agreement.
Analysts say that the recent closure of each other's consulates between the US and China, together with other disputes, could undermine any progress in trade between the two sides.
The first stage trade agreement between China and the US came into force one month after January 15. The agreement stipulated that a high-level trade framework group between the two sides should hold talks every six months.
The meeting will be “an important turning point”, allowing both sides to assess the progress of the agreement, sources said.
But this person also said that if US-China tensions lead to low willingness to talk at this time, the two sides may agree that Lai Haizhe and Liu He's telephone conference on May 8 will have met the terms of the semi-annual talks in the trade agreement.
Since this year, Sino-US relations have deteriorated rapidly. The disputes between the two sides include issues such as the origin of the coronavirus, trade, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, the South China Sea and ideology.
US President Donald Trump boasted his achievements in the first phase of the deal at the beginning of the year, but his attitude has changed recently.
He said at a White House press conference on the 23rd that although China recently purchased a record number of US maize on a single day, also bought a lot of soybeans, “but this trade agreement is now less meaningful to me than it was when it was reached.”
An anonymous Beijing government advisor also believes that a new round of trade talks is unlikely to take place due to poor US-China relations, “trade issues have lost weight in Sino-US relations.”
But he revealed that China's economic and trade related units still met on the 23rd to discuss a number of issues, including how to increase imports from the United States, “we have tried our best to buy, so any additional purchases will be difficult.”
Peng Jiining, vice chairman of the US-China Trade National Committee, said that maintaining the momentum of the first phase agreement is “more important than ever,” and said China has made progress in further opening up financial markets to US companies this year.
“Talk is better than nothing, though it may only be treated as a routine,” said analysts at plenum independent research firm.

Commentator of People's Daily: Concentrate on doing their own things to build new advantages in future development — on learning and implementation General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech at the entrepreneur forum - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 25 - People's Daily July 26th commentator article: Concentrate your efforts to do their own things to build new advantages in future development
At present, the global epidemic and the world economic situation remain grim and complex, and the development challenges facing our country are unprecedented.
Keeping strategic strength, building confidence in winning, and concentrating our efforts on doing our own things is the key to responding to various risks and challenges.
At the recent Entrepreneurs Symposium, General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed that under the external environment of the current rise of protectionism, the world economic downturn, and the shrinking global market, we must concentrate our efforts to do our own business, fully play the advantages of domestic hyperscale markets and gradually form a domestic cycle The new development pattern of mutual promotion of body, domestic and international double cycle, to enhance the modernization of the supply chain in the industrial chain, vigorously promote Technological innovation, accelerate key core technology, build new advantages for future development.
Wise, the harnessing win.
In the external environment of deepening economic globalization, markets and resources “both sides” play an important role in the rapid development of our country.
Now, the world under the impact of the epidemic is undergoing profound changes, facing more uncertainties of instability, and economic globalization is facing downwinds and backwinds.
To prepare for a longer period of time to cope with changes in the external environment, and to promote China's economy to thrive and stabilize. One of the most important aspects is to make the expansion and satisfaction of domestic needs a strategic basis for development, give full play to its own advantages, and to flourish the domestic economy and smooth the country through prosperity of the domestic economy. The big cycle adds impetus to China's economic development, driving the world economic recovery.
We should be deeply aware that building a complete system of domestic demand is related to the long-term development and long-term security of our country.
During the review of the situation, the Party Central Committee clearly proposed to firmly implement the strategy of expanding domestic demand. This is the need to cope with the impact of the epidemic. It is the need to maintain the sustained and healthy development of our economy in the long term, and to meet the needs of the people's growing and better life.
The advantage of large economies is internal circulation.
China has the world's most complete and largest industrial system, strong production capacity, perfect supporting capacity, has more than 100 million market subjects and more than 170 million people with higher education or all kinds of professional skills, and a large scale of 1.4 billion people, including more than 400 million middle income groups In-mold demand market, is in the rapid development stage of new industrialization, information, urbanization, agricultural modernization, The potential for investment demand is enormous.
The common development of the public ownership system, multi-ownership economy, distribution of labor as the main subject, multiple distribution modes coexist, and socialist basic economic systems such as the socialist market economy system can both stimulate the dynamism of various market subjects, liberate and develop social productivity, but also promote efficiency and fair and organic unity, Continuously achieve common prosperity.
We need to firmly grasp the strategic base of expansion of domestic demand, so that production, distribution and distribution will rely more on the domestic market to achieve a virtuous circle, clarify the strategic direction of supply-side structural reforms, and promote a dynamic balance of total supply and demand at a higher level.
To accelerate the construction of a complete domestic demand system, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation and other aspects of innovation, accelerate the development of strategic emerging industries such as digital economy, intelligent manufacturing, life health, new materials, and form more new growth points, growth poles, and gradually form a domestic and international double cycle New patterns of development that mutually reinforce each other.
Openness brings progress, closure is bound to lag behind.
General Secretary Xi Jinping has repeatedly stressed that China's open doors will not close, it will only become bigger.
The main theme of the domestic cycle is not closed to closed doors, but rather to achieve stronger and more sustainable development by harnessing the potential of domestic demand, making better access to both domestic and international markets and two kinds of resources.
At the same time, there is no contradiction between expanding domestic demand and opening up. The smoother the domestic cycle, the more conducive to the establishment of a new pattern of openness, the more conducive to developing new advantages for participation in international cooperation and competition.
Although protectionist thinking at the international level is rising, we need to stand on the right side of history, insist on deepening reform, expanding openness, strengthening open cooperation in science and technology, promoting the construction of an open world economy and promoting the establishment of a community of human destiny.
The Chinese nation has experienced many tribulations in its history, but has never been overwhelmed, but rather the more frustrating, growing up in the tribulation and rising up from the tribulation.
On the way forward, there are strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Xi Jinping at its core, with significant advantages of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, strong mobilization ability and strong comprehensive strength, and the unity and struggle of the people of all nationalities of the whole Party and the whole army, and we will surely be able to overcome all difficult and dangerous obstacles. China's economic and social development momentum, fully built a well-off society, successfully opened a comprehensive socialist modernization A new journey to the country!

France increases military investment in space - Xinhuan.com
French Defense Minister Florence Palley said on the 24th that France will add hundreds of millions of euros space defense budget to develop military forces in space to prevent other countries to carry out “unfriendly moves” in outer space.
Pali told the newspaper Provence that day that the budget for French military space projects would increase from €3.6 billion ($4.2 billion) to 4.3 billion euros ($5 billion) between 2019 and 2025.
Under the French Military Planning Act 2019 to 2025, approved by the French Parliament in 2018, France is expected to update its existing observation and communications satellites, launch three electromagnetic listening satellites and modernizing space surveillance radars.
French President Emmanuel Macron announced last July that the French Air Force will set up a military command of space and an “aviation and space force”.
Pali said she would officially announce the establishment of this space force when she visited a military school in Salon in Provence later.
Parley said the space force is part of the air force, which reached 500 people by 2025.
“The idea that space serves the common good of science is gone,” she said. “Now space is the place where nations compete for global hegemony.”
Palley reiterated Macron's previous statement, saying that the French side had no intention of provoking an arms race.
“We are by no means engaged in an arms race. But it is my duty to fully understand the threats we may face.”
Pali reopened the surveillance of a French and Italian military satellite in 2017.
“Voyeur” was a Russian satellite, she said.
The Russian side denied this claim.
France “soon” will have small patrol satellites capable of reconnaissance and lock “the black hands behind those unfriendly moves”, Palley said.
French media believe that France seeks to create a space force is due to US President Donald Trump's request last February to the US Department of Defense to draft a space force bill.
Trump signed the Defense Authorization Act last December, approving the creation of the sixth largest US military, the Space Force.
Some experts worry that these US initiatives have accelerated the pace of US space militarization, which may trigger a new round of space arms race.

Experts say immigrant data collected through the US census for use in house seat allocation is unconstitutional
Civil rights organizations and several US cities and counties have filed prosecutions against the United States federal government, claiming that Trump's Office's attempt to exclude undocumented immigrants from the US census is unfeasible and unconstitutional.
The US census will determine the allocation of seats in the US House of Representatives.
Sarah Blannon, executive lawyer of the Civil Rights and Freedom League of America, said to VOA, “This is not possible.”
She went on to say that Trump's request to determine the citizenship of those subject to the census in the census was difficult and “not very reliable.”
Another civil liberties organization Common Cause filed a lawsuit on Thursday challenging Trump's executive order.
A number of cities in New Jersey and Georgia joined the lawsuit.
Arlington County, Virginia, also joined the lawsuit on Friday.
“The US Constitution requires an accurate inventory of our population every 10 years,” said Gavi, chairman of the Board of Management of Arlington County. We must accurately count everyone living in Arlington County, and this illegal attempt to scare away and squeeze our immigrant communities cannot succeed.”
Other organizations and individuals praised President Trump's executive order.
Alabama Attorney General Marshall said the executive order was a “victory” for the state.
“The allocation of seats in the House of Representatives and electoral colleges in each state must be based on the number of residents living in each state and the number of legally residing residents,” he said.
The US Supreme Court last year prevented the Trump administration from including citizenship in the 2020 census form.
President Trump signed an executive order earlier this week directing the US Census Bureau Commerce Secretary Ross to submit data on the undocumented population from the census so that the administration can exclude these undocumented populations from state census figures, as a means of determining whether each state is increasing Add or reduce or keep seats in the House of Representatives.
The United States redistributes seats in the House of Representatives every 10 years in the light of demographic changes.

Moving forward to promote the construction of industrial projects - Nodding Headline-Hunan Daily - Huasheng Online
Hunan in the midsummer, heat waves flutter.
And the province's industrial project construction promotion site to promote the enthusiasm released by the scene, covered three volts of heat, “with industry ratio strength, project theory hero” with the distinct orientation of the Sanxiang four water.
The development of Hunan, always depends on construction projects, training industry.
Faced with the very unusual first half of the year, under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Xi Jinping at the core, the province insisted on a set of chess, and went all out to fight epidemic prevention and flood control, and industrial projects as a “first-hand chess” to implement “six stable” and “six protection”.
GDP fell 1.9% yoy in the first quarter to 1.3% year-on-year growth in the first half, during the period of hard work, it goes without saying.
On this valuable transcript, the construction of industrial projects is the key support for accelerating the economic recovery and stability of Hunan.
It is good and irreversible.
Industrial project construction, to put into the big situation, both good at momentum, potential, and good at knowledge change, change, strain.
Against the background of the complex and grim international situation, in addition to hard investment and investment, we need to calm down to study the new characteristics of the current situation, more grasp the law, more scientific and accurate, and better integrate into the new development pattern with the domestic and international double cycles as the main body and promote each other.
Pay more attention to improving the industry's basic capabilities.
In the first half of the year, the province not only had a large number of heavyweight investment projects in emerging industries breaking ground, sowing hope, but also traditional advantages industrial enterprises in the transformation of digital, intelligent and green industries to accelerate the cloth and fall into the fly.
Yiyang Ausconn Third Science Park project to transform the existing production line, high-end printed circuit board intelligent production line seize the first opportunity; Hunan Cigarette Changde Cigarette Factory new factory is committed to intelligent transformation, building a modern factory, is also a vivid picture of “old tree sprout”... Strategy and “two new ones”, focus on consolidating and upgrading the advantages of industries, actively cultivating and developing emerging industries, comprehensive To increase the efforts of technological innovation and localization substitution, we can continuously consolidate the basic conditions and save the momentum of transformation.
Pay more attention to cultivating new models for the development of new economic and new forms.
The sudden coronavirus, brought the “cloud economy”, stimulated the potential of the digital economy and provided new opportunities for industrial change: in the first half of the year, the province's computer and office equipment manufacturing industry, electronic and communications equipment manufacturing industry grew 12.6%, and the limit of wholesale and retail enterprises online retail sales An increase of 32.2%, food and beverage business online meal income increased by 35.6% year-on-year.
Breeding new opportunities in the crisis, starting a new start in the change, actively promote digital industrialization, industry digitization, and guide the integration and development of the digital economy and the real economy is the trend.

U.S. White House advisors “anti-bite” states return to work prematurely
On July 23 local time, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the United States exceeded 4 million, accounting for 30% of global cases.
For several months, US President Donald Trump has repeatedly asked states to return to work in the country until recently changed their attitude and took the initiative to wear masks in public, while his advisors “bite back” said that some state governments return to work prematurely.
On the 22nd, White House presidential adviser Kelly Ann Conway said at a press conference that some state governments failed to comply with the standards of resumption of work, prematurely restarted such places as bars.
Conway also mentioned that the previous assertion that the president had “absolute power” to decide on the resumption of work in the states was a misleading rumor.
“The president is a federalist and he believes every state has autonomy.”
She defended Trump.
However, the “rumor” in Conway's mouth was made by Trump at the April 13 White House outbreak briefing.
The operation of this self-playing face, was taunted by Internet users as “rewriting history”.
Kelly Ann Conway wants to rewrite history, she's a liar.
Trump called Michigan Governor Gretan Whitmer a dictator because she followed medical guidelines and insisted on stoppage.
Trump wants to push for a return to work so that he can hold rallies.
This is not the first time that Kelly Conway has been controversial.

Is it reasonable to sue the school after 3 year old child's college playground play was smashed, after being compensated?
2020-07-26 05:01:11 Source: Legal Daily Author: Wang Sishuo Responsibility Editor: Wang Sishuo
The playground was smashed, the child was compensated before the school.
□ The newspaper correspondent Zhao Yifan
The 3-year-old Xiaowen was accidentally hit by softball team Chen mu while playing in a college playground.
After Chen's compensation, Xiaowen's father, Mr. Wen, as the legal representative of Xiaowen, brought the school to the court, asking the school where the incident was in place to apologize for compensation and pay medical expenses, mental damages, etc., a total of 20,000 yuan.
Recently, after hearing the case, the Beijing Haidian District People's Court held that the school had set up a protective net in the playground at the time of the incident, and that Chen had already paid compensation, and that Chen had made compensation, and accordingly dismissed the plaintiff's claim.
Mr. Wen claimed that he took Xiao Wen to play at the school playground during the summer of 2019, when the softball team was training in the playground.
In order to avoid the risks, Mr. Xiao Wen, Man, and many other children and parents are active in safe areas designated by the softball team.
But then, softball team member Chen mu left his hand while pitching, causing the softball to fly across the protective net to the above safe area and hitting the small man behind the head.
Mr. Wen immediately took Xiao Wen to hospital for treatment and was diagnosed as a head trauma.
Mr. Man believes that the facilities of the school stadium do not comply with the relevant safety requirements and do not effectively manage the team and related facilities.
The negligence of the school has led to the events mentioned above, causing immense physical and psychological suffering to the small literary and psychological, and at the same time inflicting greater suffering on their families, for which the school should bear legal responsibility.
In response, the school argued that the school had set up a protective net on the playground and had posted regulations and training notices informing that access to the playground must be kept safe from the training site and reminded that it was safe, and that the plaintiff could not prove that the school had “failed to meet its safety obligations” and therefore did not agree to compensation.
After the hearing, the court held that the site of the incident was open to the public free of charge by the university and that although the school had an obligation to ensure the management of the playground, such a duty of safety was only required to meet the general duty of care.
At the time of the incident, the school set up a protective net in the playground, and had already done its proper safety and security obligations, and Chen also compensated Xiaowen for damages such as medical expenses, transportation costs and other losses in accordance with the compensation agreement reached earlier. The two sides agreed to resolve the dispute at one time.
After the incident, Xiao Wen's parents once again argued for school compensation, and the court ruled out all the plaintiff's claims.
Since the judgement was delivered, neither party appealed, and the judgement is now in force.
According to article 37 of our law on tort liability, schools as administrators of public places have security obligations; in cases where the actions of third parties cause damage to others, the third party is liable for infringement, while the administrator of a public place who fails to meet the security obligations shall bear the corresponding additional liability.
According to the judge, as the administrator of a public place, it is most likely that the actual circumstances of the site as a whole, foresee the risks and damage that may occur, and thus to take the necessary measures to prevent or mitigate the extent of damage and the lowest cost of avoiding and mitigating damage, the law (b) The obligation to guarantee the exercise of social activities shall be imposed on them.
In the present case, the safety obligations of the school should be commensurate with the social activities carried out by the school in respect of unspecified entrants in the playground open to the public free of charge, in particular the adoption of basic safety measures and the obligation to inform about hidden risks.
In judicial practice, it is also not advisable to impose excessive security obligations on managers in public places.
If the school has adopted a protective net and has met its obligation to inform, it can be concluded that the school is not at fault and is not legally liable.
In addition, in the case of third party infringements, even if the administrator of public places such as schools fails to meet their obligations of safety and security, the liability is supplemented by damages, which, under the recently promulgated Civil Code, can be recovered from third parties.
Thus, in such incidents, the victim should not extend the scope of the claim after having received compensation from the direct infringer.
Under the normalization of epidemic prevention and control, people's enthusiasm for sports and fitness is rising.
With the gradual liberalization of the cross-provincial tourism business, the tourism market is about to usher in a recovery.
Fujian Province has resumed its cross-provincial tourism business on July 21, and the first weekend after opening, Xiamen, as a popular tourist destination, ushered in passenger traffic.
As a popular tourist destination city, there are a lot of tourists arriving in Xiamen on weekends.
Xiamen Railway Station is expected to send 3.7 million passengers by summer, and airport passenger flow is mainly based on students, tourism and family visits.
The tourism market gradually recovered, and in July, Xiamen Airport operated 440 times a day, and domestic flights had recovered to 80% before the outbreak.
The airline has encrypted the air express line from Xiamen to Shanghai, Beijing, Kunming, Xi'an and other major cities, seize the recovery tourism market.
At present, a number of travel agencies in Xiamen have been on-line a number of summer domestic cross-provincial tour products, the team's main outdoor attractions.
In response to summer passenger traffic spikes in railway stations and airports, relevant units sent more manpower in areas where people can gather at check-in counters and security channels. Fujian also optimizes the “eight min health code”, realizing health data sharing and mutual recognition with 31 provinces, promoting tourism The market recovered in an orderly manner.

Israel strengthens prevention and control of recurring outbreaks - Chinan.com

Israel Strengthens Prevention and Control of Recurring Outbreaks
In the early days of the COVID-19 outbreak, Israel's prevention and control measures have been effective.
However, with the gradual lifting of prevention and control measures and the recent increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Israel, the Israeli government has taken urgent measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic on several occasions.
On 28 February, the first case of COVID-19 was diagnosed in Israel, with the aim of quickly closing all ports of entry and exit, suspending non-essential trades, shifted schools into online teaching, restrictions on public transport and non-essential social activities, blockade cities with severe epidemics, joint military and police maintenance initiatives.
This series of measures quickly yielded positive results, and by mid-May, new confirmed cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) in Israel had dropped to single digits.
As the outbreak was brought under control, Israel's prevention and control measures were completely unsealed, and since June, the number of new cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) has gradually rebounded.
In particular, after entering July, the spread of the epidemic continues to accelerate.
In recent days, there are more than 1500 new daily cases in Israel for 8 days. As of July 25, the number of new cases reached 916.
As of 25 July, there were 59745 confirmed cases and 448 deaths in Israel.
Faced with the rapid rebound, the Israeli government has repeatedly taken urgent measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic.
On 6 July, after the number of confirmed cases exceeded 30,000, the Israeli government closed public entertainment venues such as gymnasium, swimming pools, bars, nightclubs, and introduced a restricted public transport policy to limit the maximum number of passengers per bus to 20 passengers.
On the 17th, the Israeli government announced a series of new restrictions including the implementation of “Fengcheng” on weekends, stipulating that the “Fengcheng” will be implemented every Friday from 17:00 to 5:00 on Sunday.
During this period, people can go out, but shops, shopping centers, barber shops, beauty salons, libraries, zoos, museums, exhibition halls, swimming pools and tourist attractions will be closed, while basic services such as supermarkets and pharmacies will remain open.
At the same time, gatherings of more than 10 people are prohibited on all dates and periods, gymnasium, studios and other venues will be closed, restaurants and cafes are forbidden, and only takeaway services are allowed.
At the same time, the Israeli population has not paid enough attention to the severity of the outbreak and failed to join forces with the government in fighting the epidemic.
After repeated outbreaks in Israel, many people went to the streets to protest over government measures affecting their own economic interests.
On 11 July, tens of thousands of people held a demonstration in Tel Aviv, arguing that the anti-epidemic policy affected the economy.
On the evening of 21, thousands of protesters gathered in front of Prime Minister Netanyahu's residence in Jerusalem to protest against Prime Minister Netanyahu's ban on restaurants, cafes and other preventive measures without compensating them.
In addition, many people do not observe the rules of wearing masks and maintaining a safe social distance of two meters while outdoors. In order to avoid being fined by the police for not wearing masks, many people only wear masks on their chin or hanging on their wrists.
During the recurring outbreak, schools were a major disaster area for the spread of the coronavirus. According to a recent visit to kindergarten here, the teachers and students of kindergarten did not wear masks as required by the government, nor did they maintain two meters of safe social distance from each other, creating a hidden danger for a large number of teachers and students infected with the virus.
Professor Ellie Waxman, a member of the National Security Council's National Security Council Counter Epidemic Expert Advisory Panel, believes Israel is moving towards a “dangerous situation”, pointing out that Israel's current measures to prevent and control the epidemic are not enough and that all leisure and recreational activities and summer schools should be closed to contain further expansion of the epidemic scatter

“Liu's Spy War Drama” returns again to see Liu Yunlong Li Liqun rival “drama” - Xinhuan.com
The 40 episodes of the spy battle drama “win” will be on July 16 in Beijing Satellite TV.
“Winning odds” based on real historical facts, based on the dust for many years, the first available Soviet military archives.
Actor Liu Yunlong, known as the “Spy War Drama”, has challenged a very happy “stuttering agent” in the play.
In recent years, “camouflage” “mask” “kite” and other drama red, all prove that the spy war type drama has a vigorous vitality.
Unlike the previous spy war works, “the odds” look to the world, the story will be extended to the Soviet Far East battlefield.
In the context of the final phase of the 1944 anti-Japanese war, it tells the story of Tang Fei, a clandestine intelligence worker of the Communist Party of China (Liu Yunlong), under the leadership of the secretary of the Chinese underground Party Linhe Provincial Committee and the Director of the Far East Intelligence Agency of the Soviet Union, carrying out the tactical action of “Mudan Ula” of the Soviet Army's Far East Intelligence Agency.
A lot of spy war play, the main character as a senior spy, a appearance is handsome, high IQ, mature perfect image.
But in the view of Liu Yunlong，Such people are not suitable for spy，"Spy should be the kind of people who can not find people in the pile of people，If the appearance is the kind of very handsome image，Hate all people have to pay attention to you，Can still lurk? There is a line in “Kite”, 'You don't come to catch me, I forgot that I'm a KMT, 'spy is going to elite.
So in the “winning odds”, Liu Yunlong intrigued his role as the master Tang Fei designed as a “stuttering agents” with a sense of joy.
The other side of the camp in “The odds” is supported by the police department of the police department, Tako Shibo, played by the Japanese Fukuhara and Li Liqun played by Leung Koan Hwa.
One south and one north two strength to play bone, adding many master tricks to the whole play.
Director Yin Fei used the word “drama” to describe Li Liqun and Liu Yunlong's rival play in the drama. “Absolutely a drama, the two of them were particularly tacit, and the tacit understanding on them was very impulsive for me. Many times their play is “hanging”, for example, we only write half a page of paper, and I don't shout when shooting, and they can play it all the time.”
Mastors do not rob each other, the director does not cheat, when the actors are in the role and ensure their character status, not only from the perspective of the character to shape the role, but also to bring more viewing possibilities to the audience, Yin Fei said such a play is good enough.
In the drama, you can also see many “Liu's spy war play” familiar face, “kite” in the famous, majestic “mountain city F4”, also gathered three in the “winning odds”.
Hou Yu and Liu Mingyang, who played Song Xiaoan and Zhao Jianzhi, again played Tang Fei's left arm.
Director Yin Fei introduced, “These two people have no bad roots, they are only in that era and in that environment.”
Liu Yunlong also took the initiative, “We need to have a human touch. This human sense means that people around me must have good and bad, bad people are enemies, but also to develop them, our team should also grow up.”
The ending of the two people in the drama is also carefully designed by Liu Yunlong, he believes that he will give the audience a satisfactory answer.

“The Lancet” publication praises China's efforts to combat epidemic encourage countries to learn from their experiences - Chinese.com
As a country with a population of 1.4 billion people, the size of which is similar to Europe or the United States, the COVID-19 has been effectively controlled at this stage, and there is no further large-scale spread, largely contained the outbreak in the country, according to the Lancet magazine 25.
The article said China has invested heavily in domestic research and public health construction for nearly a decade, which has made China more prepared for the coronavirus than it was for SARS.
At the time of the SARS outbreak in 2002, the authors said, China was initially underprepared, especially the pathogen could not be identified.
When the coronavirus was discovered in December 2019, Chinese scientists were soon able to identify the virus species and shared genome sequencing data with the international community on January 11, 2020.
By the end of January, doctors from mainland China and Hong Kong clarified the clinical features of the virus, warning the world of the threat of coronavirus through research papers published in Lancet.
China has also been at the forefront of vaccine research. The results of early trials of the coronary vaccine developed in China were announced in May and July, respectively, in the Lancet, through close cooperation at the national state of emergency.
China's experience shows that it is important to invest in national health and research systems to effectively improve laboratory capacity.
This is the basis for a rapid and effective national response to health emergencies and global health security.
Other countries, especially low- and middle-income countries, are well worth learning.
In addition, China's experience has shown that strong research is based on strong leadership and determination to make the right decisions based on science to enable COVID-19 to be effectively controlled.
The article emphasizes that governments and their leaders must respect science, understand its values, and act on it in the most beneficial manner for society.
In the early days of the outbreak, China's State Sanitary Construction Commission sent three groups of infectious disease experts to Wuhan to investigate the risk and spread of the coronavirus. Their recommendations provided the basis for the decision of “Fengcheng” in Wuhan on January 23; when some experts proposed the necessity and urgency of building a hospital class, the government made a decision soon and rapid implementation; and the broad participation of communities and the masses has also enabled the outbreak to be brought under control quickly and effectively.
The article concludes by emphasizing that countries need to strengthen global cooperation and joint responses to global health emergencies.

The Supreme People's Procuratorate has carried out targeted guidance. Of the ten typical cases involving epidemic prevention and control, there are 9 cases involving fraud offences.
From the case of the prosecution offices in the first half of the year, it appears that there are a wide range of names involving fraud crimes, ranging from national macro policy to the general population, including outbreaks fraud, “medical care care” fraud, “health care products” fraud, “recruitment intermediary” fraud, “routine loan” fraud, fraud in obtaining State subsidy, fraud, and public Family assets thawing fraud, etc., continue to “push out new”, covering education, health care, employment, pension, social security, Many areas such as land expropriation, demolition, precision poverty alleviation and financial credit have not only caused economic losses to the victims, but also seriously affect economic and social development.
In particular, some telecommunication network fraud breaks across national borders, geography and personnel restrictions and are characterized by interlocational, cross-border, remote, electronic payments, and so on.
For example, some set up specialized companies, rent upscale office buildings, set up multiple departments or positions, use a legitimate network platform to publicize, recruit, train and examine recruiters, adopt enterprise operating mode management, wearing “legitimate cloak”, and more confusing.
It is the responsibility of the procuratorial authorities to punish and prevent crimes in accordance with the law and to issue early warning to the public and relevant departments in a timely manner.
In judicial cases, the procuratorial organs carefully carry out their duties, both insisting on maintaining high pressure on fraud crimes, and refining law enforcement initiatives in a targeted manner, and promoting social governance by issuing prosecutorial recommendations, etc.
The procuratorial authorities strictly deal with arrests, prosecutions of fraud cases, evidence, procedures and the application of laws on the basis of facts, and the law as the norm.
In particular, in the case of telecommunication network fraud offences, the central role of electronic data in the determination of fact is being pursued and efforts are made to build a chain of evidence between electronic data, verbal evidence and documentary evidence.
For example, in the case of an epidemic fraud case handled by the Yinzhou District Procuratorate of Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province, the procuratorial office intervened early in the first time, from the case to the completion of the case, it took only five days to reflect the attitude and determination to handle strictly and maintain the stability of the society in general.
In reviewing arrests and reviewing prosecutions, focusing on the prosecution of omissions in cases, correcting the omission of 733 people by the public security organs, and correcting the omissions of public security organs, examining and prosecuting the co-perpetrators of 1113 persons.
In the first half of the year, the national procuratorial authorities issued 298 prosecutorial recommendations for fraud offences, promoting joint efforts to prevent fraud and promote deep governance.
For example, in response to the loopholes in the regulation of telecommunications networks, such as telecommunications enterprises, banks and intermediary organizations found in the case, the Guangzhou Procuratorate of Guangdong Province and the Dongguan Municipal Procuratorate promptly put forward procuratorial recommendations, urging the relevant units to strengthen supervision and improve mechanisms to promote long-term system building.
Four is to do a good job of recovering and recovering damage.
Procuratorate departments in various places seize important links such as intervening in the investigation, guide evidence, review and prosecution, and urge the investigating authorities to actively collect stolen money, cooperate with the relevant departments in recovering and recovering damage, and strive to minimize the economic losses caused by fraud crimes to the masses.
If the Beijing Municipal Procuratorate handled by the Beijing Municipal Procurator's Office, the case involved 22 sets of properties waiting for seizure. If the property may be previously disposed of in other cases, the first “suspended execution letter” was issued to the relevant court in a timely manner, suggesting that the court would suspend the execution of the property involved in the case before the crime. Unitary disposal after identification, maximum efforts are made to recover the property involved and recover the damage to the victims.
Prosecutors warned everyone that there is a high level of vigilance against fraud crimes, do not expect to “drop pie in the sky”, nor do you think it is cheap and keep your “money bag”.
Yina Town, Weining County, Guizhou Province: a short apple tree wide out of poverty - Chinan.com

Heat heat, economic daily - China Economic Network reporter went into the village of Yina Town, Weining County, Guizhou Province.
On the sun, villagers Li Yuanzhong hoe grass in the base, although the face was red, but the mouth from time to time hummed a few small songs.
Weining County, where yina town is located, because of low latitude, high altitude, plenty of light, day and night temperature difference, the apple is high sugar content, good taste, in the surrounding area has a certain visibility, but also because of a small head, many spots, has not been able to sell a good price, failed to form an industrial scale.
Yina Town was once a poor township of “Baogu Taro Spring and Autumn”, with a local incidence of 25.8% a decade ago.
In the critical period of fighting against poverty, it is urgent to change traditional farming habits, adjust the industrial structure and increase farmers' incomes.
Chen Chao, party committee secretary of Yina town and a group of people in town after many visits, believes that industrial development can no longer go old.
To this end, Yina Town introduced leading enterprises and modern ways to grow apples.
Hou Jianwen, Deputy General Manager of Weining beyond Agriculture Co., Ltd. from Shaanxi in 2015 came to Yina town research, at a glance at a glance the local planting conditions, starting in 2016 to the local planting of apple trees.
At first, the village mobilized Li Yuanzhong to transfer the land to plant apple trees, and Li Yuanzhong couple committed muttering in their hearts: “We planted apples for so many years, nor saw who kind of apple in the village was rich.”
“All apples are dwarfed apples and will not make the apple tree grow too high.”
What Li Yuanzhong did not expect is that this time apple planting uses a new method, irrigation pipes are paved under each apple tree, water and fertilizer poured together to the root of the tree. When the fruit is collected in autumn, the tractor directly into the orchard, standing can pick fruit.
At present, Apple base has gradually entered the productive period, the market is also as Hou Jianwen expected, Apple is not worried about selling, popular among consumers in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and other cities.
Growing Apple industry, let Li Yuanzhong's life have changed, although still planted, but a new source of income.
Li Yuanzhong family has more than 9 acres of land transferred to the apple base. In addition to the guaranteed land transfer fee every year, there are profit dividends after hanging fruit, the couple usually work in the base, “one person can get 80 yuan a day, every year to work.”
Li Yuanzhong told reporters that the profit dividend of more than 2,800 yuan last year, together with the land transfer fee and the work income of both spouses, a family income of more than 80,000 yuan. “Eat and wear without worries, good days have passed.”
“At present, the first results have been achieved, the annual output value of 1 acre of apples is more than 15,000 yuan, is about 10 times the type of corn.”
Chen Chao told reporters that the whole town of Yina currently planted 20,000 acres of apples, 6000 acres in the Zhonghai Village alone, covering 4056 households, 172,000 peasants, including 656 poor households, 2952 people, a year to pay more than 6 million yuan, really realized the base is built at the doorstep, not to work Go outward.
Li Yuanzhong, who is increasingly drum up, began to realize his “wish”.
This year's Lunar New Year, Li Yuanzhong bought a SUV, such as today drove a car to commuting to work, “There are more than a dozen acres of land at home, and the next step to expand the size of the Apple base, all flow to them, income will be more.”

Membrane Separation Technology Helps Crack “Greenhouse Effect” - Chinane.com
Membrane separation technology helps crack “greenhouse effect”
Schematic diagram of new hybrid matrix membrane preparation technology
This news reporter shangrui reported: recently, Tianjin University's atmospheric environment and bio-energy team made significant progress in “membrane separation method to capture carbon dioxide”, successfully developed a new hybrid matrix membrane preparation technology, greatly improve the carbon dioxide capture performance of membrane material.
The results have been published as a cover article in the international journal Greenhouse Gases: Science and Technology.
The “greenhouse effect” is a major environmental problem plaguing human development, and carbon dioxide emissions are responsible for the “greenhouse effect.”
Scientists focus on how to efficiently capture and utilize carbon dioxide emissions from humans.
Membrane Separation Method is an emerging carbon dioxide capture technology that separates carbon dioxide gas with the help of membrane materials, which is energy-efficient and simple to operate.
How to make membrane material “deep breathing”, improve gas separation efficiency, is the bottleneck of carbon dioxide capture using membrane separation method.
The research team of Tianjin University innovative ideas, through repeated experiments to explore the effect of different solvents on membrane gas separation properties.
The results show that the carbon nanotubes are distributed more evenly and “more breathable” in the membranes using N-methylpyrrolidone as the preparation solvent, and effectively improve the gas separation efficiency and rate of membrane material.
The carbon dioxide separation properties of hybrid matrix films prepared with this new technology are close to the current theoretical separation limit of such film materials.
“New technology provides new ideas for capturing carbon dioxide by membrane separation.”
Li Run, member of the Atmospheric Environment and Bioenergy team at Tianjin University, said: “We hope this technology will provide strong support for future coal-fired power plants and chemical companies in handling flue gas, and play a major role in controlling greenhouse gas emissions.”
Before volunteering to fill out, understand what is a professional grade difference - China.com

Before volunteering to do so, understand what is a professional grade difference
Every year, students or parents are not aware of the terminology involved in the voluntary application, and thus affect the voluntary filing.
This year, five universities from Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing University of Science and Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing Forestry University and Beijing University of Chemical Technology jointly issued 2020 admissions policy, eliminating professional grade difference.
What does professional-grade difference mean, and what is the significance of volunteering?
There are three ways to assign professional rules
Experts remind that before filing a volunteer, be sure to read the “Admissions Charter” of your favorite schools, to understand the admission rules of colleges, including regulation ratio, professional allocation rules, etc.
Professional allocation rules, refers to the university after the profile, for professional admission are mainly professional priority, score priority, professional grade difference three ways.
The specific method used by universities will be specified in the Admissions Charter.
But there are also some universities where the principle of admission is the total score priority, there is no grade difference between majors.
That is to say, candidates within the admission range are queued according to the total score, when the score does not reach the first professional volunteer, then see if the second professional volunteer has reached the second professional volunteer, and so on until admission to the last professional volunteer, there is no grade difference between each professional volunteer.
The so-called “professional grade difference” is that when an institution arranges a candidate's profession, according to one or more points published in the admissions charter, to determine the admissions of volunteer candidates from different specialties. This score value is “professional grade difference”.
That is, the difference between the scores of students enrolled in the first professional volunteer and non-first professional volunteers, such as 3 points, 2 points, 1 point, etc.
For example.
Assuming that students are enrolled in college A, 560 points, their professional volunteering are: computer, international trade, automation, mechanical engineering, e-commerce, professional admissions of A colleges to implement professional grade difference, grade difference is 2 points, 1 point, 1 point, 0 points.
In professional assignment, if Xiaoming's first professional volunteer meets the professional admission requirements and the professional planned balance, then Xiaoming is admitted to the “computer” professional; if the computer is not accepted, his score will be subtracted by 2 points, according to the score of 558 as the first professional volunteer for “International Trade” Easy” sorting candidates to determine whether they meet the criteria for professional admission; if still not, score minus 1 point ( (557 points) for the third professional volunteer “automated” admission; if still not met, the score is subtracted by 1 point (i.e. 556 points) for admission to the fourth profession, the subsequent profession will not be reduced if it still fails to meet its professional volunteer, and so on.
Different college professional level difference set
With the popularity of parallel volunteerism, many universities have now abolished professional grade difference, but some universities still retain this method this year. Judging from the “Admissions Charter” published by each school, this year, mainly over 20 universities have set professional grade difference.
For example, Sichuan Agricultural University, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Heilongjiang University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Jiangxi Normal University, Chengdu Medical College, Northeast Electric Power University, Jimei University, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing University of Technology, Ningxia University, Shandong University of Technology, China Civil Aviation Flight College, etc.
In each of these universities, each university has a different level of specialization.
Some universities have grade differences in every major. For example, Ningxia University, the files of candidates who have been put to the school, decreasing one point in order according to the order in which candidates are enrolled in the professional volunteer order.
Some universities set different professional grade differences between different disciplines.
For example, Jimei University, professional volunteer level difference is 4 points, that is, the first professional volunteer and other professional volunteer level difference is 3 points, no difference between other professional volunteers, is considered parallel volunteer, and the difference between other professional volunteers and the spin-off professional level is 1 point.
When filing a volunteer, candidates and parents must carefully read the admission policy of the reported school to see if there is a professional grade difference, what the form of the grade difference is, while fully considering the score, also have a reasonable analysis of the proposed school and profession, if the institution explicitly adopts a fractional difference in the admissions charter For admission, when choosing a profession, pay attention to the gradient between the major, improve the chances of admission.
