Xinhua Times: Turning Outstanding Returning Migrant Workers Into a New Force for Rural Revitalization - Xinhuanet
Talent is the key to the revitalization of villages.
Where is the talent to find?
Outstanding groups of migrant workers returning to their hometowns are an indispensable fresh force.

Chengdu, July 26,2020/PRNewswire/-- Turning outstanding returning migrant workers into a new force for rural revitalization
Zhang Xiong, 34, whose family lives in Guoyuan Village, Meishan City, Sichuan Province, quit his job in Beijing in 2010, earning tens of thousands of dollars a month, and returned home to start his own business.
After several years of hard work, he now runs a family farm of grape growers with an annual income of more than one million yuan, and has become a leader in getting rich with a small reputation. He has also been selected to join the "two committees" team in the village.
In recent years, more and more outstanding migrant workers like Zhang Xiong have chosen to return to their hometowns to start their own businesses, activating a pool of spring water in the countryside, inspired by a series of policies to support farmers and benefit farmers, such as the national poverty alleviation and rural revitalization.
Sichuan, a province with a large population in the west of China and a large export of labor services, has implemented the "Excellent Migrant Workers Retroduction Training Project" because of snobbery. In 2019 alone, more than 8,000 village Party branch secretaries were created from the outstanding migrant workers, 61,000 village reserve forces were cultivated, and more than 20,000 Party members were developed, providing a strong guarantee for winning the war against poverty and implementing the strategy of rural revitalization.
Well-off is not well-off, the key is to look at the villagers.
Since the reform and opening up, a large number of young and middle-aged laborers in China's rural areas have gone out to work to increase their income, and some have set up their own enterprises through hard work.
But objectively, it also leads to the "hollowing out" of rural areas to varying degrees, especially the weakening of rural grass-roots organizations. Village Party branch secretaries and Party members present the characteristics of "one old and one low," that is, aging, low education, and the leading ranks of village Party organizations are not strong, and the problems of youth and youth are not prominent.
If the rural talents and other elements have been flowing to the cities in one direction, and the villages have been in the state of "blood loss" and "anemia" for a long time, revitalization is an empty word.
To attract back migrant workers who are capable, aware and interested in serving their hometowns, to guide them to return to their hometowns and start their own businesses to become leaders in getting rich, to train Party members and rural cadres on merit, and to enrich the ranks of cadres at the grass-roots level. This is the basic policy to solve the problem that the ranks of rural Party members and grass-roots Party organizations are not connected with each other.
Excellent migrant workers can be brought back, but also let them stay and do well.
In recent years, Sichuan has started by paying close attention to the Party building of migrant workers. On the basis of strict selection criteria, Sichuan has established such institutional mechanisms as targeted referral, service guarantee, training and energy promotion, and selection and use of outstanding migrant workers, so that they can improve their abilities, secure their work and have hope in life, truly take root in the countryside, and have a sense of accomplishment in starting their own businesses.
This year marks the end of the decisive battle against poverty. Talent is a key factor in connecting poverty alleviation efforts with rural revitalization.
Party committees and governments at all levels should attach great importance to the group of outstanding migrant workers returning to their hometowns. Through comprehensive measures, they should be made into a working team and a fresh force that can be retained, can fight and cannot be taken away, so as to provide a strong organizational guarantee and talent support for rural poverty alleviation and development and rejuvenation.
Because of the epidemic situation, this year's college graduates are a very special class. On the evening of July 11, the summer graduation song of bilibili will bring a special live online performance to the graduates. Old Wolf, Park Shu, Li Yuchun, Mao Yi and other musicians will send songs and blessings to the fresh graduates.
Well-known up master SealWu Yifan also brought "Weeds," a rap style song based on Lu Xun's collection of prose poems of the same name, which is extremely popular among young people.
Because of the pandemic, many graduates failed to appreciate the ritual of plucking ears and teaching degree cards on the spot, so they shifted the ritual to the online.
According to the data, the 2.5-hour-long song will have a peak popularity of more than 35 million people.
"Follow your own heart, seize the opportunity, regardless of the consequences, but sometimes there will be unexpected gains."
Although it is a graduation song, many songs also moved the non-fresh graduates.
"I really want to cry when I look at the whole scene. Everyone's youth is full of good things and regrets, but they are all worth remembering. All of them should be brave enough to go on."
Beijing's Natural Ecology Continues to Attract More Than 500 Species of Wild Animals to "Settle" in City - CNN.com

Capital's Natural Ecology Continues to Attract Wild Animals to "Settle" Cities
There are more than 500 species of wild animals in Beijing
This newspaper (reporter Wang Bin) Beijing Youth Daily reporter learned from the Municipal Landscaping Bureau that in recent years, with the continuous improvement of the natural ecological environment in the capital, the species and number of wild animals have also continued to increase.
At present, the number of terrestrial vertebrate wild animals living in Beijing has increased to more than 500 species, including brown horse chickens, black storks and other national-level protected animals, as well as impala, whooper swan, gray crane, mandarin duck and other national-level protected animals.
Whether it is planted in an urban forest in the Second Ring Road or a small wetland embedded between buildings, it not only brings the wild interest of nature to the citizens of the capital, but also attracts wild animals to "settle" in the city.
In the middle of summer, the Songshan National Nature Reserve, located in the Yanshan Mountains in the northwest of Yanqing District, is full of vitality.
A raccoon was playing leisurely by a mountain stream, while two badgers were fighting with each other.
In retrospect, a wild boar could not resist the "prickly scratches" on its body and was rubbing against the bark. Hu Qiaoli, director of the Songshan National Nature Reserve Administration, said that by the end of 2019,178 species of wild animals, including the golden eagle, the spoon chicken and the impala, were living in this green sea with a total area of more than 6,200 hectares. Nearly one-third of the wild animal species in the city can be seen here.
"In Matsuyama, wild animals are the real'owners' and our staff can only be regarded as the'bodyguards' of others at best."
Hu Qiaoli said that in order to understand the wildlife situation in the protected area on the ground, more than 30 professional patrol team members patrol along 16 carefully formulated protection routes every day. There will also be a "big circle" once a month, and they will spend a whole day almost walking through the whole protected area.
"During the inspection, it is necessary not only to check and record the biodiversity, but also to check the installation of artificial bird nests, rescue injured wild animals, install infrared cameras in the field and so on."
More than 200 infrared cameras have been installed in the Songshan National Nature Reserve to record the living conditions of wild animals in the forest.
Hu Qiaoli said that with the increasing biodiversity of the protected areas in recent years, more and more wild animals have appeared in the camera. Ocelots, raccoons and pigs and badgers have become "resident guests," and the "appearance rate" of the impala, a Grade II protected animal of the state, has become higher and higher.
Zhang Zhiming, director of the wildlife and wetland protection department of Beijing Landscaping Bureau, said that the number of terrestrial vertebrate wild animals in Beijing has increased from 461 in 1994 to more than 500 now, and the species and number of wild animals in Beijing have continued to increase in recent years.
The presence of wild animals in cities is becoming more and more common, which is closely related to the escalation of urban greening in the capital city in recent years.
In particular, a new round of afforestation and afforestation of one million mu, which began in 2018, proposes to reshape the urban ecological environment, enhance the ecological function of forestland and green space, and highlight the concept of "near nature."
Planning strives to interconnect and interact with the surrounding green areas, making it easier for wild animals to "visit friends and relatives," and planting trees that are the animals' favorite source of honey and food plants.
Black Land "Planted" for Agricultural Modernization - Xinhuanet
Harbin, July 26,2020/PRNewswire/-- Black land "planted" to modernize agriculture.
In midsummer, two spraying planes skimmed the 10,000-acre high-yield demonstration field at the Second Operating Station of the Fifth Management Area of Friendship Farm, forming two white lines. In the green field, the words "the world's first field" planted with black rice seedlings stood out in large letters.
Kong Lingqiang, the station manager, said the aircraft could spray more than 6,000 acres of arable land a day, with an efficiency of about eight times that of an unmanned aerial vehicle and hundreds of times that of a human.
This farm is located in the Friendship County of Heilongjiang Province, the largest grain producing province in China. From the sound of "swish" rice cutting in the past to the sound of "rumble" in the present, traditional Chinese farming and farming have transformed in this black soil belt.
In addition to airplanes, satellites are also used in the modern agricultural production of Friendship Farm.
According to Kong Lingqiang, on the one hand, they use satellite remote sensing technology to achieve accurate fertilization, reduce agricultural input and reduce pollution. On the other hand, satellite navigation technology can improve the standard operation level of agricultural machinery in the field.
In the course of this year's rice production, the farm expanded the operating area of satellite navigation unmanned transplanting technology from 3,000 mu last year to 30,000 mu.
This technology makes the planting of seedlings more uniform, maximizes the use of sunlight and arable land resources, and saves 16 yuan per acre in labor costs.
Farms have experimented with new technologies such as informatization and intelligentization in agricultural production, forming the largest cluster of agricultural machinery in China from the ground to the sky.
According to statistics, the total amount of farm machinery is 49,000 units (pieces), and the comprehensive mechanization rate in the field is 99.8%.
The operation of agricultural machinery realizes 100% GPS satellite navigation, 100% precision sowing in dryland and 100% high-powered locomotive operation in dryland.
"Green agriculture, smart agriculture and digital agriculture are the pathfinding directions for agricultural modernization."
Said Liu Hualian, director of Friendship Farm.
The key to agricultural modernization lies in scientific and technological progress.
In recent years, Heilongjiang Agricultural Reclamation, represented by farms, has played an exemplary and leading role in modernizing large agricultural "aircraft carriers," and initially established a modern agricultural industry system dominated by large-scale planting, standardized production, and industrial management.
On the outskirts of Friendship County, there is an agricultural machinery expo park covering an area of 350,000 square meters.
More than 140 sets (pieces) of agricultural machinery and tools introduced and used by Heilongjiang Agricultural Reclamation over the years are on display here.
These agricultural machinery and farms have witnessed the development of China's agricultural modernization.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, July 26,2008Subject: She Xiaojia for Everyone - Anhui Hefei Jiang Kou He Lianwei Mass Transfer Direct Attack
Xinhua News Agency reporters Chen Shangying, Wang Liwu and Liu Xia Cun
At 4 p.m. on July 25, Fu Kunbao, dressed in mud-covered galoshes, went to the back of the house and went back and forth with his wife, Zhou Yan, to pick up their belongings.
"I was still gathering grass in the field when I received a call from the village cadres asking for a transfer."
Fu Kunbao said that he has transferred more than 60 acres of land and planted rice, and is now growing well. "Yesterday, he took medicine, and his tools and everything have not been cleaned up," he said.
Fu Kunbao pointed to the pesticide sprayer placed in the corner. "No one wants their home to be flooded, so let's make a small home for everyone."
In order to cope with the continuous high water pressure and possible heavy rainfall in Chaohu Lake, Hefei City, Anhui Province, is preparing to open the Jiangkou River Lianwei, where Fu Kun Baojia is located, on the 26th for flood storage.
Jiang Kou He Lianwei is located in Feixi County, adjacent to Chaohu Causeway.
There are thousands of villagers involved in Yan Dian Township and Sanhe Town in Wei who need to be transferred.
As of 16:00 on the 25th, the water level of Chaohu Lake, the fifth largest freshwater lake in China, remained at a high of 13.2 meters, exceeding the guaranteed water level by 0.7 meters.
Fu Kun Bao's kitchen was clean, with a pot of pumpkin heads on the table, eggs and some halogen in the fridge.
"I didn't expect to move. The water in Jiang Kou River is looking good at the moment."
Zhou Yan said that the family home is a bungalow, and some large objects have not yet figured out where to put them.
"First, pack up your valuables. Large items such as refrigerators and TV sets can be temporarily placed in the homes of neighbors or relatives on high ground."
Wang Li, a village cadre, gave Fu Kun Bao his advice.
Wang Liwen is responsible for the transfer and resettlement of 13 villagers, one household notice, confirming the resettlement plan for each individual.
The nearest settlement to Fu Kun Baojia is Su Primary School in Yan Dian Township, which is about 2 kilometers away.
In addition to the large pieces, Fu Kunbao and his wife also had a headache of more than 1,000 kilograms of grain and some new furniture.
"The food is ready to be dragged to relatives' houses, and there is no way to move the furniture."
As soon as the couple discussed it, they put a stool under the newly bought bed and raised the bed by about half a meter.
At 6:00 pm, Fu Kunbao began to use a tricycle to transport things to relatives' homes, and Zhou Yan continued to tidy up at home.
At 11 o'clock in the evening, the couple looked at the front and back of the house, pulled on the electric switch, and prepared to go to the settlement.
"I hope the water will recede soon."
Fu Kunbao said.
At 9:30 a.m. on July 26, the reporter saw at the scene of Jiang Kou Helianwei that the local area had made all the preparations before the flood.
Zhang Ji Colin's Small House Team Strengthens Muscular Teenagers - Xinhuanet
The sports youth hot-blooded competition show "Sports Bar Youth" was officially launched on Hunan Satellite TV on July 11.
Sports leader Zhang Jike and sports assistant Lin Xiaozhai crossed the same stage. Lin Dan and Fu Yuanhui commented on their respective styles, while the hardcore of the "behemoth" like power rod pulling device came on the stage, making the program "burning" full of power.
In the first episode, 11 sports teenagers appeared on the power track, stunning the spectators at the same time, the "strong conflict," "strong confrontation" and "strong heart" on the athletic stage also received attention.
Among them, "Strong Conflict" came from Super A sports student Qiao Wenyi, who openly provoked Xu Zhibin, who is known as "Flower Beauty Man" on the same track before the race, to choke on Xu Zhibin's appearance condition that he should go to sing and dance programs, and even let out the harsh words "Don't spend your makeup crying if you lose."
A remark made the teenagers and sports leaders on the court gasp.
While "Strong Confrontation" is more like a fairy fight, Sun Jian Qi, known as "The Great Devil," meets Zhang Xindong, who is also strong, and stages a Strong Confrontation.
And their identities are unexpected. Sun Jian Qi is a fitness-loving actor, while Zhang Xindong is a retired Special Warfare member and a three-time recipient of the Warrior Medal.
At the beginning of the competition, the two teenagers tried their best to pull out the small pole quickly, and the enduring confrontation on the big pole made the spectators sweat for them.
Under the tense conditions, Zhang Jike, as one of the sports leaders of "Sports Bar Youth," was also watching the game carefully.
In the commentary session, he was also very careful, patiently encouraging the teenager who lost the match and helping every mistake point in the process of resuming the match.
And athletic assistant Lin Xiaozhai is a fancy assist, and she makes no secret of her appreciation for the teenagers whose face value is on line.
When learning about the overloaded daily training of sports teenagers, it is even more admirable.
Lin Dan and Fu Yuanhui, who are also sports leaders, have their own styles. One is a "seer" with a sense of calm, while the other is a "flood girl" who uses a smile to disperse the tension.
In addition, Ji Ke Meaningyi and Liu Ye, as sports assistants, also created a lot of laughs around sports teenagers.
Church fire in Nantes, France: Parish volunteer pleads guilty to arson for being kind and taciturn
According to foreign media reports, on July 18, the famous Cathedral of St. Peter and St. Paul, a gem of religious and historical buildings in Nantes, France, was severely damaged in a fire, and the grand organ was completely destroyed.
On the 26th, local time, prosecutors in Nantes announced that a parish volunteer in charge of the defense of the cathedral had been indicted on charges of "arson and destruction."
He has admitted that he lit the fire in the church.
Local prosecutor Cenas said the 39-year-old parish volunteer from Rwanda admitted to lighting fires in three places in the cathedral during the night.
The man's lawyer said that the arsonist now regretted doing such a thing.
The man entered France a few years ago by way of asylum, and was sheltered in the parish where the fire broke out, and taken in in the church.
Prosecutors pointed out that recently, he tried to renew his visa and was talking to the police department about it.
But the church said it still could not believe that the usually kind, smiling, but not very talkative believer would destroy the church he loved so much.
On July 18, the day the fire broke out, the volunteer had already been questioned by the police because of illogical problems in his narration, but he was later released.
The picture shows firefighters carrying out rescue at the scene.
On the evening of the 25th, the man was arraigned again because the professional engineers of the Paris Central Police Laboratory had obtained new evidence.
This time, the man confessed to the act of arson.
The suspect could face up to 10 years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros if convicted of intentionally setting fire to the property, according to reports.
The fire caused severe damage to St. Pierre and St. Paul's Cathedral, where the organ was completely destroyed and the stained glass windows behind the organ were also severely damaged, the report said.
Brunet, the chief architect of France's historic buildings, said it was a conservative estimate that the restoration of Nantes Cathedral would take at least three years.
Comprehensive news: Us unilateralism undermines bilateral relations International public opinion supports China's countermeasures against the US - Xinhuanet
Beijing, July 26,2020/PRNewswire/-- On the morning of July 24, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the US Embassy in China that China has decided to revoke the license for the establishment and operation of the US Consulate General in Chengdu and put forward specific requirements for the Consulate General to cease all operations and activities.
International public opinion believes that the unilateralist measures taken by the United States have caused serious distress to the relations between China and the United States, and it is legitimate and necessary for China to respond to the unreasonable provocation by the United States and take countermeasures.
Andrés Borques, director of the China Studies Center at the Institute of International Studies at the University of Chile, said the unilateralist measures by the United States have undermined the bridge of understanding between the Chinese and American people and caused a crisis in the relations between the two major powers.
China's notice to the United States to close its consulate in Chengdu is a countermeasure to the unilateral measures taken by the United States and is in line with diplomatic practice.
Patricio Giusto, a professor at the Catholic University of Argentina and director of the Center for Arab-Chinese Studies, believes that China's decision is a legitimate and necessary countermeasure to previous US provocations, and is not aimed at ordinary Americans.
By pressuring China to cover up its poor response to the coronavirus pandemic, the United States is trying to divert the attention of Americans.
Bambang Suryono, chairman of the Asian Innovation Research Center, an Indonesian think tank, said that the provocative diplomatic posture of the United States has caused serious distress to the relations between China and the United States, and the bilateral relations face serious challenges.
China's notice to the United States to close its consulate in Chengdu is a normal countermeasure and conforms to diplomatic practice. It not only reflects China's principled position of resolutely safeguarding its own interests, but also reflects China's reasonable and advantageous diplomacy.
Tanzanian commentator Francis Semwinza said China's decision was a legitimate and necessary response to the US provocation.
For China-US relations to return to normal, the US should take the initiative to improve its relations with China and stop interfering in China's internal affairs.
The United States should focus on how to achieve win-win economic and political outcomes with China, and how to benefit the two peoples and the entire international community.
Ali Youssef, executive director of the Sudan-based Federation of Arab-Chinese Friendship Associations, said the countermeasures China was forced to take were a legitimate and necessary response to the unreasonable actions of the US, in line with international law and basic norms governing international relations, as well as diplomatic practices.
Earlier, the US called for the closure of the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, seriously violating international law and basic norms governing international relations.
It is hoped that the US side will rescind the previous decision and create necessary conditions for the relations between the two countries to return to normal.
Singapore's Lianhe Zaobao newspaper said in an editorial that the greater strategic intention of the United States is to contain China and prevent China from rising further.
In the face of the United States' step-by-step pressure, China is reluctant to see the relationship between China and the United States continue to deteriorate, but has to take countermeasures.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 26 (Reporter Mao Xin) learned from the Guangdong Coast Guard Bureau that recently, the bureau, together with the Guangzhou Customs and Public Security Department, cracked down on an extra-large oil smuggling ring, and preliminarily verified that the gang had smuggled about 120,000 tons of refined oil since 2019, with a case value of about 800 million yuan and tax evasion of about 240 million yuan.
The Guangdong Coast Guard Bureau and the anti-smuggling department of the Customs have gradually worked out the division of labor and organization structure of the gang.
On July 8, the coast guard, customs and public security departments carried out a unified collection network operation in Guangzhou, Foshan and other places as well as the Pearl River Estuary waters respectively, and seized four suspected smuggling ships on the spot. A total of 4,700 tons of refined oil products were seized from the ships and oil depots involved in the case, and a batch of funds accounts were frozen.
It is understood that the joint operation involved a total of 8 ships and 2 helicopters, divided into multiple action groups to coordinate operations and carry out a full-chain crackdown on smuggling at sea and illegal operations on land. All 35 major criminal suspects were present in the case.
At present the case is under further investigation.
The relevant person in charge of the Guangdong Coast Guard Bureau said that in the future, it will continue to maintain a high-pressure posture, crack down on all kinds of illegal and criminal smuggling activities at sea, and maintain good order in the waters under its jurisdiction.
Hurricane Hannah Makes Landfall in Texas or Causes River Surge and Flash Floods - CBS Los Angeles
July 26 (UPI) -- Hurricane Hannah made landfall in the U.S. state of Texas at 5 p.m. local time, bringing strong winds, heavy rain, swollen rivers and potentially life-threatening flash floods.
The National Hurricane Center said Hurricane Hannah is expected to bring heavy rain across parts of southern and northeastern Texas, which could lead to some swollen streams and life-threatening flash flooding.
The worst affected by Hurricane Hannah is south of Corpus Christi to the mouth of the Rio Grande River, while widespread flash flooding is possible in the Rio Grande Valley, the report said.
"Any hurricane is a huge challenge," Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said on Friday.
Thirty-two counties in the state are under a state of disaster emergency because of the hurricane.
Corpus Christi, a city of more than 320,000 people, has closed its libraries and museums, leaving residents waiting in the wings.
Abbott also said the hurricane cannot be allowed to inflict more casualties on Texas at a time when the state is being hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic.
According to reports, 6 to 12 inches of rain is expected to fall in southern Texas overnight on the 26th, and 3 to 5 inches of rain will fall in northern Texas and coastal Louisiana.
Due to global warming and other factors, "Hannah" formed earlier than previous Atlantic hurricane seasons.
Typically, the first hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean do not form until mid-August.
Poland to withdraw from European treaty to prevent violence against women
Poland will take steps next week to withdraw from the European Treaty on the Prevention of Violence against Women, the Ministry of Justice said Saturday.
Poland's right-wing government cabinet said the treaty, which requires schools to teach students about gender issues, trampled on the rights of parents.
At a news conference, Poland's justice minister, Gioblo, said his ministry would ask the Ministry of Labor and Family on Monday to begin withdrawing from the treaty.
That treaty is also known as the Istanbul Convention.
"The treaty contains elements of what we consider to be harmful meanings and morphological properties," Gioblo said.
Poland's ruling Law and Justice party and its coalition partners are closely allied with the Roman Catholic Church and advocate a conservative social agenda.
Polish President Andrzej Duda has made hostility to gay rights one of his main issues during his successful re-election campaign this month.
On Friday, tens of thousands of Poles, mostly women, protested in Warsaw and other cities against the withdrawal of the convention.
"The purpose of withdrawing from the treaty is to decriminalize domestic violence," Lempart, one of the organizers of the protest, said at a protest march in Warsaw.
Some protesters carried banners that read "Law and Justice is a hell for women."
The Law and Justice Party has long complained about the Istanbul Convention.
Poland's previous centrist government ratified the pact in 2015.
The Law and Justice government has said the treaty does not respect religion and requires liberal social policies to be taught in schools.
So far, however, the party has not decided to withdraw from the convention.

The Ka-52M will greatly improve its performance in reconnaissance, communications and weapons.
According to a recent report by the Russian newspaper Izvestia, Wuzhi Ka-52M is named "Super Alligator," and its development contract was signed by the Russian military and military industrial units in April last year. At present, the first two upgraded versions of Wuzhi are undergoing renovation and retooling at the Far East Helicopter Factory of the Russian "Progressive" Aerospace Corporation, and its state-level testing and improvement finishing work will be completed by October 2022.
According to the Russian experts who understand the above upgrade work, the "predecessor" of "Super Alligator" - Wuzhi Ka-52 was officially installed in November 2011. The model has exposed some weaknesses in its use, and this upgrade is to "fill the short board."
The report said that compared with the Ka-52, the Ka-52M will partially adopt a new type of protective material that will not increase its weight, and its pilot cockpit will be reinforced and equipped with new equipment to resist missile attacks, thus increasing the probability of battlefield survival; it will be equipped with a more powerful generator to power more complex airborne electronic equipment; the photoelectric system will be upgraded to be able to detect and identify battlefield targets that are farther apart; the new light multi-purpose missile equipped with the main attack armored fighting vehicles and reinforced concrete fortifications will have a range of 20 kilometers, which is about 1 times higher than the range of similar missiles used by the Russian military in active service; and its defense weapons and communication equipment will be used to the maximum extent possible with Mi-28NM gunship helicopters that can attack air targets, thus making the related maintenance easier and more economical.
In addition, the Ka-52M will have more advanced electronic guidance systems, weapon sighting systems and navigation equipment.
Russian experts also said that it is noteworthy that the Ka-52M will be equipped with communication equipment to communicate with UAVs, so as to obtain real-time information transmitted by nearby UAVs in the air, such as displaying the images taken by UAVs on the cockpit screen of the helicopter.
According to the plan, the pilots of the Ka-52M can directly control the UAVs with which they cooperate, thus improving the pilots' grasp of the battlefield situation and guidance of the long-range missiles.
According to Russian media reports, Russian Deputy Defense Minister Mikhail Krivoruchko said in December last year that the Russian Defense Ministry plans to purchase more than 110 Wuzhi Ka-52M aircraft by 2027.

1.75 billion cubic meters of ecological water replenishment for rivers and lakes in Hebei since the beginning of this year - Zhongxin
Xinhua News Agency Shijiazhuang on July 26 (reporter Wang Kun) reporter learned from the Hebei Provincial Water Conservancy Department that since this year, Hebei Province has made overall use of river water and local reservoirs, and implemented ecological water replenishment to 28 rivers and Baiyangdian such as Hutuo River, Tanghe River and Juma River, and completed a total of 1.75 billion cubic meters of ecological water replenishment in rivers and lakes.
Hebei Province firmly grasped the favorable opportunity of increasing the flow of water to the middle line of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project, and carried out ecological water replenishment to the Tanghe River, Shahe River, Shulong River and other rivers by using the diversion water.
At the same time, nine large and medium-sized reservoirs, including West Ocean and Dongwushi, and Baiyangdian, were used to carry out ecological water replenishment to Fuyang River, Qinglong River and other rivers, forming a total surface area of more than 90 square kilometers.
In order to do a good job in ecological water replenishment, the Hebei Provincial Water Conservancy Department actively organizes the investigation, remediation and reinforcement of hidden dangers in water replenishment rivers and the cleaning of river channels, refines the practical measures and strengthens the inspection and management.
Through supervision and inspection and centralized surreptitious visits, all kinds of problems were solved in a timely manner, which ensured the safe and orderly replenishment of the river.
According to the relevant person in charge of Hebei Provincial Water Conservancy Department, the orderly implementation of ecological water replenishment of rivers and lakes has effectively restored the ecological environment of rivers and lakes in Hebei Province, promoted the replenishment and conservation of groundwater along the river, greatly improved the living environment and the environment for economic development along the river, and is of great significance to the realization of the goal of "clear water, green banks, smooth rivers and beautiful scenery" for the management and protection of rivers and lakes.
(Deutsche Welle) In the past two weeks, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Spain has rebounded sharply, with thousands of new cases reported in several days.
The British government made a provisional decision on Saturday evening (25 July) to remove Spain from the safe travel list from 00:00 local time on 26 July. People entering the UK from Spain will have to quarantine for 14 days.
British holidaymakers in Spain have expressed surprise, worry and even anger at the decision, as the news came out of the blue.
British Transport Secretary Grant Shapps is also reported to be holidaying in Spain.
Before the UK issued its quarantine measures, Norway had also announced a 10-day quarantine for people returning to Norway from Spain.
France and Belgium have advised their residents to abandon their plans for a holiday in Barcelona and the surrounding area ahead.
Beaches in these areas were so crowded that social distancing could not be maintained, and at one point the police needed to take measures to reduce the number of beachgoers.
Tourism is an important pillar industry in Spain
Spain: It's safe here
In response to the UK's decision, Spain's foreign ministry said on Sunday that the epidemic situation in the country was under control.
"Spain is safe, not only for Spaniards, but also for tourists," Arancha González Laya, Spain's foreign minister, told the media.
The Spanish government will try to persuade the British government to exclude the Balearic Islands and Canary Islands from the quarantine measures.
The reason is that the infection rate in these two tourist destinations is much lower than in the UK mainland.
In order to prevent the spread of the epidemic, the Catalonia region of Spain has also reinstated the "foot-ban."
Tourism is an important pillar industry in Spain, which is one of the most popular holiday destinations for British tourists.
The UK's decision is expected to hit Spain's tourism industry hard.

First day of mid-volt: Beijing takes a break from heat and heat to start rainfall mode - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency in Beijing on July 26 (reporter Ni Yuanjin) July 26 is the first day of this year's "mid-volt."
The convective weather of high winds and showers in the early morning of the 26th dispersed the heat and heat that had enveloped the Beijing area for several days, and a new round of rainy weather will last for several days.
The Beijing Meteorological Observatory announced at 11:00 on the 26th that there were scattered showers (accompanied by weak thunder and lightning) in Beijing on the 26th, and the daily maximum temperature was only 27 degrees Celsius; the night was overcast with light to moderate rain (accompanied by weak thunder and lightning), and the night minimum temperature was 23 degrees Celsius.
In the previous 24 to 25 days, the whole city of Beijing was under a high temperature blue warning. The daily maximum temperature in most areas was around 37 degrees Celsius, and the local high temperature was above 40 degrees Celsius.
Fu Tian is the hottest, humid and sultry day of the year. There are "three volts" in a year, and the hottest is in the middle volt. The Chinese people say "bitter summer" at this time.
At the time of the fall, the family filled the barn, and there was a folk saying of "one volt dumpling and two volt noodles."
According to the current forecast, it will be cloudy and rainy in Beijing for the next three days.
The meteorological department advised the public to minimize mountain play and to guard against geological disasters.
It is understood that this year's "mid-volt" will last for 20 days, starting from July 26 and ending on August 14.
After entering the "mid-volt," people will feel weak and lose their appetite.
Diet can choose mung beans, barley and other foods with heat relief, spleen appetizer effect, as well as bitter vegetables, balsam pear and other bitter food, can help to increase appetite and eliminate summer qi.
FAA scrambles to check 2,000 Boeing jets for possible engine stall - Xinhua
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an emergency airworthiness directive on the 24th, requiring an emergency inspection of about 2,000 Boeing 737 NG and 737 Classic airliners registered in the United States. The reason is that the air check valve of these airliners is corroded and may cause the engines to stop in the air.
The FAA said it has so far received four reports of 737 NG and 737 Classic aircraft engines stopping in the air, prompting an urgent inspection request for airliners that have been parked for seven days or more and those that have flown fewer than 11 times since they were put back into service.
The FAA warned that the fifth stage check valve on all two engines of the airliner, if corroded, could become stuck in the open position, causing the airliner to lose power completely and not be able to restart its engines.
The aviation regulator ordered that if the check valve is found to be corroded, the airline operator must replace the critical component before the airliner can be put into service again.
Boeing responded later in the day that the coronavirus outbreak had reduced travel demand, leaving many airliners mothballed or less in use, and "the check valve is more susceptible to corrosion."
At the same time, Boeing said it has advised airline operators to inspect the airliners involved in the directive. If problems are found, Boeing will provide assistance in overhauling and replacing the check valves.
The Associated Press reported that major U.S. carriers typically fly multiple flights in a day, but after the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, a large number of airliners were grounded. With the recent slow growth in demand for passenger travel, some airliners are back in service.
The FAA did not release the details of the four air parking reports.
Alaska Airlines disclosed one of the incidents later on the 24th.
The airline operator said in a statement that one of its airliners was en route from Seattle, Washington, to Austin, Texas, on July 15 when one of its engines suddenly stalled and the airliner made a successful emergency landing at Austin Airport.
Alaska Airlines said it had replaced the plane's engines and had inspected the engines of six airliners as directed by the Federal Aviation Administration.
American Airlines, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines said on the 24th that their airliners did not have engine stalls associated with the air check valve.
Four American Airlines jets will be inspected and 28 United Airlines jets will be inspected.
Delta Air Lines said it would inspect 20 of its jets, but did not say whether there had been any engine stalls.
The FAA's emergency airworthiness directive is another blow to Boeing, according to multiple media reports.
Indonesia's Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines each crashed a Boeing 737 MAX in October 2018 and March 2019, killing a combined 346 people.
The series of airliners were subsequently grounded worldwide, with production halted in January and resuming in May.
FAA Administrator Steve Dickson admitted in June that the FAA had "erred" in its oversight of Boeing over the 737 MAX.

It was revealed that among the "knowledge sharing officers" were outstanding young teachers such as Li Yongle, a middle school physics teacher affiliated to Renmin University of China, Zhang Xuefeng, a famous postgraduate examination instructor, and Wang Lei, a history teacher with ten years of professional experience. They will show the "hardcore" knowledge of various subjects to the audience in unexpected ways.
In addition, the program also invited economics professor Xue Zhaofeng as the "knowledge initiator" of the program, and joined forces with "Ding Dong teaching assistant" Du Haitao and Jin Mengjia to talk about youth with the audience and create an "open lesson for youth for all."
Chief Secretary for Administration of Hong Kong SAR Government: The situation is grim and all efforts are being made to fight the epidemic - CNN.com
Hong KONG, July 26,2020/PRNewswire/-- Chief Secretary for Administration of the Hong Kong SAR Government, Mr Matthew Cheung Kin-chung, said on July 26 that the situation of the COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong continues to be grim. If the epidemic situation deteriorates, the SAR Government will resolutely adopt more stringent control measures to further restrict the operation of business premises and reduce the space for people to go out.
But at this stage, the SAR government has no intention to introduce a "stay-at-home order" or a "foot-ban" to restrict people from going out.
On the same day, Zhang Jianzong published an online blog entitled "The Situation Is Grim and Fighting the Epidemic with All Its Power."
He said that this wave of the epidemic is the most severe in six months, and the next two weeks will be critical to try to prevent the virus from spreading further in the community.
Apart from the necessary measures taken by the SAR Government, it is also very important for citizens to be self-disciplined and cooperative.
He urged the public to stay at home as much as possible, reduce social contact and eat out.
Members of the public should cooperate with the mandatory wearing of face masks to protect themselves and others, and pay attention to personal and environmental hygiene and frequent hand washing. They should also suspend non-essential family and friends gatherings or dinners and reduce their visits to the market.
He said that the central government has always been very concerned about the changes in the epidemic situation in Hong Kong and supported the anti-epidemic work of the SAR government. He also responded positively to the latest request of the Chief Executive, and provided assistance in increasing the testing capacity and retrofitting AsiaWorld-Expo into a "square cabin hospital" like this one.
Mr Cheung said that the free virus testing provided by the HKSAR Government for specific high-risk groups, namely elderly care homes, disabled care homes and nursing home staff, restaurant staff, taxi drivers and property management staff, has been fully rolled out, involving up to 400,000 people.
He is very concerned about the cases of infection in residential care homes for the elderly. The SAR Government has arranged a specific temporary quarantine centre for residential care homes for the elderly.
He said that the HKSAR Government is building an isolation and quarantine facility near the Penny's Bay Quarantine Centre on Lantau Island in the New Territories, which is expected to provide an additional 700 isolation units by the end of September.
The Chief Executive also announced on the 19th that the HKSAR Government will build an additional 2,000 isolation rooms at the Penny's Bay Quarantine Centre and aim to complete them by the end of this year.
Together with the 800 isolation and quarantine centres already in use, Penny's Bay Quarantine Centre is expected to provide a total of 3,500 isolation rooms by the end of the year.
Hong Kong currently has four quarantine centres in operation, providing a total of about 2,600 isolation rooms.
In addition, the Lei Yue Mun Park Resort on Hong Kong Island was re-opened by the SAR Government on the 24th as a community isolation facility for the treatment of patients under the age of 50 with independent self-care capacity.
The "Nutrition Agent" in the History of the Party and the History of New China - Zhongxin
2020-07-26 17:37:29 Source: People's Forum Network Author: Zhu Yanjing Responsible Editor: Zhu Yanjing
During a recent visit to the Siping Battle Memorial Hall, General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed that "1.4 billion people and more than 90 million Party members, especially leading cadres at all levels, should learn the history of the Communist Party of China and the history of New China."
Earnestly studying the history of the Party and the history of New China is a compulsory course for Party members and cadres not to forget their original intentions and keep in mind their mission. They should draw rich nourishment from it, cultivate a strong sense of family and country, and take the Long March road well in the new era.
A magnificent history of the Party and New China records the hard work and glorious course of the Communist Party of China since its birth, demonstrating the faith and loyalty forged by the Communists with their lives and blood, and the original intention and mission they will always adhere to.
History is the best textbook, and for Party members and cadres, the history of the Party and the history of New China are the brightest chapters in this textbook.
Every Party member and cadre should constantly strengthen the historical thinking of taking history as a lesson and moving into the future, base on the new journey and new mission, take up the "baton" of the times, and walk the Long March of the current generation well.
To forge the soul with history, and to adhere to the original mission in studying the history of the Party and the history of New China.
Turning to the history of the Party and the history of New China, it is full of the Chinese Communists' unchangeable original mission and rock-solid faith, demonstrating the simple feeling that the Communists will always be with the people.
To understand the history of the Party, the important events in the history of New China, the important meetings and the important figures up close is not only an intuitive shock to the soul and a baptism of thought, but also to understand the connotation of the original belief from the depths of the soul and to know the weight of the mission.
For Party members and cadres, if they want to constantly sharpen their original mission and maintain their advanced character, they must find the origin and the fulcrum of our original intention from the history of the Party and the history of New China, maintain a clear understanding and firm position, stir up the strength to work hard for the country and the people, and ensure that the red rivers and mountains laid down by the revolutionary forefathers with their blood and lives will be passed down from generation to generation.
It is wise to study history and inherit the lofty spirit in studying the history of the Party and the history of New China.
Since the founding of the Communist Party of China, it has shaped the spirit of the Red Ship, the spirit of Jinggangshan, the spirit of the Long March, the spirit of Yan'an, the spirit of resistance to war, the spirit of Xibaipo, the spirit of "two bullets and one star," the spirit of spaceflight and other great spirits.
These great spirits, precipitated by history, provide a powerful spiritual incentive for our Party to overcome all kinds of risks and challenges on the way forward. They are precious spiritual treasures that cannot be broken down, washed away or robbed.
The process of studying the history of the Party and the history of China is a process of revisiting these spirits and shaping the spirit of self. We should consciously take the lofty spirit of the revolutionary forefathers as the mirror, adhere to the spiritual homeland of the Communists, build a solid spiritual foundation for advancing the great cause and realizing the great dream, and carry forward these spirits, so as to radiate the light of the new era.
Reading history introspectively, in studying the history of the Party and the history of New China, there is a constant effort to rectify and eliminate evil spirits.
For Party members and cadres, there has never been a period of history that can bring more profound warning, enlightenment and reference than the history of the Party and the history of New China.
In the history of the Party and the history of New China, we can not only see the great deeds of the older generation of revolutionaries who were determined to dedicate themselves to their faith and persevered in their efforts to achieve the set goals, but also see the profound lessons of certain figures who were shaken by their ideals and beliefs and came to the opposite side of the revolution, enlightening and warning us to never stop and never slack off with firm determination and will, to always maintain a strong and energetic spirit of struggle, and to constantly purify the Party's character and cultivate self-discipline.
To truly become a firm believer and faithful practitioner of the lofty ideals of communism, we need to brush off the "dust" of our thoughts and strictly prevent "dirt" from staining our bodies. The history of the Party and the history of New China should be the basis for every Party member and cadre to examine themselves and warn themselves.
Knowing the history inspirational, in studying the history of the Party and the history of New China, we have the courage to choose the important task of the times.
General Secretary Xi Jinping once pointed out: "Studying the history of the Party and the country is a compulsory course for upholding and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics and pushing forward the various undertakings of the Party and the state."
Looking back on history and inquiring about the original intention, in order to continue the glory and move forward into the future.
Every Party member and cadre should take the study of the history of the Party and the history of New China as a lifelong pursuit, constantly set the course of life in the course of study, take the historical mission, take responsibility and take the initiative in their respective jobs.
Adhering to the reference and guidance of the advanced deeds of the older generation of revolutionaries, constantly polishing the political character of the Communists, maintaining the attitude of striving for the future and making progress, and the spirit of striving for the greater hardship and the greater progress, we will write a brilliant stroke of our own in the grand journey of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
"Plugging into the South of the River" Pursuing the Poetic "Yellow River Dream" - Zhongxin
(China's Poverty Reduction Story) "Plugging the South of the River" Pursuing the Poetic "Yellow River Dream"
China News Agency Yinchuan on July 26 (Yang Di) "Nine Complex Yellow River Miles of sand, waves and waves from the horizon."
The Yellow River, which has aroused the pride of countless literati, has given birth to the beautiful and rich plains of Ningxia. Now, Ningxia, which has the reputation of "plugging into the south of the river," is adhering to the concept of "ecological priority and green development," and pursuing the poetic "Yellow River Dream."
The "Blue Wave Dream" of River Clear Water
"The Yellow River under the whole world is rich in Ningxia," and the Yellow River flows 397 kilometers through Ningxia, which is the "mother river" of the nurturing party.
However, with the rapid advance of industrialization and urbanization, there is an imbalance between the development, utilization and management of rivers and lakes, and chaos such as excessive discharge of pollutants, construction of land around lakes and encroachment on waters has come to the fore, resulting in black and smelly water bodies, excessive water quality, dirty environment and ecological degradation.
Now, Ningxia is promoting the diversified restoration of water ecology, and striving to restore the Yellow River to its beautiful and clear waters.
Water treatment should be done from the source.
In Yinchuan, Ningxia, the local government adopted the method of "bid raising + pollution control + strict control," all sewage in industrial parks was treated centrally, all sewage treatment plants in cities and towns were discharged under the Grade A standard, and the black and smelly water bodies in urban built-up areas were basically eliminated. The third batch of China's black and smelly water model cities was successfully declared.
In addition, Ningxia fully implemented the river and lake length system in 2017, and has now achieved the full coverage of the five-level river and lake length responsibility system in rural areas, cities and counties, and river and lake length patrol has become the norm.
Gu Jincheng, 64, who lives in a village near the Yellow River, witnessed the changes in the river: "The water used to have a bad smell, and after the remediation, the bad smell was gone."
Gu Jincheng said that the ecological environment is better, and his life is more comfortable. Now he often goes to the Yellow River for a walk with his family to feel the clear water and blue sky.
The "Wetland Dream" of Sand Gull Xiang Ji
Birds, green trees, boardwalk, clear water... Fan Zhongyan's "Sand Gull Xiangji" has become a reality in the Yellow River Wetland Park in Yinchuan, Ningxia.
The Yellow River flows through Ningxia, forming a variety of wetlands such as river wetlands, lake wetlands and swamp wetlands along the way, which plays an important role in promoting the rational utilization of water resources and the balance of water ecology. At the same time, it has also become an important migratory route for birds in the world.
Since 2009, relevant departments in Ningxia have invested a total of 3.45 billion yuan in wetland protection projects. At present, Yinchuan wetland covers an area of 19,200 hectares, with a wetland protection rate of 78.5 percent. There are nearly 200 natural lakes and swamp wetlands, and there are five national wetland parks, one national urban wetland park, six autonomous region-level wetland parks, and eight municipal parks.
Lu Jinhu, deputy director of Yinchuan Wetland Conservation Center, told reporters that wetland conservation has increased biodiversity, which is particularly evident in birds. "The gull is an endangered bird, and there are only more than 20,000 in the world, of which Yinchuan Wetland is home to more than 2,000."
At the same time, Ningxia has demarcated a 500-meter red line for wetland protection areas on both sides of the Yinchuan section of the Yellow River in accordance with the law, stipulating that no unit or individual may carry out development, construction or business activities within the scope of protection, except for public welfare projects.
Zhao Shaoyong, deputy director of Yinchuan Water Conservancy Service Center, said that through the treatment of pollution sources, the comprehensive improvement of river and lake ecology and the construction of wetlands at the end, the water quality of the nine main yellow drainage ditches in Ningxia has now reached 100% Class IV standard. "Now the water is clear, the fish have swum and the flowers have blossomed."
The "Drinking Water Dream" of Prudential Huimin
Ningxia Yinchuan once had an "awkward" title: The only city along the Yellow River that "guarded the Yellow River without water to drink."
Since 2010, Yinchuan City has been facing persistent water shortage during the peak summer period. The "pain of water shortage" in the past ten years has become a painful summer experience for many high-rise residents. However, under the current situation where major water sources are at the limit of overexploitation and large areas of groundwater overexploitation funnel have been formed underground in urban areas, water shortage has become a difficult problem for Yinchuan City.
Thanks to the improvement of the water quality of the Yellow River, drinking purified water from the Yellow River has become a good solution to the problem of drinking water for local residents.
Ding Ming, deputy director of Yinchuan Water Bureau, said that in order to improve the water demand of urban and rural residents in Yinchuan, Ningxia started the water supply project on the western line of urban and rural areas in Yinchuan metropolitan area in due course, and replaced the original underground water source with high-quality Yellow River water.
"On December 29,2019, the water supply project was officially opened to the three districts of Yinchuan City. In 2020, the residents of Minning Town and Helan County also drank the water of the Yellow River."
Ding Ming said that the water conservancy department of Yinchuan will consider the transformation of regional rural drinking water and urban water supply integration as a whole. "In the next step, we will integrate all the rural decentralized water supply points into the western water supply project. It is expected that by the end of this year, the urban and rural integrated water supply in Yinchuan will be basically realized."
Compaction Responsible Departments Strengthen Flood Prevention and Disaster Relief Work - CNN.com
Compacting Responsible Departments to Strengthen Flood Prevention and Relief Work
CCTV network news (news): News from the Ministry of Water Resources, today (July 25) at 12:00, the Huaihe River main stream Wangjiaba below the super warning water level of 0.64 ~ 3.31 meters, the Yangtze River in the middle and lower reaches of the main stream Shashi below the river and the two lakes super warning water level of 0.05 ~ 2.02 meters.
Taihu Lake has lasted for 28 days since June 28, when it exceeded the warning level.
At 12 o'clock today, the average water level of Taihu Lake is 4.67 meters, exceeding the guaranteed water level by 0.02 meters.
Today, after consultation and judging, the National Defense Council decided to continue to maintain the Level II response for flood prevention on the Yangtze and Huaihe Rivers, asking all localities to compress their responsibilities and further implement the flood prevention and relief work.

Us launches first anti-subsidy investigation against China over "undervaluation of RMB exchange rate"
In response to the US Department of Commerce's recent announcement, it decided to launch an anti-dumping countervailing investigation against the tie (harness) products originating in China, and to launch an investigation into the "RMB exchange rate undervaluation" project.
China's Ministry of Commerce pointed out that this is the first time that the United States has filed an investigation into the so-called "undervaluation of RMB exchange rate" project in a countervailing case. China is firmly opposed to this.
China's Ministry of Commerce issued a special press release on the evening of the 23rd, saying that China implements a managed floating exchange rate system based on market supply and demand, with reference to a basket of currencies, and the market plays a decisive role in the formation of the exchange rate.
The press release stressed that overall, the RMB exchange rate is at a reasonable and balanced level, and has not been undervalued.
Since 2005, the RMB has appreciated by more than 17% against the US dollar.
According to the data released by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), from the beginning of 2005 to May 2020, the effective exchange rate of the RMB appreciated by 38% and the real effective exchange rate by 49%, making it the strongest currency among the G20 economies and one of the most appreciative currencies in the world.
The Ministry of Commerce pointed out that the exchange rate issue exceeded the authority of the members to conduct countervailing investigations in accordance with the WTO rules.
In February this year, the United States amended its regulations to conduct countervailing investigations on other countries' exchange rates, which has been suspected of violating WTO rules and has been opposed by many parties.
According to the press release, even under US regulations, there are numerous errors in the content of the applicant's complaint, and it does not have the necessary countervailing elements such as financial aid, grant of benefits, and specificity.
China urges the US to abide by the existing international rules and stop conducting countervailing investigations into the so-called "undervaluation of the RMB exchange rate."
As tensions between China and the United States rose further, the offshore and onshore RMB exchange rates against the U.S. dollar depreciated sharply on the 22nd, both falling below the 7.0 RMB per U.S. dollar threshold.
Whether the US Commerce Department's move is intended to push up the renminbi is a cause for concern.
The spot exchange rate of the RMB against the U.S. dollar rose above the 7.0 mark on the 23rd to close at 6.9961.
The central parity rate of the officially regulated RMB exchange rate against the U.S. dollar was lowered by 17 basis points to 6.9938 on the 24th.
With the gradual improvement of the epidemic situation, the film and television industry, which has been quiet for nearly half a year, has also gradually returned to normal.
Recently, the organizing committee of the 26th Shanghai Television Festival announced the shortlist of this year's Magnolia Awards.
In terms of best actor and actress, solid Mesozoic actors have an absolute advantage. Lei Jiayin, Chen Baoguo, Zhang Ruoyun, Sun Honglei and Huang Lei will compete for the best actor, while Haiqing, Ma Yili, Qin Hailu, Sun Li and Yan Ni will compete for the best actress.
The results will be officially announced on August 7.
From the current point of view, the realistic educational drama "Little Joy," which depicts a "Chinese-style family," has won six nominations, including "Best Chinese Drama Series," "Best Director," "Best Screenplay," "Best Actress" and "Best Supporting Actress."
The "Best Actor" award has always been one of the focus of attention from the outside world, and this year's competition is particularly fierce. The shortlisted actors and actresses are all solid actors. Chen Baoguo, Huang Lei, Lei Jiayin, Sun Honglei and Zhang Ruoyun will compete for the "Best Actor" award.
Chen Baoguo, Huang Lei and Sun Honglei are all highly qualified Mesozoic actors. Lei Jiayin, 37, is also a solid performer, while Zhang Ruoyun, 32, is the youngest finalist.

Venezuela's foreign minister accuses US of fabricating lies in groundless attack on China - Xinhuanet
Arreaza said that the US government has been exerting pressure on China in the political, diplomatic, economic and public opinion fields recently, which is a groundless attack on a sovereign country.
Arreaza retweeted a tweet posted by Chinese Ambassador to Venezuela Li Baorong on his personal account earlier in the day and made the above comments.
Li Baorong said in a tweet that China strongly condemns the US for forcibly entering the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, which is a serious violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and the China-US Consular Treaty, and China will make a legitimate and necessary response to this.
Venezuelan Vice President Rodriguez, Deputy Foreign Minister for North American Affairs Carlos Long and other government officials, celebrities and journalists from mainstream media have also retweeted Li Baorong's tweet, condemning the US 'actions as a serious violation of international law.
On the 26th, the day before Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte delivered his fifth State of the Nation Address (SONA), the total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the Philippines exceeded 80,000, of which the number of confirmed cases among the staff of the Information Department (PCOO) of the Presidential Office and the agencies directly under it increased to 25.
To this end, the PCOO has specially prepared a working group that has not been in contact with the confirmed staff to cooperate with President Duterte's press release of SONA.
PCOO Minister Martin Andanar said in an interview with DZBB radio on the 26th that two sets of plans have been prepared for President Duterte to publish the SONA.
According to Plan A, Duterte will deliver the SONA at the Batasang Pambansa building in Quezon City on the afternoon of the 27th.
Because of the epidemic situation, only 50 seats will be arranged for some government cabinet members and lawmakers, and a video conference room will be set up for other cabinet members and local government officials to watch.
All attendees passed a rapid test to enter the Capitol on the same day.
Once one of the attendees tested positive, Plan B was launched, with President Rodrigo Duterte delivering SONA at the Malakanan Palace of the Presidential Palace, with fewer seats for the hearing.
According to the usual practice, SONA will broadcast live to the Philippines.
At the time of publication, the Philippine Presidential Office had not yet confirmed whether Duterte's family would attend SONA.
Andanar said President Rodrigo Duterte's SONA will highlight how the government will lead the Philippines to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic and restore social and economic life. He will also mention his promises when he took office to fight government corruption, crack down on illegal drugs and reduce poverty.
Duterte will also explain the administration's other plans, including creating more jobs, reviving the economy, promoting education, and helping Filipino laborers abroad who have suffered in the pandemic.
Yinchuan: Classifying Policies to Support Kindergartens to Stabilize Teachers - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, July 26 (Reporter Ai Fumei) Affected by the epidemic, kindergartens in Yinchuan City, Ningxia, have not yet been reopened. In particular, the increasing financial pressure on privately-run kindergartens will have a certain impact on the stability of the kindergarten teaching staff and the sustainable development in the future.
In response to this, Yinchuan City has taken a number of measures to support the stabilization of teachers in these kindergartens, such as earmarking subsidy funds for universally beneficial private kindergartens, providing subsidies for non-universally beneficial private kindergartens, and reducing and waiving the rent for privately-run kindergartens.
According to the relevant policies of Yinchuan City, if during the epidemic period, the organizers of universally beneficial private kindergartens (including those that have been converted to universally beneficial kindergartens after the management of supporting kindergartens in urban communities) pay the basic living expenses of not less than 1,660 yuan per month to each teacher and staff member with reference to the minimum wage standard of the three districts, the municipal treasury will allocate the subsidy funds for six months according to the standard of 1,000 yuan per student per year for universally beneficial private kindergartens, which will be used to settle teachers' salaries and social insurance expenses.
For non-universally beneficial private kindergartens, which also pay teachers and staff no less than 1,660 yuan per month in basic living expenses, Yinchuan City will arrange a six-month subsidy fund to be used as a subsidy fund for early childhood teachers according to the standard of 500 yuan per student per year.
At the same time, Yinchuan City will reduce the rent for three months during the epidemic prevention and control period for privately-run kindergartens that have leased state-owned assets for business use, and encourage developers and other leaseholders to assume social responsibility, reduce and waive the rent for kindergartens for more than three months, and reduce and waive the relevant taxes and fees according to the policy.
Yangtze River 2020 No. 3 Flood Formation Ministry of Water Resources Refines Practical Measures - CNN.com
Beijing, July 26 (Xinhua News Agency) (Reporter Hu Lu) On July 26, the Yangtze River Flood No. 3 of 2020 formed.
When presiding over the meeting on the 26th, Minister of Water Resources E Jingping requested that the Three Gorges Reservoir should be carefully dispatched, the water supply from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and Dongting Lake should be considered as a whole, and the staggered peak dispatch should be carried out, so as to leave enough storage capacity to prepare for the possible flood, and ensure the safety of flood control in the middle and lower reaches of the main stream and the important embankment of Dongting Lake.
According to the forecast, there will be heavy to torrential rains in parts of eastern southwest, southern Jianghuai, western northern Jiangnan, southern Hubei and central Guangxi in the next three days, including locally heavy rains in northern Hunan and southwestern Jiangsu, and moderate to heavy rains in central and western North China, including locally heavy rains in central Hebei.
The Ministry of Water Resources predicts that, under its influence, the flow rate of the Three Gorges Reservoir in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River may reach about 60,000 cubic meters per second after 28 days, and the water level of the Lianhuatang River and Dongting Lake in the middle reaches will rise again and exceed 0.20 meters; the water level of the middle reaches of the Huaihe River will recede slowly, and the water level of Hongze Lake will continue to rise slowly; and rivers such as the Daqing River and the Yongding River in the Haihe River will experience the process of rising.
E Jingping proposed that the Huaihe River Basin should further intensify flood discharge efforts, reduce the water level of Hongze Lake as soon as possible, and prepare for the possibility of major floods.
We should do a good job in coping with the rainstorm and flood in Yishu Sishui.
He said that the Taihu Lake Basin should not relent in its efforts to increase flood discharge, reduce the water level of the Taihu Lake and surrounding river networks as soon as possible, and reduce the risk of high water levels and typhoons in Taihu Lake.
In addition, he stressed that in northern regions such as Inner Mongolia and Hebei, floods rise and fall steeply, and the warning time is short, making it very easy to cause flash floods and mudslides, making it difficult to prevent them. There are many small and medium-sized reservoirs and silt dams, and there are safety risks.
58 apps that infringe on the rights and interests of users have been exposed involving more than a dozen listed companies - CNN.com
The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) announced that according to the "Cybersecurity Law," "Telecommunications Regulations," "Provisions on the Protection of Personal Information of Telecommunications and Internet Users" and other laws and regulations, it has recently organized third-party testing institutions to inspect the mobile application software and urge enterprises with problems to carry out rectification.
These 58 apps have problems, including collecting personal information privately, collecting personal information beyond the scope, applying for permission frequently, requesting permission excessively, making it difficult to log off accounts, sharing to third parties privately, and not giving permission not to use them.
According to the requirements of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, 58 APP should complete the implementation of the rectification work before July 30. If the rectification is not completed within the time limit, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology will organize and carry out the relevant disposal work in accordance with the law.
The reporter of Zhongxin Jingwei found that behind the 58 APP models, more than a dozen US, Hong Kong and A-share listed companies were involved.
For example, "Fangduo" is a product of Fangduo, a US-listed company. There are five major problems: Collecting personal information privately, collecting personal information beyond the scope, sharing it privately to third parties, forcing users to use the targeted push function, and frequently applying for permission.
Public information shows that more houses than landed on the NASDAQ in November 2019, and it is "the first real estate agency with an industrial Internet SaaS (software service) model in China," providing online solutions for many intermediary merchants.
In response to the "Where to Go" APP account cancellation problem pointed out in the notice, according to the Beijing News, Where to Go responded that in order to prevent black-owned businesses from taking advantage of frequent registration and cancellation for profit, Where to Go has set up a one-month interval between registration and cancellation on the basis of being able to cancel independently.
Taking into consideration the convenience of cancellation and the security of the account, the cancellation has been changed to take effect immediately and is currently awaiting review.
A cybersecurity expert, who did not want to be named, told clients of Zhongxin Jingwei that the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) has issued three reports this year on apps that infringe on the rights and interests of users.
Among them, the collection of personal information, excessive request for permission, account cancellation is difficult to "manage" more than three problems.
From the notification, it can also be found that at present, more attention has been paid to the invasion of privacy by APP.
On July 24, the day of the announcement of 58 apps that infringe on users' rights and interests, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said that it had recently issued a notice to deploy and carry out special remediation actions to further promote the apps that infringe on users' rights and interests.
Special remediation will strengthen supervision and inspection in accordance with regulations, urge relevant enterprises to strengthen the protection of APP personal information, promptly rectify and eliminate outstanding problems such as illegal collection, use of users' personal information and harassment of users, deception and misdirection of users, and inadequate implementation of the management responsibility of the application distribution platform, so as to purify the application space of APP.
Lewis family: John Lewis was'fighting for the weakest 'warrior
U.S. Congressman John Lewis, a civil rights fighter, was remembered as a "fighter for the weakest" at a memorial service for him on Saturday, July 25.
Lewis' public memorial service has been held in Alabama since Saturday.
There were two memorial services on the first day.
At a public memorial service at Troy University in Alabama on Saturday, Lewis' five siblings and a nephew spoke of him as a loving, fearless man who put his family first.
"He devoted his life to helping others," Henry "Grant" Lewis, Lewis's youngest brother, said at the meeting.
Samuel Lewis said his mother had warned John "not to get into trouble, not to get into trouble."
He added that John did not heed his mother's warning, saying, "We all know that John is always in trouble, always in trouble, but that is because he insists on doing the right thing, and that is a good trouble."
Lewis' siblings reminded those at the memorial service that John's most famous argument was to cause "good trouble," that is, to not shy away from stirring up trouble for the sake of justice.
John had applied to Troy University in Troy, Alabama, where he was born, but Troy University, an all-white school at the time, rejected his application.
John Lewis, who preached the gospel to chickens on his family's farm as a child, eventually earned a degree in religion and philosophy from Fisk University.
Years later, the University of Troy awarded Lewis an honorary doctorate.
Doug Jones, a congressman from Alabama, said the current protesters "are protesting peacefully and nonviolently," as Lewis did during the civil rights movement.
"Even if President Trump knocks over a boatload of people and calls all the protesters thugs, he's wrong," Jones said.
The protesters are patriots who want America to move toward a more equal country. "
A six-day series of events in Lewis's memory will culminate this week with a funeral in Georgia.
Lewis' casket was parked at a public memorial service at Troy University on Saturday, where people came to pay their respects to the civil rights pioneer.
Later on Saturday, a private service paid tribute to him at a small church in Selma, Alabama, followed by a public memorial service.
On Sunday, Lewis' body will pass over the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma.
It was in front of the bridge in 1965 that he and demonstrators demanding black voting rights were beaten by Alabama State Police, who also fired tear gas at the protesters.
Lewis was nearly killed at the time.
The day became known as "Bloody Sunday."
Lewis' body will be transported to Montgomery, the capital of Alabama.
Mayor Steven Reed encouraged people to line up on the sidewalk for the final leg of the walk with Lewis.
At the same time, officials have asked the public to wear masks and maintain social distancing when participating in the event.
Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey ordered flags to be flown at half-mast on Saturday and Sunday in honor of Lewis.
During the nearly week-long commemoration, Lewis' body will be briefly laid to rest at the Alabama State Capitol in Montgomery, the Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta, and the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., for public mourning.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., announced last week that people could come to the U.S. Capitol on Monday and Tuesday to honor Lewis.
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, a public memorial service for Lewis will be held outdoors.

Those who violate the regulations will be ordered by the market supervision and administration department to make corrections, and a fine of 30,000 yuan will be imposed.
In addition to "abstinence from alcohol," minors should also "exercise more."
According to the request of the draft, the school should arrange more than one hour of students' sports activities every day.
For online games, the departments of public security, culture, radio, television, tourism and sports, network supervision and health should improve the health supervision system of the Internet service business premises, establish a health review system for online games, and create a good communication space and culture for promoting the healthy growth of adolescents.
In addition, the draft also proposed that influenza patients must wear masks in public places, and medical and health institutions should be fined 20,000 yuan for revealing patients' privacy without their consent.
It is worth noting that in addition to the physical and mental health of residents, the draft also requires that all departments in Shenzhen should evaluate the impact of public policy implementation on the health of the population before formulating planning and normative documents concerning urban space planning and construction, industrial park planning and construction, resource development and utilization, ecological and environmental protection, biomedical industry development, as well as approving major construction projects and implementing major public service projects.
If it has not been assessed or will have a serious adverse effect on the public health of the city or the health of the residents, it may not be formulated, promulgated or approved for implementation.

Adhering to the guidance of Party building and implementing the leadership of the Party in all aspects of grass-roots governance is the fundamental requirement of doing a good job in grass-roots governance.
To improve the level of governance at the grassroots level, we must adhere to the guidance of the Party's construction, promote the transformation of the Party's political, organizational and mass work advantages into governance advantages by strengthening political guidance, building battle bastions and rallying the red forces, and pass on the Party's strength and propositions to the "nerve endings" and "the last kilometer."
Pay attention to calcium supplementation to cast the soul and strengthen political guidance.
To strengthen the political guidance of grass-roots governance, it is necessary to carry out the project of "calcium replenishment and soul casting."
Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era should be taken as the primary task, "Never Forget the Primary Mind and Remember the Mission" should be taken as the eternal task of Party building and the lifelong task of Party members and cadres, and the principles of reading the original books should be strengthened. Through special training, training in batches, discussion and exchange, and holding large lecture halls, the Party's innovative theory should be continuously armed and practical, and Party members and cadres should be encouraged to further strengthen the "Four Consciousness," "Four Confidence" and "Two Safeguards" so as to better fulfill their duties.
Through the combination of online and offline learning methods, we will broaden the channels of learning and education, and guide Party organizations and Party members and cadres at the grass-roots level to truly integrate learning and education into their daily lives and focus on regular learning.
Pay attention to practical training, in the process of resolving the key and difficult problems in the field of grass-roots governance, solve the troubles and troubles that the masses are concerned about, and temper the Party's character and ability.
Grasp the standard upgrade, build the battlefortress.
The grass-roots Party organization is not only an important part of the grass-roots governance system, but also an important carrier for the manifestation of governance ability.
To promote the standardization of Party organizations at the grass-roots level, it is necessary to start with the regulations on the work of Party branches, focus on such issues as the weakening and weakening of the leadership of Party organizations, and solidify the foundation, make up the shortcomings and promote development by establishing the linkage mechanism, innovating the form of setting up branches, normalizing the rectification of weakness and laxity, establishing and improving the mechanism of decision-making and deliberation, and serving the masses.
In rural areas, we will strengthen the standardization of Party organizations at the village level, standardize organizational forms, learning activities and management mechanisms against the standardization construction standards of Party branches, and earnestly promote the detailed implementation of the "Three Sessions, One Lesson" and thematic Party Day activities.
In cities, focus on street communities, explore innovative forms of branch setup, focus on weak areas, "choke points" and "pain points," and actively build urban party-building alliances so that the Party's work can be effectively covered.
At the same time, we will establish and improve the system of governance at the grass-roots level, improve the decision-making and deliberation mechanism led by major issues, practical issues, urgent matters, difficult issues, and grass-roots Party organizations, improve the mechanism of connecting Party members and cadres to serve the masses, and gather the hearts and minds of the people in serving the people, so as to enhance the sense of acquisition, happiness, honor and pride of the Party members and the masses, so as to make grass-roots governance more temperate.
Play the vanguard role and gather the red power.
Party members and cadres at the grass-roots level are the cornerstone of grass-roots governance.
To enhance the capacity of grass-roots governance, we should focus on improving the capacity of grass-roots Party members and cadres, give full play to the exemplary and leading role of "red cells" in grass-roots governance, and gather the power of red at the forefront of connecting with and serving the masses.
It is necessary to take the improvement of governance ability as a compulsory course for Party members and cadres at the grassroots level, constantly strengthen ideological hardening, professional training and practical training, carry forward the spirit of responsibility in their posts and in difficult and dangerous tasks, and lay a solid foundation and contribute to the modernization of the country's governance system and governance capacity.
It is necessary to carry out the activities of "community whistleblowing and reporting of Party members" extensively, and participate in community construction, management and service by participating in thematic Party Day activities, contacting people in need, identifying service projects, claiming micro-aspirations, and putting forward reasonable suggestions, so as to enable Party members to play a role in community governance.
It is necessary to give full play to the role of unemployed Party members in rural areas, guide the majority of Party members at the grassroots level to actively participate in poverty alleviation, ecological construction, letters and visits to maintain stability, straw burning and other work by setting up vanguard posts for unemployed Party members and setting up working teams for unemployed Party members, so as to better integrate the red forces and serve the people.
The foundation is solid and the building strong.
The grass-roots Party organization is the foundation of the ruling building.
Only by focusing on closer relations between Party cadres and increasing the well-being of the people, and taking the guidance of Party building as the fundamental way to promote the innovative development of grass-roots governance, can we build a solid foundation so that grass-roots Party organizations can pull out and rise to the top, and Party members and cadres at the grass-roots level can catch up and rush up, so as to promote grass-roots governance with "soul," order, strength and effectiveness.

Koksiri Tibetan Antelope Enters Return Season - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency Xining on July 25 (reporter Wang Jinjin) learned from the Wudaoliang Protection Station of the Kexili Management Office of the Yangtze River Source Park of the Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration that monitoring showed that the Tibetan antelope, which had been migrating to the Zhuo Nai Lake area in the hinterland of Kexili, was ending their calving and began to return to their original habitat with their calves.
Surveillance footage near the Wudaoliang Protection Station shows that on July 25, about 40 female Tibetan antelope led three Tibetan antelope calves through the 3002-kilometer Qinghai-Tibet Highway and the Wudaoliangbei Bridge of the Qinghai-Tibet Railway, and the Tibetan antelope has already begun to move back.
Experts have analyzed that in recent years, the number of Tibetan antelope calves among the relocated flocks has accounted for a quarter to a fifth of the total number of Tibetan antelope herds.
Lian Xinming, Associate Researcher at the Northwest Plateau Institute of Biology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said: "In the early stage of relocation, the Tibetan antelope faced a higher risk of predation. Therefore, the number of young in the flock will be relatively small, and there may even be no young in the flock."
According to statistics from the Kexili Management Office of the Yangtze River Source Park of the Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration, the number of Tibetan antelope relocating has been increasing year by year. In 2019, the number of Tibetan antelope relocating was 4,860, an increase of 338 compared to 2018.
Lian Xinming said: "This year's relocation of Tibetan antelope is expected to end in early September, and the number of relocated Tibetan antelope is expected to continue to increase."
The Tibetan antelope is a protected animal at the national level.
Every year at the end of May, Tibetan antelope from Sanjiangyuan in Qinghai, Qiangtang in Tibet, Alshan in Xinjiang and other places go to Zhuo Nai Lake in the hinterland of Kexili to lamb.
Wu Xiaomin, an expert on Tibetan antelope conservation in China and a researcher at the Shaanxi Provincial Institute of Zoology (Northwest Institute of Endangered Animals), said: "The relocation of Tibetan antelope is the process of female Tibetan antelope returning to their habitats after calving. At first, the relocation groups leaving the calving grounds are quite large, but then the Tibetan antelope will return to their respective habitats according to different geographical populations and along different paths."
In order to ensure the safe relocation of Tibetan antelope herds, the reporter learned that recently the Kexili Management Office of the Yangtze River Source Park of the Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration has arranged staff to carry out video monitoring and district patrols in the main relocation areas.
If a Tibetan antelope herd is found trying to cross the highway, the mountain patrol team will carry out temporary traffic control at the first time, allowing the sheep to pass through the wildlife passage safely, so as to ensure as little human disturbance as possible on the way back to the mountain.
So, how to relieve the heat in the daily life?
Experts suggest going out in summer to avoid the hot period, preferably not to walk or work in the hot sun around noon, because the sun is most intense during this period, and the possibility of heatstroke is higher.
If you must go out at this time, be sure to do a good job of protection, such as wearing a parasol, a visor, sunglasses, the best conditions to apply sunscreen, to protect against sunburn.
As far as possible, choose light-colored, breathable cotton, hemp and silk textures, and wear less chemical fiber clothing, so as not to dissipate heat in time when sweating a lot, causing heatstroke.
When the weather is hot and sultry, you should prepare enough water to drink in time. Don't wait for thirst before drinking water, because once you feel thirsty, your body is already short of water. Each time you drink water, limit it to 150ml to 200ml. Drink warm water and don't drink ice water.
According to the temperature, the average person drinks 1.5 liters to 2 liters of water per day, and the high temperature workers drink 3 liters to 5 liters of water per day.
When sweating more, some salt water can be properly replenished to make up for the loss of salt in the body due to sweating.
In addition, the human body is prone to lack of potassium in summer, which makes people feel tired and tired. Potassium-containing tea is an excellent summer drink.
In summer, eat fruits and vegetables with high water content, such as lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, etc.; fresh fruits, such as peaches, apricots, watermelons, melons, etc. with water content of 80% to 90%, can be used to replenish water; dairy products can not only replenish water, but also meet the nutritional needs of the body.
In addition, people who work in high-temperature environments should appropriately supplement drinks containing potassium, magnesium and other elements.
Summer days and nights are short, the temperature is high, the body's metabolism is strong, consumption is also large, easy to feel fatigued.
Adequate sleep can relax the brain and the body's systems, which is not only conducive to work and study, but also a measure to prevent heat stroke.
Experts say the best time to go to bed is between 22:00 and 23:00, and the best time to wake up is between 5:30 and 6:30.
When sleeping, be careful not to lie under the air conditioner outlet and electric fan, so as not to suffer from air conditioner disease and heat colds.
Experts suggest that people who are engaged in outdoor activities or high-temperature operations can carry ten drops of water, Rendan, Patchouli Zhengqi water or Patchouli Zhengqi pills and other anti-heat medicines, or place them in the nearest workplace and use them at any time to prevent the occurrence of heatstroke.
Graduate Art Exhibition Moves Into Shopping Mall for Public Welfare Exhibition - Xinhuanet
In the "cloud graduation" season of major colleges and universities, a rare offline graduate art exhibition kicked off last weekend.
But it is neither in the museum nor on campus. Instead, it appears in the public space of Chaoyang Joy City and is open to the public free of charge. It will last until August 23.
The reporter learned that the 2020 Graduate Art Exhibition has collected 50 pieces/groups of works from 57 young artists from the Central Academy of Fine Arts, Communication University of China and Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts. The exhibition space extends from 2 to 6 floors, and makes full use of the light box in the building to display the graphic works, thus maximizing the artistic atmosphere of the graduation season.
Under the epidemic situation, the significance of this exhibition is particularly special.
Ge Pingtan, head of Chaoyang Joy City Mei Chen, said: "We have chosen to bring the graduation exhibition to the'cloud 'back to the offline space. We also hope to let more people see the youth's exploration of themselves and understanding of the world, and amplify the healing power of art to society and the soul."
She revealed that the works in this exhibition were solicited from the graduates of several art colleges and universities, and selected from them suitable for commercial space display. The works range from traditional paintings and sculptures on shelves, to new media installations, interactive animations and VR panoramas, with the largest volume and richness in the calendar year.
Among them, Li Yunxiao expressed his feelings on the epidemic through a mixture of mechanical and manual creative language in "The First Battle of 2020"; Liu Jiaying explored themes such as "cryptocurrency," "credit creation," and "transaction" through her Ethereum blockchain creation "Sound Money"; Zhang Jiaqi's "Cat Forest" and Qiu Daqiang's "Boogie" showed animals that often accompany humans, from which one could see young artists' understanding of the relationship between humans and animals; while Zhu Zhongyu's "Winter of Faith - Gift" was a reminder to young people growing up, "When one day you have a successful career, don't forget your first thoughts and remember the simplicity and sincerity."
Among the few graduates who set up the exhibition in person was Li Jingyin from the sculpture department of Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts.
"I came to Beijing on July 7. I was actually a bit worried about the epidemic at that time. I also took a nucleic acid test three days in advance. I came to the exhibition with alcohol cotton wool and a test report."
His work "Yesterday as a Mystery" has a complicated structure and must be hands-on.
At the same time, he also undertook the task of helping his classmates to repair the damaged works.
"Cloth exhibition until 4:30 in the morning, and then do the repair, time is very tight, forgot to take a photo with the works, also a bit regrettable."

University of Australia develops new drug that could be used to treat blood vessel blockage caused by corona - Xinhuanet
Sydney, July 26 (Xinhua News Agency) (Reporter Chen Yu) Researchers at Monash University in Australia are developing a new drug to help prevent heart attacks and strokes, and hope that the drug can be used to treat blockages in blood vessels caused by the new coronavirus.
Before a heart attack or stroke, the researchers found, an enzyme in platelets accelerates platelet clotting.
As a result, they developed a drug that temporarily inhibits platelet clotting, thereby preventing blockages in blood vessels and preventing heart attacks and strokes.
According to the researchers, the drug only inhibits the clotting effect of platelets when there are signs of heart attack or stroke.
Researchers hope the drug could be used in the future to treat patients with severe COVID-19, as studies have shown similar blockages in blood vessels are one of the leading causes of death in patients with severe COVID-19.
At present, the drug has achieved good results in animal model experiments, and the researchers are ready to conduct human clinical trials in the next stage.
The results of the study have been published in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
He became the first spectator to enter the stadium after the resumption of the CBA League, which allowed spectators to watch the games.
On the same day, during the second phase of the resumption of the 2019-2020 Chinese Men's Basketball Association (CBA) season (Laoshan Division) held in Qingdao, Shandong Province, medical staff, teachers and members of the public security front entered the stadium to watch the Shanghai Jiushi Team's match against Shandong Xiwang Team after completing the relevant procedures, including nucleic acid testing, through the official ticketing platform.
During the race, spectators are required to wear masks at all times, take seats on opposite numbers, and strictly maintain a one-meter gap between seats.
When exiting the stage, the audience must maintain the "one meter line" social distancing and exit in an orderly manner according to the order from the front, the first two sides and then the middle.
Xinjiang Ploughs "Sunflower Fields" to Use Clean Energy - CNN.com
2020-07-26 15:43:42 Source: China News Network Author: Chen Haifeng Responsible Editor: Chen Haifeng
Hami, Xinjiang, July 26,2016/PRNewswire/-- "Sunflower Fields" in Xinjiang are Ploughed to Use Clean Energy
More than 6,000 pentagonal helioscopes, each 48 square meters, are arranged neatly in a circle, such as a silver "sunflower field," which rotates with the sun and reflects the sun's rays to a heat-absorbing tower more than 200 meters high in the center to realize power generation.
The reporter saw this scene on the 25th in the Hami molten salt tower type photothermal power field of the CLP project in Maomaohu Town, Yigu County, Hami City, Xinjiang.
"The so-called molten salt tower type photothermal power generation means that the sun's rays are reflected through the mirror to the heat absorbing tower to form heat energy, and then the heat energy is converted into electricity through traditional power generation technology."
Zhang Yong, deputy general manager of CLP Hami Solar Thermal Power Co., Ltd., said that the design principle is similar to that of solar stoves used in rural areas in Northwest China, all of which need to gather the sunlight.
Construction of the power plant began in October 2017 and was connected to the grid by the end of last year. It covers an area of 6,600 acres and plans to install a total of 14,500 fixed helioscopes.
"Compared to traditional solar power generation technology, its biggest advantage is that it can store the accumulated heat energy and also generate electricity at night."
Zhang Yong said that the 13-hour heat storage system configured by the project will enable the generator set to maintain continuous and stable operation, which will not be affected by changes in light. It can also quickly participate in the peak adjustment of the power grid according to the demand of the peak load of the power grid.
When fully completed, the project will generate 198 million degrees of electricity annually, save more than 60,000 tons of standard coal per year, reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by more than 60 tons, nitrogen oxides by more than 60 tons, soot by about 20 tons and carbon dioxide by more than 150,000 tons, providing a steady stream of clean energy for the local area.
In addition, there is another silver "sunflower field" in the Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park in Hami City.
The Hamifu solar photovoltaic power plant covers an area of more than 2,300 acres, and the 714 power generation devices that have been built also follow the sun's rotation, keeping the sun's rays at a right angle of 90 degrees to the condenser surface.
"We use dual-axis tracking condenser power generation technology. Through unified integrated control, all power generation equipment will adjust the angle according to the height of the sun to maintain the efficiency of power generation."
Duan Mengqi, the station manager of the power station, said that under good weather conditions, the efficiency of the power generation technology can be increased by about 20% compared to the traditional photovoltaic power generation.
In the first half of this year, the power station has generated more than 7 million degrees of electricity, complementing the local demand for electricity.
Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park is a photovoltaic industrial demonstration park with the largest monomer scale and the most complete photovoltaic module type in Xinjiang, with a total of 38 photovoltaic power generation projects, with a total installed capacity of 820,000 kilowatts.
In the first half of this year, the electricity generation exceeded 110 million degrees, an increase of 6% compared to the same period in 2019.
Hami is one of the regions with the best solar energy resources in China.
The average annual total solar radiation is more than 6,200 megajoules per square meter, and the annual sunshine hours are about 3,200 hours.
In recent years, the city has vigorously developed the photovoltaic industry and planted "sunflower fields."
More than 2.5 million kilowatts of solar power has been installed. In the first half of this year, the city generated more than 1.4 billion degrees of photovoltaic power, a year-on-year increase of about 14 percent.
At present, there are more than 330 grid-connected photovoltaic power plants in Xinjiang with an installed capacity of more than 10 million kilowatts.
This year's annual photovoltaic power generation is expected to reach 15 billion degrees, which can replace more than 6 million tons of standard coal.
Police report details of "missing female college student's trip to Qinghai" as search and rescue efforts continue - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, July 26 (Reporter Wang Jinjin Zhouzhe) Recently, "a female college student lost contact after traveling to Golmud, Qinghai," which aroused netizens' concern.
The Public Security Bureau of Golmud City, Hainan Mongolian Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, announced on the 26th that Huang Mou, a student of a university in Nanjing, is still in a state of disconnection, and many police are going deep along Huang Mou's disconnected land and actively carrying out search work.
On July 10,2020, the security detachment of the Public Security Bureau of Golmud City, Hainan Province, received a notice from its superiors that Huang Mou, a student of a university in Nanjing, took the Z164 train from Nanjing to Golmud on July 5, and on July 9, his mobile phone was shut down and lost contact in the southwest area of Qingshui River at the Sonandajie Protection Station in Qumalai County, Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, requesting assistance in the search.
According to the investigation by the Golmud Municipal Public Security Bureau, Huang entered the territory of Qinghai Province at 19:54 on July 6 and arrived in Golmud City at 4:00 on July 7.
At 8 o'clock on the same day, the missing person Huang Mou took a taxi from Golmud Yellow River Hotel towards G109 National Road, and arrived at Koksiri Sonandajie Protection Station at 12 o'clock. The taxi driver returned alone, and Huang Mou went to Qingshui River area near Dasonandajie Protection Station at 15 o'clock on the 7th until he shut down in the area at about 18 o'clock on the 9th.
During further investigation, the police found that Huang had passed through the Naijigou checkpoint at 17:07 on July 13.
Najigou checkpoint is a checkpoint set up by Naqu City of Tibet Autonomous Region at the Nanshan Pass of Golmud City. Since there is no video surveillance at the checkpoint, it is impossible to determine the information of the person and the vehicle they are travelling in. The police can only search the checkpoint by car along the way and coordinate with the checkpoints in Tibet. If Huang is found at the checkpoint along the way, they will immediately contact the Golmud Public Security Bureau.
According to the latest situation, at 1:00 a.m. on July 26, the Golmud Municipal Public Security Bureau organized rescue forces to carry rescue equipment to search the freeze-free spring protection station and Sonandajie protection station along the Qinghai-Tibet Highway, and actively contacted the Sichuan police, the Tibet police and the Nanjing police to jointly carry out the work. At present, the search and rescue work continues.
The local police hope that the majority of netizens and all sectors of society will provide relevant clues to the Golmud Police and Nanjing Jiangning Police in a timely manner, and strive to find the missing person Huang Mou at an early date.
At the same time, relevant experts suggest that tourists should be standardized, rational and civilized in outdoor activities, pay attention to roadside warning signs at all times, and never venture into no-man's land. In case of emergencies, they should report to the police in time.
Us Media Reveals US 'Unwarranted Demand for China to Close Consulate-General in Houston - CNN.com
2020-07-26 14:40:44 Source: CCTV Network Author: Zhu Yanjing Responsible Editor: Zhu Yanjing
The US media uncovered the truth about the US 'groundless demand for China to close its consulate in Houston
On the 24th, the Chinese Foreign Ministry informed the US Embassy in China that the Chinese side decided to revoke the license for the establishment and operation of the US Consulate General in Chengdu, and put forward specific requirements for the Consulate General to stop all business and activities, as a countermeasure to the US side's abrupt request on the 21st that the Chinese Consulate General in Houston be closed.
This act of the US government has aroused many concerns, and its political motives have been questioned by foreign media and scholars.
Why did you ask China to close the Consulate General?
Several foreign media said it was not clear why the US Congress chose the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, but the foreign media bluntly stated the purpose of the move: For the sake of elections.
CNN reported on the 23rd that the move by the US to ask China to close the Consulate General in Houston has raised questions about its political motives.
According to the article, the US government's disastrous response to the coronavirus pandemic has contributed to President Donald Trump's low approval rating in the polls before the election.
White House officials have said privately that the tough approach to China is aimed at salvaging Trump's approval ratings and deflecting blame for the White House's failed response to the outbreak.
According to the article, the Chinese Consulate-General in Houston is a "politically driven and very cautious" target chosen by the United States, and the US government chose it "to create a strong attitude while avoiding the risk of major conflicts."
The BBC agreed that Trump believes "playing the'China card 'has political advantages" at a time when the US election season is approaching and the US economy has been hit hard by the epidemic.
The current situation is "a spiraling, tit-for-tat struggle," which is partly driven by the US government from the perspective of domestic considerations and will only worsen the tensions between China and America.
CBS News has reported that Trump's re-election prospects are under pressure because of the outbreak, and he has repeatedly blamed China for the outbreak.
Almost every day, the United States takes new action against Trump's absurd claim that "China exploits America."
"The Consulate-General of Houston is very important in establishing ties between the two countries."
The Associated Press commented that U.S. demands for China to close its consulate in Houston have heightened tensions between the world's two largest economies.
If the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is closed, in addition to the diplomatic implications, Chinese citizens in the southern United States will face difficulties in obtaining consular services, as will American citizens seeking visas and other services.
A Houston business group expressed regret over the US request for China to close its consulate in Houston, saying that the consulate has played an important role in establishing trade, investment and cultural ties between the two countries.
According to the Associated Press, this reflects the importance of China's economy.
According to the website of US Foreign Policy magazine, the US move "is part of a series of provocative measures that will only worsen US-China relations."
Jonathan Pollack, an expert on East Asia at the Brookings Institution, a US think tank, was quoted by Reuters as saying that since the US and China established full diplomatic relations in 1979, he could not think of any move comparable to the US action against the Chinese Consulate General in Houston.
Hong Kong's South China Morning Post reported that the US move is unprecedented in the more than 40 years of diplomatic relations between China and the US.
Analysts believe that the move could cause lasting damage.
The Chinese Consulate-General in Houston, built in 1979, is the first Chinese Consulate-General in the United States.
At present, China has one embassy and five consulates general in the United States.

In his speech at the military parade, Putin said that the level of modern technology of Russian naval equipment has been continuously improved in recent years, and the Russian Navy will receive a total of about 40 new ships equipped with unique hypersonic strike systems in 2020.
In addition, commander-in-chief of the Russian Navy Yevmenov recently said in an interview with the Red Star newspaper, an organ of the Russian Defense Ministry, that Russia's plans to build ships have been effectively implemented, and the number of new ships that the Russian Navy plans to receive in 2020 is larger than in recent years.
In 1696, Tsar Peter the Great set out to set up a naval fleet, opening up the history of the Russian navy.
The Russian Naval Day is celebrated on the last Sunday of July every year.
In response to the new changes in epidemic prevention and control work, since July 17, trade unions at all levels in Xinjiang have responded to the call of the regional federation of trade unions and actively participated in epidemic prevention and control work.

Chinese Embassy Spokesperson: The Chinese government is a staunch defender of cyber security - CNN.com
On July 26, according to the website of the Chinese Embassy in the UK, on July 25, the spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in the UK answered a question on the erroneous remarks about the cyber attack.
The spokesperson stressed that the Chinese government is a staunch defender of cyber security, and has always firmly opposed and cracked down on all forms of cyber attacks and cybercrimes.
A reporter asked a question: According to media reports, China-related hacker groups have interfered with the network systems of a British company, launched attacks on Anglo-American technology companies with patent data, and infiltrated the networks of governments of EU countries.
The spokesperson said that the Chinese government is a staunch defender of cyber security, and has always firmly opposed and cracked down on all forms of cyber attacks and cybercrimes.
Cyberspace is highly virtual, difficult to trace, and diverse in behavior. When investigating and characterizing cyberspace events, sufficient evidence should be produced, and no groundless speculation should be made.
The spokesman said that a series of previous incidents such as "Prism Gate" proved that the United States has been conducting the world's largest cyber espionage operation.
Maintaining peace and stability in cyberspace serves the common interests of all countries.
The spokesperson pointed out that China's achievements in scientific and technological innovation were not stolen or snatched, but were achieved through self-reliance and hard work.
In 2019, China filed about 59,000 patent applications through the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), with an annual growth rate of 10.6 percent, making it the country with the highest number of international patent applications filed.
China has become a major country in innovation and intellectual property rights.
Data from the Urumqi Central Branch of the People's Bank of China showed that in the first half of the year, new loans to agriculture-related and small and micro enterprises in Xinjiang exceeded the increase in the whole of 2019.
In the first half of this year, the Urumqi Central Branch of the People's Bank of China (PBOC) used a variety of monetary policy tools to guide the banking sector to continuously increase lending, providing adequate financial protection for epidemic prevention and control and resumption of work and production.
Urumqi Free Nucleic Acid Detection Most Areas Have Already Completed Secondary Testing in High-Risk Areas - CNN.com
Urumqi, July 26 (Reporter Sun Tingwen Zhao Yamin) Zhang Wei, director of Urumqi Municipal Health Committee, said on July 26, when briefing on the latest epidemic situation and nucleic acid testing in Urumqi, that at present, the free nucleic acid testing in most districts of Urumqi has been basically completed.
The expert group of the State Council and experts from the autonomous region and Urumqi city are making further assessment on the development of the epidemic based on the results of nucleic acid detection and epidemiological investigation.
The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Information Office held a press conference on the 26th to inform about the situation of epidemic situation and prevention and control in Xinjiang.
According to him, between 00:00 and 24:00 on July 25, there were 22 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Urumqi (5 of which were transferred from asymptomatic infected persons to confirmed cases) and 38 new cases of asymptomatic infected persons.
As of 24:00 on July 25, there were 135 confirmed cases and 147 asymptomatic infected persons in Urumqi.
The new asymptomatic infected persons on the 25th also basically passed the free nucleic acid testing and active screening in the whole city.
Zhang Wei, director of Urumqi Municipal Health Committee, said on the 26th that the free nucleic acid testing work in most districts of Urumqi has been basically completed.
He also said that from the experience of other regions in China, there are many factors that affect the nucleic acid test results, such as the sensitivity of the test reagents, the time of infection and detoxification of the tested personnel, the cooperation of the tested persons when the specimens are taken (poor coordination may result in the specimens not being taken in place), the testing environment, the proficiency of the inspectors, etc.
For a variety of reasons, the nucleic acid test can also produce false negative results.
A false negative means that the person being tested is indeed an infected person, but the nucleic acid test result is negative.
In addition, for people who have had close contact with confirmed or suspected cases, two nucleic acid tests are usually required to rule them out.
For people who have been to high-risk areas of the epidemic, if they develop fever and respiratory symptoms, a negative nucleic acid test may be a false negative, so two nucleic acid tests are also needed to rule them out.
He said that in view of the above situation, for the sake of the health of the people of all ethnic groups in the city, starting from today, Urumqi will conduct two free nucleic acid tests in key areas such as Tianshan District and Shaibak District, and at the same time carry out "checking for leaks and leaks."
It is reported that Tianshan District and Shaibak District are high-risk areas for the epidemic.

On the basis of doing a good job in normalizing epidemic prevention and control, holding the Shanghai International Film and Television Festival is not only a sign of confidence, but also a declaration of determination - our confidence and determination to overcome the epidemic remain unchanged, our confidence and determination to run the people's festival well remain unchanged, and our confidence and determination to build a global film and television creation center and launch the "Shanghai Culture" brand remain unchanged.
Every year, the Shanghai International Film Festival, with its innovative and enterprising attitude, is a new start and a new beginning.
Therefore, it is necessary to take every step well to serve the spiritual life of the people and the high-quality development of the film and television industry.
This year is even more so.
In order to cherish the hard-won situation of epidemic prevention and control, the Shanghai International Film Festival, on the one hand, strictly abides by the requirements of epidemic prevention and control, and implements epidemic prevention and control measures in detail. On the other hand, with the vision of gathering wisdom for the creation of Chinese films and meeting the needs of film fans, the Shanghai International Film Festival has launched a multi-plate activity that is both online and offline.
On the first day of opening, the relevant anti-epidemic policies were strictly implemented in the film festival activities, from offline viewing to industry forum.
The activities of the forum are limited to 50 people, and the attendance of each movie is strictly limited to 30%.
As upheld by the organizing committee of the festival, in any case, "putting people's lives and health first" is a major prerequisite.
Offline activities have been greatly streamlined, and "on the cloud" has been a lot of fun.
In order to implement the important concept of "People's City People Build, People's City for People," and as a festival for the people, this year's Shanghai International Film Festival aims to innovate and transform, using online "Cloud Screening" and master class "Cloud Sharing" and other measures to meet the diverse needs of film fans.
On the first day of opening, Migu Video, the official partner of the festival, and Oriental Pearl Blockbuster respectively gave back to the fans with a number of "One Belt, One Road" films.
In the evening, the Golden Goblet Opening Forum and Jia Zhangke Master Class were also launched on various platforms such as Central Video, Learning Power and Wenhui App, so that people could follow the latest trends of Chinese films without leaving their homes.
At the opening forum yesterday, Yan Xiaoming, a member of the party group and deputy director of the Central Radio and Television Station, delivered a speech and announced the opening of the festival. Zhou Huilin, standing committee member of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and head of the Propaganda Department, delivered a speech. Vice Mayor Zong Ming attended.
Fauci, White House pandemic expert: Cautious optimism for vaccine in early 2021
Fauci made the remarks during an online video conference hosted by the International Leadership Foundation on the 25th.
He cautioned that it is not yet clear how the coronavirus epidemic will develop in the fall and winter, or what the ultimate impact of the epidemic will be. "And the only way to end all of this is for each of us to choose to be part of the solution."
According to data from Johns Hopkins University, as of 21:00 on the 25th, the number of newly confirmed cases in the United States has reached 4.176 million, with 146,000 deaths.
Fauci said some parts of the United States are struggling with a resurgence of the disease.
Although epidemics vary from place to place and need to be adapted to local conditions, diversified anti-epidemic strategies do not mean that regions are not closely linked.
An outbreak in one area will eventually affect other areas.
"Now is not the time for complacency," Fauci said. "Our work is not done. We must step up our efforts and remain vigilant against the uncertainty ahead."
He Dayi, a Chinese-American medical expert and founder of "Cocktail Therapy" for AIDS, pointed out at the meeting that the epidemic has not yet reached its peak in the United States.
"Each of us must do our part to slow the spread of this virus."
He called on the public to use their own practical actions to buy time for scientists to step up research and development of new crown therapeutics and vaccines.
The International Leadership Foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting international exchange between the United States and the Asia-Pacific region. It is dedicated to elevating the status of Asian-Pacific Americans in the United States and nurturing young international leaders.
On the same day, U.S. Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao, U.S. Congressman Meng Zhaowen and founding president of the International Leadership Foundation Dong Jiling made speeches at the conference.
In particular, they paid tribute to Asian-Pacific American medical workers and volunteers fighting the epidemic on the frontline, and called on the American public to continue to adhere to anti-epidemic guidelines such as "social distancing" to curb the spread of the epidemic.

Dalian, July 25 (Xinhua News Agency) (Reporters Cai Zhongjun and Cui Shihao) Dalian announced on July 25 that from 15:00 on July 24 to 14:00 on July 25, there were no new locally confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Dalian, 24 new asymptomatic infected persons and no new suspected cases.
From July 22 to 14:00 on July 25, the city reported a total of 12 locally confirmed cases of New Crown Pneumonia, all of which were treated in isolation at the Sixth People's Hospital of Dalian.
Zhao Lian, deputy director of the Dalian Municipal Health Commission, said that according to the epidemic situation, Dalian organized the medical staff of the city's tertiary hospitals to be stationed in the street communities, and set up more than 600 sampling points in Dalian Bay, workers' villages, along the light rail and in some key areas of Jinpu New District, to fully promote the nucleic acid screening of personnel, and dispatched nearly 2,000 medical staff to carry out nucleic acid testing and sampling every day.
As of 14:00 on July 25, the city has collected more than 210,000 samples.
At present, 10 of the 12 confirmed cases in Dalian are employees of Dalian Kaiyang World Seafood Co., Ltd.; 46 of the 54 asymptomatic infected persons are employees of the company and their relatives' families. Among all the positive cases of nucleic acid tests, the proportion of employees of the enterprise and their relatives' families reached 85%.
After judging, the city of Dalian decided to strengthen strict control over the close contacts of all employees of Dalian Kaiyang World Seafood Co., Ltd., as well as the close contacts of the close contacts, and to carry out 14 days of centralized medical observation and at least 2 nucleic acid tests.
At the same time, the city of Dalian decided to further expand the scope of medical observation personnel under centralized quarantine, and all close contacts of those who tested positive for nucleic acid (including cases and asymptomatic infected persons) and close contacts of those who tested positive for nucleic acid were placed under centralized medical observation for 14 days, and at least two nucleic acid tests were conducted.

Brazilian study shows hydroxychloroquine is not effective in treating mild COVID-19 - RT World News
Recently, a Brazilian study showed that hydroxychloroquine was not effective in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19.
The study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
The Pakistani researchers divided 667 patients from 55 hospitals across the country into three groups and conducted clinical trials. They compared the effects of hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with other antibiotics, azithromycin, and analyzed whether it could help improve the condition of patients with mild and moderate cases of COVID-19.
The results showed that hydroxychloroquine not only has no therapeutic effect, but may have damaging side effects on the organs.
The study was carried out by several leading Brazilian hospitals such as Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Hospital of Cardiology (HCor), Hospital S erio-Liban in Syria, in collaboration with the Brazilian Clinical Research Institute (BCRI) and the Brazilian Intensive Care Research Network (BRICNet).
On the 25th of local time, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro announced via social media platforms that the fourth nucleic acid test was negative.
During his infection, Bolsonaro has been taking hydroxychloroquine and has been actively promoting it several times.

Four Departments Launch New Round of App Governance to Protect Personal Information Security - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 25 (Reporters Yu Junjie and Chen Aiping) learned from the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) on July 25 that the governance of the illegal collection and use of personal information by the App in 2020 has been officially launched recently, focusing on cracking down on issues that are strongly reflected by the public, such as private uploading of personal information in the background of the App.
It is reported that this round of App governance work is carried out by the Cyberspace Administration of China, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the Ministry of Public Security and the State Administration of Market Supervision.
According to reports, the special governance working group composed of four departments accepted more than 12,000 effective reports from netizens last year, carried out verification on more than 2,300 apps, and took punishment measures such as public exposure, negotiation, and removal from shelves for 260 apps with large scale users and outstanding problems.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), the number of apps has exceeded 5 million, and the problem of collecting and using personal information in violation of laws and regulations has not been solved.
In 2020, governance efforts will be further intensified, and on the basis of App verification, the scope of governance will be further expanded to include SDKs (software development kits) and applets.
It is reported that the working group will conduct special research and in-depth detection on issues such as irregularities in the collection and use of personal biometric information and the abuse of sensitive rights by apps, focusing on the abuse of background rights such as recording and photographing.
According to the circumstances of the discovery of the problem and the severity of the consequences, the working group will make an appointment, give a warning, remove the shelves and impose a fine in accordance with the law, thus effectively deterring the violations.
It is understood that the working group plans to draw up guidelines for the review and management of app stores for the collection and use of personal information, to guide and urge app stores to do a good job in the pre-launch review of apps, and to close the entrance to the app.
In addition, the working group will also release free technical tools to guide SMEs to conduct self-assessment and improve the legal compliance of SMEs' personal information collection and use activities.
Johns Hopkins University: More than 16 million new cases confirmed worldwide - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, New York, July 26,2020/PRNewswire/-- According to the statistics released by Johns Hopkins University on July 26, as of 2:40 a.m. EDT (14:40 a.m. Beijing time) on July 26, the total number of confirmed cases in the world reached 16048,100, with 644,537 deaths.
According to the data, the United States is the worst-hit country in the world, with a total of 4178,027 confirmed cases and 146,460 deaths.
Brazil has a total of 2394,513 confirmed cases and 86,449 deaths, both figures second only to the United States.
Other countries with more than 300,000 confirmed cases include India, Russia, South Africa, Mexico, Peru, Chile and the United Kingdom.
On the 25th, the 2020 Hunan Red Tourism and Culture Festival and the first Xiangtan Red Culture and Industry Expo kicked off in Shaoshan.
In recent years, the demand for red tourism has gradually increased.
However, the development of the red tourism industry is also faced with the dilemma of fewer young groups, homogenization of tourism projects, and single commercial channels.
Especially this year, when the epidemic hit, the national cultural tourism industry suffered a severe setback, and the red tourist attractions also faced severe challenges.
For example, the use of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) filming, VR immersion experience and other scientific and technological means can meet the tourist demand of "people have not arrived, the scenery has arrived"; the introduction of webcast means to promote the famous and special products of the Red Scenic Area can directly enhance the economic benefits of the Red Scenic Area; the introduction of "cloud" technology to create a high-quality display with a prominent theme, distinct orientation and rich connotation, to fully display and enhance the mission function of the Red Scenic Area; the innovation of the communication mode of the Red Culture, to make the revolutionary cultural relics "come alive," to make the Red Tourism popular, to pass on the Red Gene, and to enhance the attraction of the Red Scenic Area.
This cultural festival uses the popular "county (district) mayor + professional anchor special promotion" method to promote the Red Cultural Tourism Specialty, and uses 5G technology to provide real-time viewing and smart city demonstration services to promote the Red Cultural Tourism Attractions. All these efforts are an attempt to insert the wisdom wings into the Red Tourism, and Hunan Red Tourism is expected to become more and more popular.
US-China Trade Talks Delegates to Meet in August
Hong Kong's South China Morning Post reported on August 25, quoting an anonymous source familiar with the situation, that the head of China's trade negotiation team, Vice Premier Liu He, and the US team's co-leader, Trade Representative Lai Haizhe, are expected to hold formal talks in August to assess the implementation of the China-US phase one trade deal.
The report said that although China has significantly increased its purchases of U.S. agricultural products in the past few months, China's purchases are still some distance away from what was promised in the trade deal due to the coronavirus outbreak and other factors.
Analysts say the recent closure of each other's consulates by the United States and China, along with other disputes, could undermine any progress on trade between the two sides.
The Phase 1 trade deal between China and the United States entered into force one month after it was signed on January 15. The agreement stipulates that a high-level trade framework group of the two sides should hold talks every six months.
The meeting will be "an important turning point," allowing both sides to assess the progress of the agreement, according to a person familiar with the matter.
But this person also said that if U.S.-China tensions lead to a lack of willingness to talk at this time, the two sides may agree that the May 8 teleconference between Lai Haizhe and Liu He has met the terms of the semiannual talks in the trade deal.
Since the beginning of this year, China-US relations have deteriorated rapidly. Disputes between the two sides include the origin of the new coronavirus, trade, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, the South China Sea and ideology, among other issues.
Although US President Donald Trump touted his accomplishments in the first phase of the deal at the beginning of the year, his attitude has changed recently.
He said at a White House press conference on the 23rd that although China recently purchased a record amount of US corn in a single day and also bought a lot of soybeans, "this trade deal is no longer as meaningful to me as it was when it was first reached."
An anonymous Beijing government adviser agreed that a new round of trade talks is unlikely due to the poor relationship between the US and China, and that "trade issues have lost weight in China-US relations."
But he revealed that China's economic and trade units still met on the 23rd to discuss a series of issues, including how to increase imports from the US. "We have tried our best to buy, so any additional purchases will be difficult," he said.
Peng Jiening, vice-president of the US-China National Trade Council, said it was "more important than ever" to maintain the momentum of the first-phase agreement, and pointed to China's progress in further opening up its financial markets to US companies this year.
Analysts at Plenum, an independent research firm, said: "It is better to talk than not, although it may only be regarded as a routine matter."
Xinhua News Agency in Beijing on July 26 (reporter Wei Yukun) learned from the Ministry of Emergency Management on July 26 that the State Defense Office and the Ministry of Emergency Management, together with the State Administration of Food and Material Reserves, have once again urgently dispatched 1.35 million woven bags, 1.2 million square meters of woven cloth, 130,000 square meters of geotextile and other six categories of central reserve flood prevention materials to Anhui to support the flood relief and rescue work.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Ministry of Emergency Management, at present, the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the Huaihe River Basin maintain high water level fluctuation, and the "Yangtze River Flood No. 3 of 2020" formed in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River on the 26th, increasing the risk in some areas.
The meteorological department predicts heavy rainfall in Chongqing, Guizhou and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in the next three days, and the flood prevention situation remains grim and complex.
According to reports, since the flood, the Ministry of Emergency Management has deployed the National Comprehensive Fire and Rescue Team to pre-position professional rescue forces in key flood prevention areas. A total of 10,364 flood rescue and rescue operations have been carried out, more than 130,000 commanders, 17,778 fire engines and 11,887 boats have been dispatched, 37,777 people trapped in distress have been rescued and more than 107,000 people have been evacuated and transferred.
Hao Yusheng, Chief Representative of Nasdaq China: Now is the best time for Chinese companies to go to the U.S. for IPOs - Economic Observer - Financial News Website
Economic Observer reporter Zhang Bin because of the Rui Xun coffee fraud incident, the US market has imposed stricter regulations on Chinese stocks, coupled with long-term pressure on valuations, and Chinese stocks listed in the US are feeling the pressure. NetEase, JD.com and other Chinese stocks have recently embarked on the journey of returning to Hong Kong.
And recently, companies such as Shell and Ideal Auto have been enthusiastic about going public in the United States.
Is now the best time for Chinese companies to go public in the U.S. under the epidemic situation and the Chinese stock market crisis?
"As far as the recent IPO cases and the companies that are going to be listed in the United States are concerned, the IPO in the United States has not been affected in essence. Instead, the market is very good now, and even now this is the best time for Chinese companies to go to the United States for IPO in the past 10 years."
Hao Yusheng, chief representative of the Nasdaq Stock Exchange China, said at the "2020 Listed Company Leaders Summit China Shares Branch" hosted by Snowball.
In April this year, the U.S. Securities Regulatory Commission (SEC) and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) issued the "Statement on the Important Role of Audit Quality and Regulatory Access to Audit and Other International Information - A Discussion on the Challenges of Access to Information for U.S. Listed Companies with a Large Business in China."
The statement said that despite the significant increase in international cooperation and coordination in recent years, U.S. regulators still have problems in obtaining information, and the SEC and the PCAOB still face legal and practical challenges. In contrast to the document, the PCAOB website details the list of listed companies and their auditing institutions that have encountered audit obstacles, with a large number of Chinese companies listed.
In addition, in May this year, the U.S. Senate passed the Foreign Companies Accountability Act, which imposes additional disclosure requirements for foreign companies to list in the U.S., according to the report.
In Hao Yusheng's view, the stock market crisis has not affected the appetite of investors.
"When this news first came out, it caused everyone to panic. Everyone was asking if they could go public in the United States in the future, but then we found out that these problems were not a problem for investors. Investors may ask these questions during the recent IPO roadshow in the United States, or even become standardized questions, but this has not been taken as an important factor for investors to invest in a Chinese company or not.
It is suggested that the current situation should be viewed with a sense of normality.
Of course, this may appear to be the most serious situation in the past two years, but as far as investors' appetite is concerned, it has not suffered any impact.
So between now and the end of this year or before the US election, the IPO boom in the US will continue. "
On May 9 this year, Jinshan Cloud was officially listed on the NASDAQ in the US, becoming the first Chinese company to IPO in the US after the epidemic.
"The listing of Jinshan Cloud gives a lot of confidence to the Chinese companies that are preparing for IPO."
Hao Yu-sheng said.
According to Snowball's report on Chinese stocks in the first half of 2020, in the first half of this year, a total of 20 Chinese companies went to the United States for IPOs, an increase of 17.6% over the same period last year. In terms of the total amount of initial capital raised, 20 companies raised a total of 2.725 billion yuan, an increase of more than 52.4% compared to the same period last year. In terms of industry distribution, the number of IPOs in the health care industry was prominent in the first half of this year, an increase of 100% over the same period last year.
According to Hao Yusheng, in the first half of this year, Chinese companies with high quality, excellent fundamentals and high quality of growth will be more favored by investors.
In the short, medium and long term, Hao Yusheng continues to be optimistic about the IPO of Ming China Company in the US.
"In the short term, the IPO boom in the US is still going on; in the medium term, Chinese companies have more choices, A shares, Hong Kong shares and US shares. You will consider the US election and China-US relations as factors for market choices and time choices. In the long term, everything will return to normal, and market fluctuations will be cyclical. Both political and economic cycles will eventually return to normal, and the stock market has always moved forward with volatility."
At the same time, Hao Yusheng said, "There are many uncertainties this year, but for high-quality companies, no matter how good or bad the market is, as long as they are solid and have the growth that investors can see, other factors are relatively minor. Investors need to invest in excellent Chinese companies."

Subsequently, Zhang Haochen returned to the audience with a performance of Chopin's posthumous "Nocturne in C minor."
After a brief stage adjustment, Yang Yang conducted the National Central Theatre Orchestra to play Rachmaninoff's last large-scale orchestra work, "Symphonic Dance," in which the composer presented more introspective emotions and incorporated his new inspirations and memories of his past compositions and homeland.
In Yang Yang's calm and calm treatment, the melancholy temperament and grand atmosphere of this work are revealed, and the orchestra will perform Rachmaninov's "Last Spark" in a brilliant way.
The performance of this concert has once again brought unexpected surprise to the audience during the lead performance.
CCTV's "News Lianhe" anchor Gang Qiang came to the backstage dressing room of the National Grand Theatre to reveal the "stronghold" of music masters such as Jegeyev and Lang Lang before they took the stage. Then he came to the public space on the first floor of the National Grand Theatre and had a quick dialogue with Yang Yang, Zhang Haochen and the National Grand Theatre tuner in front of the three storied nine-foot pianos. Gang Qiang discussed with them the maintenance and maintenance of the piano, Rachmaninov's music, the musicians' usual life and the preparation before the performance from the perspective of a senior piano lover. At the end of the guided tour, Gang Qiang also collaborated with Zhang Haochen on "Relay" of Schumann's "Dream Song," so that the audience of netizens could feast their eyes.
In the evening, at the National Grand Theatre's Taihu Amphitheatre, the military anthem was loud and clear - the military chorus song concert kicked off with the melodious "Never Forget the First Heart."
This is the first performance of the National Grand Theatre's "Taihu Week Concert" since the anti-epidemic period.
It is reported that on August 1, conductor Zheng Jian will continue to bring "Soldiers and the Motherland" with the National Grand Theatre Choir - the National Grand Theatre's Choral Concert to Celebrate the August 1st Military Day. As a series of online performances of "Sounds like Summer Flowers," the concert will be broadcast live on the Internet, paying tribute to the soldiers defending the motherland in the classic song.

People's Daily commentator: Focus on doing one's own thing well to build new advantages for future development: On learning and implementing General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech at the Entrepreneurs' Symposium - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 25,2020/PRNewswire/-- People's Daily, July 26, commentator's article: Focus on doing your own thing well to create new advantages for future development
At present, the global epidemic situation and the world economic situation are still grim and complex, and the challenges facing China's development are unprecedented.
Maintaining strategic determination, enhancing confidence in winning and concentrating on doing our own thing well are the keys to coping with all kinds of risks and challenges.
At the Entrepreneurs' Symposium held recently, General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed that under the current external environment of rising protectionism, sluggish world economy and shrinking global market, we must concentrate our efforts on doing our own thing well, give full play to the advantages of the domestic super-large market, gradually form a new development pattern featuring domestic large circulation as the main body and domestic and international dual circulation promoting each other, improve the level of modernization of the supply chain of the industrial chain, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation, accelerate key core technology research, and build new advantages for future development.
He who looks at the situation is wise, and he who controls the situation wins.
Under the external environment of the deepening development of economic globalization, the market and resources "outside at both ends" have played an important role in China's rapid development.
At present, the world under the impact of the epidemic is undergoing profound changes, facing more unstable and uncertain factors, and economic globalization is encountering headwinds and turning back waves.
A very important aspect is to take the expansion and meeting of domestic demand as the strategic basis for development, give full play to its own advantages, add impetus to China's economic development through the prosperity of the domestic economy and the smooth flow of the domestic cycle, and drive the world economic recovery.
We should deeply realize that the construction of a complete domestic demand system has a bearing on our country's long-term development and long-term stability.
The CPC Central Committee reviewed the situation and clearly put forward the strategy of firmly implementing the expansion of domestic demand, which is needed to cope with the impact of the epidemic, to maintain the long-term sustainable and healthy development of China's economy, and to meet the growing needs of the people for a better life.
The advantage of a large country's economy is that it can be recycled internally.
China has the world's most complete and largest industrial system, strong production capacity and perfect supporting capacity. It has more than 100 million market entities and 170 million people with higher education or various professional skills, as well as a super-large domestic demand market formed by a population of 1.4 billion, including more than 400 million middle-income groups. It is in the stage of rapid development of new-type industrialization, informatization, urbanization and agricultural modernization, with huge investment demand potential.
With public ownership as the main body and multiple forms of ownership developing together, distribution according to work as the main body and multiple modes of distribution coexist, the socialist market economy system and other basic socialist economic systems can not only stimulate the vitality of various market entities, liberate and develop the productive forces, but also promote the organic unity of efficiency and fairness, and continuously achieve common prosperity.
We need to firmly grasp the strategic basis of expanding domestic demand, make all aspects of production, distribution and circulation rely more on the domestic market to achieve a virtuous cycle, clarify the strategic direction of supply-side structural reform, and promote the dynamic balance between aggregate supply and aggregate demand at a higher level.
It is necessary to speed up the construction of a complete domestic demand system, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation and other aspects of innovation, accelerate the promotion of digital economy, intelligent manufacturing, life and health, new materials and other strategic emerging industries, and form more new growth points and poles, and gradually form a new development pattern featuring domestic large circulation as the main body and domestic and international dual circulation promoting each other.
Opening-up leads to progress, and closeness is bound to fall behind.
General Secretary Xi Jinping has stressed many times that the door of China's opening will not be closed, but will only open wider and wider.
Taking the domestic large circulation as the main body, it is by no means a closed operation behind closed doors. Instead, the domestic market and the international market will be better connected by leveraging the potential of domestic demand, making better use of the two international and domestic markets and resources, and achieving stronger and more sustainable development.
At the same time, there is no contradiction between expanding domestic demand and expanding opening-up. The smoother the domestic circulation, the more conducive it is to building a new pattern of opening-up, and the more conducive it is to forming new advantages in participating in international cooperation and competition.
Although protectionism is on the rise in the world, we need to stand on the right side of history, continue to deepen reform and expand opening-up, strengthen opening-up and cooperation in science and technology, promote the building of an open world economy and a community with a shared future for mankind.
The Chinese nation has experienced many tribulations in its history, but it has never been crushed. Instead, it has become more and more courageous, constantly growing up and rising from the tribulations.
On the way forward, with the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core, the remarkable advantages of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, strong mobilization ability and strong comprehensive strength, and the unity and struggle of the entire Party, the armed forces and the people of all ethnic groups, we will surely overcome all difficulties and obstacles, maintain the sound momentum of China's economic and social development, build a moderately prosperous society in all respects, and smoothly start a new journey of building a modern socialist country in all respects.
Yu Bao earnings down "after 90" instead of "retaliatory" savings?
With the income of Yu Bao going down, "after 90" not only did not flee Yu Bao, but began to "retaliate" to save money?
According to the "Report on Saving Money After 90" (2020 edition) recently released by the China Academy of New Economics and Alipay, in the first half of the year, "After 90" was more interested in saving money: The amount of money saved per capita increased by nearly 40% compared to 2019.
Interestingly, "after 90" is more inclined to start with a "small sum of money," with 60% of the average amount of money saved below 20 yuan...
Saving money with Yu Bao has also become a habit of saving money after "90."
According to the data, out of the 700 million YueBao users, 134 million users are "after 90."
There are 174 million "post-90s" in China, that is, about 3 out of every 4 "post-90s" in the country are saving money with Yu Bao.
At present, the seven-day annualized rate of return for money funds such as Yu Bao has dropped to about 1.5% from above 2% at the beginning of the year.
Even so, it did not affect the pace of saving money after "90."
Under the background of the improvement of "saving money effect" of Yu Bao, many young people who are used to using Yu Bao are also directly transformed into "basic people."
Alipay data shows that, as of July 13, the number of new "basic citizens" on Alipay has more than doubled in the past month, and more and more young people are achieving "advanced" financial management on Alipay.
Some analysts believe that the inflow of funds from YueBao into the stock market is also an important reason for the clear decline in the share of money funds in June.
The report also shows that "after 90" girls are more likely to save more money, with an average of 20% higher than the amount of money saved by boys. Among the users holding funds on the Alipay platform, 60% are men, and women tend to choose more robust financial management methods compared to men.
After saving money, what is the plan for "after 90"?
Alipay data shows that "after 90" has the habit of saving money for the goal, and the users who take travel as the goal of saving money are the most numerous.
As a result of the pandemic, many "post-90s" have saved money to prepare for post-pandemic travel; the resumption of cinemas has also provided a new way to shift from saving money to spending.

The brightly colored Party flag is flying high on the flood-resistant levee, which is the holding of the position and also the clarion call of the charge.
In the face of flood and flood disaster, Party organizations at all levels acted swiftly, sounded the "vanguard" of flood resistance, and planted the bright Party flag on the levee of flood resistance. The vast majority of Party members and cadres and the people's army held the position of flood resistance, and with the will and action of "the Party flag is in the position" and "the flood will never recede," they became the most assured and trustworthy solid barrier for the people in the disaster area.
It is selfless dedication and responsibility for the brightly colored Party flag to fly high on the flood resistance levee.
In times of crisis, when the lives and property of the people are under serious threat, Party members and cadres, the people's army and soldiers, with selfless dedication, dare to take responsibility for winning the hard battle of flood prevention, flood relief and disaster relief, as the main battlefield and military parade ground for comprehensively testing ability, style and quality, it is this spirit of selfless dedication and commitment that greatly inspires the confidence and determination of the people in the disaster areas to overcome the disaster and build up a strong spiritual force to win flood prevention, flood relief and disaster relief.
"People first, life first," not only in peacetime to accept the test, but also in the critical moment to accept the test.
On the anti-flood levee, Party members and cadres and the people's army should let the people see the bright red Party flag, the figure of struggle and the voice of encouragement everywhere at any time.

(Fighting New Corona Pneumonia) 13 people have tested positive in the Information Department of the Philippine Presidential Office
Manila, July 26 (Reporter Guan Xiangdong) - The Department of Information (PCOO) of the Philippine Presidential Office announced on July 25 that its Secretary Martin Andanar tested negative for COVID-19 on July 24.
By the afternoon of the same day, a total of 13 PCOO staff members had tested positive, after three positive cases, one dead and two still receiving treatment.
On the 24th, Andanar and 49 PCOO staff members were tested for COVID-19 because they had contact with an infected PCOO staff member.
The report released on the 25th showed that 10 of the staff members had tested positive.
Marvin Gatpayat, Deputy Minister of Administration and Legal Affairs of the PCOO, said that the new administrative office building of the ministry, located in the Presidential Palace, was scheduled to resume operations on the day of President Duterte's fifth State of the Nation Address on the 27th.
On the same day, Martin Andanar assured the public that the PCOO will continue to fulfill its duty to the Filipino people to ensure that important information is provided to the public in a timely manner, while strengthening contact tracing and testing to avoid further spread of COVID-19 among the PCOO staff.

France ramps up military spending in space - Xinhua
French Defense Minister Florence Parly said on the 24th that France will increase its space defense budget by hundreds of millions of euros and develop military forces in space to guard against "unfriendly actions" that other countries may make in outer space.
Parly told La Provence the same day that between 2019 and 2025, the budget for France's military space program will increase to 4.3 billion euros ($5 billion), up from 3.6 billion euros ($4.2 billion) previously proposed.
According to the French Military Planning Act 2019-2025, approved by the French Parliament in 2018, France is expected to update its existing observation and communications satellites, launch three electromagnetic listening satellites, and modernize its space surveillance radar.
French President Emmanuel Macron announced in July last year that the French Air Force would establish a Space Military Command and an "Aerospace and Space Force."
Parly said she will formally announce the creation of the Space Force when she visits a military academy in Salon, Provence, later.
The Space Force, which is part of the Air Force, will have 500 personnel by 2025, Parly said.
"The idea that space serves the common interests of science is gone forever," she said. "Today, space is a place where nations compete for global supremacy."
Parly reiterated Macron's previous remarks, saying the French side has no intention of provoking an arms race.
"We are by no means engaged in an arms race, but it is my duty to fully recognize the threats we may face."
Parly recounted the 2017 surveillance of a military satellite shared by France and Italy.
"Peeping" is a Russian satellite, she said.
The Russian side denies this claim.
Parly said France will "very soon" have small patrol satellites capable of detecting and targeting "those behind unfriendly moves."
According to French media, France is seeking to establish a space force because US President Donald Trump asked the US Department of Defense last February to draft a bill for the creation of a space force.
Trump signed the National Defense Authorization Act into law last December, authorizing the creation of the Pacific Air Force, the sixth largest military service in the US.
Some experts worry that these moves by the US have accelerated the pace of militarization of US space and may trigger a new round of space arms race.

Report says shared accommodation market has picked up since March - CNN.com
(Reporter Yang Zhaokui) "China Shared Accommodation Development Report 2020" (hereinafter referred to as the "Report") recently released by the National Information Center's Sharing Economy Research Center shows that due to the impact of the epidemic, the transaction volume of China's shared accommodation market decreased by 72.1% year on year in the first five months of 2020.
However, the shared accommodation market began to pick up in March, with the market gradually recovering in terms of transaction volume, order volume and reception numbers.
According to the report, the volume of transactions in the shared accommodation market fell sharply. On the one hand, the demand for travel accommodation dropped sharply under the epidemic prevention and control, and the volume of orders decreased sharply. In the first five months, the total volume of orders fell by 65% year on year, and the number of visitors dropped by 63% year on year. On the other hand, the weak demand also led to a significant decline in the price of overnight stays. In the first five months, the average price of overnight stays fell by 16% year on year.
However, in March, April and May, the market turnover increased by 78%, 199% and 35%, respectively; the number of orders increased by 141%, 152% and 50%, respectively; and the number of visitors increased by 81%, 112% and 28%, respectively.
"The report" pointed out that the development of shared accommodation industry is promising for a long time, but there are still many uncertainties in the near future.
In this regard, Yu Fengxia, deputy director of the Sharing Economy Research Center of the State Information Center, told the reporter of Workers' Daily that the development of shared accommodation needs stronger policy support. On the one hand, it is necessary to do a good job in implementing the policies already promulgated in the previous period, further strengthen policy advocacy, and focus on creating a better business environment. On the other hand, it is necessary to further strengthen policy guidance and support from various aspects such as stimulating consumer demand, enriching the supply of tourism accommodation services, innovating service methods, and strengthening cooperation between the government and platform enterprises.

Xiamen, July 26 (Yang Fushan Zhang Shushan Xu Jingyi) China's famous vascular surgery center, Shanghai Changhai Hospital of Naval Medical University, signed a contract with Zhongshan Hospital of Vascular Surgery affiliated to Xiamen University on the 25th to jointly set up a cooperation center to promote exchanges and cooperation between the two sides in the field of vascular surgery, especially in the field of acute and severe diseases of the aorta.
According to Zhongshan Hospital affiliated to Xiamen University, after the two hospitals have officially formed a cooperative unit for vascular surgery, they will conduct remote consultation, formulate treatment plan with Changhai Hospital for real-time online consultation, select talents for further study and training, and jointly carry out weekly surgical technology exchange, teaching and checking rooms, etc. For complex cases, Changhai experts can be invited to perform surgery according to the needs of the patients, thus realizing that the patients in southwest Fujian can enjoy the top medical resources in the country without going to the province.
The two hospitals will also work together to carry out innovative research on surgery, popularization of aortic diseases and early screening, among others.
Organized by Beijing Health Promotion Association and hosted by Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University, the special seminar on aorta was held in Xiamen on the same day.
The above-mentioned two well-known hospitals in Shanghai and Shanghai held the signing ceremony of the Vascular Surgery Collaboration Center at the same time, announcing the formation of a cooperative unit to jointly improve the level of treatment of vascular surgery-related diseases in southwest Fujian.
Shanghai Changhai Hospital Vascular Surgery is the only research institute of vascular surgery in the army and the only clinical medical center of vascular system diseases in Shanghai. It is also the first national key discipline of vascular surgery, leading the establishment of the professional committee of endovascular medicine of the Chinese Association of Physicians, and is a top team with deep accumulation in the industry.
Professor Huang Xiaojin, Director of Vascular Surgery of Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University, was interviewed by the media.
Vascular Surgery of Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University is the first vascular surgery in Fujian Province with an independent discipline. It has long been dedicated to the diagnosis and treatment of aortic and peripheral vascular diseases. In 2018, it was approved to build a provincial key clinical specialty.
In the treatment of aortic diseases, in addition to the treatment of dissecting aneurysms and aortic aneurysms, he has rich experience in the emergency treatment of ruptured aortic aneurysms.
"The history of vascular surgery at Zhongshan Hospital affiliated to Xiamen University, the breadth, difficulty and complexity of the operation, are outstanding in the region. Therefore, this time, we have set up a collaboration center. Besides the aorta, we can also carry out in-depth cooperation in medicine, teaching and scientific research on the diagnosis and treatment of diseases such as lower extremity artery and carotid artery," he said.
Professor Feng Rui, deputy director of vascular surgery at Shanghai Changhai Hospital, said.
Zhongshan Hospital affiliated to Xiamen University and Shanghai Changhai Hospital signed a contract to set up "Li Zhaoshen Famous Medicine Studio" in the department of gastroenterology in 2018.
Professor Huang Xiaojin, Director of Vascular Surgery of the hospital, said in an interview with CNN.com that the hospital also has a long history of communication with Changhai Hospital. This time, the two hospitals officially formed a cooperative unit, bringing the cooperation and exchange between the two sides to a new level.
He said that the hospital will regularly invite Shanghai experts to come to the building to carry out surgical technology exchange, teaching room inspection and discussion of difficult cases. At the same time, it will further carry out remote consultation. At present, it plans to conduct remote consultation once a week. In addition, the department will also select personnel for further study and exchange, and strengthen the training and development of the talent team in disciplines.
The reporter learned at the meeting that vascular disease is the leading cause of death in China, and the aorta plays an important role as the main route for all organs of the human body, flowing from the heart to the whole body.
The occurrence of aortic diseases is often accompanied by high risk, high mortality and high difficulty in treatment. The thickest section of the aorta is up to 4 cm in diameter. Once a hemangioma is formed, a rupture occurs, or a rupture of the lining of the blood vessel produces a dissection, which can lead to heavy bleeding. It is very dangerous.
In recent years, as people's lifestyles have changed and the pace of life has accelerated, China has become the largest country in the world for hypertension, and the number of aortic diseases has also increased. Now, with the development of surgical techniques and industrial materials, the treatment of aortic diseases has continued to develop in a minimally invasive, rapid and efficient direction.
Doctors can properly "channel" blood flow by puncturing the thigh and placing a stent in the aorta, thus avoiding the impact on the aneurysm or ruptured dissection and achieving good results. Some surgeries even require only local anesthesia.
More than a dozen domestic experts were invited to the symposium to discuss the new progress in the treatment of aortic diseases, and to carry out cutting-edge technical training and discussion of difficult cases in the form of conference salons.
Reporters learned at the meeting that with the development of surgical techniques and industrial materials, the current treatment of aortic diseases continues to develop in the direction of minimally invasive, rapid and efficient.

Chongqing, July 26 (Reporter Han Lu) reporter learned from China Railway Chengdu Bureau Group Co., Ltd on the 26th that the 18.9-kilometer-long Zhengwan High-Speed Railway Xiaosanxia Tunnel was completed on the same day.
It is understood that the Little Three Gorges Tunnel is not only the longest high-speed rail tunnel within the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, but also the longest single-hole, double-track high-speed rail tunnel with a design speed of 350 kilometers per hour, which is currently under construction in China.
Zhengwan high-speed railway is located in Henan, Hubei and Chongqing provinces and cities. It connects Beijing-Guangzhou and Xulan high-speed railway in Zhengzhou north and Yuwan high-speed railway in Wanzhou south to Chongqing. It is an important part of the "eight longitudinal and eight horizontal" high-speed railway network in China along the river and the Huonantong Road.
The Little Three Gorges Tunnel of Zhengwan-Wan High-Speed Railway was completed on the 26th.
The picture shows through the scene.
The Zhengwan high-speed railway starts in Zhengzhou City, Henan Province, and runs southwest through Pingdingshan City, Nanyang City, and Xiangyang City, Hubei Province, to Wanzhou District, Chongqing. The new line is about 818 kilometers long, with a design speed of 350 kilometers per hour, and about 184 kilometers in Chongqing.
Among them, the Zhengzhou-Xiangyang section was opened for operation on December 1,2019, and the Chongqing section is stepping up construction.
The Little Three Gorges Tunnel, which was completed on the 26th, is a control project for the Zhengwan-Wan high-speed railway. The project is located at the junction of Fengjie County and Wushan County in Chongqing, with a total length of 18.9 kilometers and a maximum burial depth of 890 meters.
Construction of the tunnel began in February 2017, and the entire line was opened on July 26,2020.
According to Wang Guojun, head of Zhengwan High-speed Railway Tunnel Design Co., Ltd., China Railway Second Academy Engineering Group Co., Ltd., the surveying and designing party, the location of the Little Three Gorges Tunnel is very complicated in terms of topography and geological conditions, and it faces risks such as karst, mud-gushing water, and large deformation of soft rock. It is a Grade I high-risk tunnel, and the tunnel design and construction is extremely difficult.
"During the construction of the project, we used geological survey method, geophysical prospecting method and advanced drilling method to advance the geological forecast, and adopted a special design scheme for more than 30 karst caves of various types. For example, we designed and built a bridge with a length of 24 meters, and crossed a large karst cave with a longitudinal length of more than 10 meters and a depth of more than 55 meters in the tunnel to avoid the settlement of the tunnel," said Wang Guojun.
According to the China Railway Tunnel Bureau of the construction party, when the tunnel was constructed, the combination of diversion and plugging was adopted to ensure the orderly progress of the project through the construction of Hengdong flat guide, grouting and plugging, strengthening the structural support of the tunnel and the construction of a sewage treatment station. At the same time, it also avoided the damage of construction and drainage to the water body of the Little Three Gorges Scenic Area. At the same time, it successfully overcame the construction problems such as the bad geology such as the large deformation of soft rock up to 7 kilometers long, and the maximum daily water inrush of 157,000 cubic meters of mud and water.
After the completion and opening of the entire Zhengwan high-speed railway line, it will become a new convenient and fast main passageway to the Central Plains, North China and Northeast China in southwest China. It is of great significance to improve the capacity and quality of the Northeast to Northeast railway passageway in southwest China, improve the layout of the regional road network, speed up the development of tourism resources and urbanization along the route, promote the coordinated development of the region, and promote the implementation of the strategy for the development of the western region.
Experts say it is unconstitutional to collect immigration data through the U.S. Census for apportioning House seats
Several civil rights groups and several U.S. cities and counties have sued the federal government, saying President Trump's administration's attempt to exclude undocumented immigrants from the U.S. Census is unworkable and unconstitutional.
The U.S. Census will determine the allocation of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Sara Brannon, executive attorney of the American Civil Liberties Union, told VOA, "This is not going to work."
She went on to say that Trump's request to determine the citizenship status of census takers is difficult to do and "not very reliable."
Another civil liberties group, Common Cause, filed a lawsuit Thursday challenging Trump's executive order.
Some cities in New Jersey and Georgia joined the lawsuit.
Arlington County, Virginia, joined the lawsuit on Friday.
"The U.S. Constitution requires an accurate count of our population every 10 years," said Garvey, chairman of Arlington County's governing board. "We must accurately count everyone who lives in Arlington County. This illegal attempt to scare people away and reduce the number of people in our immigrant community must not be allowed to succeed."
Other organizations and individuals have praised President Trump's executive order.
Alabama Attorney General Marshall called the executive order a "victory" for the state.
"The allocation of congressional seats and electoral college seats in each state must be based on the number of residents living in each state, and the number of residents who are legally resident," he said.
The U.S. Supreme Court last year blocked the Trump administration from including a citizenship question in the 2020 census.
President Trump signed an executive order earlier this week directing Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who oversees the U.S. Census Bureau, to submit data on the undocumented population from the census so that the administration can exclude the undocumented population from each state's census count and determine whether each state will increase or decrease or retain seats in the House.
Every 10 years, the United States redistributes seats in the House of Representatives based on demographic changes.

Responding to the Situation and Promoting the Construction of Industrial Projects - View the Headlines - Hunan Daily Online - Huasheng Online
In the middle of summer in Hunan, the heat wave hit the surface.
And the enthusiasm released by the provincial industrial project construction promotion site observation meeting overshadowed the heat of the three-volt day, and the clear guidance of "industry over strength, project over hero" encouraged the three Hunan and four waters.
The development of Hunan has always depended on construction projects and cultivation of industries.
In the face of the highly unusual first half of the year, under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core, the whole province persevered in a game of chess, made all-out efforts to fight the two hard battles of epidemic prevention and flood prevention, and took industrial projects as the "first move" to implement the "six stability" and "six guarantees."
From a 1.9% year-on-year decline in GDP in the first quarter to a 1.3% year-on-year increase in the first half of the year, it is self-evident how difficult the period has been and how hard it has been.
On this precious report card, the construction of industrial projects is the key support for Hunan to speed up economic recovery, develop steadily and improve.
The potential is smooth and irreversible.
The construction of industrial projects should be put into the overall situation, not only good at building up momentum, building momentum and seeking momentum, but also good at recognizing change, seeking change and responding to the situation.
Against the backdrop of the current complex and severe international situation, in addition to the painstaking efforts to attract investment, it is also necessary to study the new situation and new features, grasp the law more, be more scientific and precise, and better integrate into the new development pattern featuring domestic large circulation as the main body and domestic and international dual circulation promoting each other.
More attention will be paid to improving the industrial base capacity.
In the first half of the year, not only did a large number of heavyweight investment projects in emerging industries in our province break ground and sow hope, but also enterprises in industries with traditional advantages accelerated the distribution of digital, intelligent and green industrial transformation and fell like a fly.
The third science park project of Yiyang Aoshikang revamped the existing production line, and the intelligent production line of high-end printed circuit boards took the lead. The new factory of Changde Cigarette Factory in Hunan Province is committed to the process of intelligent transformation and construction of a modern factory. It is also a vivid portrayal of "old trees sprout new shoots." Focusing on the major national strategy and "two new and one," the project focuses on consolidating and upgrading the advantaged industries, actively cultivating and developing the emerging industries, and comprehensively increasing scientific and technological innovation and localization substitution, so as to continuously consolidate the basic conditions and accumulate the momentum of transformation.
More attention will be paid to fostering new business models for the development of new economies.
The sudden outbreak of the coronavirus has brought the popularity of the "cloud economy," stimulated the potential of the digital economy and provided new opportunities for industrial transformation. In the first half of the year, the computer and office equipment manufacturing industry, electronics and communication equipment manufacturing industry in our province grew by 12.6%, the online retail sales of wholesale and retail enterprises above the quota increased by 32.2%, and the online meal expenses income of catering enterprises increased by 35.6%.
It is the general trend to nurture new opportunities in the crisis, open new bureaus in the midst of changes, actively promote digital industrialization and industrial digitization, and guide the integrated development of the digital economy and the real economy.
Pay more attention to optimizing and stabilizing the supply chain of the industrial chain.
Construction machinery is the main force in Hunan's industry, but two-thirds of the supporting enterprises are outside the province, and there is still room and potential in the supporting chain.
To strengthen the industrial chain thinking to grasp the project, it is necessary not only to have the leading enterprises to continuously accumulate and achieve technological breakthroughs in the key links of the industrial chain; it is also necessary to cultivate all over the world to stimulate the "chain" lock response by strengthening the chain extension chain, promote the coordinated layout of related supporting industries, and accelerate the construction of an independent, controllable, safe and reliable industrial chain supply chain.
Overcoming difficulties and strengthening enterprises, Hunan is still a hot and promising land with a good business environment and emerging market opportunities.
In the process of recovering the losses caused by the epidemic, all kinds of "do everything possible" to identify the shortcomings and pain points, and achieve the living story of turning the crisis into an opportunity, Shaoyang implements the "shareholder-style" service, without prevarication, without discounting the implementation of policies, and without overnight solution of problems.
Single-mindedly researching industries, cultivating industries, developing industries, and solidly optimizing the business environment will surely win the favor of more investors.
The wind and waves ahead are still there, but the state of riding the waves has become the norm for the whole province to grasp the construction of industrial projects and promote high-quality development.
During this critical period, we must study and implement the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's series of important instructions and instructions, effectively deal with external uncertainties with the certainty of our own work, persistently push forward the construction of industrial projects, share enthusiasm and sweat together, and ensure the successful conclusion of the 13th Five-Year Plan and the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects.

Cultivating new forms of business opens up new space for employment - CNN.com
New forms of employment continue to emerge, opening up new spaces for employment, and a number of innovative service policies continue to be introduced, helping new forms of employment to thrive.
According to the latest data from the National Bureau of Statistics, the surveyed unemployment rate in urban areas was 5.7 percent in June, 0.2 percentage points lower than in May.
This is also the second consecutive drop in the surveyed unemployment rate in urban areas since April. Behind the decline in the unemployment rate data month by month is the new employment opportunities emerging from new business forms.
Now the monthly salary of more than 5,000, coupled with the novelty of embracing information technology, has made Guo Mei more and more energetic.
In the innovation incubation base of Shanxi Transformation and Comprehensive Reform Demonstration Zone, there are more than 2,300 data markers.
Not only are they data markers, but since the beginning of this year, the state has also defined 25 occupations, including nucleic acid testers and e-learning service providers, as new occupations, developed vocational skill standards, and launched skill training programs to support the development of practitioners.
In view of the new employment mode and the new entrepreneurial path, the state is also innovating the employment service.
Recently, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and 13 other departments jointly issued the "Opinions on Supporting the Healthy Development of New Business Patterns and Activating the Consumption Market to Drive the Expansion of Employment," providing various employment opportunities for labourers.
Multiple departments will work together to foster new individuals in the market and further reduce the cost of online entrepreneurship and employment for self-employed workers. Policies such as protection of rights and interests and social security for flexible employment will be introduced in succession to make new forms of employment more secure.

The Overall Stability of Employment and Prices Reveals "Temperature" in the Economy - CNN.com

The overall stability of employment and prices shows that the economy has a "temperature"
Lin Huochan, reporter of Economic Daily and China Economic Network
In the first half of this year, in the face of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, China made overall efforts to promote epidemic prevention and control and economic and social development. The situation of epidemic prevention and control continued to improve, and the steady recovery of the economy was evident. Employment and price performance, which are closely related to people's livelihood, were generally stable. The Chinese economy handed over a report card of economic operation with a temperature.
In the first two months of this year, the surveyed unemployment rate rose.
Especially in February, the production and operation activities of many enterprises were basically shut down, the employment demand of enterprises decreased, the recruitment was delayed or canceled, and the surveyed unemployment rate in urban areas increased.
With the gradual improvement of the situation of epidemic prevention and control, the order of production and life of the whole society has been continuously restored.
The CPC Central Committee adheres to the general tone of seeking progress while maintaining stability, further intensifies macro policy hedging, comprehensively strengthens the employment priority policy, and actively promotes the work of aiding enterprises to stabilize and expand employment.
China has increased policy hedging to stabilize jobs, launched a policy combination of "relief and reprieve," reduced and exempted the contributions of three social insurance units in a phased manner, allowed deferred payment of social insurance premiums, expanded the benefits of unemployment insurance for small and medium-sized enterprises and work-for-hire training policies, and provided subsidies and traineeships for enterprises to absorb employment of key groups.
With the implementation of various policies to stabilize employment, the employment demand of enterprises has steadily picked up, the employment situation has gradually improved, and the surveyed unemployment rate in urban areas has gradually declined. In June, the surveyed unemployment rate was 5.7 percent.
Zhang Yi, director of the Department of Population and Employment Statistics of the National Bureau of Statistics, said that in the second quarter, various employment policies continued to bear fruit, and the labor force that exited earlier due to the impact of the epidemic returned one after another. In June, the labor force participation rate in urban areas increased by about 10 percentage points compared to February, which is close to the level of the same period last year.
According to the data, total urban employment increased by more than 19 percent in June compared to February, with most industries reaching pre-epidemic levels. The average working hours of employees in enterprises reached 46.8 hours per week, 6.6 hours higher than in February and 0.1 hours higher than in January.
Prices are also linked to thousands of households.
In January, the year-on-year rise in the CPI was 5.4%, the highest in years.
In February, the year-on-year rate of CPI growth declined slightly, but it was still in the "5 range."
The year-on-year rise in the CPI is at a high level, driven by both consumer demand before the Spring Festival, as well as the wrong month for the Spring Festival and a low year-on-year base.
However, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on prices has been particularly pronounced.
Affected by the epidemic prevention and control, in January and February, all over the country, there were delays in logistics, untimely supplies of materials, and increased transportation costs of materials. In addition, some citizens hoarded and snapped up goods, and the prices of some necessities of life increased significantly.
In order to cope with the disruption caused by the epidemic prevention and control to the price situation, relevant departments have included important daily necessities in the scope of emergency transportation guarantee to ensure the smooth transportation of materials.
Under the influence of a series of policies and measures, the supply of vegetables, fruits and melons in the market is effectively guaranteed.
In order to cope with the rapid rise in pork prices at the beginning of this year, after the central government promulgated the policy of maintaining supply and price stability, all regions and departments quickly implemented it. The supply of pork reserves improved markedly, the production capacity of pigs was restored in an orderly manner, and the production and marketing order gradually became normal.
Since March, the price of pork has been falling continuously. In May, the year-on-year increase in food prices fell to 10.6%. In June, the price of pork rose slightly on a month-on-month basis due to factors such as a slowdown in the production of pigs, a decrease in imports and a rebound in the demand for group consumption.
Seasonal changes in fresh vegetable prices were evident, with an average increase of 3.4% in the first half of the year.
Affected by the relatively high base in the same period last year, fresh fruit prices continued to decline year-on-year, falling by an average of 13.3% in the first half of the year.
The basic livelihood of the masses has been effectively guaranteed and the overall economic and social situation has remained stable and orderly.
With the gradual resumption of transportation and logistics, the supply and demand situation in the market has improved.
Since March, the CPI has declined for four consecutive months, and the year-on-year rate of increase has dropped from 4.3% in March to 2.5% in June. Overall, the price level has returned to a stable level.
In the second half of the year, China's prices will remain at a moderate level, with little overall inflationary pressure. However, it is still necessary to promote the restoration of production and living order under the premise of doing a good job in normalizing epidemic prevention and control.
We will effectively deal with natural disasters such as floods and droughts in major agricultural producing areas such as grain, fruits and vegetables, strengthen market supervision, and resolutely crack down on acts such as hoarding and price gouging that disrupt market order.

Author Hu Guilong Pan Yujie
"On the shores of Qinghai Lake in midsummer, the eyes are full of golden flowers and thousands of bees are flying. Here, the altitude is high, the temperature difference between day and night is large, and the air pollution is low. The intense light breeds the most tenacious and generous bee colonies, creating the characteristics of Qinghai royal jelly with high activity, high protein, high nutritional value, low sugar and low fat."
On the 26th, Zhang Jianxun, deputy director of the Bureau of Industry and Information of Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, said.
On the same day, the live broadcast of "Concentric War Epidemic Spring Pulp Helping Farmers" bee products was held on the shores of Qinghai Lake. Representatives of China Bee Products Association, entrepreneurs, bee farmers and other parties gathered to jointly promote the characteristic bee products in Qinghai. A total of nearly 10,000 bottles of royal jelly from Qinghai Plateau were sold online and offline, with a total of nearly 3.8 million yuan in goods.
The picture shows beekeepers displaying bee products at the scene.
It is reported that the live broadcast with goods activities with the help of Beijing Houde Li Bee chain stores network, Kuaishou, Taobao and other well-known domestic bee products retail enterprises, live broadcast, e-commerce platform, to promote the exchange and cooperation of "enterprises + beekeepers + growers," and through online and offline channels continue to issue "Qinghai Plateau Spring Pulp Consumption Coupons" to consumers, the total annual profit of enterprises is expected to be nearly 5.28 million yuan.
In this regard, Wu Na, president of Beijing Houde Li Bee Co., Ltd., thinks it is "worth it": "This move can expand the visibility of Qinghai bee products, attract more consumers to understand and like the bee products without adding pure nature, and drive beekeepers to increase their income."
At present, the company has signed production cooperation strategic agreements with Qinghai Cloud Bee Industry Co., Ltd., and Qinghai Huabao Bee Industry Co., Ltd., hoping to jointly promote the rapid development of local bee industry in Qinghai.
The picture shows the sea of rapeseed on the Qinghai Lake.
This spring, due to the epidemic prevention and control, road checkpoints were set up all over the country. The way of beekeepers "chasing flowers and nectar" was blocked. Many bees died because they missed the flowering period and lacked food. The income of beekeepers was severely affected.
"Throughout the year, beekeepers travel long distances following the flowering period, moving from Yunnan and Sichuan all the way north to the Northwest. They sleep rough and have no fixed place to live. They work very hard.
As a business, we have a responsibility to help them. "
Una said.
"Small bees are'environmental scouts', and bees cannot survive in heavily polluted areas," said Zhao Xiaochuan, executive vice president of China Bee Products Association. Bee pollination is an important link in the ecological chain and plays an irreplaceable role in protecting plant diversity and improving the ecological environment.
At the same time, bee pollination can increase crop yield and improve quality, especially in areas with extensive species and poor management conditions, pollination is of greater significance.
According to the research data, pollination can increase rapeseed production by 15% -30%.
The picture shows Zhao Xiaochuan (right), executive vice-president of China Bee Products Association, promoting Qinghai Bee products.
"The economic, ecological and social benefits created by bee pollination far outweigh the value of the bee products themselves. The bee industry has huge potential in human health, crop production, vegetation reproduction and ecological protection, and little is known about it."
Zhao Xiaochuan said.
Nowadays, the number of beekeepers is getting smaller and smaller. Besides the beekeepers, many poor families with limited mobility still choose to share in the cooperative with beehives.
"The state has financial support, and we contact technical personnel to help guide them. Beekeepers lack understanding and judgment of the market environment, and they also need the help and coordination of the government, enterprises and industry associations to open up the market."
Said Zhao Xiaochuan.
"I hope you will pay more attention to and help the beekeeping community in the future," said Wu Na. "Our bee products are also screened and controlled in strict accordance with national standards to ensure quality and protect the rights and interests of consumers while helping beekeepers."

Liu Yunlong, an Old Face of Spy Drama, Plays a Stuttering Actor - Xinhuanet
Produced by Liu Yunlong, directed by Yin Fei and starring Liu Yunlong, Su Qing, Liang Guanhua and Li Liqun, the large-scale espionage drama "The Chance" landed on Guangdong Satellite TV's "Vitality Theatre" at 7:30 p.m. on July 16.
The play tells the story of Tang Fei (Liu Yunlong), an underground member of the Communist Party of China (CCP) lurking in a Japanese pseudo-police station, who joins forces with Soviet agents to assassinate the leader of the Japanese secret service and crush the Japanese army's shocking plot.
"Odds" is based on historical facts, and the material is taken from Soviet military archives that have been sealed for many years.
During the defense of Moscow, the Soviet Red Army's Far East elite advanced westward to help. At this time, the Japanese Guantong Army's "northward advance faction" thought that it could take advantage of the situation and intended to send troops.
The Chinese Communist Party and Communist Party of the Soviet Union intelligence agents jointly implemented the "Mudanullah" program in order to relieve the danger of the belly of the enemy.
According to this historical background, Deng Yuan, a well-known screenwriter, has been polished several times, causing the plot twists and turns to burn brains.
Liu Yunlong is both a producer and a leading actor in "The Chance."
In the play, he plays Tang Fei, the head of the criminal section of the Linhe Police Department, a stuttering policeman with a sense of joy and even a bit of ruffian, whose real identity is that of an underground member of the Communist Party of China.
Cai Meng, the heroine of the opposite play, is the head of the Linhe Security Bureau. She is deeply appreciated by her Japanese boss, Fukuhara, and has a delicate relationship with Tang Fei, which is also hostile and ambiguous.
Su Qing has experimented with many different types of roles in recent years, from Lu Ruowen in "Those Years We Were Young" to Erqing in "Yan Ji Raiders," all of which left a deep impression on the audience and received recognition for their acting skills.
This time, Su Qing and Liu Yunlong were partnered for the first time. The setting of the stuttering sheriff with the charming policewoman was quite interesting and innovative.
In addition to the two main characters, Liang Guanhua, Li Liqun, Qian Bo, Lei Han, Shen Jun Yi and many other powerful actors joined in "The Chance of Winning." The old drama is also one of the highlights of the play.
It is understood that the production of "The Chance" is also very sophisticated, with the production crew spanning Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Liaoning provinces for nearly 2,000 kilometers of filming.
In order to restore the bizarre urban landscape of the Northeast Japan Period, the production team worked day and night to carefully polish every detail of the construction of the scene and the props, making the scenes in the play exquisite and rich in historical texture.

According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the number of people infected with cholera in Yemen has exceeded 1 million since 2017, and the death toll has exceeded 2,000.
Yemeni medical institutions are worried that the ongoing flooding will lead to a resurgence of cholera.
"Jedi Strike" Releases Struggling Boxing Row to Dream of Life - Xinhuanet
Directed by young director Gao Zhuangzhuang and starring William Liao, Dong Yu, Yang Xin Ran and Wang Yibo, the online film "Strike of the Jedi" was officially released in iQIYI.
The film tells the story of Venus, a down-at-heel boxer, who returns to the ring and fights for his dignity, showing a blood-curdling, dream-driven journey.
The film "Jedi Strike" takes Thailand as the main plot driving force, and takes "Muay Thai" as the starting point for Venus, the fallen boxing champion, to pursue her dreams. The whole story is based on the traditional Chinese cultural values. Whether it is Venus' determination to fight fake boxing for Master in the early stage, or her efforts to fight for dignity in the later stage with the support of friends and lovers, it shows the men's pursuit and great love for their families and dreams in traditional Chinese culture.
Combining the classic Hollywood sports film storytelling model with the strong cooperation of professional teams from China and Thailand, "Strike of the Jedi" not only presents an international effect, but will also impress different kinds of audiences.
At the same time, "Jedi Strike" showcases the drama of Muay Thai combat and training, and the intensity and blood of the scenes.
In the film, Zhang Xiaoliang, a game designer played by Dongyu, helps Venus, played by William Liao, to return to the ring and take the crown through a fighting game, combining novel and interesting high technology with high-blood competitive competition. It also shows the brotherhood between Zhang Xiaoliang and Venus, who seem to have "different ways" and actually have the same goal.
In addition, the love between Venus and Jingjing is also very touching. Jingjing's silent support for Venus and Venus' firm commitment to Jingjing have allowed the audience to see the "iron man's tenderness" in Venus and added a lot of human touch to the down-and-out boxing champion.

Since its inception, Greenland Holdings has carried out a number of institutional reforms: From 1992 to 1997, it operated in accordance with market-oriented rules under a purely state-owned system; from 1997 to 2013, it established and continuously improved a joint-stock system of state-owned holding and employee holding; from 2013 to 2015, it introduced strategic investors to form a mixed ownership system in which state-owned and non-public capital are cross-owned and integrated with each other; and from 2015 to the present, it has been listed as a public company.
Greenland's current hybrid reform plan is similar to Gree's. In December 2019, Zhuhai Mingjun, led by High-end Capital, took over the 15% stake of Gree Electric (000651.SZ) for 41.662 billion yuan, and Gree Group retired as a minority shareholder. After the completion of the hybrid reform, Gree Electric implemented modern enterprise management methods, such as executive incentive plan and no real controller structure.
Shanghai Real Estate and Shanghai City Investment are state-owned enterprise groups wholly owned by Shanghai State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC). Zhang Yuliang, chairman and president of Greenland Holdings, said that Greenland's move is an important measure for Shanghai to promote the comprehensive reform of state-owned enterprises and accelerate the reform of state-owned enterprises in the new stage in accordance with the requirements of the CPC Central Committee. It fully demonstrates the new ideas of reform adapted to local conditions and tailor-made. By introducing new outstanding strategic shareholders to listed companies, Greenland supports enterprises to further improve the degree of marketization, enhance the freedom of operation and management, and accelerate the full release of reform vitality.
Inter-provincial travel resumes with the country's first inter-provincial train - Xinhuanet
Hangzhou, July 25 (Xinhua News Agency) (Reporter Li Ping) At 12:20 on July 25, more than 200 Shanghai tourists who took the D771 train successfully arrived in Lanxi, Zhejiang Province. This is also the first inter-provincial special train since the Ministry of Culture and Tourism resumed inter-provincial (district and city) group tours on July 14.
Lanxi City, located in the central and western parts of Zhejiang Province, has many scenic spots such as Zhuge Bagua Village, Underground Yangtze River and Zhiyan Ancient Village. During the two-day and one-night trip, more than 200 Shanghai tourists will enjoy these scenic spots one by one.
Li Li, deputy general manager of Shanghai Railway International Tourism (Group) Co., Ltd., said that according to the latest policy, the company kept a close eye on the demand for inter-provincial travel, immediately communicated with Lanxi City, and carefully launched the "Shanghai to Lanxi" and "Summer to enjoy the lotus two-day tour" products. The products sold out in less than a week after launch.
Aunt Sun, from Shanghai, said she had not been out of the house this year because of the epidemic.
"After a long time at home, as soon as I saw a group tour, I immediately shared the news with my friends to sign up. I had never been to Lanxi before, and I was looking forward to this trip," said Auntie Sun.
It is understood that in September last year, Lanxi City and Shanghai Railway International Tourism (Group) Co., Ltd. signed a strategic cooperation agreement on "taking high-speed rail and touring Lanxi," and planned to run 12 high-speed rail tourism special trains to Lanxi from four places in Jiangzhe-Shanghai-Anhui within one year.

White House adviser "bites back" on states going back to work too soon - The Sun
White House adviser "bites back" on states' premature return to work
On July 23, local time, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the United States topped 4 million, accounting for 30 percent of the global cases.
For months, US President Donald Trump repeatedly asked states across the country to return to work and school. Only recently did he change his tune and take the initiative to wear a mask in public, while his advisers said that some state governments were going back to work too soon.
22, White House presidential adviser Kellyanne Conway said at a press briefing that some state governments failed to comply with reopening standards and reopened bars and other establishments prematurely.
Conway also referred to previous claims that the president has "absolute power" to decide on states' reopening as a false rumor.
"The president is a federalist, and he believes in the autonomy of the states."
She defended Trump.
Conway's "rumor," however, was uttered by Trump himself during a White House briefing on the pandemic on April 13.
The self-punching operation was ridiculed by netizens as "rewriting history."
Kellyanne Conway wants to rewrite history. She's a liar.
Trump has called Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer a dictator because she followed medical guidelines and insisted on shutdowns.
Trump wants to push for a return to work so he can hold rallies.
This is not the first time Kellyanne Conway has courted controversy.
In an interview with Fox News on April 15, Conway blurted out: "This is COVID-19, not COVID-1, friends!"
She seemed to understand "19" as a version number, and was wildly ridiculed by netizens: Read the newspaper without common sense!
Is it reasonable for a 3-year-old child to sue the school after his college playground was smashed up?
2020-07-26 05:01:11 Source: Legal Daily Author: Wang Sishuo Responsible Editor: Wang Sishuo
The playground was smashed and the children were compensated and then sued the school.
Zhao Yifan, Correspondent of this newspaper
3-year-old Xiao Wen was playing in a college playground when he was accidentally hit on the head by Chen Mou of the softball team while pitching.
After Chen's compensation, Xiao Wen's father, Mr. Wen, as Xiao Wen's legal representative, took the school to court to demand an apology from the school where the playground was located, and to pay a total of 20,000 yuan in medical expenses and compensation for mental damage.
Recently, the People's Court of Haidian District of Beijing held after hearing the case that the school had set up a protective net in the playground at the time of the incident, and had done its due duty of safety and security, and Chen had already made compensation. Accordingly, the judgment dismissed the plaintiff's lawsuit.
Mr. Wen alleges that during the summer vacation of 2019, he took Xiao Wen to play on the school playground while the softball team was training on the playground.
In order to avoid the risk, Xiao Wen, Mr. Wen and many other children and their parents are in the safe area designated by the softball team.
But then Chen, a member of the softball team, took off his hands while pitching, causing the softball to fly over the protective net into the aforementioned safe area and hit Xiao Wen in the back of the head.
Mr. Wen immediately took Xiao Wen to the hospital for treatment and was diagnosed with head trauma.
Mr. Wen believes that the facilities of the school's stadium do not comply with the relevant safety regulations and do not effectively manage the team and related facilities.
The negligence of the school led to the above-mentioned incident, which caused Xiao Wen to suffer great physical and mental pain, and also brought great pain to his family members. The school should bear legal responsibility for this.
In this regard, the school argued that the school had set up a protective net in the playground, and posted management regulations and training notices, informing them that they should keep a safe distance from the training ground and reminding them to pay attention to their own safety. The plaintiff also could not prove that the school "failed to fulfill its safety and security obligations," and therefore did not agree to the compensation.
After hearing the case, the court held that the site involved in the incident is a venue open to the public free of charge. Although the school has safety and security obligations for the management of the playground, such safety and security obligations only need to meet the general duty of care.
At the time of the accident, the school had set up a protective net in the playground, and had fulfilled the proper safety and security obligations. Moreover, Chen also compensated Xiao Wen for medical expenses, transportation expenses and other losses of more than 2,000 yuan in accordance with the compensation agreement previously reached. The two sides agreed to settle the dispute at one time.
Afterwards, Xiao Wen's parents once again claimed compensation from the school, which was unfounded. The court ruled to dismiss all the plaintiffs' claims.
After the verdict was handed down, neither side appealed, and the verdict is now in effect.
According to the provisions of Article 37 of China's Tort Liability Law, schools, as managers of public places, have the obligation to guarantee safety; in the case of damage caused by the actions of a third party, the third party shall bear the liability for tort, while the managers of public places who fail to fulfill the obligation of safeguarding safety shall bear the corresponding supplementary liability.
The judge said that as the manager of a public place, he is most likely to understand the actual situation of the whole place, foresee the possible danger and damage, and thus is most likely to take necessary measures to prevent the loss or mitigate the extent of the damage, and the cost of avoiding and mitigating the damage is the lowest. Therefore, the law stipulates that he shall bear the corresponding security obligations for engaging in social activities.
In this case, for unspecified groups of people entering the playground, which is open to the public free of charge, the safety and security obligations of the school should be commensurate with the social activities it engages in. In particular, the school should take basic safety measures and have the obligation to inform about hidden dangers.
In judicial practice, it is also not appropriate to impose too high security obligations on managers of public places.
If the school has already set up a protective net and has done its duty to inform, it can be determined that the school is not at fault and should not be held liable.
In addition, for third party infringement, even if the administrators of schools and other public places fail to fulfill their safety and security obligations, their liability is a kind of compensation for damages. According to the newly promulgated Civil Code, after the administrators assume the supplementary liability, they can also recover from the third party.
Therefore, in such accidents, the victims should not expand the scope of claims after they have received compensation from the direct infringer.
Under the normalization of epidemic prevention and control, people's enthusiasm for sports and fitness is high.
With the gradual opening up of inter-provincial tourism business, the tourism market is also about to usher in a recovery.
Fujian Province resumed inter-provincial tourism operations on July 21, and Xiamen, a popular tourist destination, saw a peak in passenger traffic on the first weekend after opening.
As a popular tourist destination city, there are many tourists who arrive in Xiamen on weekends.
Xiamen Railway Station is expected to carry 3.7 million passengers in the summer, while the flow of passengers at the airport is dominated by students, tourists and family visits.
The tourism market has gradually picked up. In July, Xiamen Airport operated an average of 440 flights a day, and domestic flights have recovered to 80% of the pre-epidemic level.
The airline encrypted the air express lines from Xiamen to Shanghai, Beijing, Kunming, Xi'an and other major cities to seize the tourism market after the recovery.
At present, a number of travel agencies in Xiamen have launched a batch of domestic inter-provincial tour products in the summer, and the group's itinerary is mainly based on outdoor attractions.
In view of the peak summer passenger traffic at railway stations and airports, relevant units have deployed additional manpower to conduct diversion at check-in counters, security checkpoints and other areas where people are easy to gather. Fujian has also optimized and upgraded the "Babuan Health Code," realizing the sharing of health data and mutual recognition with 31 provinces, and promoting the orderly recovery of tourism market.
Can Andy Liu Qingyun "demolish" a new spark? - Xinhuanet
"The Hurt Locker 2" recently announced that it will be released on December 24, making it the first film to be released on New Year's Eve.
The second film is still directed by Qiu Litao, produced and starring Andy Lau, and unfolds with a new story.
It is reported that the addition of the "nuclear bomb" element in the second part also makes the challenges faced by the bomb disposal experts even more difficult. Several eye-popping shots in the trailer are already hanging by a thread. The mushroom cloud of the big explosion, the airport engulfed in flames, is quite a shocking scene.
Three years ago, "The Hurt Locker," produced by the original cast, won the top spot at the May Day box office that year, and was nominated for seven awards at the Hong Kong Film Awards. Qiu Litao × Andy Lau also became the audience's favorite gold medal partner.
This time, "The Hurt Locker 2" once again raises the expectation that this pair of aces will be able to make a spark.
"Bomb Disposal Expert 2" tells a new story: Former bomb disposal expert Pan Fengfeng (Andy Lau) fainted at the scene of the bombing and was named as a suspect by the police.
In order to find out the truth, he has to ask Dong Zhuowen (Liu Qingyun), a friend who is also a bomb disposal expert, for help.
Pang Ling (Ni Ni), a female inspector eager to solve the case and also Pan's ex-girlfriend, is also involved.
He is still a bomb disposal expert, but he can feel the complexity of Andy Lau's new role in the trailer: He broke a leg, put on a prosthetic leg, and was pursued by Liu Qingyun, who is also a bomb disposal expert, while being directed by his ex-girlfriend Ni Ni.
What exactly is the relationship between the three, what exactly Andy Lau did at the Hong Kong Island Hotel, what kind of cases he was involved in, and what twists and turns his career as a bomb disposal expert has gone through, all kinds of mysteries make people curious.
It is understood that the highlight of the film is the filming of world landmarks in Hong Kong, coupled with the top-notch special effects production team, which brings shocking and realistic visual impact.

Chongqing, July 26 (Reporter Liu Xian) Chongqing Development and Reform Commission announced on July 26 that up to now, 4,404 fishermen have been retired from fishing in the city, accounting for 42.54 percent of all fishermen involved.
Li Daiguo, 53, said in an interview with CNN.com that his grandparents were fishing in the Longxi River. Since he was 11 years old, he has been fishing with his father, rocking a boat, traveling along the Longxi River, up to Liangping in Chongqing, and down to longevity. Every time he leaves home, it is 10 days and a half months, and he supports his family by fishing.
However, since 1997, as the rural population has gradually surged into the town, more and more residents of Gaoanchang have been living in the town, causing more and more environmental pollution.
Paper mills, chemical plants and farms have been built along the Longxi River, which also pollutes the river water.
By 2007 and 2008, the Longxi River had turned into a stinky ditch.
"The scales of the fish caught are black, and the inside is black after being cut open."
Li Daiguo said that it is more and more difficult to fish after the river is polluted.
Local efforts have been made to control the pollution of Longxi River, including drifting, river patrolling and aquatic resources management.
Li Daiguo also switched from fishing to production and became a member of the river patrol team to protect the aquatic resources.
Starting from January 1,2020, the Chongqing Aquatic Biological Reserve and the relevant waters in the main urban areas have been completely banned.
According to the Chongqing Development and Reform Commission, up to now, Chongqing has returned 3,403 fishing boats and signed 4,643 fishing boats, accounting for 63.3 percent and 86.3 percent of the total tasks in three years, respectively.
4,404 fishermen have been retreated, accounting for 42.54% of all fishermen involved.
Of the 4,404 people who have been retreated, 4,267 have been employed, accounting for 96.89% of the fishermen who have been retreated.
The endowment insurance covers 2,691 people, accounting for 61.10% of the fishermen who have returned to fishing.
In the next step, Chongqing will carry out various special remediation actions, speed up the clean-up and remediation of the Yangtze River main stream coastline utilization projects, complete a new round of Yangtze River sewage outlet survey and carry out corresponding remediation actions, basically complete the "three phosphorus" (referring to phosphate ore, phosphorus chemical industry and phosphorus gypsum reservoir) remediation tasks, small hydropower clean-up and rectification work, promote the special action of afforestation and afforestation on both sides of the Yangtze River, strengthen the construction of green mines, consolidate the achievements of illegal docks and illegal sand mining in the Yangtze River main stream, and push forward the work of banning arrests and retreating in the Yangtze River basin.
Israel Strengthens Repeated Prevention and Control of Epidemic Diseases - CNN.com

Israel steps up prevention and control of repeated outbreaks
In the early days of the outbreak of COVID-19, Israel's prevention and control measures have shown remarkable results.
However, with the gradual lifting of the lockdown, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Israel has increased significantly recently, and the Israeli government has taken emergency measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic on several occasions.
On February 28, the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Israel, which quickly closed all ports of entry and exit, suspended non-essential businesses, switched schools to online classes, restricted public transportation and non-essential social activities, locked down cities with severe epidemics, and jointly maintained prevention and control measures by the military and police.
This series of measures quickly yielded positive results, and by mid-May, the number of new confirmed cases of COVID-19 in a single day in Israel had dropped back to single digits.
As the epidemic was brought under control and Israel's various prevention and control measures were fully unsealed, the number of new confirmed cases of COVID-19 has gradually rebounded since June.
Especially after entering July, the spread of the epidemic has been accelerating.
In recent days, the number of daily new cases in Israel has been above 1,500 for eight days, and as of the time of publication on July 25, the number of daily new cases reached 916.
As of July 25, Israel had 59,745 confirmed cases and 448 deaths.
In the face of the rapid rebound of the epidemic, the Israeli government has repeatedly taken emergency measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic.
On July 6, after the number of confirmed cases topped 30,000, the Israeli government closed gyms, swimming pools, bars, nightclubs and other public entertainment venues, and introduced a policy of restricting public transportation, limiting the number of passengers per bus to a maximum of 20.
On the 17th, the Israeli government announced a series of new restrictions, including the implementation of "sealing off the city" on weekends, stipulating that "sealing off the city" will be implemented from 17:00 on Fridays to 5:00 on Sundays.
During this period, people will be allowed to go out, but shops, shopping centers, hairdressers, beauty salons, libraries, zoos, museums, exhibition halls, swimming pools and tourist attractions will be closed, while essential services such as supermarkets and pharmacies will remain open.
At the same time, gatherings of more than 10 people will be banned on all dates and times, gyms, studios and other venues will be closed, restaurants and cafes will be banned from serving food, and only take-away services will be allowed.
At the same time, the Israeli people did not pay enough attention to the seriousness of the epidemic and failed to join forces with the government in the fight against the epidemic.
After the recurrence of the epidemic in Israel, many people took to the streets to protest against the government's prevention and control measures affecting their own economic interests.
On July 11, tens of thousands of people demonstrated in Tel Aviv, arguing that anti-pandemic policies were affecting the economy.
On the evening of the 21st, thousands of protesters gathered in front of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's official residence in Jerusalem to protest against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's decision to ban restaurants, cafes and other prevention and control measures without giving compensation.
In addition, many people do not observe the rules of wearing masks and maintaining a safe social distance of two meters when they are outdoors. To avoid being fined by the police for not wearing masks, many people only wear masks on their chins or on their wrists.
During repeated epidemics, the school was the hardest-hit area for the spread of the new coronavirus. According to the reporter's recent visit to the kindergarten, the teachers and students of the kindergarten did not wear masks as required by the government, nor did they maintain a safe social distance of two meters from each other, thus laying a hidden danger for a large number of teachers and students to be infected with the virus.
Professor Eli Waxman, a member of the Israeli National Security Council's expert advisory group on combating the epidemic, said Israel is heading toward a "dangerous situation," pointing out that the current epidemic prevention and control measures taken by Israel are not enough, and that all leisure and entertainment venues and summer schools should be closed to control the further spread of the epidemic.
Waxman said that Israel lacks a master plan to fight the epidemic, and the parliament and various government departments should abandon their respective interests as soon as possible, reach an agreement on combating the epidemic, and formulate clear steps including relevant restrictions for different departments.

Wu Fengfang, a farmer from Guyuan, Ningxia, was awkward but his wife, Dai Tianfu, arrived at Liangyun Cultural Compound from their home 20 miles away in a car.
Despite two years of inconvenient legs and feet, 77-year-old Dai Tianfu is still counting on "coming here every three or five years to live a drama addiction."
This is an inconspicuous courtyard in Yuanzhou District of Guyuan City. Unlike the average farmyard, there is often a melodious Qin cavity in the courtyard, as well as colorful shadow puppetry, embroidery works, traditional Qin cavity, Mei Hu opera and so on.
The owner of the compound, Liang Yun, was once a carpenter.
More than 10 years ago, loving shadow and singing, he began to plan the construction of a cultural compound.
With the Liangyun Cultural Compound, the cultural life of the villagers has become rich and colorful.
Before the reporter walked into the Liangyun Cultural Compound, the tune of Qin cavity had already been passed out.
It is Bai Lixiang, a villager from a neighboring village, who is singing an excerpt from the Qin cavity for the villagers.
She has loved Qin Qi since she was a child, and now she has a small reputation in the local area. Whenever she has free time, she will come to the cultural compound to perform for the villagers.
Recently, Peregrine has also been playing a live webcast.
"It is a very happy thing to have a stage where more people can see themselves performing," Berejiklian said.
On the stage, the singers are one-size-fits-all and the players are one-size-fits-all. Although they are amateurs, their enthusiasm is undiminished.
Just like the rustic style of the farmyard, outside the Qin cavity, the "grassroots" art and non-heritage culture of the Liangyun Cultural Compound come to the fore.
The compound also has a collection of more than 300 pieces of agricultural utensils of different ages, traditional and handmade tile sculptures, paper-cut, embroidery, shadow and other objects.
Liang Yun led the reporter into the exhibition hall in the courtyard, which displayed his collection of old objects, such as old wine jugs, three-stringers, spinning wheels, etc.
Why did an ordinary peasant build a cultural compound?
"Shadow puppetry is my family tradition. I have been learning this craft since I was 15 years old."
Liangyun Cultural Compound was established in 2012, becoming the first rural "exhibition hall of intangible cultural heritage" in Ningxia, and also a demonstration compound for the protection of intangible cultural heritage in Guyuan.
In addition to the Liangyun Cultural Compound, more than 120 cultural compounds and 79 folk performance groups have sprung up in Yuanzhou District of Guyuan City. Among them, there are more than 50 cultural compounds of a certain size, such as the Shenjiahe Cultural Compound, the Wang Yonghong Cultural Compound and the Yang Lang Cultural Compound, covering the townships and streets of Yuanzhou District, with more than 5,000 performers.
These grassroots entertainers are active in the fields, enriching the cultural life of the masses and meeting their spiritual needs.
"As life gets better and better, traditional culture can't just be left behind."
"Liu's Spy War Drama" Returns to "The Chance of Winning" to See Liu Yunlong Li Liqun's Rival "Drama" - Xinhuanet
40 episodes of the espionage drama "The Chance of Winning" will be released on Beijing Satellite TV from July 16.
Based on real historical facts, "The Chance of Winning" is based on the Soviet military archives, which have been sealed for years and were first published.
Liu Yunlong, an actor known to the audience as "Spy War Drama," broke through the image in the play and challenged a "stuttering agent" with a sense of joy.
In recent years, the popularity of such dramas as as "The Pretenders," "The Mask," and "The Kite" has proved that the espionage genre dramas have exuberant vitality.
Unlike previous espionage works, "The Chance" looks around the world and extends the story to the Soviet Far East battlefield.
Set in the final stages of the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression in 1944, it tells the story of Tang Fei (Liu Yunlong), a secret intelligence worker of the Communist Party of China (CCP), who, under the leadership of Linhe Provincial Party Secretary of the Chinese Underground Party and the head of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Bureau, carried out the "Mudanullah" strategic operation of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Bureau.
In many espionage dramas, the male protagonist, as a senior spy, appears as the perfect image of handsome, intelligent and mature.
But in Liu Yunlong's view, such a person is not fit to be a spy. "A spy should be the kind of person who can't be found in a pile of people. If the appearance is a very handsome image, I wish everyone would pay attention to you. Can you still lurk? There is a line in" Kite "that says," If you don't come to arrest me, I will forget that I am a Kuomintang. "Spies should be de-elitized."
So in "The Chance," Liu Yunlong ingeniously designed his protagonist, Tang Fei, as a "stuttering agent" with a sense of joy.
The other camp in "The Chance" is held together by Japanese Fukuhara, played by Liang Guanhua, and Fang Shibao, played by Li Liqun, the head of the National Police Department.
One South, one North and two Solid Force Drama Bones add a lot of masterful points of view to the whole drama.
Director Yin Fei used the word "drama" to describe Li Liqun and Liu Yunlong's opposites in the play. "It is definitely a drama, and the two of them have a special tacit understanding. This tacit understanding in them is very impactful to me. Many times, their plays are'now hanging '. For example, we only wrote the length of half a page, and if I don't stop when shooting, they will be able to continue acting."
When the actors are in the roles and ensure the state of their characters, they can not only shape the characters from the perspective of the characters, but also bring more viewing possibilities to the audience. Yin Fei said that such a drama is brilliant enough.
In the play, you can also see many familiar faces in "Liu's Spy War Drama." In "Kite," the famous and majestic "Mountain City F4" also gathered three people in "Chance of Winning."
Hou Yu and Liu Mingyang, who had played Song Xiaoan and Zhao Jianzhi, reprised their roles as Tang Fei's right arm.
Director Yin Fei introduced, "There is no inferiority in these two people. They just drifted with the tide in that era and that environment."
Liu Yunlong also offered, "We should have a human touch. This human touch means that there must be good and bad people around me, and bad people are enemies, but we should also develop them, and our ranks should be strengthened."
The ending of these two characters in the play was also carefully designed by Liu Yunlong, who believed that he would hand over a satisfactory answer to the audience.

Hong KONG, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's financial market remains active and operating in an orderly manner, said Hui Zhengyu, secretary for financial affairs and the treasury of the Hong Kong SAR government.
He expressed optimism about Hong Kong's financial stability and economy.
Speaking at a webinar jointly organized by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Toronto and the Hong Kong and Canada Chamber of Commerce (Canadian Federation) on the 24th (Toronto time), Hui Zhengyu said that Hong Kong is experiencing a difficult situation because of the "storm of fixing cases" and the outbreak of the new corona pneumonia.
The exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar is stable and biased towards the strong exchange guarantee level.
There are no obvious signs of outflows from the banking system. On the contrary, more than $11 billion has flowed in since June.
Total bank deposits have also continued to increase in the past few months, and the stock market has seen a flurry of public offering and fund-raising activities, and market transactions have risen frequently.
Hui Zhengyu said that the outbreak of COVID-19 has put pressure on the global economy and financial markets, but Hong Kong's basic advantages remain unchanged.
Hong Kong has a number of advantages, including geography, rule of law, high-speed communications, free flow of information and capital, and a simple and low tax system, making Hong Kong a leading international financial center.
Hui Zhengyu pointed out that the HKSAR Government has set aside HK $6 billion in the "Epidemic Prevention and Anti-Epidemic Fund" to create about 30,000 time-limited jobs in the public and private sectors in the next two years, covering people with different skills and academic qualifications.
To support the development of fintech, the HKSAR Government has also launched the "Thousand Talents Scheme" to support local fintech companies, start-ups and other enterprises with fintech related businesses to create 1,000 new jobs, employ local talents and enrich Hong Kong's fintech talent pool.
Looking ahead, Hui Zhengyu expressed optimism about Hong Kong's financial stability and economy.
He encouraged Canadian companies to capitalize on Hong Kong's strengths and its position as an international financial center, an international asset and wealth management center and a global offshore RMB business hub to develop and invest in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and nearby regions.
"The Lancet" published an article praising China's anti-epidemic efforts to encourage countries to learn from their experiences - CNN.com
According to an article published in The Lancet on the 25th, China, as a country with a population of 1.4 billion and a scale similar to Europe or the United States, has effectively controlled the epidemic situation of the new crown at this stage, but there has been no further widespread spread of the disease, thus controlling the epidemic situation in China to a large extent.
According to the article, over the past decade or so, China has invested heavily in domestic research and public health construction, which has made China much better prepared for the new crown than it was for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) that year.
When SARS broke out in 2002, China was initially ill-prepared, especially because the pathogen could not be identified, the authors said.
When the new coronavirus was discovered in December 2019, Chinese scientists were soon able to identify the type of virus and shared the genome sequencing data with the international community on January 11,2020.
By the end of January, doctors from mainland China and Hong Kong had elucidated the clinical features of the virus, warning the world of the threat of the new coronavirus through research papers published in The Lancet.
China has also been at the forefront of vaccine research. Under the state of emergency declared by the state, such research has been carried out very quickly and rigorously through close cooperation at home. In May and July, the results of the early trials of the new crown vaccine developed by China were published in The Lancet.
China's experience shows that it is very important to invest in the national health and research system and effectively improve the laboratory capacity.
This is the basis for a rapid and effective national response to health emergencies and global health security.
Other countries, especially low- and middle-income countries, are well worth learning from and studying.
In addition, China's experience has proved that, on the basis of strong research, it is necessary to have a strong high-level to decisively rely on scientific basis to make correct decisions, which can effectively control the epidemic situation in Xinguan.
The article stresses that governments and their leaders must respect science, understand its value, and act on it in a way that is most beneficial to society.
In the early days of the outbreak, China's National Health and Construction Commission sent three groups of infectious disease experts to Wuhan to investigate the risk and spread of the new coronavirus. Their recommendations provided the basis for the decision to "seal off the city" of Wuhan on January 23. When some experts suggested the necessity and urgency of building the Fangcai Hospital, the government quickly made a decision and implemented it quickly. Meanwhile, the extensive participation of the community and the masses also enabled the epidemic to be controlled quickly and effectively.
The article concludes by emphasizing that in response to a global health emergency, countries need to strengthen global cooperation and jointly respond.

Dapeng director's "Good luck" shortlisted for Golden Goblet Award - Xinhuanet
On July 18, the 23rd Shanghai International Film Festival announced the official selection of films for the Golden Goblet Award.
Director Dapeng's first reality-themed film, "Good luck," was successfully shortlisted for the Golden Goblet Award at this year's festival. Meanwhile, the film's first poster was released officially.
Photo Gallery of Poster
The film "Good luck" is Dapeng's first reality-themed work, and it is also his second marriage with the Golden Goblet.
The film tells the story of a comedy director who, on a whim, returns to his hometown in rural Northeast China, hoping to turn his family's New Year into a literary film. As a result, he suffers a series of accidents.
The family members, who had gathered for the film, finished the final party.
In the movie poster released today, Wang Jixiang, a member of the family known as "Third Uncle," sits in the center of the screen smoking a cigarette. In the background, the black land of Northeast China is draped in silver, and in the foreground, the red lanterns that the Chinese people must hang for the holidays.
The red lantern, a symbol of festivity and reunion, contrasts sharply with Wang Jixiang, a lonely figure, and seems to reveal the intricacies and tangles in the relationship between the extended family.
It is reported that in the film, except for the daughter of "Third Uncle" Wang Jixiang, who is played by actor Liu Lu, the rest of the scenes are done by the real director's family. The experimental audio-visual style of the film breaks down the boundary between drama and reality, and brings the audience a new immersive viewing experience.
According to director Dapeng, the creation of "Good luck" originated from "a providence." A series of sudden changes in the family during filming forced the original shooting plan to change accordingly. Life without a script was eventually recorded as a film, but it released tension beyond the design.
How does director Dapeng face this "providence" and how should he continue to meet the changes brought about by this providence?
There is no doubt that "Good luck" is full of experimentation. The almost all-vegan cast and innovative audio-visual style turn life in front of the camera into a movie. Wrapped in real images, the audience will also find themselves and their families' shadows from the families presented in the film. With the conclusion of this family gathering in the film, it evokes a series of reflections.

Yu Wang, a platoon leader, and a soldier stand guard at the Zhuokang outpost in Ba Nong.
In this place, where the average annual temperature is minus a dozen degrees, a simple row of barracks stands at the mountain pass. Not far from the barracks, a national flag flutters in the wind. The soldiers stand guard in the wind every day, and at the same time, they have to patrol the higher elevation regularly.
The soldiers had to use their hands and feet to climb up the steep slope of the rocks.
It was late July, when flowers and plants flourished at lower elevations, and in Barong Zhuokang, only the ravine behind the barracks was relatively dense with green.
Gao Peng, a soldier who has been stationed at the outpost for six years, pointed to the ravine and said that this is their back garden. Every year, only in July and August, the grass grows slowly. Soon after, it all turns yellow and is covered with snow.
Patrolling on foot can take up to nine hours.
Under the harsh conditions of the plateau, the soldiers stationed here keep company with the snow-capped mountains and glaciers all the year round, and they have to patrol the mountain passes at higher elevations regularly.
A few days ago, a patrol team composed of eight soldiers, led by instructor Liang Yixin, once again embarked on the patrol road.
Each soldier weighed about 30 pounds and marched to the target early in the morning.
On the way, a soldier rebelled, and his comrades rushed to rescue him.
In addition to the patrol duties, the soldiers at the Barong Zhuokang post have to carry out tactical and physical training every day.
As the minutes ticked by, the elevation rose, the oxygen levels got lower and lower, and the physical strength was constantly overstretched, these factors tested the will of the patrol members.
They clenched their teeth and persisted, crossing several landslides one after the other and several emergency and dangerous beaches.
At about 16:00, it was lunchtime for the patrol members. They took out their own dry food and sat on the ground at an altitude of more than 5,700 meters, accompanied by sleet and snow, and used food to replenish their strength.
The soldiers at the Zhuokang sentry post in Ba Nong conducted tactical and physical training.
During the break, they would play cards together, and the losers would do push-ups, both to entertain and to exercise.
After a short break in the cold wind, they climbed to the target location of the patrol, took out the national flag on the mountain pass, and solemnly swore an oath.
Behind them are snow-capped mountains, and in front of them are tens of kilometers of no man's land. They are the safest guardians of the country.
Beijing Consumption Season Restarted - Xinhuanet
Beijing has restarted the activities of the Beijing consumption season in accordance with the principle of "comprehensive restart, key planning, orderly promotion and strict organization."
On July 26,1.5 million government and enterprise vouchers were issued, including 1 million offline food and beverage shopping vouchers and 500,000 smart product vouchers, which can be collected by consumers in the JD.com APP.
Liu Meiying, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Commerce, said at the media briefing held on the 25th that the consumption season after the restart will further reduce the capital allocation of enterprises on the basis of maintaining the existing preferential subsidies for consumer voucher card packages.
Starting from the first half of August, the current 1:1 capital allocation for the government and enterprises will be adjusted to 2:1. For example, if the original consumer receives a card package to spend at the store, he can enjoy a discount of 120 yuan, including a government subsidy of 60 yuan and a profit of 60 yuan for the enterprise. After the adjustment, the government subsidy will be 80 yuan and the profit of the enterprise will be 40 yuan.
During the consumption season, the three major carriers will subsidize traffic and terminals around 5G consumption, further boosting Beijing's new 5G infrastructure and 5G consumption.
Chen Maobo Says Hong Kong's Economy Hit Again by Pandemic, Calls on People to Survive Difficulties Together - CNN.com
Hong KONG, July 26/PRNewswire/-- Hong Kong is facing a new wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, and business and economic activity, which had been showing signs of recovery, have also been hit, the Financial Secretary of the Hong Kong SAR Government, Mr Chan Mo-po, said on July 26.
The HKSAR Government reiterates its appeal to small landlords to reduce rents and work with retailers, restaurants and small and medium-sized enterprises to overcome the difficulties.
On the same day, Chen Maobo published an article on the Internet entitled "The rugged road to recovery."
He said that the recent high number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Hong Kong is a grim situation that has affected the livelihood of the people and also troubled the economy.
When the epidemic situation is repeated, the first priority is to prevent imported cases and deal with and break the chain of transmission of the virus as quickly as possible. When the epidemic situation is under control, economic activities should be resumed in a timely and appropriate manner.
He pointed out that in the face of the new wave of the epidemic, business contacts and economic activities, which had seen some signs of recovery, were also hit.
In addition to the spirit of the contract, social responsibility is equally important for the business community, especially for those groups that receive large government subsidies under the "Job Protection Scheme."
He noted that Hong Kong's economic situation remained grim in the second quarter of this year, but the contraction appears to have slowed down slightly.
In terms of exports, he believes that the situation in Hong Kong's periphery remains severe.
Chen Maobo said that Hong Kong's development over the past few decades has shown that every crisis hides new opportunities, and every difficulty hides the key to future development.

"Service costs are increasing," he said.
As a result of the pandemic, people began to spend more time on the Internet. "
Marinichev did not rule out a serious increase in annual internet prices, arguing that operators could provide customers with higher speeds and more services to offset people's dissatisfaction with the price increase.
"Chinese Doctors" To Pay Tribute to Anti-Epidemic Heroes - Xinhua
Recently, with the respect of the heroes of Chinese filmmakers fighting the epidemic, Yu Dong, Chairman of Bona Films Group, and Liu Weiqiang (pictured left), Director of Bona Films Group, had a discussion and exchange with academician Zhong Nanshan in Guangzhou on the filming and production of the anti-epidemic film "Chinese Doctors."
With "Chinese Doctor," Bona Films hopes to pay tribute to all the medical and epidemic prevention workers who are fighting on the frontline of epidemic prevention and control.
In 2021, the film will be released nationally as a tribute film to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China.
At present, under the arrangement of the Central Propaganda Department and the State Film Bureau, and with the support of the Guangdong Film Bureau and the Hubei Film Bureau, Bona Films has organized the original cast of the film "China's Captain" to prepare the film "China's Doctor," which is a film reflecting the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the unity of the people of the whole country in fighting the epidemic of New Crown Pneumonia.
Focusing on the frontline of the fight against the epidemic in Wuhan, the film will feature the Wuhan medical staff and the provincial and municipal medical aid teams as the characters' backgrounds. From the perspective of human nature, the film will use the unique narrative, as well as the highly impactful camera language, to show the touching stories of the Chinese medical staff on the frontline of the fight against the epidemic with dedication and sacrifice.
It is understood that on the first day of the unsealing of Wuhan, Bona overcame many difficulties, dispatched a team of photographers to the frontline of the epidemic, and had face-to-face exchanges with hundreds of medical workers to understand and collect information. At present, Bona has interviewed academician Zhong Nanshan himself, the first person from Guangzhou to assist Wuhan, the medical team from Guangdong to assist Hubei, as well as the angels in white who are at the forefront of the anti-epidemic front such as Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan Union Hospital, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University and Wuhan Central Hospital, and filmed a large number of precious first-hand video materials.
Academician Zhong Nanshan also raised expectations and hopes for the filming of the film during the symposium: "I am looking forward to it. I hope you will not only visit some experts who have made more appearances, but also interview more medical workers who are working hard on the frontline. They are the majority of them."
He said that he had seen "Me and My Motherland" and "Captain China" before, and thought that it would be a good way to tell the story of the big pattern from the perspective of ordinary people.
"Now some foreign friends still have some misunderstandings about China."
Commenting on the spread of the film, academician Zhong Nanshan said that at present, some people abroad like to label the virus as political. He hoped that the film could impress the audience from the perspective of human nature: "Besides being screened in China, this film is best to be screened abroad, in a way that both domestic and foreign audiences can understand, and to impress the audience with the true humanistic spirit."
Academician Zhong Nanshan also fondly recalled the film "Man to Middle Age" in the 1980s. "After all these years, what impressed me most about the film after the reform and opening up was" Man to Middle Age. "At that time, all my friends who were doctors abroad cried. If" Chinese Doctor "could play such a role, it would be very remarkable."
Academician Zhong Nanshan said that if "Chinese Doctors" could resonate with foreign audiences, it would be very successful.
During the discussion and exchange, academician Zhong Nanshan also shared his opinions and suggestions on the current international epidemic prevention and control. "I believe people will always be smarter than the virus," he said.
Academician Zhong Nanshan said that although the virus is difficult to predict, since the primitive society, mankind has passed through a thousand difficulties and risks. Nowadays, modern society has developed medical science and technology and social management measures. Coupled with the fact that medical workers and even ordinary people all over the world have a basic understanding of the scientific response to the epidemic of New Crown Pneumonia, people will no longer be as passive as before. "Next, we should pay attention to two aspects of work, one is to study how the whole world can strengthen cooperation, and the other is to focus on the consolation of people's hearts."

Cultural Brigade "Red Fruit" Gathers in Shaoshan - News of the First Red Expo in Xiangtan - Today's News - Hunan Daily - Huasheng Online
Hunan Daily · New Hunan Client reporter Jiang Rui correspondent Xiao Yan
Jiaxing Red Ship Mould, Shaoshan Mao Zedong Bronze Statue, Yan'an Budui Flower Crafts, Xiangxi Yongshun bacon... On July 25th, the 2020 Hunan Red Tourism and Culture Festival opened in Shaoshan.
As one of the main activities, the first Xiangtan Red Culture Industry Expo was held in Shaoshan Global Tourism Consultation and Distribution Center.
The exhibition area is full of red cultural and creative products and local products from the old revolutionary area, attracting tourists from all over the world to buy them.
"The Red Expo is not only a showcase of the achievements of the national red culture industry, but also an important platform for exhibitors and enterprises to exchange experiences and explore development paths."
According to the relevant person in charge of the Executive Committee of the First Red Expo in Xiangtan, with the theme of "Promoting Red Culture to Boost Cultural Tourism," the exhibition covers a total area of nearly 3,000 square meters, and has set up an atmosphere creation area, a scenic exhibition area, and an online shopping experience area for Red Cultural Tourism.

The exhibition area will be on display until July 29.

Japan's new coronavirus cases exceed 30,000 - Xinhuanet

Telecom Network Fraud Crimes Rise by 70% in the First Half of the Year Summary of Highest Inspection Characteristics - Zhongxin
According to the website of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, in the first half of this year, the procuratorial organs across the country prosecuted 58,101 people for fraud crimes, a year-on-year increase of 35 percent.
In particular, among the crimes of obstructing epidemic prevention and control, the number of fraud crimes prosecuted by the procuratorial organs accounted for 43.4% of the total number of crimes of obstructing epidemic prevention and control.
The Supreme People's Procuratorate has given targeted guidance. Of the ten batches of typical cases related to epidemic prevention and control that have been issued so far, nine involved fraud.
From the perspective of the procuratorial organs handling cases in the first half of the year, there were many kinds of crimes involving fraud, ranging from the national macro-policy to the common people's food, clothing and shelter, including epidemic fraud, "medical care" fraud, "health care products" fraud, "enrollment intermediary" fraud, "routine loan" fraud, state subsidy fraud, national assets unfreezing fraud, etc., constantly "innovating," covering education, medical care, employment, old-age pension, social security, land requisition and relocation, precise poverty alleviation, financial credit and other fields, which not only caused economic losses to the victims, but also seriously affected economic and social development.
In particular, some telecom network frauds break through the limits of national borders, regions and personnel, and have the characteristics of stakeholder, cross-border, remote and electronic payment. There are not many specific groups of victims, which can cause great harm.
For example, some set up special companies, rent high-grade office buildings, set up multiple departments or posts, use legitimate online platforms to publicize and recruit, train and evaluate recruiters, adopt enterprise operation mode management, cloak themselves in "legal cloak," and become more confusing.
It is incumbent upon the procuratorial organs to punish and prevent crimes according to law and issue early warning to the public and relevant departments in a timely manner.
In handling cases judicially, the procuratorial organs earnestly perform their duties, not only maintaining a high-pressure posture against fraud crimes, but also refining various law enforcement measures in a targeted manner, and promoting social governance through the production and issuance of procuratorial recommendations.
The procuratorial organs strictly control the facts, evidence, procedure and application of the law in cases of arrest and prosecution of fraud, and take the facts as the basis and the law as the yardstick, so as not to be wronged or not to indulge.
Especially for the telecom network fraud crime, we should pay attention to the central role of electronic data in fact-finding, and strive to build a chain of evidence between electronic data, verbal evidence and documentary evidence.
For example, the Yinzhou District Procuratorate of Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province handled a certain epidemic fraud case, and the procuratorial organ intervened in advance at the first time. From the case to the conclusion, it took only 5 days, reflecting the attitude and determination to handle the case quickly and strictly and maintain the overall stability of the society.
During the examination of arrest and prosecution, attention is paid to the prosecution of missing offenders in cases, correcting the omission of 733 arrests by public security organs, and correcting the omission of the public security organs to examine and prosecute 1,113 accomplices.
In the first half of the year, the national procuratorial organs issued 298 prosecutorial recommendations in response to fraud crimes, promoting joint efforts to prevent fraud crimes and promoting deep-seated governance.
For example, the Guangzhou Procuratorate of Guangdong Province and the Dongguan Procuratorate of Guangdong Province put forward timely recommendations on the loopholes in the supervision of telecommunications networks, such as communication enterprises, banks and intermediary organizations found in handling cases, urging the relevant units to strengthen supervision and improve the mechanism, so as to promote the construction of long-term system.
Fourth, we should do our best to recover assets and damages.
Local procuratorial organs seize the important links of intervening in investigation, guiding evidence collection, examining and prosecuting, and urge the investigative organs to actively recover the stolen money, cooperate with the relevant departments to do a good job in asset recovery and damage recovery, and strive to minimize the economic losses caused by the crime of fraud to the people.
For example, the Beijing Municipal Procuratorate handled the case of Lin Mou Road Loan, which involved 22 sets of real estate waiting to be sealed up. Under the circumstance that the real estate may be disposed of by other cases, the "Letter of Suspension of Execution" was first created and sent to the relevant court in a timely manner. It was suggested that the court should suspend the execution of the real estate involved in the case before sealing up the property, and deal with it uniformly after the facts of the crime are ascertained, so as to make the greatest efforts to recover the real estate involved and recover the losses of the victims.
The prosecutor reminded everyone to be very vigilant against the crime of fraud, not to expect "pie in the sky," and not to be gullible if you think it is cheap, and to keep your own "money bag."
Meandering Town, Weining County, Guizhou Province: Short Apple Tree Widens Road to Poverty Alleviation - Zhongxin
2020-07-26 11:42:58 Source: China Economic Network Author: Zhu Yanjing Responsible Editor: Zhu Yanjing
In the heat of the day, the reporter of Economic Daily - China Economic Network walked into Zhonghai Village, Wanna Town, Weining County, Guizhou Province.
Under the scorching sun, Li Yuanzhong, a villager, was weeding in the base. Although his face was red with sun, his mouth hummed a few ditties from time to time.
Weining County, where the town is located, has a high sugar content and a good taste due to its low latitude, high altitude, abundant light and large temperature difference between day and night. It has a certain popularity in the surrounding area, but also because of its small size and many spots, it has not been able to sell at a good price and has not been able to form an industrial scale.
The town was once a poverty-stricken township of "Baogu Potato Spring and Autumn." Ten years ago, the local poverty rate was as high as 25.8%.
It is urgent to change the traditional planting habits, adjust the industrial structure and increase the income of farmers during the crucial period when poverty alleviation will enter the decisive battle.
After many visits, Chen Chao, secretary of the party committee of the town, and a group of people in the town believed that industrial development could no longer follow the old path.
To this end, the town has introduced leading enterprises and planted apples in a modern way.
Hou Jianwen, deputy general manager of Weining Beyond Agriculture Co., Ltd., came to the town from Shaanxi Province in 2015 for research. He saw the local planting conditions at a glance, and began to plant apple trees there in 2016.
At first, the village mobilized Li Yuanzhong to transfer the land to plant apple trees. Li Yuanzhong and his wife murmured in their hearts, "After planting apples for so many years, they did not see anyone in the village who planted apples and made a fortune."
"All the apples planted are dwarf apples, which will not make the apple trees grow too tall."
What Li Yuanzhong didn't expect was that this time, a new method was adopted for apple planting. Irrigation pipes were laid under each apple tree, and water and fertilizer were poured into the roots. When the fruit was harvested in autumn, the tractor drove directly into the orchard and could pick fruit while standing.
At present, the apple base has gradually entered a bumper production period, and the market is just as Hou Jianwen had expected. Apple does not worry about selling, and is loved by consumers in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and other cities.
The growing apple industry has brought new changes to Li Yuanzhong's life. Although he is still planting land, he has a new source of income.
Li Yuanzhong's family has more than 9 acres of land transferred to the apple base. Every year, in addition to the land transfer fee, there is a profit dividend after hanging fruit. The couple usually work in the base. "One person can get 80 yuan per day and work all year round," Li said.
Li Yuanzhong told reporters that last year, the profit dividend was more than 2,800 yuan, plus the land transfer fee and the couple's labor income, and the family's income was more than 80,000 yuan. "There is no need to worry about food and clothing, and the well-off life has already passed."
"At present, the annual output value of an acre of apples is more than 15,000 yuan, which is about 10 times that of corn."
Chen Chao told the reporter that at present, the whole town has planted 20,000 mu of apples, and there are 6,000 mu in Zhonghai Village alone, covering 4,056 households and 17,200 rural households, including 656 households and 2,952 poor households in Lika, with a salary of more than 6 million yuan a year. The real realization is that the base is built at the doorstep, and there is no need to go out to work.
Li Yuanzhong, whose pockets are bulging, has also begun to fulfill his "wish."
This Lunar New Year, Li Yuanzhong bought an off-road vehicle and now commutes to work by car every day. "The family still has more than ten acres of land, and when the next step is to expand the scale of the apple base, all of it will be transferred to them, and the income will be even more."

Membrane Separation Technology Helps Hack "Greenhouse Effect" - CNN.com
Membrane Separation Technology Helps Hack the "Greenhouse Effect"
Schematic diagram of a new hybrid matrix membrane preparation technology
Our reporter Shang Rui reported: Recently, the atmospheric environment and bioenergy team of Tianjin University has made significant progress in the "membrane separation method to capture carbon dioxide," and successfully developed a new hybrid matrix membrane preparation technology, which greatly improves the carbon dioxide capture performance of membrane materials.
The results have been published as the cover article of the international journal "Greenhouse Gas: Science and Technology."
The "greenhouse effect" is a major environmental problem that perplexes human development, while carbon dioxide emissions are the culprit of the "greenhouse effect."
How to efficiently capture and utilize the carbon dioxide emitted by human beings is the focus of scientists' attention.
"Membrane Separation" is a new technology of carbon dioxide capture. It separates carbon dioxide gas with the help of membrane material, which has the characteristics of high efficiency and energy saving, and simple operation.
How to make the membrane material "take a deep breath" and improve the efficiency of gas separation is the bottleneck difficulty of capturing carbon dioxide by membrane separation.
The research team of Tianjin University innovated ideas to explore the influence of different solvents on the separation performance of membrane gases through repeated experiments.
The experimental results show that N-methylpyrrolidone is used as the preparation solvent, and the carbon nanotubes in the resulting membrane materials are more evenly distributed and "more breathable," which effectively improves the gas separation efficiency and rate of membrane materials.
The carbon dioxide separation performance of mixed matrix membranes prepared by this new technology is close to the upper limit of the theoretical separation of such membranes.
"The new technology provides a new idea for capturing carbon dioxide by membrane separation."
Li Run, a member of Tianjin University's atmospheric environment and bioenergy team, said: "We hope that this technology can provide strong support for the future treatment of flue gas by coal-fired power plants and chemical enterprises, and play a major role in controlling greenhouse gas emissions."
Before volunteering to fill in the application form, understand what is the professional grade difference - CNN.com
2020-07-27 02:22:36 Source: Chongqing Morning Post Author: Yu Xiao Responsible Editor: Yu Xiao
Before volunteering, understand what is a professional grade difference.
Every year, students or parents who volunteer for the college entrance examination do not understand the nouns involved in the voluntary application, thus affecting the voluntary application.
This year, five universities - Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing University of Science and Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing Forestry University and Beijing University of Chemical Technology - jointly issued the 2020 enrollment policy, eliminating the professional grade difference.
What is the meaning of professional grade difference and what is the significance in volunteering?
There are three ways to allocate professional rules
Experts reminded that before volunteering, you must read the "Admissions Charter" of your preferred school in detail to understand the admission rules of colleges and universities, including the adjustment ratio, professional allocation rules, etc.
The rules of professional assignment refer to the three main ways of professional priority, score priority and professional grade difference for the admission of majors after the adjustment of university files.
The specific method used by colleges and universities will be clearly defined in the "Admissions Charter."
But there are some colleges and universities whose admission principle is to give priority to the total score, and there is no grade difference between the majors.
That is to say, candidates within the scope of admission will be lined up according to the total score. When the score does not reach the first major voluntary admission score line, it will be determined whether the second major voluntary admission score line has been reached, and so on until the admission to the last major voluntary, there will be no grade difference between the professional volunteers.
The so-called "professional grade difference" is when an institution arranges a candidate's major, according to one or several scores published in the enrollment regulations, to determine the admission of candidates from different majors. This kind of grade difference is the "professional grade difference."
That is, the difference between the scores of the first major and the non-first major when the college admits the candidates, and the difference between the grades of each major, such as 3,2,1, etc.
Take, for example.
Assuming that Xiao Ming, a student, enrolled in A University and scored 560 points, his major volunteers were: Computer, international trade, automation, mechanical engineering, electronic commerce, and the method of professional grade difference was implemented for admission to A University. The grade difference was divided into 2,1,1, and 0 points.
At the time of professional assignment, if Xiaoming's first major voluntarily meets the requirements for professional admission and the major has a planned balance, then Xiaoming will be admitted to the "computer" major; if the computer is not admitted, his score will be subtracted by 2 points, according to the ranking of 558 points with the candidates who voluntarily apply for "international trade" in the first major, to determine whether they meet the requirements for professional admission; if they are still unable to meet the requirements, the score will be subtracted by 1 point (i.e. 557 points) for voluntary "automated" admission in the third major; if they are still unable to meet the requirements, the score will be subtracted by 1 point (i.e. 556 points) for admission to the fourth major, and if the subsequent major is still unable to meet its professional requirements, the score will no longer be subtracted, and so on.
Different universities have different levels of specialization.
With the popularization of parallel volunteering, many colleges and universities have now abolished the professional grade difference. However, some colleges and universities still retain this method this year. Judging from the "Admissions Charter" published by each university, more than 20 universities have set up professional grade difference this year.
For example, Sichuan Agricultural University, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Heilongjiang University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Jiangxi Normal University, Chengdu Medical College, Northeast Electric Power University, Jimei University, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing University of Technology, Ningxia University, Shandong University of Science and Technology, China Civil Aviation Flight Academy, etc.
In each of these universities, there is a difference in the professional grade.
Some colleges and universities have a grade difference in each major, such as Ningxia University, where the files have been submitted to the candidates, who are admitted according to the order in which the candidates fill in the professional volunteers, one point in turn, and then one point in order of the scores.
However, some universities have set up different professional grade differences between different majors.
For example, Jimei University has a total score of 4 points for professional volunteers, that is, 3 points for volunteers in the first major and 3 points for volunteers in other majors. There is no grade difference between volunteers in other majors, which is regarded as parallel volunteers. The difference between volunteers in other majors and volunteers in adjustment majors is 1 point.
When volunteering, candidates and their parents must carefully read the admission policies of the schools to see if there is any difference in professional grade and what is the form of the difference in grade. While fully considering the scores, they should also make a reasonable analysis of the schools and majors to be selected. If the institutions clearly adopt the method of difference in grade in the admission regulations, candidates should pay attention to the gradient between the majors and improve the chances of admission when choosing a major.

First Atlantic hurricane of the year makes landfall in pandemic-battered Texas
The U.S. National Hurricane Center announced early in the morning that Hurricane Hanna, which reached 145 kilometers per hour, was expected to bring heavy rains to southern Texas and northeastern Mexico until next Monday, which in turn would cause rapid flooding.
At present, with the gradual onshore advance, the custom has weakened somewhat. Despite power outages in some areas, there are no casualty statistics for the time being.
Some local officials in Texas are bracing for the possibility of tornadoes along the coast.
President Trump said via Twitter that his office was closely monitoring Hurricane Hannah and Hurricane Douglas in Hawaii, and called on people to listen to local authorities for emergency management information and to protect families and property.
Meanwhile, the coronavirus outbreak in Texas is rapidly worsening, with the number of infections soaring, with more than 390,000 confirmed infections and more than 5,000 deaths.
When the hurricane hits, the government will face the double challenge of sheltering the homeless and preventing the epidemic from worsening again.

3-year-old girl in Belgium dies from coronavirus infection - Xinhua
Belgian health authorities said on the 24th that a 3-year-old girl died from the new coronavirus infection, making her the youngest person to die from the disease in the country.
Belgian health department spokesman Budwin Carteri said the girl already had other serious illnesses before contracting the new coronavirus. In addition to the girl, an 18-year-old recently died from the new coronavirus.
Last week, 85% of the newly diagnosed people in Belgium were under the age of 60, Carteri said.
He reminded people who are healthy and younger not to take the situation lightly.
"Although it is relatively rare for young people to die from COVID-19, no one is immune now."
Last week, Belgium recorded an 89% increase in new confirmed coronavirus cases compared to the previous week, with an average of 2.9 deaths per day from COVID-19, up from 1.7 the previous week.
During the peak of the epidemic in Europe, Belgium had the highest proportion of COVID-19 cases among the population in Europe.
Belgium has a population of more than 11 million.
According to the latest data, a total of 64,847 people have been infected with the new coronavirus in Belgium.
Carteri warned earlier this week that action must be taken before the snowball gets bigger and ends up causing an "avalanche."
In an effort to curb the rebound of the epidemic, Belgian Prime Minister Sophie Vermes announced on the 23rd that the rules for people to wear masks in public places will be stricter, and the plan to further lift the restrictive measures in August will also be put on hold.

Hong KONG, July 25,2020/PRNewswire/-- The Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development of the Hong Kong SAR Government, Edward Yau, said on the 25th that all APEC member economies should act in unison to fight the epidemic and promote economic recovery, and should avoid erecting unnecessary trade barriers in accordance with the rights and obligations set by the World Trade Organization.
Qiu Tenghua made the remarks while attending a video conference of trade ministers on the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic held by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) on May 25.
During the meeting, the participating ministers exchanged views on APEC's response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the substantive solutions that can be adopted to promote economic recovery in the region.
Qiu Tenghua said that the public health and economic crisis triggered by the epidemic has had an unprecedented and far-reaching impact on society and the economy.
"We are in a double battle. We must overcome the epidemic before we can save the economy."
We need to have a clear goal, the virus is our common enemy, cooperation can only win, on the other hand, it will only fail. "

Chengdu People Pile Up to Watch US Consulate as Police Stop People "Looking So Happy"
In response to the closure of the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, China announced the closure of the US Consulate General in Chengdu on Friday.
On Saturday, the insignia of the US consulate was removed, and on Sunday, a car with dark glass drove away from the consulate amid boos from passers-by.
On Sunday, many Chengdu residents piled up in front of the US consulate to take photos, and those who did not come came to see it because of curiosity about current events.
An AFP reporter from Chengdu Station also went to observe near the US Consulate in Chengdu. The news came back that there was a steady stream of curious people, and many parents took their children for a walk to see the consulate, to take pictures of the building, or to take selfies.
The consulate was surrounded by guards, who occasionally "rectified" people's behavior. They did not seem to allow any out-of-character behavior: A woman was stopped just as she was about to sing a red song, and a guard confiscated a banner.
But residents of a nearby residential building managed to pull up a giant Chinese flag on their balcony and shouted slogans in support of China.
The U.S. Consulate in Chengdu opened in 1985 and covers all U.S. consular matters in southwestern China, especially the Tibet Autonomous Region.
AFP's Chengdu correspondent said the Chinese government has been relatively restrained in its response to the US: Many Chinese have asked the government online to close the US consulate in Hong Kong, but the official said only that "the closure of the US consulate in Chengdu is a necessary and legitimate response to the US 'unreasonable behavior."
At present, in addition to Chengdu, the United States also has consulates in Guangdong, Shanghai, Shenyang, Wuhan and Hong Kong in China.
Large-scale Financial Media Action "Walking Village Live to Watch Poverty Alleviation" Starts - Today's News - Hunan Daily Online - Huasheng Online
Hunan Daily · New Hunan Client July 25 (Our Reporter) On July 25, the large-scale financial media action "Walking Village Live to Watch Poverty Alleviation" sponsored by the Central Radio and Television Administration's Financial Programming Center started from Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province. Two caravans carrying 5G new media mobile cloud production and broadcasting system were seen by the guests at the scene and drove slowly out of the scene.
General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out that "2020 is a milestone year. We will build a moderately prosperous society in all respects and achieve the first century-long goal. 2020 will also be a decisive year in the decisive battle against poverty."
The large-scale financial media action "Walking to the Village Live to Watch Poverty Alleviation" is an important measure for the Central Radio and Television Administration's financial program center to promote poverty alleviation in line with this major theme.
The action will enter the poverty-stricken villages of more than 20 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the Central Government, excavate fresh stories of poverty alleviation, directly attack the great changes in the appearance of villages and villages, and show how villagers can break through the dilemma of survival and development and go on the road to riches.
The operation will last for more than three months.
Starting from Xuzhou, the reporter took the southwestern route, passing through Anhui, Hubei, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangxi, Guizhou, Sichuan, Chongqing, Yunnan, Tibet and other places. The other route took the northwestern route, passing through Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Hebei and other places, covering a distance of over 10,000 kilometers.
In the form of reporting, "Walking to the Village Live to Watch Poverty Alleviation" is a bold integration.
The economic development of the villages visited by the caravan will be broadcast through CCTV's financial channel, CCTV's economic voice, China Communications Broadcasting and CCTV's new financial media.
Among them, the live TV broadcast will be mainly completed in the afternoon news program "World Finance" of CCTV Finance Channel (the first broadcast time: Monday to Sunday 12:00-13:00), and the prime news program "Economic Information Broadcast" of CCTV Finance Channel will open a special column on poverty alleviation (the first broadcast time: Monday to Sunday 20:30-21:30).
At the same time, the caravan will broadcast live to each village for up to one hour on CCTV's financial client. Viewers can watch the live broadcast and participate in the sweepstakes by downloading the CCTV's financial app.
In terms of technology application and studio design, "Walking to the Village Live to Watch Poverty Alleviation" has the courage to make a breakthrough and pioneered the "Outfield New Media Caravan."
The vehicle is equipped with a 5G new media mobile cloud production and broadcasting system, and utilizes 5G + 4K/8K + AI technology to realize the organic combination of online and offline, large screen and small screen, and TV broadcasting.
Equipped with a three-message broadcast area, the broadcast area is converted from a container, with a length of 12 meters, a width of 2.55 meters and a height of 3.98 meters. The box body adopts a hydraulic automatic expansion structure, which can be turned up to 120 degrees.
The broadcast area can also be expanded automatically, and the platform can be expanded externally, covering an area of more than 50 square meters, which can meet the requirements of most programs.
At present, the Dongchuan District of Kunming City is already hot in summer, and what is hotter than the weather is the poverty alleviation workshop next to the resettlement site.
Lu Ling, an employee of Kunming Eisfu Electronic Technology Co., Ltd., said, "Now, as soon as you leave your home, you will enter the factory and make money to take care of your family. Thanks to the free vocational skills training organized by the trade union."
Walking into the poverty alleviation workshop of electronic components processing in Tongdu Street, Dongchuan District, a busy picture of a hot day came into view.
Lu Ling, who is in her 40s, is a single mother with children and also takes care of her elderly parents.
In her most difficult time, the Dongchuan District Federation of Trade Unions helped to come up with ideas and "send charcoal in the snow" before and after the rush.
Since 2018, Lv Ling has enjoyed assistance policies such as housing, schooling, social security, and employment, as well as assistance payments from trade unions at all levels.
This year, her children have successfully graduated and taken up employment, and she herself has a job and an income after taking part in skills training. She was released from the lockdown at the end of April.
It is reported that the special skills training program of Dongchuan District General Organization for Poverty Alleviation is part of the skills training work of Yunnan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions.
Based on the characteristics of the workers with difficulties in the poverty alleviation and relocation resettlement sites in the district, the district will conduct an in-depth investigation to understand the training needs and determine the types of training jobs. In the near future, the district plans to train a total of 450 electricians, welders and noodle makers.
Recently, Li Yi, an employee of the Menglian County Branch of the Agricultural Bank of Yunnan Province, wrote a heartfelt thank-you letter to the county federation of trade unions.
In her letter, she sincerely thanked the union for giving her the Golden Autumn Scholarship from August 2013 to January 2017 to help her complete her studies.
In 2004, Li Yi's father died in a car accident, and her mother was included in the files of workers in need. Since then, she has been enjoying the care of the policy of establishing a filing card.
With the help of the local trade union, Li Yi successfully completed her studies.
Since 2016,3,809 households have been lifted out of poverty through institutional guarantees and precise assistance.
The successful relief of Lu Ling's family and Li Yi is a microcosm of the Yunnan trade union's efforts to promote the relief of workers in need.
According to Duan Kaiyuan, a staff member of the Yunnan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions Law and Human Rights Protection Department, the provincial general manager will strengthen the dynamic management of the files of the workers with difficulties, promote the normalization of the documentation work, and include the assistance system for the workers with difficulties who meet the requirements for documentation in a timely manner; broaden the application channels for the workers with difficulties, and use WeChat to open an online filing service platform for the workers with difficulties, so as to facilitate the workers with difficulties to declare in a timely and proactive manner.
During the epidemic period, it was difficult to go out to work. In order to help the workers with difficulties in filing to ease the pressure of life, Yunnan Province arranged a total of more than 13 million yuan to send warm funds. According to the standard of 2,000 yuan per household for workers with difficulties in filing at the national level and 1,500 yuan per household for workers with difficulties in filing at the provincial level, more than 6,000 households at the national level and more than 1,000 households at the provincial level were given special warm condolences.
At the same time, the provincial general manager connects with various Internet recruitment platforms, such as the People's Society Department and Zhilian Recruitment, to push the recruitment information to the workers in need, and to provide employment advice, employment guidance and other services.
