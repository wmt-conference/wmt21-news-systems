Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 26: Turning outstanding returning migrant workers into a new force for rural revitalization
Zhang Xiong, 34, lives in Orchard Village, Meishan City, Sichuan. In 2010, he quit his job in Beijing with a monthly salary of tens of thousands and returned home to start a business.
After several years of hard work, the grape-growing family farm he runs now has an annual income of more than one million yuan, has become a well-known leader in getting rich, and has also been selected into the village " two committees " team.
In recent years, inspired by a series of policies to support agriculture and benefit agriculture, such as national poverty alleviation and rural revitalization, more and more outstanding migrant workers like Zhang Xiong have chosen to return home to start their own businesses, activating a pool of spring water in the countryside.
Sichuan, a populous province in western China and a major labor-exporting province, has implemented the " Excellent Migrant Workers Return Training Project " according to the situation. In 2019 alone, more than 8,000 village party branch secretaries were generated from the outstanding migrant workers, 61,000 village reserve forces were trained, and more than 20,000 party members were developed, providing a strong guarantee for winning the fight against poverty and implementing the rural revitalization strategy.
Well-off is not well-off, the key depends on the villagers.
Since the reform and opening up, a large number of young and middle-aged workers in China's rural areas have gone out to work to increase their income, and some have set up their own enterprises through hard work.
However, objectively, it also leads to the emergence of " hollowing out " in rural areas to varying degrees, especially the weakening of rural grass-roots organizations, and the secretaries of village party branches and party members show the characteristics of " one old and one low, " that is, aging, low education, weak leadership of village party organizations, and outstanding problems.
If rural talents and other factors have been flowing one way to the city, and the countryside has been in a state of " blood loss " and " anemia " for a long time, revitalization is an empty word.
Attracting those migrant workers who are capable, conscious and interested in serving their hometown back, guiding them to return home and start businesses to become rich leaders, training them to become party members and village cadres on the basis of merit, and enriching the ranks of grass-roots cadres is a solution to the root causes of the problem of rural party members and grass-roots party organizations.
Excellent migrant workers can be brought back, and they should be allowed to stay and do a good job.
In recent years, Sichuan has started by paying close attention to the party building of migrant workers, and on the basis of strict selection criteria, established institutional mechanisms such as targeted referral, service guarantee, training and ability enhancement, selection and use of outstanding migrant workers, so that they can improve their ability, have security in work, have hope in life, truly take root in rural areas, and have a sense of accomplishment in starting a business.
This year is the final year of the decisive battle against poverty. Talent is the key factor in the connection between poverty alleviation and rural revitalization.
Party committees and governments at all levels should attach great importance to the group of outstanding returning migrant workers, and through comprehensive measures, turn them into a task force and new force that can stay, fight and cannot be taken away, so as to provide strong organizational guarantee and talent support for rural poverty alleviation, well-off development and revitalization.
Because of the epidemic, this year's college graduates are a very special one. On the evening of July 11, the bilibili summer graduation song will bring a special live online performance for the graduates. Lao Wolf, Park Shu, Li Yuchun, Mao Yi and other musicians send songs and blessings to the fresh graduates.
Famous up master SealWu Wu Yifan also brought a song " Wild Grass, " which is a rap song adapted from Lu Xun's collection of prose poems of the same name, which is very popular among young people.
Due to the epidemic situation, many graduates failed to experience the ritual sense of picking ears and awarding degree certificates on the spot, so they transferred the ritual sense to the online.
Data show that the peak popularity of the 2.5-hour live broadcast exceeded 35 million.
" Follow your own heart, seize the opportunity, regardless of the consequences, sometimes there will be unexpected gains. "
Although it is a graduation song party, many songs also moved non-fresh graduates.
" Looking at the whole scene, I really want to cry. Everyone's youth is full of beauty and regret, but it is worth remembering, and we should go on bravely. "
Beijing's natural ecology continues to improve, attracting more than 500 species of wild animals to " settle " in the city-Chinanews.com

The natural ecology of the capital continues to improve to attract wildlife cities to " settle down "
There are more than 500 species of wild animals in Beijing
(Reporter Wang Bin) Beijing Youth Daily reporter learned from the Municipal Bureau of Landscape and Greening that in recent years, with the continuous improvement of the natural ecological environment of the capital, the species and number of wild animals have also continued to increase.
At present, the number of terrestrial vertebrate wild animals living in Beijing has increased to more than 500 species, including national-level protected animals such as brown horse chicken and black stork, as well as national-level protected animals such as gazelle, swan, grey crane and mandarin duck.
Whether planted in urban forests everywhere in the Second Ring, or embedded in small and micro wetlands between buildings, it not only brings the wild interest of nature to the citizens of the capital, but also attracts wild animals to " settle " in the city.
In midsummer, the Songshan National Nature Reserve, located in the Yanshan Mountains in the northwest of Yanqing District, is full of vitality.
A raccoon was playing leisurely by the mountain stream, while two badgers were fighting with each other.
Looking back, a wild boar couldn't resist the " scratch " on his body and was rubbing hard against the bark. Hu Qiaoli, director of the Songshan National Nature Reserve Management Office, said that as of the end of 2019, there were 178 species of wild animals living in this green sea with a total area of more than 6,200 hectares, including the national protected animal golden eagle and the national protected animal spoon chicken and gazelle. Nearly one third of the city's wild animal species can be seen here.
" In Songshan, wild animals are the real' masters', and our staff can only be regarded as people's' bodyguards' at best. "
Hu Qiaoli said that in order to understand the situation of wildlife in the reserve on the ground, more than 30 professional patrol members patrol along 16 carefully formulated protection routes every day, and there will be a " big circle " every month, which takes a whole day to travel almost throughout the reserve.
" During the inspection, we should not only check and record biodiversity, but also check and install artificial bird nests, rescue injured wild animals, install field infrared cameras and so on. "
More than 200 infrared cameras have been installed in Songshan National Nature Reserve to record the living conditions of wild animals in the forest.
Hu Qiaoli introduced that with the continuous enrichment of biodiversity in the reserve in recent years, more and more wild animals appear in the camera, leopard cats, raccoons and badgers have become " permanent guests, " and the " appearance rate " of the national second-class protected animal gazelle is also increasing.
Zhang Zhiming, Director of the Wildlife and Wetland Protection Division of the Beijing Bureau of Landscape and Greening, said that the number of terrestrial vertebrate wild animals in Beijing has increased from 461 in 1994 to more than 500 now, and the species and number of wild animals in Beijing have continued to increase in recent years.
The presence of wild animals in cities is becoming more and more common, which is closely related to the continuous upgrading of urban greening in the capital in recent years.
In particular, the new round of afforestation and greening construction of one million mu, which began in 2018, proposes to reshape the urban ecological environment, improve the ecological function of forestland and green areas, and highlight the concept of " near nature. "
The planning strives to achieve interconnection and interaction with the surrounding green areas, so as to facilitate wild animals to " visit relatives and friends. " The trees planted are also honey and food plants that animals love.
Black land " planted " agricultural modernization-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 26, Topic: Black land " grows " agricultural modernization
In midsummer, two spraying planes passed the million mu high-yield demonstration field in the second operation station of the fifth management area of Friendship Farm, forming two white lines. The words " the first field in the world " planted with black rice seedlings in the green field are particularly striking.
Kong Lingqiang, the headmaster of this operation station, said that this kind of aircraft can spray more than 6000 mu of arable land a day, the efficiency is about 8 times that of drones and hundreds of times that of humans.
This farm is located in Friendship County, Heilongjiang Province, the largest grain-producing province in China. From the sound of rice cutting in the past to the sound of " rumbling " today, Chinese traditional farming and farms have transformed in this black soil belt.
In addition to aircraft, satellites are also used in the modern agricultural production of Friendship Farm.
Kong Lingqiang introduced that, on the one hand, they use satellite remote sensing technology to achieve accurate fertilization, reduce agricultural input and reduce pollution; on the other hand, satellite navigation technology can improve the standardized operation level of agricultural machinery in the field.
In the course of rice production this year, the farm expanded the operating area of satellite navigation unmanned transplanting technology from 3,000 mu last year to 30,000 mu.
This technology makes seedling planting more uniform, maximizes the utilization of sunlight and arable land resources, and saves 16 yuan in labor costs per acre.
Farms have tried new technologies such as informatization and intelligence in agricultural production, forming the largest agricultural machinery group in China from the ground to the sky.
According to statistics, the total number of farm agricultural machinery is 49,000 units (pieces), and the comprehensive mechanization rate in the field is 99.8%.
Agricultural machinery operations achieve 100% GPS satellite navigation, 100% precision seeding in dry fields, and 100% high-power locomotive operations in dry fields.
" Green agriculture, smart agriculture and digital agriculture are the exploring directions of agricultural modernization. "
Liu Hualien, director of Friendship Farm, said.
The key to agricultural modernization lies in scientific and technological progress.
Heilongjiang Agricultural Reclamation, represented by farms, has played a demonstration and leading role in modern large-scale agriculture " aircraft carrier " in recent years, and has initially established a modern agricultural industrial system dominated by large-scale planting, standardized production and industrial management.
On the outskirts of Friendship County, there is an agricultural machinery exhibition park covering an area of 350,000 square meters.
There are more than 140 agricultural machinery (pieces) that have been introduced and used in Heilongjiang agricultural reclamation over the years.
These agricultural machinery and farms have witnessed the development of China's agricultural modernization.

" When I received a call from the village cadre to transfer, I was still gathering grass in the field. "
Fu Kunbao said that he has transferred more than 60 mu of land and planted rice. At present, he is growing well. " I took medicine yesterday, and the tools have not been cleaned up. "
Fu Kunbao pointed to the pesticide sprayer placed in the corner. " No one wants their home to be flooded. Give up their small home for everyone. "
In order to cope with the continuous high water level pressure of Chaohu Lake and possible heavy rainfall, Hefei City, Anhui Province, is preparing to use the Jiangkou River Lianlian flood diversion water storage where Fu Kunbao's family is located on the 26th.
Jiangkou River Lianwei is located in Feixi County, adjacent to the Chaohu dike.
There are thousands of villagers involved in Yandian Township and Sanhe Town in Wei who need to be transferred.
As of 16: 00 on the 25th, the water level of Chaohu Lake, the fifth largest freshwater lake in China, remained at a high level of 13.2 meters, exceeding the guaranteed water level by 0.7 meters.
Fu Kunbao's kitchen was clean, with a pot of pumpkin head vegetables on the table, eggs and some brine in the refrigerator.
" I didn't expect to move. The water in Jiangkou River looks good at present. "
Zhou Yan said that the home is a bungalow, and some large objects have not yet decided where to put them.
" Pack up the valuable items first, and large items such as refrigerators and televisions can be temporarily placed in the homes of neighbors or relatives on high ground. "
Wang Lizhen, a village cadre, gave Fu Kunbao advice.
Wang Lizhen is responsible for the transfer and resettlement of 13 villagers, one household to notify, confirm each person's resettlement plan.
The nearest settlement to Fu Kunbao's home is Su Xiaoxue, Yandian Township, about 2 kilometers away.
In addition to the large items, Fu Kunbao and his wife also have a headache of more than 1,000 kilograms of grain and some newly bought furniture.

Zhang Jilin small house formed a team to support muscular teenagers-Xinhuanet
Sports Youth Hot-blooded Sports Show " Sports Bar Youth " officially landed on Hunan Satellite TV on July 11.
Sports leader Zhang Jike and sports assistant Lin Xiaozhai cross the border on the same stage. Lindane and Fu Yuanhui commented on their own styles, and the hard core of the " giant " power pulling device made the program " burning " full.
In the first episode, 11 sports teenagers appeared on the power track, stunning the audience at the scene. At the same time, the " strong conflict, " " strong confrontation " and " strong heart " on the competition stage also received attention.
Among them, the " strong conflict " came from Super A sports student Qiao Wenyi, who openly provoked Xu Zhibin, who was known as a " beautiful man " on the same track before the race, choked that Xu Zhibin's appearance condition should go to sing and dance programs, and even released the cruel words " Don't cry if you lose. "
A remark made the teenagers and sports leaders on the field take a breath of coolness.
The " strong confrontation " is more like an immortal fight. Sun Jianqi, known as the " Great Demon King, " met the equally powerful Zhang Xindong and staged a strong confrontation.
Their identities are also unexpected. Sun Jianqi is an actor who loves fitness, and Zhang Xindong is a retired special forces player and three-time winner of the Warriors Medal.
At the beginning of the game, the two teenagers tried their best to pull out the small pole quickly, and the lasting confrontation on the big pole made the audience sweat for them.
In the tense competition situation, Zhang Jike, as one of the sports leaders of " Sports Bar Youth, " was also watching the game carefully.
In the comment section, he was also very careful, patiently encouraging the teenager who lost the game, and helping every mistake in the recovery process.
Sports assistant Lin Xiaozhai is a fancy assist, and she makes no secret of her appreciation for the teenagers who are online.
When learning about the overloaded daily training of sports teenagers, they are even more admired.
Lindane and Fu Yuanhui, who are also sports leaders, have their own styles. One is a calm " prophet " and the other is a " flood girl " who dispels tension with a smile.
In addition, Jike Yuanyi and Liu Ye, as sports assistants, have also created a lot of funny topics around sports teenagers.
Church fire in Nantes, France: Parish volunteers admit arson is usually kind and reticent-Chinanews.com
China News Service, July 26 (Xinhua) According to foreign media reports, on July 18, the famous Cathedral of St. Peter and St. Paul, a treasure of religious and historical buildings in Nantes, France, was severely damaged in a fire, and the large organ was completely destroyed.
On the 26th local time, the Nantes prosecutor announced that a parish volunteer responsible for protecting the cathedral had been charged with " arson and destruction. "
He has admitted that he lit the fire in the church.
According to the report, local prosecutor Senas said that the 39-year-old parish volunteer from Rwanda admitted that he set fire to three places in the cathedral at night.
The man's lawyer said the arsonist now regretted doing such a thing.
This person entered France through the way of asylum a few years ago, was sheltered in the parish where the fire occurred, and was taken in in the church.
The prosecution pointed out that recently, he tried to renew his visa and was talking to the police about it.
But the church said it still couldn't believe that the believer, who was usually very kind, smiling, but not very talkative, would destroy the church he loved so much.
On the day of the fire on July 18, the volunteer had been questioned and investigated by the police because of illogical problems in the narrative, but he was later released.
The picture shows firefighters carrying out rescue at the scene.
On the evening of the 25th, this person was summoned again because professional engineers from the laboratory of the Paris Central Police Department obtained new evidence.
This time, the man admitted to arson.
According to reports, if convicted of intentional arson and destruction, the suspect could face 10 years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros.
According to the report, the fire caused serious damage to St. Pierre and St. Paul's Cathedral. The organ in the church was completely burned down and the stained glass window behind the organ was also seriously damaged.
Brunet, the chief architect of French historic preservation buildings, believes that it is conservatively estimated that the restoration of Nantes Cathedral will take at least three years.
Comprehensive news: US unilateralism undermines bilateral relations International public opinion supports China's countermeasures against the United States-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26: On the morning of July 24, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the US Embassy in China that China had decided to revoke the license for the establishment and operation of the US Consulate General in Chengdu and put forward specific requirements for the Consulate General to stop all business and activities.
International public opinion believes that the unilateral measures taken by the United States have caused serious trouble to China-US relations. It is legitimate and necessary for China to respond to the unreasonable provocation of the United States and take countermeasures.
Andrés Bolks, director of the China Research Center of the Institute of International Studies of the University of Chile, said that the unilateral measures of the United States have damaged the bridge of understanding between the two peoples and caused a crisis in the relationship between the two major countries.
China's notification to the United States to close its Consulate General in Chengdu is a countermeasure to the unilateral measures taken by the United States and is in line with diplomatic practice.
Patricio Giusto, a professor at the Catholic University of Argentina and director of the Arab-Chinese Research Center, believes that China's above-mentioned decision is a legitimate and necessary countermeasure to the previous provocation of the United States, not against ordinary Americans.
The United States is trying to pressure China to cover up its weak response to the COVID-19 epidemic and divert the attention of the American people.
Bambang Suryono, chairman of the Asian Innovation Research Center, an Indonesian think tank, said that the provocative diplomatic posture adopted by the United States has caused serious trouble to China-US relations, and bilateral relations are facing serious challenges.
China's notification to the United States to close its Consulate General in Chengdu is a normal countermeasure and is in line with diplomatic practice. It not only reflects China's principled position of resolutely safeguarding its own interests, but also reflects the rationality, advantages and justice of China's diplomacy.
Tanzanian commentator Francis Semwinza said that China's above-mentioned decision is a legitimate and necessary response to the provocation of the United States.
China-US relations should return to normal, and the US should take the initiative to improve its relations with China and stop interfering in China's internal affairs.
The United States should focus on how to achieve win-win results with China economically and politically, and how to benefit the two peoples and the international community as a whole.
Ali Yusuf, executive director of the Sudan-based Federation of Arab-Chinese Friendship Associations, said that the countermeasures China was forced to take were a legitimate and necessary response to the unreasonable actions of the United States, in line with international law and the basic norms of international relations, as well as diplomatic practices.
Earlier, the US request to close the Chinese Consulate General in Houston seriously violated international law and the basic norms of international relations.
We hope that the US side will rescind its previous relevant decisions and create the necessary conditions for bilateral relations to return to normal.
Singapore's Lianhe Zaobao published an editorial saying that the greater strategic intention of the United States is to contain China and prevent China from continuing to rise.
In the face of the step-by-step pressure of the United States, although China is very reluctant to see China-US relations continue to deteriorate, it has to take countermeasures.

Poland to withdraw from the European treaty to prevent violence against women
Poland's Ministry of Justice said Saturday that Poland will take steps next week to withdraw from the European Treaty on the Prevention of Violence against Women.
Poland's right-wing government cabinet said the treaty trampled on the rights of students' parents by requiring schools to teach students about gender issues.
Polish Justice Minister Gioblo said at a press conference that his Ministry of Justice will submit a request to the Ministry of Labour and Family on Monday to begin withdrawing from the treaty.
That treaty is also known as the Istanbul Convention.
" The treaty contains some elements of meaning-form nature that we consider to be harmful, " Gioblo said.
Poland's ruling Law and Justice Party and its ruling coalition partners have a close alliance with the Roman Catholic Church and advocate a conservative social agenda.
Polish President Duda made hostility to gay rights one of the main issues during his successful re-election campaign this month.
On Friday, thousands of Poles, most of them women, protested in Warsaw and other cities against withdrawal from the convention.
" The purpose of withdrawing from the treaty is to legalize domestic violence, " Lempat, one of the organizers of the protest, said at a protest march in Warsaw.
Some protesters held banners that read " Law and Justice is a hell for women. "
The Law and Justice Party has long complained about the Istanbul Convention.
Poland's previous centrist government ratified the convention in 2015.
The Law and Justice Party government said the treaty did not respect religion and required liberal social policies to be taught in schools.
But so far, the party has not decided to withdraw from the convention.

According to Russian experts familiar with the above-mentioned upgrade work, Wuzhika-52, the " predecessor " of " Super Alligator, " was officially installed in November 2011. Some weaknesses were exposed in the use of this model. This renovation and upgrade is just to " complement each other. "
According to the report, compared with the Ka-52, the Ka-52M will partially adopt new protective materials that will not increase weight, and its pilot cockpit will be strengthened and equipped with new equipment to resist missile attacks, thus increasing the probability of battlefield survival; It will be equipped with a more powerful generator to power more complex airborne electronic equipment; The photoelectric system will be upgraded to detect and identify more distant battlefield targets; The new light multi-purpose missile equipped with mainly attacking armoured fighting vehicles and reinforced concrete fortifications will have a range of 20 kilometers, which is about double the range of similar missiles used in active service in Russia; Its defense weapons and communication equipment will be used to the maximum extent with Mi-28NM helicopter gunships that can attack air targets, thus making related maintenance simple and economical.
In addition, the Ka-52M will have more advanced electronic guidance system, weapon targeting system and navigation equipment.
Russian experts also said that it is worth noting that the Ka-52M will be equipped with communication equipment to communicate with drones, so as to obtain real-time information transmitted by nearby drones in the air, such as displaying images taken by drones on the cockpit screen of the helicopter.
According to the plan, the pilots of the Ka-52M can directly control the drones they cooperate with, thus improving the pilots' grasp of the battlefield situation and the guidance of long-range missiles.
According to Russian media reports, Russian Deputy Defense Minister Krivoruchko said in December last year that the Russian Defense Ministry plans to purchase more than 110 Wuzhika-52M by 2027.

The FAA urgently ordered the inspection of 2,000 Boeing airliners-Xinhuanet
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an emergency airworthiness directive on the 24th, requiring an emergency inspection of about 2,000 Boeing 737NG and 737Classic passenger aircraft registered in the United States, because the corrosion of the air check valve of the above-mentioned passenger aircraft may cause the engine to stop in the air.
The FAA said that so far, it has received four reports of engine parking in the air of 737NG and 737Classic passenger aircraft, so it has made an emergency inspection request. The inspection targets are passenger aircraft that have been parked continuously for 7 days or more and passenger aircraft that have flown less than 11 times so far after re-entering flight.
The FAA warned that if the stage 5 check valves of all two engines of the airliner were corroded, they could get stuck in the open position, causing the airliner to lose power completely and be unable to restart the engine.
The aviation regulator ordered that if the check valve is found to be corroded, the airline operator must replace this key component before the airliner is put into use again.
Boeing responded later in the day that the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic led to reduced travel demand, so many passenger planes were sealed or less used, and " check valves were more vulnerable to corrosion. "
Boeing also said that it has advised air operators to inspect the passenger aircraft involved in the directive. If problems are found, Boeing will provide assistance in repairing and replacing check valves.
The Associated Press reported that passenger planes owned by major US airline operators usually fly many times a day, but after the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic, a large number of passenger planes have been grounded; with the recent slow growth of passenger travel demand, some passenger planes have returned to operation.
The FAA did not release details of the four air parking reports.
Alaska Airlines disclosed one of the incidents later on the 24th.
The airline operator said in a statement that on July 15, one of its passenger planes was flying from Seattle, Washington, to Austin, Texas, when an engine suddenly shut down, and the passenger plane finally made an emergency landing at Austin Airport.
Alaska Airlines said it had replaced the engine of the airliner and had inspected the engines of six airliners in accordance with FAA instructions.
American Airlines, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines said on the 24th that their airliners had no engine failure related to the air check valve.
Four American Airlines passenger planes will be inspected, and 28 United Airlines passenger planes will be inspected.
Delta Air Lines said it would inspect its 20 airliners, but did not say whether there had been engine failure.
According to several media reports, the FAA emergency airworthiness directive is another impact on Boeing.
A Boeing 737MAX of Lion Air Indonesia and Ethiopian Airlines crashed in October 2018 and March 2019 respectively, killing a total of 346 people.
This series of passenger planes were subsequently grounded worldwide, stopped production in January this year, and resumed production in May.
FAA Director Steve Dixon admitted in June that the FAA had " made a mistake " in regulating Boeing with regard to the 737MAX.

The " Nutrition Agent " of the History of the Party and the History of New China-Chinanews.com
2020-07-26 17: 37: 29 Source: People's Forum Network Author: Zhu Yanjing Editor: Zhu Yanjing
Recently, when visiting the Siping Battle Memorial Hall, General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed: " It is necessary for 1.4 billion people and more than 90 million party members, especially leading cadres at all levels, to learn the history of the Communist Party of China and the history of New China well. "
Conscientiously studying the history of the Party and the history of New China is a compulsory course for Party members and cadres to keep their original intentions in mind and keep their mission in mind. They should draw rich nourishment from it, cultivate the feelings of home and country, and take the long march of the new era.
A magnificent history of the Party and the history of New China records the hard work and glorious course of the Communist Party of China since its birth, and shows the faith and loyalty forged by the Communists with their lives and blood, as well as the original intention and mission that they will always adhere to.
History is the best textbook. For party members and cadres, the history of the Party and the history of New China are the brightest chapters in this textbook.
Every party member and cadre should constantly strengthen the historical thinking of taking history as a lesson and moving towards the future, base on the new journey and new mission, take the " baton " of the times and take the long march road of the present generation.
Cast the soul with history and stick to the original mission in studying the history of the Party and the history of New China.
Turning to the history of the Party and the history of New China, it is full of the immutable original mission and rock-solid belief of the Chinese Communists, which shows the simple feeling that the Communists will always be with the people.
To get a close understanding of the important events, important meetings and important figures in the history of the Party and New China is not only an intuitive spiritual shock and ideological baptism, but also to understand the connotation of the original belief from the depths of the soul and know the weight of the mission.
For party members and cadres, if they want to constantly strive for their original mission and always maintain their advanced qualities, they must find the origin and fulcrum of our original intention from the history of the Party and the history of New China, maintain a clear understanding and firm position, stir up the strength of fighting bravely for the country and the people, and ensure that the red mountains and mountains laid by the revolutionary ancestors with blood and lives are passed on from generation to generation.
It is wise to study history and inherit the noble spirit in studying the history of the Party and the history of New China.
Since the founding of the Communist Party of China, it has successively shaped a series of great spirits such as the red ship spirit, the Jinggangshan spirit, the Long March spirit, the Yan'an spirit, the anti-war spirit, the Xibaipo spirit, the " two bullets and one star " spirit, and the space spirit.
These great spirits precipitated by history provide a strong spiritual incentive for our Party to overcome various risks and challenges on the way forward, and are valuable spiritual wealth that cannot be defeated, washed away or robbed.
The process of studying the history of the Party and China is the process of revisiting these spirits and shaping self-spirit. We should consciously take the lofty spirit of the revolutionary ancestors as a mirror, stick to the spiritual homeland of the Communists, build a solid spiritual base for advancing the great cause and realizing the great dream, inherit and carry forward these spirits and radiate the light of the new era.
Read history and introspect, and constantly correct and dispel evil spirits in studying the history of the Party and the history of New China.
For party members and cadres, there has never been any history that can bring more profound warning, enlightenment and reference than the history of the Party and the history of New China.
In the history of the Party and the history of New China, we can see not only the great deeds of the older generation of revolutionaries who are determined to devote themselves to their beliefs and persevere in striving to achieve the set goals, but also the profound lessons of some figures who have been shaken by their ideals and beliefs and walked to the opposite side of the revolution, enlightening and warning us to never stagnate and never slacken with firm determination and will, always maintain a full and tenacious fighting spirit, constantly purify the party spirit and discipline ourselves.
To truly become a staunch believer and faithful practitioner of the lofty ideal of communism, it is necessary to brush away the ideological " dust " and strictly prevent " dirt " from dyeing himself. The history of the Party and the history of New China should be the basis for every party member and cadre to examine himself and warn himself.
Knowledge of history is inspiring, and bravely take the important responsibilities of the times in studying the history of the Party and the history of New China.
General Secretary Xi Jinping once pointed out: " Learning the history of the Party and national history is a compulsory course to adhere to and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics and continue to push forward various undertakings of the Party and the state. "
Looking back at history and asking the original heart, in order to continue the glory and move towards the future.
Every party member and cadre should take the study of the history of the Party and the history of New China as a lifelong pursuit, constantly correct the course of life in the study, bravely shoulder the historical mission, dare to take responsibility and take the initiative in their respective posts.
We will continue to take the advanced deeds of the older generation of revolutionaries as reference and guidance, constantly polish the political essence of the Communists, maintain the attitude of striving for the day and striving for success, and the spirit of struggle that is more difficult and more dangerous, and write a brilliant piece of our own in the vast journey of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
Pursuing the Poetic " Yellow River Dream " -Chinanews.com
(China's Poverty Reduction Story) Pursuing the Poetic " Yellow River Dream "
China News Service, Yinchuan, July 26 (Yang Di) " Jiuqu Yellow River thousands of miles of sand, waves and winds from the horizon. "
The Yellow River, which aroused the pride of countless literati, has given birth to the beautiful and rich Ningxia Plain. Now, Ningxia, which has the reputation of " plugging up the Jiangnan River, " is adhering to the concept of " ecological priority and green development " and pursuing the poetic " Yellow River Dream. "
The " Blue Wave Dream " of River Clear Water Show
" The Yellow River in the world is rich in Ningxia. " The Yellow River flows through Ningxia for 397 kilometers, which is the " mother river " for raising one side.
However, with the rapid advancement of industrialization and urbanization, the development, utilization, management and protection of rivers and lakes are unbalanced, and chaos such as excessive sewage discharge, land surrounding lakes, and encroachment on water areas are highlighted, leading to black and smelly water bodies, excessive water quality, dirty environment and ecological degradation.
Now, Ningxia is promoting the diverse restoration of water ecology and striving to clear the Yellow River.
Water control should start from the source.
In Yinchuan, Ningxia, the local government adopted the method of " raising standards + pollution control + strict management, " all sewage in industrial parks was treated centrally, all urban sewage treatment plants achieved Grade I A standard discharge, and black and smelly water bodies in urban built-up areas were basically eliminated, and the third batch of black and smelly water demonstration cities in China was successfully declared.
In addition, Ningxia fully implemented the river and lake length system in 2017, and now it has achieved full coverage of the five-level river and lake length system in districts, cities, counties and villages, and river and lake length patrol has become the norm.
Gu Jincheng, 64, who lives in a village near the Yellow River, witnessed the changes in the Yellow River: " The water used to smell, but the smell disappeared after remediation. "
Gu Jincheng said that the ecological environment is better and his life is more comfortable. Now he often goes for a walk along the Yellow River with his family to feel the blue water and blue sky.
Sha Gu Xiangji's " Wetland Dream "
Flying birds, green trees, trestle roads, clear water... Fan Zhongyan's beautiful scenery of " Sha Gu Xiangji " has become a reality in the Yellow River Wetland Park in Yinchuan, Ningxia.
The Yellow River flows through Ningxia, and a variety of wetlands such as river wetlands, lake wetlands and swamp wetlands have been formed along the way, which plays an important role in promoting the rational utilization of water resources and water ecological balance, and has also become an important international bird migration channel.
Since 2009, relevant departments in Ningxia have invested about 3.45 billion yuan in wetland protection projects. At present, Yinchuan wetland covers an area of 19,200 hectares, with a wetland protection rate of 78.5%. There are nearly 200 natural lakes and swamp wetlands, with 5 national wetland parks, 1 national urban wetland park, 6 autonomous region-level wetland parks and 8 municipal parks.
Lu Jinhu, deputy director of Yinchuan Wetland Protection Center, told reporters that wetland protection has increased biodiversity, which is particularly evident in birds. " The gull is an endangered bird. There are only more than 20,000 in the world, of which more than 2,000 live in Yinchuan Wetland. "
At the same time, Ningxia has delineated a 500-meter red line for the wetland protection area on both sides of the Yinchuan section of the Yellow River in accordance with the law, stipulating that no unit or individual may carry out development, construction and business activities within the scope of protection except for public welfare projects.
Zhao Shaoyong, deputy director of Yinchuan Water Conservancy Service Center, said that through the treatment of pollution sources, the comprehensive improvement of river and lake ecology and the construction of terminal wetlands, the water quality of the nine main yellow drainage ditches in Ningxia has reached 100% of the Class IV standard. " Now the water is clear, the fish swim and the flowers bloom. "
Pu Huimin's " Drinking Water Dream "
Yinchuan City, Ningxia, once had an " awkward " title: the only city along the Yellow River that " guards the Yellow River and lacks water to drink. "
Since 2010, Yinchuan City has been facing the problem of persistent water shortage at the peak of summer. The " pain of water shortage " in the past ten years has become a painful summer experience for many high-rise residents. However, under the current situation that major water sources are at the limit of overmining and a large area of groundwater overmining funnel area has been formed underground in urban areas, water shortage has become a difficult problem for Yinchuan City.
Thanks to the improvement of the water quality of the Yellow River, drinking the purified Yellow River has become a good solution to the drinking water problem of local residents.
Ding Ming, deputy director of Yinchuan Water Bureau, said that in order to improve the living and production water demand of urban and rural residents in Yinchuan, Ningxia launched the water supply project on the western line of urban and rural areas in the Yinchuan metropolitan area in due course, replacing the original underground water source with high-quality Yellow River.
" On December 29, 2019, the water supply project officially provided water to the three districts of Yinchuan City. In 2020, residents of Minning Town and Helan County also drank the Yellow River. "
Ding Ming said that the Yinchuan water conservancy department will give overall consideration to the transformation of the integration of regional rural drinking water and urban water supply. " In the next step, we will integrate all the scattered rural water supply points into the West Line water supply project, and it is expected to basically realize the integrated urban and rural water supply in Yinchuan by the end of this year. "
Compaction responsibility departments strengthen flood control and disaster relief work-Chinanews.com
Compaction responsibility departments strengthen flood control and disaster relief work
CCTV News (CCTV News): According to the news from the Ministry of Water Resources, at 12 o'clock today (July 25), the river below Wangjiaba in the main stream of the Huaihe River exceeded the warning water level by 0.64 ~ 3.31 meters, and the river below Sha City and two lakes in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River exceeded the warning water level by 0.05 ~ 2.02 meters.
Taihu Lake has lasted for 28 days since it exceeded the warning water level on June 28.
At 12 o'clock today, the average water level of Taihu Lake was 4.67 meters, exceeding the guaranteed water level by 0.02 meters.
Today, after consultation and judgment, the National Defense General decided to continue to maintain the level II flood control response of the Yangtze River and Huaihe River, requiring all localities to compute their responsibilities and further implement flood control and disaster relief work.
Today, the National Defense Office and the Emergency Management Department urgently dispatched professional drainage vehicles from Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Fujian to help Jiangxi solve local problems such as urban waterlogging caused by heavy rainfall.
The United States launched a countervailing investigation against China for the first time with " undervalued RMB exchange rate "
In response to the recent announcement by the US Department of Commerce, it decided to launch an anti-dumping and countervailing investigation on strap (strap) products originating in China, and launched an investigation on the " undervalued RMB exchange rate " project.
China's Ministry of Commerce pointed out that this is the first time that the United States has filed a case in a countervailing case to investigate the so-called " undervalued RMB exchange rate " project, which China firmly opposes.
China's Ministry of Commerce issued a special press release on the evening of the 23rd, saying that China implements a managed floating exchange rate system based on market supply and demand and adjusted with reference to a basket of currencies, and the market plays a decisive role in the formation of the exchange rate.
The press release stressed that, on the whole, the RMB exchange rate is at a reasonable equilibrium level and has not been underestimated.
Since 2005, the RMB has appreciated more than 17% against the US dollar.
According to the data released by the Bank for International Settlements, from the beginning of 2005 to May 2020, the nominal effective exchange rate of the RMB appreciated by 38% and the real effective exchange rate by 49%, making it the strongest currency among the G20 economies and one of the currencies with the largest appreciation in the world.
The Ministry of Commerce pointed out that the exchange rate issue is beyond the competence of members to conduct countervailing investigations in accordance with the rules of the World Trade Organization.
The United States amended its regulations in February this year to conduct countervailing investigations on other countries' exchange rates, which has been suspected of violating WTO rules and has been opposed by many parties.
The press release said that even according to US regulations, the applicant's complaint contained a large number of errors and did not have the necessary countervailing elements such as financial support, benefit granting and exclusivity.
China urges the US to abide by existing international rules and stop conducting countervailing investigations into the so-called " undervalued RMB exchange rate. "
Affected by the further rise in tensions between China and the United States, the offshore and onshore RMB exchange rates against the US dollar fell sharply on the 22nd, both falling below the threshold of RMB 7.0 against the US dollar.
Whether the US Department of Commerce's move is intended to force up the RMB is worthy of attention.
The spot exchange rate of RMB against the US dollar rose above the 7.0 mark on the 23rd and closed at 6.9961.
The midpoint rate of the officially regulated RMB against the US dollar was lowered by 17 basic points to 6.9938 on the 24th.
As the epidemic situation gradually improves, the film and television industry, which has been silent for nearly half a year, has gradually returned to normal.

"
The " Best Actor and Actor " award has always been one of the focus of attention from the outside world. This year's competition is also extremely fierce. The shortlisted actors and actresses are all powerful actors. Chen Baoguo, Huang Lei, Lei Jiayin, Sun Honglei and Zhang Ruoyun will compete for " Best Actor. "
Chen Baoguo, Huang Lei and Sun Honglei are all highly qualified Mesozoic actors. Lei Jiayin, 37, is also a powerful actor, and Zhang Ruoyun, 32, is the youngest finalist.
In 2016, 34-year-old Hu Ge won the Magnolia Award for Best Actor for " Langya List, " becoming the youngest emperor in the award. If Zhang Ruoyun can beat several other predecessors this year, he will set a new record.
The competition for the best actress was finally fixed among the actresses who are the mainstay of the film and television industry, such as Haiqing, Ma Yili, Qin Hailu, Sun Li and Yan Ni.
It is worth mentioning that Sun Li was shortlisted for the role of Fang Xijin in " Settling Home. " This is her sixth nomination for the award. In 2014 and 2016, she won " Best Actress " twice for " The True Story of Hot Mother " and " The Story of the Moon. "

Lewis family: John Lewis is a fighter " fighting for the weakest "
U.S. Congressman and civil rights fighter John Lewis was remembered as a fighter " fighting for the weakest " at a memorial service for him on Saturday (July 25).
Lewis's public memorial service has been held in Alabama since Saturday.
There were two memorial services on the first day.
At a public memorial service at Troy University in Alabama on Saturday, Lewis's five brothers and sisters and a nephew spoke of him as a loving, fearless, family-oriented man.
" He devoted his life to helping others, " Lewis's youngest brother, Henry " Grant " Lewis, said at the meeting.
Samuel Lewis said his mother had warned John " not to get into trouble, not to get into trouble. "
He added that John did not heed his mother's warning, saying: " We all know that John is always in trouble, always in trouble, but that's because he insists on the right thing, and that's a good trouble. "
Lewis's brothers and sisters reminded people at the memorial service that John's most famous argument was to create " good trouble, " that is, to provoke trouble as long as it is for the sake of justice.
John applied to Troy University in Troy, Alabama, where he was born, but Troy University, then an all-white school, rejected his application.
John Lewis, who preached the gospel to chickens on his farm as a child, eventually earned a degree in religion and philosophy from Fisk University.
Years later, the University of Troy awarded Lewis an honorary doctorate.
Senator Doug Jones from Alabama said that the current protesters were " protesting peacefully and non-violently, " just as Lewis did in the civil rights movement.
Jones said: " Even if President Trump knocked over a boat and described all the protesters as a mob, he was wrong.
The protesters are patriots who want the United States to move towards a more equal country. "
A six-day series of events in memory of Lewis will culminate this week at a funeral in Georgia.
Lewis's coffin was parked at a public memorial service at the University of Troy on Saturday as people came to pay tribute to the civil rights pioneer.
Later Saturday, a private ceremony paid tribute to him in a chapel in Selma, Alabama, followed by a public memorial service.
On Sunday, Lewis's body will pass through the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma.
In 1965, he and protesters demanding black voting rights were severely beaten by Alabama police in front of the bridge, who also fired tear gas at protesters.
Lewis was almost killed at the time.
This day is later known as " Bloody Sunday. "
Lewis's body will be transported to Montgomery, the capital of Alabama.
Mayor Steven Reed encouraged people to line up on the sidewalk to complete the final journey with Lewis.
At the same time, officials require the public to wear masks and maintain social distance when participating in activities.
Alabama Governor Kay Ivey ordered flags to be flown at half-mast on Saturday and Sunday in memory of Lewis.
During the nearly week-long commemoration, Lewis's body will be briefly placed at the Alabama State Capitol in Montgomery, the Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta, and the United States Capitol in Washington.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced last week that people can come to the U.S. Capitol on Monday and Tuesday to pay tribute to Lewis.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a public event in memory of Lewis will be held outdoors.

"
Pay attention to calcium supplementation and casting the soul, and strengthen political leadership.
To strengthen the political leadership of grass-roots governance, it is necessary to implement the " calcium supplementation and soul casting " project well.
It is necessary to study deeply and understand Xi Jinping's thought of socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era as the primary task, take " not forgetting the original intention and remembering the mission " as the eternal subject of party building and the lifelong subject of party members and cadres, strengthen the understanding of the principles of reading the original text, continue to promote the Party's innovative theory through special training, batch training, discussions and exchanges, and hold large lecture halls, and promote party members and cadres to further strengthen the " four consciousness, " firmly " four self-confidence, " achieve " two maintenance, " and better perform their duties.

Pay attention to practical training, and in the process of solving key and difficult problems in the field of grass-roots governance, solve the troubles and troubles that the masses are concerned about, and sharpen the party spirit and ability.
To improve the standard and build a battle fortress.
Grass-roots party organizations are not only an important part of the grass-roots governance system, but also an important carrier of governance ability.
To promote the standardization construction of grass-roots party organizations, we should start by grasping the rules and regulations on the work of party branches, focus on the weakening and falsification of party leadership, and establish a solid foundation, complement each other and promote development by establishing an up-and-down linkage mechanism, innovating the form of branch establishment, normalizing and rectifying weakness and disorganization, establishing and improving the decision-making and deliberation mechanism, and serving the masses mechanism.
In rural areas, we will strengthen the standardized construction of village-level party organizations, standardize organizational forms, learning activities and management mechanisms according to the standardized construction standards of party branches, and effectively promote the detailed implementation of systems such as " three meetings and one lesson " and thematic party day activities.
In cities, pay attention to street communities, explore innovative branch setting forms, focus on weak areas, " bridge " and " pain points, " and actively build urban party building alliances to achieve effective coverage of the party's work.

It is necessary to take the improvement of governance ability as a compulsory course for grass-roots party members and cadres, continuously strengthen ideological refinement, professional training and practical training, carry forward the spirit of responsibility in their posts and urgent, difficult and dangerous tasks, and lay a solid foundation and contribute to the modernization of the national governance system and governance capacity.
We should widely carry out " community whistling and party members reporting " activities, and participate in community construction, management and service by participating in thematic party day activities, contacting people in need, determining service projects, claiming micro-wishes, and putting forward reasonable suggestions, so that party members can play a role in community governance.
We should give full play to the role of rural unemployed party members, and guide the majority of grass-roots party members to take an active part in poverty alleviation, ecological construction, letters and visits to maintain stability, and straw burning ban, so as to better integrate red forces and serve the people by setting up vanguard posts for unemployed party members and forming task forces for unemployed party members.
A solid foundation makes the building strong.
Grass-roots party organizations are the foundation of the ruling building.
Only by adhering to the focus of strengthening the relationship between the party and the masses and increasing the well-being of the people, and taking the leadership of party building as the fundamental way to promote the innovative development of grass-roots governance, can we build a solid foundation so that grass-roots party organizations can pull out and stand up, and grass-roots party members and cadres can catch up and rush up, so as to promote grass-roots governance with a " soul, " orderly, powerful and effective.

Kao Xili Tibetan antelope enters the migration season-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, July 25 (Reporter Wang Jinjin) The reporter learned from the Wudaoliang Protection Station of the Kaoxili Management Office of the Yangtze River Source Park of the Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration that the monitoring showed that the Tibetan antelopes who had previously migrated to the Zhuonai Lake area in the hinterland of Kaoxili were ending giving birth and began to return to their original habitat with their young.
Surveillance footage near Wudaoliang Protection Station shows that on July 25, about 40 female Tibetan antelopes led three Tibetan antelope cubs through 3002 kilometers of Qinghai-Tibet Highway and Wudaoliang North Bridge of Qinghai-Tibet Railway. Tibetan antelopes have begun to move back.
According to expert analysis, in recent years, the number of Tibetan antelope cubs in the returning sheep accounted for one-quarter to one-fifth of the total number of Tibetan antelopes.
Lian Xinming, an associate researcher at the Northwest Plateau Institute of Biology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said: " In the early stage of migration, the Tibetan antelope faces a higher risk of predation, so the number of cubs in the sheep will be relatively small, and there may even be no cubs. "
According to the statistics of the Kao Xili Management Office of the Yangtze River Source Park of the Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration, the number of Tibetan antelopes returning is generally increasing year by year. In 2019, the number of Tibetan antelopes returning was 4,860, an increase of 338 over 2018.
Lian Xinming said: " It is expected that the migration of Tibetan antelopes this year will end in early September, and the number of Tibetan antelopes is still expected to continue to increase. "
The Tibetan antelope is a national-level protected animal.
At the end of May every year, Tibetan antelopes from Sanjiangyuan in Qinghai, Qiangtang in Tibet, Aljinshan in Xinjiang and other places go to Zhuonai Lake in the hinterland of Koxili to give birth.
Wu Xiaomin, a Tibetan antelope protection expert in China and a researcher at the Shaanxi Provincial Institute of Zoology (Northwest Institute of Endangered Animals), said: " The migration of Tibetan antelopes is a process in which female Tibetan antelopes return to their habitat with their cubs after giving birth. At first, the migration group leaving the breeding site is relatively large, but then Tibetan antelopes will return to their respective habitats according to different geographical populations and along different paths. "
In order to ensure the safe relocation of Tibetan antelopes, the reporter learned that the Kaoxili Management Office of the Yangtze River Source Park of the Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration has arranged staff to continuously carry out video monitoring and district patrols in the main relocation areas.
If a herd of Tibetan antelopes is found trying to cross the road, the mountain patrol team will carry out temporary traffic control at the first time to let the sheep safely pass through the wildlife passage to ensure that they are as little disturbed by human beings as possible on the way back.

Hubei Daily News (Reporter Lin Jing) On July 26, Enshi City announced that it praised Chen Guangming, a geological disaster site monitor who had made important contributions to the early warning of Shaba landslide, and sent him a prize of 50,000 yuan.
At the same time, party members and cadres in the city are called upon to learn from his spirit of dedication, courage, initiative and dedication.
On July 21, a landslide occurred in the sand dam of Mari Village, Tunbao Township, Enshi City, resulting in the formation of a barrier lake in the main stream of the Qingjiang River. Chen Guangming, 58, was the first person to warn of the landslide.
On the afternoon of July 17, Chen Guangming learned that the walls of the villagers' homes were cracked and immediately went to the scene to check.
As soon as he walked five or six hundred meters from his home, he saw the village road split four or five centimeters, extending along the road to the cornfield, with a length of about 50 meters.
Chen Guangming Dunsheng was alert and sent the photos of highway cracking to the township " geological disaster monitors contact group " for the first time.

The new drug developed by the University of Australia is expected to be used to treat vascular blockage caused by COVID-19-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Sydney, July 26 (Reporter Chen Yu) Researchers at Monash University in Australia are developing a new drug to help prevent heart disease and stroke, and hope that this drug can be used to treat blood vessel blockage caused by COVID-19.
Researchers have found that an enzyme in platelets accelerates platelet clotting before a heart attack or stroke.
As a result, they developed a drug that can temporarily inhibit platelet coagulation, thus avoiding blood vessel blockage and preventing heart disease and stroke.
Researchers say the drug only inhibits the clotting effect of platelets when there are signs of heart disease or stroke.
Since studies have shown that similar vascular blockage is one of the main causes of death in severe cases of COVID-19, researchers hope that this drug can be used in the treatment of such severe cases in the future.
At present, the drug has achieved good results in animal model experiments, and researchers are preparing for the next stage of human clinical trials.
The research results have been published in the American journal Science and Translational Medicine.
He became the first spectator to enter the CBA League to allow spectators to watch the game live after the match.
On the same day, in the second stage (Laoshan Division) of the 2019-2020 Chinese Men's Basketball Professional League (CBA) replay held in Qingdao, Shandong Province, medical staff, teachers and public security front personnel completed the relevant procedures including nucleic acid testing through the official ticket purchase platform and entered to watch the match between Shanghai Jiushi Team and Shandong Xiwang Team.
During the viewing period, spectators must wear masks throughout the process, take seats in pairs, and strictly keep seats one meter apart.
When exiting, the audience must exit in order to maintain the " one-meter line " social distance.
Xinjiang deeply cultivates " sunflower fields " and uses clean energy-Chinanews.com

China News Service, Hami, Xinjiang, July 26, Topic: Xinjiang deeply cultivates " sunflower fields " and uses clean energy
More than 6,000 pentagonal sunsetting mirrors, each 48 square meters, are neatly arranged in a circle, such as a silver " sunflower field, " which rotates with the sun and reflects sunlight to a heat absorption tower more than 200 meters high in the center to generate electricity.
The reporter saw this scene on the 25th at the Hami molten salt tower photothermal power station of CLP Project in Mumaohu Town, Yiwu County, Hami City, Xinjiang.
" The so-called molten salt tower photothermal power generation is to reflect sunlight through the mirror to the heat absorption tower to form heat energy, and then convert heat energy into electricity through traditional power generation technology. "
Zhang Yong, deputy general manager of CLP Hami Solar Thermal Power Generation Co., Ltd., said that its design principle is similar to that of solar stoves used in rural areas in northwest China, which should gather sunlight.
The power plant started construction in October 2017 and was connected to the grid at the end of last year. It covers an area of 6,600 mu, and a total of 14,500 heliostats are planned to be installed.
" Compared with traditional solar power generation technology, its biggest advantage is that it can store the accumulated heat energy and generate electricity at night. "
Zhang Yong said that the 13-hour heat storage system configured in the project can keep the generator set running continuously and steadily without being affected by light changes; it can also quickly participate in power grid peak adjustment according to the peak and valley demand of power grid load.
When fully completed, the project can generate 198 million kilowatts of electricity per year, save more than 60,000 tons of standard coal per year, reduce emissions of more than 60 tons of sulfur dioxide, more than 60 tons of nitrogen oxides, about 20 tons of soot and more than 150,000 tons of carbon dioxide, and provide a continuous supply of clean energy for the local area.
In addition, there is another silver " sunflower field " in the Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park in Hami City.
Hamifuguang Solar Photovoltaic Power Station covers an area of more than 2,300 mu. The 714 power generation equipment that has been built also follows the rotation of the sun, always keeping the sunlight at a right angle of 90 degrees with the surface of the concentrating plate.
" We adopt dual-axis tracking concentrated power generation technology. Through unified integrated control, all power generation equipment will adjust the angle according to the height of the sun to maintain power generation efficiency. "
Duan Mengqi, director of the power station, said that under good weather conditions, the power generation technology can improve the efficiency of traditional photovoltaic power generation by about 20%.
In the first half of this year, the power station has generated more than 7 million degrees of electricity, supplementing local electricity demand.
Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park is currently a photovoltaic industry demonstration park with the largest single scale and the most complete types of photovoltaic modules in Xinjiang. There are 38 photovoltaic power generation projects with a total installed capacity of 820,000 kilowatts.
In the first half of this year, electricity generation exceeded 110 million kWh, an increase of 6% over the same period in 2019.
Hami is one of the regions with the best solar energy resources in China.
The annual average total solar radiation is more than 6,200 megajoules per square meter, and the annual sunshine hours are about 3,200 hours.
In recent years, the city has vigorously developed the photovoltaic industry and planted " sunflower fields. "
A solar power generation scale with an installed capacity of more than 2.5 million kilowatts has been built, and the city's photovoltaic power generation exceeded 1.4 billion kilowatts in the first half of this year, a year-on-year increase of about 14%.
At present, there are more than 330 grid-connected photovoltaic power stations in Xinjiang, with an installed capacity of more than 10 million kilowatts.
It is expected that photovoltaic power generation will reach 15 billion degrees this year, which can replace more than 6 million tons of standard coal.
Police report details of " female college students missing from traveling to Qinghai " Search and rescue work is still continuing-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, July 26 (Reporter Wang Jin Zhou Zhe) Recently, " a female college student lost contact after traveling to Golmud, Qinghai " attracted the attention of netizens.
The Public Security Bureau of Golmud City, Haixi Mongolian and Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, reported on the 26th that Huang Yue, a student of a university in Nanjing, is still out of contact, and many police are going deep along the lost area of Huang Yue and actively looking for work.
On July 10, 2020, the Public Security Detachment of the Public Security Bureau of Golmud City, Haixi Province, received notification from his superiors that Huang Yue, a student of a university in Nanjing, took the Z164 train from Nanjing to Golmud on July 5. On July 9, his mobile phone was turned off and lost contact in the southwest area of Qingshui River, Sonandajie Protection Station, Qumalai County, Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, and asked for assistance in finding it.
According to the investigation by the Public Security Bureau of Golmud City, Huang entered Qinghai Province at 19: 54 on July 6 and arrived in Golmud City at 4: 00 on July 7.
At 8: 00 on the same day, Huang, the missing person, took a taxi from the Yellow River Hotel in Golmud City to the G109 National Road, and arrived at the Sonandajie Protection Station in Koxili at 12: 00. The taxi driver returned alone. Huang went to the Qingshui River area near the Sonandajie Protection Station at 15: 00 on the 7th until 18: 00 on the 9th. He shut down in the area.
In further investigation, the police found that Huang had passed the Naijigou checkpoint at 17: 07 on July 13.
Naijigou checkpoint is a checkpoint set up in Nanshan Pass, Golmud City, Nagqu City, Tibet Autonomous Region. Because there is no video surveillance at the checkpoint, it is impossible to determine the information of myself and the vehicle I am travelling in. The police can only drive along the way to search, and coordinate with the checkpoints along the way in Tibet if Huang is found, immediately contact the Golmud Public Security Bureau.
According to the latest situation, at 1: 00 a.m. on July 26, the Golmud Public Security Bureau organized rescue forces to carry rescue equipment to search for the unfrozen spring protection station and Sonandajie protection station along the Qinghai-Tibet Highway, and actively contacted the Sichuan police, the Tibet police and the Nanjing police to carry out joint work. At present, the search and rescue work is still continuing.
The local police hope that if the vast number of netizens and all sectors of society have relevant clues, they will provide them to the Golmud police and Nanjing Jiangning police in a timely manner, and strive to find the missing person Huang Yue as soon as possible.
At the same time, relevant experts suggest that tourists should be standardized, rational and civilized in outdoor activities, pay attention to roadside warning signs at any time, do not risk entering no man's land, and call the police in time when they encounter unexpected situations.
The US media uncovered the truth that the US side unjustifiably asked China to close its Consulate General in Houston-Chinanews.com

The US media uncovered the truth that the US side unjustifiably asked China to close its Consulate General in Houston
On the 24th, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the US Embassy in China that China had decided to revoke the license for the establishment and operation of the US Consulate General in Chengdu, and put forward specific requirements for the Consulate General to stop all business and activities, as a countermeasure to the US sudden request to China to close the Consulate General in Houston on the 21st.
This action of the US government has attracted many attention, and its political motives have been questioned by foreign media and scholars.
Why do you ask China to close the Consulate General?
Several foreign media said that it was not clear why the United States chose the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, but for the purpose of this move, the foreign media said bluntly: for the general election.
CNN (CNN) reported on the 23rd that the US request for China to close its Consulate General in Houston has raised questions about its political motives.
The article said that the disastrous response of the US government to the COVID-19 epidemic caused President Trump's poll approval rating to be relatively low before the election.
White House officials said privately that the tough strategy against China was to save Trump's approval rating and to shift responsibility for the failure of the White House's response to the epidemic.
According to the article, the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is a " politically driven and very cautious " target chosen by the United States, and the US government chose it " to create a tough attitude and avoid the risk of major conflict. "
The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) also believes that as the US election season approaches and the US economy is severely hit by the epidemic, Trump believes that " playing the' China card' has a political advantage. "
The current situation is " a spiral and tit-for-tat struggle, " which is driven to a certain extent by the US government from the perspective of domestic considerations, and will only worsen the tension between China and the United States.
CBS reported that Trump's re-election prospects were under pressure due to the outbreak of the epidemic, and he repeatedly blamed China for the epidemic.
Almost every day, the United States has new actions against Trump's absurd argument that " China exploits the United States. "
" The Consulate General of Houston is very important in establishing ties between the two countries. "
The Associated Press commented that the United States' request for China to close its Consulate General in Houston has exacerbated tensions between the world's two largest economies.
If the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is closed, in addition to the diplomatic impact, Chinese citizens in the southern United States face difficulties in obtaining consular services, as do American citizens seeking visas and other services.
A Houston business group expressed regret over the US request that China close its Consulate General in Houston, saying that the Consulate General has played an important role in establishing trade, investment and cultural ties between the two countries.
The Associated Press believes that this reflects the importance of China's economy.
The US Foreign Policy magazine website believes that this move by the US is " part of a series of provocative measures, which will only worsen US-China relations. "
Reuters quoted Jonathan Pollack, an expert on East Asia at the Brookings Institution, an American think tank, as saying that since the United States and China established full diplomatic relations in 1979, he could not think of any move comparable to the US action against the Chinese Consulate General in Houston.
Hong Kong's South China Morning Post reported that this move by the US is unprecedented in more than 40 years of diplomatic relations between China and the United States.
Analysts believe that this move may cause lasting damage.
The Chinese Consulate General in Houston was established in 1979 and is the first Chinese Consulate General to open in the United States.
At present, China has one embassy and five consulates in the United States.

On the same day, the Russian North Sea, Baltic Sea, Black Sea, Caspian Sea and Pacific Fleet held military parades in the waters where their respective bases are located, with a total of 15,000 soldiers, 219 ships of various types and 71 military aircraft participating.
Russian President and Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces Vladimir Putin attended the military parade of the Baltic Fleet.
About 4,000 soldiers, 46 ships and more than 40 fighters took part in the local military parade.
Putin first inspected the ship parade in the waters of the Kronstadt naval base in the Baltic Sea.
After that, he took a speedboat to the waters of the Neva River in central St. Petersburg and went ashore to watch the military parade on the Neva River.
Putin said in a speech at the military parade that the modern technical level of Russian naval equipment has continued to improve in recent years, and the Russian Navy will receive a total of about 40 new ships equipped with unique hypersonic strike systems in 2020.
In addition, the commander-in-chief of the Russian Navy, Yevmenov, said in an interview with Red Star, an organ of the Russian Ministry of Defense, that Russia's plan to build ships has been effectively implemented, and the number of new ships that the Russian Navy plans to receive in 2020 is the largest in recent years.
In 1696, Tsar Peter the Great set out to form a maritime fleet, creating the history of the Russian navy.
The last Sunday in July every year is the Russian Navy Day.
In response to the new changes in the epidemic prevention and control work, since July 17, trade unions at all levels in Xinjiang have responded to the call of the Autonomous Region Federation of Trade Unions and actively participated in the epidemic prevention and control work.
Trade union cadres, workers and labor models in the north and south of Tianshan walked into street communities and residents to carry out activities such as delivering vegetables and medicine, disinfection and sterilization, and publicizing epidemic prevention knowledge, to serve the workers and the masses, and to demonstrate the " hard nuclear power " of trade unions with practical actions.
Recently, the condolence group of the Tianshan District Federation of Trade Unions of Urumqi City sent a batch of urgently needed epidemic prevention and control living materials to the staff of 12 isolation points.
After the outbreak of the epidemic, Tianshan District invested more than 1.05 million yuan in the first time, which was urgently allocated to 23 directly affiliated grass-roots trade unions.
After receiving the company's notice on epidemic prevention and control, Zhao Xiangguo, deputy secretary of the Party committee and chairman of the trade union, chose to stay on duty in the unit to escort the employees.
He sent cooking utensils, food and daily necessities to the new employees living in the unit dormitory, and organized personnel to send them daily necessities every two days.

Spokesperson of the Embassy in the UK: The Chinese government is a staunch defender of cyber security-Chinanews.com
China News Service, July 26 According to the website of the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom, on the 25th, the spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom answered questions on the wrong remarks about cyber attacks.
The spokesman stressed that the Chinese government is a staunch defender of cyber security and has always resolutely opposed and combated any form of cyber attacks and cyber crimes.
A reporter asked: According to the media, hacker organizations related to China have interfered with the network system of a British company, attacked British and American technology companies with patent data, and invaded the government networks of EU countries.
The spokesman said that the Chinese government is a staunch defender of cyber security and has always resolutely opposed and combated any form of cyber attacks and cyber crimes.
Cyberspace is highly virtual, difficult to trace, and diverse actors. When investigating and characterizing network events, sufficient evidence should be produced, and there should be no groundless speculation.
The spokesman said that a series of events such as the " Prism Gate " in the past proved that the United States has been carrying out the largest cyber theft operation in the world.
Maintaining peace and stability in cyberspace serves the common interests of all countries.
The spokesman pointed out that China's achievements in scientific and technological innovation were not stolen or stolen, but achieved through self-reliance and hard work.
In 2019, China submitted about 59,000 patent applications through the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), with an annual growth rate of 10.6%, making it the country with the largest number of international patent applications.
China has become a big country in innovation and intellectual property rights.
Data from the Urumqi Central Sub-branch of the People's Bank of China show that in the first half of the year, new loans for agriculture-related and small and micro enterprises in Xinjiang exceeded the annual increase in 2019.
In the first half of this year, the Urumqi Central Sub-branch of the People's Bank of China used a variety of monetary policy tools to guide the banking industry to continuously increase loan investment, providing sufficient financial guarantee for epidemic prevention and control and the resumption of work.
Free nucleic acid testing in Urumqi Most districts have basically completed secondary testing in high-risk areas-Chinanews.com
China News Service, Urumqi, July 26 (Reporter Sun Tingwen Zhao Yamin) Zhang Wei, director of the Urumqi Municipal Health Commission, said on the 26th that at present, free nucleic acid testing in Urumqi has been basically completed in most districts.
The expert group of the State Council and experts from the autonomous region and Urumqi are further evaluating the development of the epidemic based on the results of nucleic acid testing and epidemiological investigations.
The Press Office of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region held a press conference on the 26th to report on the epidemic situation and prevention and control in Xinjiang.
According to him, from 0: 00 to 24: 00 on July 25, there were 22 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 pneumonia in Urumqi (including 5 cases of asymptomatic infection) and 38 new asymptomatic infections.
As of 24: 00 on July 25, there were 135 confirmed cases and 147 asymptomatic infections in Urumqi.
The new asymptomatic infections on the 25th also basically passed the city's free nucleic acid testing and active screening.
Zhang Wei, director of the Urumqi Municipal Health Commission, said on the 26th that free nucleic acid testing in Urumqi has been basically completed in most districts.
He also said that from the experience of other regions in China, there are many factors that affect the nucleic acid test results, such as the sensitivity of the detection reagent, the infection time and detoxification time of the tested person, the cooperation of the tested person when the specimen is taken (poor cooperation may lead to the specimen not being taken in place), the detection environment, the operational proficiency of the inspectors, etc.
For various reasons, nucleic acid testing will also show false negative results.
The so-called false negative means that the tested person is indeed infected, but the nucleic acid test result is negative.
In addition, two nucleic acid tests are usually needed to exclude people who have been in close contact with confirmed cases and suspected cases.
For people who have been to high-risk areas in the epidemic, if fever and respiratory symptoms occur, one negative nucleic acid test may be false negative, so two nucleic acid tests are also needed to rule out.
He said that in view of the above situation, for the sake of the health of the people of all ethnic groups in the city, from today, Urumqi will conduct two free nucleic acid tests in key areas such as Tianshan District and Shaybak District, and carry out " checking and filling leaks " at the same time.
It is reported that Tianshan District and Shaybak District are high-risk areas for epidemic diseases.

"
As the first international film and television festival held since the continued spread of the global epidemic and the normalization of epidemic prevention and control in China, this year's Shanghai International Film Festival is of great significance.
On the basis of doing a good job in the normalization of epidemic prevention and control, holding the Shanghai International Film and Television Festival is not only a sign of confidence, but also a declaration of determination - our confidence and determination to overcome the epidemic will remain unchanged, our confidence and determination to run the people's festival will remain unchanged, and our confidence and determination to build a global film and television creation center and launch the " Shanghai Culture " brand will remain unchanged.
Every year, the Shanghai International Film Festival, with the attitude of continuous innovation and continuous progress, is a new start and a new start.
Therefore, it is necessary to take every step to serve the spiritual life of the people and the high-quality development of the film and television industry.
This is even more so this year.
In order to cherish the hard-won epidemic prevention and control situation, the Shanghai International Film Festival, on the one hand, strictly adheres to the epidemic prevention requirements and implements the epidemic prevention and control measures in detail; on the other hand, with the vision of gathering wisdom for Chinese film creation and meeting the needs of movie fans, it opens multi-plate activities both online and offline.
On the first day of the opening ceremony, from offline viewing to industry forum, the relevant epidemic prevention policies were strictly implemented in the relevant activities of the film festival.
Forum activities are controlled within 50 people, and the attendance rate of each movie viewing is strictly controlled within 30%.
As the organizing committee of the film festival upholds, in any case, " putting the lives and health of the people first " is a major premise.

White House epidemic expert Forge: cautiously optimistic about the development of a vaccine in early 2021
Forge made the above remarks at an online video conference hosted by the International Leadership Foundation on the 25th.
He reminded that it is not clear how the COVID-19 epidemic will develop in autumn and winter, or what the ultimate impact of the epidemic will be. " The only way to end all this is for each of us to choose to be part of the problem. "
According to the data of Johns Hopkins University in the United States, as of 21: 00 on the 25th, there were 4.176 million confirmed cases and 146,000 deaths in the United States.
Forge said that some parts of the United States are currently struggling with the rebound of the epidemic.
Although the epidemic situation varies from place to place and needs to be adapted to local conditions, diversified anti-epidemic strategies do not mean that there is no close connection between regions.
An epidemic in one area will eventually affect other areas.
" This is not the time for complacency, " Forge said. " Our work is not finished. We must intensify our efforts and be vigilant about the uncertainty of the future. "
He Dayi, a Chinese-American medical expert and founder of " cocktail therapy " to treat AIDS, pointed out at the meeting that the COVID-19 epidemic in the United States has not yet reached its peak.
" Each of us must do our part to slow the spread of this virus. "
He Daichi called on the public to use their own practical actions to buy time for scientists to step up the research and development of COVID-19 therapeutic drugs and vaccines.
The International Leadership Foundation is a non-profit organization that aims to promote international exchange activities in the United States and the Asia-Pacific region. It is committed to enhancing the status of Asia-Pacific Americans and cultivating international young leaders.
On the same day, US Secretary of Transportation Zhao Xiaolan, US Representative Meng Zhaowen and Dong Jiling, founding president of the International Leadership Foundation, spoke at the meeting respectively.
They paid special tribute to the Asia-Pacific medical workers and volunteers who were fighting the epidemic on the front line, and called on the American public to continue to adhere to epidemic prevention guidelines such as " social distance " to curb the spread of the epidemic.

Brazilian study shows that hydroxychloroquine is ineffective in the treatment of mild and moderate COVID-19 pneumonia-Chinanews.com
Recently, a Brazilian study showed that hydroxychloroquine was ineffective in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 pneumonia.
The study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

On the 25th, the 2020 Hunan Red Tourism Culture Festival and the first Xiangtan Red Cultural Industry Expo opened in Shaoshan.
In recent years, the demand for red tourism has gradually increased.
However, the development of red tourism industry also faces difficulties such as few young groups, homogenization of tour projects and single commercialization channels.
In particular, this year's epidemic raid has seriously frustrated the national cultural and tourism industry, and red tourist attractions are also facing serious challenges.
For example, the use of scientific and technological means such as drone photography and VR immersion experience can meet the tourist needs of " no one has arrived, the scenery has arrived "; the introduction of live webcasting means to promote the famous and special products of red scenic spots can directly improve the economic benefits of red tourism; the introduction of " cloud " technology to create a boutique exhibition with prominent themes, clear orientation and rich connotation, to fully display and enhance the propaganda and education function of red scenic spots; Innovate the mode of dissemination of red culture, make revolutionary cultural relics " live, " make red tourism popular, let red genes pass on, and enhance the attractiveness of red scenic spots.
This cultural festival uses the popular " county and county (district) chief + professional anchor special promotion " method to promote red cultural tourism products, and uses 5G technology to provide real-time viewing and smart city demonstration services to promote red cultural tourism attractions. These are all efforts to insert smart wings for red tourism, and expect Hunan red tourism to become more and more prosperous.
Representatives of the US-China Trade Talks met in August
Hong Kong's South China Morning Post quoted an anonymous person familiar with the matter as reporting on the 25th that Liu He, head of the Chinese trade negotiation team and Vice Premier of the State Council, and Lai Haizhe, co-leader of the US team and trade representative, are expected to hold formal talks in August to assess the implementation of the first phase of the Sino-US trade agreement.
The report said that although China has significantly increased the amount of US agricultural products purchased in the past few months, due to factors such as the virus epidemic, the amount of Chinese purchases is still some distance from the amount promised in the trade agreement.
Analysts said that the recent closure of each other's consulates between the United States and China, together with other disputes, could undermine any progress in trade between the two sides.
The first phase of the China-US trade agreement entered into force one month after it was signed on January 15. The agreement stipulates that the high-level trade framework group of the two sides should hold talks every six months.
According to people familiar with the matter, the meeting will be " an important turning point " for both sides to assess the progress of the agreement.
However, this person also said that if the tension between the United States and China leads to a low willingness to talk at this time, the two sides may agree that the conference call between Lai Haizhe and Liu He on May 8 has met the clause of semi-annual talks in the trade agreement.
Since the beginning of this year, China-US relations have deteriorated rapidly. The disputes between the two sides include a series of issues such as the origin of the COVID-19 virus, trade, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, the South China Sea and ideology.
Although US President Donald Trump boasted about his achievements in the first phase of the agreement at the beginning of the year, his attitude has changed recently.
He said at the White House press conference on the 23rd that although China has recently purchased a record amount of US corn in a single day and bought a lot of soybeans, " this trade agreement is not as meaningful to me as it was when it was reached. "
An anonymous Beijing government adviser also believes that due to the poor US-China relations, a new round of trade negotiations is unlikely to take place, and " trade issues have lost weight in Sino-US relations. "
However, he revealed that China's economic and trade-related units still met on the 23rd to discuss a series of issues, including how to increase imports from the United States. " We have tried our best to buy, so any additional purchases will be difficult. "
Peng Jining, vice president of the US-China National Committee on Trade, said that it was " more important than ever " to maintain the momentum of the first phase of the agreement, and said that China had made progress in further opening up its financial markets to US enterprises this year.
" It's better to talk than not to talk, although it may only be seen as routine, " said an analyst at Plenum, an independent research firm.
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26 (Reporter Wei Yukun) The reporter learned from the Emergency Management Department on the 26th that the State Defense Office and the Emergency Management Department, together with the State Grain and Material Reserve Bureau, once again urgently transferred 1.35 million woven bags, 1.2 million square meters of woven cloth and 130,000 square meters of geotextile to Anhui to support the flood fighting and rescue work in Anhui.
According to the relevant person in charge of the emergency management department, at present, the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the Huaihe River basin maintain high water level fluctuations, and the " No. 3 flood of the Yangtze River in 2020 " formed in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River on the 26th, increasing the risk in some areas.
The meteorological department predicts that there will be heavy rainfall in Chongqing, Guizhou and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in the next three days, and the flood control situation is still severe and complex.
According to reports, since the onset of the flood, the Emergency Management Department has deployed national comprehensive fire and rescue teams to pre-position professional rescue forces in key flood control areas, participated in 10,364 flood fighting and rescue cases, dispatched more than 130,000 commanders and soldiers, 17,778 fire trucks and 11,887 boats, rescued 37,777 trapped people in distress, and evacuated and transferred more than 107,000 trapped people.
Hao Yusheng, chief representative of NASDAQ China: Now is the best time for Chinese companies to go to the United States for IPO-Economic Watch-professional financial news website
Economic Observer Network reporter Zhang Bin because of the coffee fraud incident, the US market has implemented stricter supervision on Chinese stocks, coupled with the long-term pressure on valuation, and Chinese stocks listed in the United States are under pressure. Netease, JD.com and other Chinese stocks have recently started their journey back to Hong Kong for listing.
Recently, companies such as Shell and Ideal Automobile have been enthusiastic about listing in the United States.
Under the epidemic situation and the Chinese stock market crisis, is now the best time for Chinese enterprises to go public in the United States?
" As far as the recent IPO cases and the next companies to go public in the United States are concerned, the IPO in the United States has not been affected in essence. On the contrary, the market is very good now, and even now this time point is the best time for Chinese companies to go public in the past 10 years. "
Hao Yusheng, chief representative of NASDAQ Stock Exchange in China, said at the " 2020 Listed Company Leaders Summit " hosted by Snowball.
In April this year, the US Securities and Futures Commission (SEC) and the US Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) issued the " Statement on the Important Role of Audit Quality and Regulation in Obtaining Audit and Other International Information-A Discussion on the Current Challenges of Information Access for US Listed Companies with a Large Business in China. "
The statement said that although international cooperation and coordination have increased significantly in recent years, the problems of US regulators in obtaining information still exist, and the SEC and PCAOB still face legal and practical challenges. Corresponding to the document, the PCAOB website lists in detail the list of listed companies and their audit institutions that have encountered audit obstacles, and a large number of Chinese stock companies are listed.
In addition, in May this year, the US Senate passed the Foreign Company Accountability Act, which introduced additional information disclosure requirements for foreign companies to list in the United States.
In Hao Yusheng's view, the Zhongbao stock crisis did not affect the appetite of investors.
" When this news first came out, it caused everyone's panic. Everyone was asking if they could go public in the United States in the future, but later we found that these questions were not a matter for investors. Investors may ask these questions during the recent IPO roadshow in the United States, or even become standardized questions, but this has not been regarded by investors as an important factor in investing in or not investing in a Chinese company.
It is suggested that everyone try to view the current situation with a normal mind.
Of course, this may appear to be the most serious situation in the past two years, but in terms of investors' appetite, it has not been affected in any way.
So the upsurge of IPOs in the United States will continue from now until the end of this year or before the US election. "
On May 9 this year, Jinshan Cloud officially listed on NASDAQ in the United States, becoming the first Chinese enterprise to go to the United States for an IPO after the epidemic.
" The listing of Jinshan Cloud gives great confidence to the Chinese companies that are preparing for IPO. "
Hao Yusheng said.
The data report on Chinese stocks in the first half of 2020 released by Snowball shows that in the first half of this year, a total of 20 Chinese enterprises went to the United States for IPOs, an increase of 17.6% over the same period last year; In terms of the total initial fund-raising, 20 enterprises raised a total of 2.725 billion yuan, an increase of more than 52.4% compared with the same period last year; In terms of industry distribution, the number of IPOs in the health care industry in the first half of this year was outstanding, an increase of 100% over the same period last year.
According to Hao Yusheng, the Chinese companies that went to the United States for IPO in the first half of this year are of high quality, and high-quality companies with strong fundamentals and growth will be more favored by investors.
In the short, medium and long term, Hao Yusheng continues to be optimistic about Ming China's IPO in the United States.
" In the short term, the upsurge of IPO in the United States continues; in the medium term, Chinese companies have more choices, A-shares, Hong Kong stocks and US stocks, and everyone will take the US election and Sino-US relations as market choices and timing considerations; In the long run, everything will return to normal, and market fluctuations are cycles, both political and economic, and will eventually return to the normal stage. The stock market has always been volatile. "
Hao Yusheng also said, " There are many uncertain factors this year, but for high-quality companies, whether the market is good or bad, as long as they are solid and have growth that investors can see, other factors are relatively secondary. Investors need to invest in excellent Chinese companies. "

Commentator of People's Daily: Concentrate on doing your own business well and create new advantages for future development--On learning and implementing General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech at the Entrepreneurs Symposium-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 25 (People's Daily, July 26) Commentator's article: Concentrate on doing your own business well and create new advantages for future development
At present, the global epidemic situation and the world economic situation are still severe and complex, and the challenges facing China's development are unprecedented.
Maintaining strategic concentration, enhancing confidence in victory, and concentrating on our own affairs is the key for us to cope with various risks and challenges.
At the recent Entrepreneurs Symposium, General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed that under the current external environment of rising protectionism, the downturn in the world economy and the shrinking global market, we must concentrate our efforts on doing our own business, give full play to the advantages of the domestic super-large-scale market, gradually form a new development pattern with the domestic big cycle as the main body and the domestic and international double cycles mutually reinforce each other, raise the modernization level of the industrial chain supply chain, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation, speed up key core technologies, and create new advantages for future development.
He who monitors the situation is wise, and he who controls the situation wins.
Under the external environment of the in-depth development of economic globalization, the market and resources have played an important role in the rapid development of our country.
Now, the world under the impact of the epidemic is undergoing profound changes, facing more unstable and uncertain factors, and economic globalization is encountering headwinds and waves.
A very important aspect is to take expanding and meeting domestic demand as the strategic basis for development, give full play to its own advantages, add impetus to China's economic development and drive the recovery of the world economy by flourishing the domestic economy and smooth the domestic cycle.
We should deeply realize that building a complete domestic demand system is related to China's long-term development and long-term stability.
The Party Central Committee reviewed the situation and made clear the firm implementation of the strategy of expanding domestic demand, which is the need to cope with the impact of the epidemic, to maintain the long-term sustainable and healthy development of China's economy, and to meet the growing needs of the people for a better life.
The advantage of large economies is that they are internally recyclable.
China has the most complete and largest industrial system in the world, strong production capacity and perfect supporting capabilities. It has more than 100 million market players and more than 170 million talents with higher education or various professional skills, as well as a super-large domestic demand market formed by 1.4 billion people, including more than 400 million middle-income groups. It is in the stage of rapid development of new industrialization, informatization, urbanization and agricultural modernization, with great potential for investment demand.
Public ownership is the main body, multiple ownership economies develop together, distribution according to work is the main body, and multiple distribution methods coexist. Socialist basic economic systems such as the socialist market economic system cannot only stimulate the vitality of various market subjects, liberate and develop social productive forces, but also promote the organic unity of efficiency and fairness, and continuously realize common prosperity.
We should firmly grasp the strategic basis of expanding domestic demand, make production, distribution and circulation rely more on the domestic market to achieve a virtuous circle, clarify the strategic direction of supply-side structural reform, and promote the dynamic balance between total supply and aggregate demand at a higher level.
We should accelerate the construction of a complete domestic demand system, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation and other innovations, accelerate the promotion of strategic emerging industries such as digital economy, intelligent manufacturing, life and health, and new materials, form more new growth points and growth poles, and gradually form a new development pattern with the domestic big cycle as the main body and the domestic and international double cycles mutually reinforce each other.
Opening up brings progress, and closure is bound to lag behind.
General Secretary Xi Jinping has repeatedly stressed that the door of China's opening will not be closed, but will only open wider and wider.
Taking the domestic cycle as the main body, it is not to operate behind closed doors, but to achieve stronger and more sustainable development by giving full play to the potential of domestic demand, making the domestic market and the international market better connected, and making better use of both international and domestic markets and resources.
At the same time, there is no contradiction between expanding domestic demand and opening-up. The smoother the domestic cycle, the more conducive it is to building a new pattern of opening-up, and the more conducive it is to forming new advantages in participating in international cooperation and competition.
Although the trend of protectionism is on the rise in the world, we should stand on the right side of history, adhere to deepening reform, opening up, strengthen open cooperation in the field of science and technology, promote the building of an open world economy and promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.
The Chinese nation has experienced many tribulations in its history, but it has never been crushed. Instead, it has become more and more courageous, constantly growing up and rising from tribulations.

Yubao earnings down " after 90 " but " retaliatory " to save money?
With the decline in Yuanbao's earnings, the " post-90s " not only did not escape Yuanbao, but began to " retaliate " to save money?
The " Yu Bao Post-90s Savings Report " (2020 Edition) recently released by the China New Economic Research Institute and Alipay shows that in the first half of the year, the " post-90s " prefer to save money: the amount of money saved per capita increased by nearly 40% compared with 2019.
Interestingly, the " post-90s " tend to start with a small sum of money, and 60% of the average amount of money saved is less than 20 yuan...
Saving money with Yu Bao has also become the saving habit of " post-90s. "
Data show that out of the 700 million Yubao users, 134 million users are " post-90s. "
There are 174 million " post-90s " in China, that is to say, about three out of every four " post-90s " in the country are saving money with Yu Bao.
At present, the 7-day annualized yield of Yuanbao and other monetary funds has fallen to about 1.5% from above 2% at the beginning of the year.
Even so, it did not affect the pace of saving money in the " post-90s. "
Under the background of the promotion of Yuanbao's " saving effect, " many young people who are accustomed to using Yuanbao have also been directly transformed into " basic people. "
Alipay data show that as of July 13, the number of new " basic people " on Alipay has more than doubled year-on-year in the past month, and more and more young people have achieved " advanced " financial management on Alipay.
Some analysts believe that the inflow of funds from Yubao into the stock market is also an important reason for the clear decline in the share of the International Monetary Fund in June.
The report also shows that " post-90s " girls are more likely to save more money, with an average of 20% higher than that of boys. Among the users holding funds on Alipay platform, 60% are men, and women tend to choose a more robust financial management method than men.
After saving money, what are the plans for the " post-90s "?
Alipay data shows that the " post-90s " have the habit of saving money for the goal, and the largest number of users take travel as the goal of saving money.
Affected by the epidemic, many " post-90s " saved money to prepare for travel after the epidemic; the resumption of cinemas also provided a new way to switch from saving money to consumption.

The report released on the 25th showed that 10 of the employees tested positive.
PCOO Deputy Minister of Administration and Legal Affairs Marvin Gatpayat said that the new administrative office building of the Ministry, located in the presidential palace, was originally scheduled to resume operations on the day of President Duterte's fifth State of the Union address on the 27th.
On the same day, Martin Andanal assured the public that PCOO continued to perform its duties to the Filipino people, ensuring that important information was provided to the public in a timely manner, and strengthening contact tracking and testing to avoid further spread of the COVID-19 pneumonia virus among PCOO staff.

France increases military investment in space-Xinhuanet
French Defense Minister Florence Paley said on the 24th that France will add hundreds of millions of euros to its space defense budget to develop space military forces to prevent " unfriendly actions " that other countries may carry out in outer space.
Paley told the Provence newspaper on the same day that between 2019 and 2025, the expenditure budget for French space military projects will increase from the previously proposed 3.6 billion euros (about 4.2 billion US dollars) to 4.3 billion euros (5 billion US dollars).
According to the French Military Planning Act 2019-2025 approved by the French Parliament in 2018, France is expected to update its existing observation satellites and communications satellites, launch three electromagnetic listening satellites, and improve the modernization of space surveillance radar.
French President Emmanuel Macron announced in July last year that a space military command and an " aviation and space force " would be established within the French Air Force.
Paley said she will officially announce the establishment of the space force when she visits a military school in Salon, Provence.
Paley said that this space force belongs to the Air Force and will have 500 personnel by 2025.
" People used to think that space serves the common interests of science, and this idea is gone forever. Now space is a place where countries compete for global hegemony, " she said.
Paley reiterated Macron's previous statement, saying that France has no intention of provoking an arms race.
" We are by no means engaged in an arms race, but it is my responsibility to be fully aware of the threats we may face. "
Paley recalled the surveillance of a military satellite shared by France and Italy in 2017.
She said that the " peeping " was a Russian satellite.
Russia denies this claim.
Paley said that France will " soon " have small patrol satellites capable of detecting and locking " the black hands behind those unfriendly actions. "
French media believe that the reason why France seeks to establish a space force is because US President Donald Trump asked the US Department of Defense to draft a bill to establish a space force in February last year.
Trump signed the National Defense Authorization Act last December, approving the establishment of the sixth army of the United States, the Pacific Air Force.
Some experts are concerned that these US measures have accelerated the pace of US space militarization and may trigger a new round of space arms race.

The report says the shared accommodation market has picked up since March-Chinanews.com
Xinhua News (Reporter Yang Zhaokui) The " China Shared Accommodation Development Report 2020 " (hereinafter referred to as the " Report ") released by the Sharing Economy Research Center of the National Information Center shows that due to the impact of the epidemic, the transaction volume of China's shared accommodation market decreased by 72.1% year-on-year in the first five months of 2020.
However, the shared accommodation market has picked up since March, and the market turnover, order volume and reception number have gradually recovered.
The Report shows that the transaction volume of the shared accommodation market decreased significantly. On the one hand, due to the sharp decline in the demand for travel accommodation under epidemic prevention and control, the number of orders decreased sharply. The total number of orders in the first five months decreased by 65% year-on-year and the number of arrivals decreased by 63% year-on-year. On the other hand, the weak demand also led to a relatively obvious decline in night prices, with the average night price in the first five months falling by 16% year-on-year.
However, the market turnover in March, April and May increased by 78%, 199% and 35% respectively; the number of orders increased by 141%, 152% and 50% respectively; and the number of receptions increased by 81%, 112% and 28% respectively.
The Report points out that the development of the shared accommodation industry has been promising for a long time, but there are still many uncertainties in the near future.
In this regard, Yu Fengxia, deputy director of the Sharing Economy Research Center of the National Information Center, told the reporter of the Workers' Daily that the development of shared accommodation needs stronger policy support. On the one hand, it is necessary to do a good job in the implementation of policies already issued in the early stages, further strengthen policy publicity and focus on creating a better business environment; on the other hand, it is necessary to further strengthen policy guidance and support from stimulating consumer demand, enriching the supply of tourism accommodation services, innovating service methods and strengthening cooperation between the government and platform enterprises.

Xiamen, China, July 26 (Yang Fushan Zhang Shushan Xu Jingyi) Vascular Surgery of Shanghai Changhai Hospital of Naval Military Medical University, a famous vascular surgery center in China, signed a contract with Vascular Surgery of Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University on the 25th to jointly set up a collaboration center to promote exchanges and cooperation between the two sides in the field of vascular surgery, especially in the field of aortic emergency and severe disease.
Zhongshan Hospital affiliated to Xiamen University said that after the vascular surgery of the two hospitals formally formed a collaborative unit, they will carry out remote consultation, formulate treatment plans with real-time online consultation with Changhai Hospital, select and send talents for further training, and jointly carry out weekly surgical technical exchanges, teaching and room inspection; For complex cases, Changhai experts can be invited to the hospital to perform surgery according to the needs of patients, so that patients in southwest Fujian can enjoy the top medical resources in China without leaving the province.
The two hospitals will also work together to carry out innovative scientific research on surgery, popularization of aortic diseases and early screening, etc.
A special seminar on aorta hosted by Beijing Health Promotion Association and hosted by Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University was held in Xiamen on the same day.
The two well-known hospitals in Shanghai and Xia held the signing ceremony of the Vascular Surgery Collaboration Center at the same time at the meeting, and announced the formation of a collaborative unit to jointly improve the treatment level of vascular surgery-related diseases in southwest Fujian.
The vascular surgery of Shanghai Changhai Hospital is the only institute of vascular surgery in the army and the only clinical medical center for vascular system diseases in Shanghai. It is also the first national key discipline of vascular surgery. It leads the establishment of the professional committee of intra-cavity angiology of the Chinese Physicians Association, and is a top team with deep accumulation in the industry.
Professor Huang Xiaojin, Director of Vascular Surgery of Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University, was interviewed by the media.
Vascular surgery of Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University is the first independent discipline of vascular surgery in Fujian Province. It has long been committed to the diagnosis and treatment of aortic and peripheral vascular diseases. In 2018, it was approved to build a provincial key clinical specialty.
In the treatment of aortic diseases, in addition to the treatment of dissection aneurysms and aortic aneurysms, he has extensive experience in emergency ruptured aortic aneurysms.
" The vascular surgery of Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University is very outstanding in this region in terms of its development history, breadth, difficulty and complexity. Therefore, this time we set up a collaboration center. In addition to aorta, we can also carry out in-depth cooperation in medicine, teaching and scientific research in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases such as lower extremity artery and carotid artery. "
Professor Feng Rui, deputy director of vascular surgery at Shanghai Changhai Hospital, said.
Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University and Shanghai Changhai Hospital signed a contract to establish " Li Zhaoshen Famous Medical Studio " in the Department of Digestive Medicine in 2018.
Professor Huang Xiaojin, director of vascular surgery of the hospital, said in an interview with Xinhua News that the vascular surgery of the hospital has also had a long history of exchanges with Changhai Hospital. This time, the two hospitals formally formed a collaborative unit, bringing the cooperation and exchanges between the two sides to a new level.
He said that the hospital will regularly invite Shanghai experts to Xia to carry out surgical technology exchange, teaching room inspection, difficult case discussion, etc., and further carry out remote consultation. At present, it plans to conduct remote consultation once a week. In addition, the department will also select personnel for further study and exchange to strengthen the training and development of subject talent team.
The reporter learned at the meeting that vascular disease is the leading cause of death in China. As the main road of various organs of the human body, the aorta flows from the heart to the whole body and plays an important role.
The occurrence of aortic diseases is often accompanied by high risk, high mortality and high difficulty of treatment. The thickest section of the aorta is up to 4 cm in diameter. Once a hemangioma is formed, rupture occurs, or vascular endometrial rupture produces dissection, it will cause massive hemorrhage, which is very dangerous.
In recent years, with the change of people's lifestyle and the acceleration of the pace of life, China has become the largest country in the world with hypertension, and aortic diseases have increased. Now, with the development of surgical technology and industrial materials, the treatment of aortic diseases has continued to develop in the direction of minimally invasive, rapid and efficient.
Doctors can properly " change channels " for blood flow by piercing from the thigh and placing a stent in the aorta, so as to avoid the impact on aneurysms or ruptured dissections, and achieve good therapeutic results. Some operations even require local anesthesia.
This academic symposium invited more than a dozen domestic experts to discuss the new progress in the treatment of aortic diseases, and carried out cutting-edge technical training and difficult case discussion in the form of a conference salon.
The reporter learned at the meeting that with the development of surgical technology and industrial materials, the treatment of aortic diseases continues to develop in the direction of minimally invasive, rapid and efficient.

On the way, they met King Kong's little sister, and the three completed their mission together.
This year marks the 15th anniversary of the game " Journey " IP, and the launch of the film of the same name is undoubtedly a tribute to the classic game.
At the same time as the announcement of the filing, the film " Journey " released the " National War " version of the filing poster and the " Live " pilot trailer.
The excellent picture quality presents a grand picture of the national war in the world, depicting the profound brotherhood of the two protagonists, Dongyi Long and Chu Soul.
" Journey " chooses the overhead era to build the story background.
In the fictional Central Plains, among the ten countries, the State of Southern Zhao and the State of Northern Yan live next to each other.
In order to defend the increasingly powerful Beiyan, Nan Zhao held a martial arts conference to select generals.
The news reached the remote Qingyuan village. The villager Dong Yilong wanted to be the flag bearer of the family and compete on behalf of the Qingyuan village family, but the villagers questioned his qualifications. After some efforts, Yilong finally embarked on a journey with the warrior Chu Soul.
The total investment of the film is nearly 300 million yuan, and the proportion of special effects shots in the whole film is as high as 80%.
Predictably, special effects have become one of the biggest highlights of " Journey. "

China News Service, Chongqing, July 26 (Reporter Han Lu) The reporter learned from China Railway Chengdu Bureau Group Co., Ltd. on the 26th that the Zhengwan High-speed Railway Small Three Gorges Tunnel, with a total length of about 18.9 kilometers, was completed on the same day.
It is understood that the Small Three Gorges Tunnel is not only the longest high-speed railway tunnel in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, but also the longest single-hole double-track high-speed railway tunnel with a design speed of 350 km / h among the projects currently under construction in China.
The Zhengwan high-speed railway is located in the three provinces and cities of Henan, Hubei and Chongqing. It connects the Beijing-Guangzhou and Xulan high-speed railway in the north of Zhengzhou, and reaches Chongqing in the south of Wanzhou. It is an important part of the " eight vertical and eight horizontal " high-speed railway network in China.
The Zhengwan High-speed Railway Small Three Gorges Tunnel was completed on the 26th.
The picture shows through the scene.
The Zhengwan high-speed railway starts in Zhengzhou City, Henan Province, and runs southwest through Pingdingshan City, Nanyang City, Xiangyang City, Hubei Province to Wanzhou District, Chongqing. The new line is about 818 kilometers long, with a design speed of 350 kilometers per hour, and about 184 kilometers in Chongqing.
Among them, the Zhengzhou-Xiangyang section has been opened for operation in advance on December 1, 2019, and the Chongqing section is stepping up construction.
The Small Three Gorges Tunnel, which runs through the entire line on the 26th, is a full-line control project of Zhengwan High-speed Railway. The project is located at the junction of Fengjie County and Wushan County in Chongqing, with a total length of about 18.9 kilometers and a maximum buried depth of 890 meters.
Construction of the tunnel began in February 2017 and the entire line was completed on July 26, 2020.
According to Wang Jun, head of Zheng Wan high-speed railway tunnel design of China Railway Second Academy Engineering Group Co., Ltd., the survey and designer, the small three gorges tunnel is located in very complex topography and geological conditions, facing risks such as karst, mud inrush and large deformation of soft rock. It is a Grade I high-risk tunnel, and the design and construction of the tunnel is extremely difficult.
" During the construction of the project, we used geological survey method, geophysical exploration method and advanced drilling method to advance geological prediction, and adopted special design schemes for more than 30 karst caves of various types. For example, a bridge with a length of 24 meters was designed and built to cross a large karst cave with a longitudinal length of more than 10 meters and a depth of more than 55 meters in the tunnel to avoid tunnel settlement, " the Royal Army said.
According to the China Railway Tunnel Bureau, during the construction of the tunnel, the combination of diversion and blocking was adopted. Through the construction of horizontal tunnel guide, grouting to block water, strengthening tunnel structural support and building sewage treatment station, it not only ensured the orderly progress of the project, but also avoided the damage of construction drainage to the water body of the Small Three Gorges Scenic Area. At the same time, it successfully overcome bad geology such as large deformation of soft rock up to 7 kilometers long, and construction problems such as multi-inrush mud inrush with a maximum daily inrush of 157,000 cubic meters.
After the full line of Zhengwan high-speed railway is completed and opened to traffic, it will become a new convenient and fast passenger transport main channel from southwest China to Central Plains, North China and Northeast China, which is of great significance for improving the capacity and quality of northeast railway channels in southwest China, improving the layout of regional road network, accelerating the development of tourism resources and urbanization along the route, promoting coordinated regional development, and promoting the implementation of the western development strategy.
Experts say it is unconstitutional to collect immigration data through the US Census for the allocation of seats in the House of Representatives
Some civil rights organizations and several American cities and counties have filed a lawsuit against the US federal government, saying that the Trump presidential palace's attempt to exclude undocumented immigrants from the US census is unworkable and unconstitutional.
The U.S. Census will determine the allocation of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.
" This will not work, " Sarah Brannon, an executive lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, told VOA.
She went on to say that Trump's request to determine the citizenship of people surveyed in the census is difficult to do and " not very reliable. "
Another civil liberties group, Common Cause, filed a lawsuit Thursday challenging Trump's executive order.
Some cities in New Jersey and Georgia joined the lawsuit.
Arlington County, Virginia, also joined the lawsuit Friday.
Garvey, chairman of the Arlington County Management Board, said, " The United States Constitution requires an accurate count of our population every 10 years. We must accurately count everyone living in Arlington County. This illegal attempt to scare people away and reduce the number of our immigrant community cannot be allowed to succeed. "
Other organizations and individuals praised President Trump's executive order.
Alabama Attorney General Marshall called the executive order a " victory " for the state.
" The allocation of seats in the House of Representatives and electoral college seats in each state must be based on the number of residents living in each state and the number of residents living legally, " he said.
The US Supreme Court last year blocked the Trump administration from including the issue of citizenship in the 2020 census.
President Trump signed an executive order earlier this week instructing Commerce Secretary Ross, who oversees the U.S. Census Bureau, to submit data on undocumented people from the census so that the administration can exclude these undocumented people from state census figures and determine whether each state increases, decreases or maintains seats in the House of Representatives.
The United States redistributes seats in the House of Representatives every 10 years according to demographic changes.

Respond to the situation and promote the construction of industrial projects-Viewpoint Headline-Shangbao Network-Huasheng Online
In Hunan in midsummer, heat waves hit the face.
The enthusiasm released by the on-site observation meeting to promote the construction of industrial projects in the province has overshadowed the heat of three days, and the clear orientation of " comparing the strength of the industry and the hero of the project " has encouraged Sanxiang and Sishui.
The development of Hunan always depends on building projects and cultivating industries.
In the face of the very unusual first half of the year, under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, the whole province adhered to a game of chess, went all out to fight the two tough battles of epidemic prevention and flood control, and took industrial projects as the " first move " to implement the " two cities. "
From a 1.9% year-on-year decline in GDP in the first quarter to a 1.3% year-on-year growth in the first half of the year, it is self-evident that the period is difficult and the efforts are enormous.
In this precious report card, the construction of industrial projects is the key support for Hunan to accelerate economic recovery and develop steadily.
The potential is smooth and irreversible.
The construction of industrial projects should be put into the overall situation. It is not only good at accumulating, accumulating and seeking momentum, but also good at understanding, seeking and adapting to change.
Under the complex and severe background of the current international situation, in addition to making great efforts to attract investment, it is necessary to calm down and study the new characteristics of the current new situation, better grasp the law, be more scientific and accurate, and better integrate into the new development pattern with the domestic big cycle as the main body and the domestic and international double cycles mutually reinforce each other.
Pay more attention to improving the basic capacity of industry.
In the first half of the year, not only did a large number of heavyweight investment projects in emerging industries in our province break ground and sow hope, but also enterprises in traditional advantageous industries accelerated their deployment and fell in the digital, intelligent and green industrial transformation.
The Yiyang Oskang Third Science Park project has transformed the existing production line, and the intelligent production line of high-end printed circuit boards has taken the lead; The new factory of Hunan Zhongyan Changde Cigarette Factory is committed to intelligent transformation and building a modern factory, which is also a vivid reflection of " old trees and new shoots "... Around the major national strategy and " two new and one heavy, " we focus on consolidating and upgrading competitive industries, actively cultivating and developing emerging industries, and comprehensively increasing scientific and technological innovation and localization substitution, so as to continuously consolidate the basic conditions and accumulate the kinetic energy of transformation.
Pay more attention to the cultivation and development of new economy, new business format and new model.
The sudden COVID-19 epidemic has brought the popularity of the " cloud economy, " stimulated the potential of the digital economy and provided new opportunities for industrial transformation: In the first half of the year, the computer and office equipment manufacturing industry, electronic and communication equipment manufacturing industry in our province grew by 12.6%, the online retail sales of wholesale and retail enterprises above the quota increased by 32.2% year-on-year, and the online meal fee income of catering enterprises increased by 35.6% year-on-year.
It is the general trend to cultivate new opportunities in the crisis, open new situations in the changing situation, actively promote digital industrialization and industrial digitization, and guide the integrated development of digital economy and real economy.
Pay more attention to optimizing and stabilizing the industrial chain supply chain.
Construction machinery is the main force of Hunan industry, but two-thirds of the supporting enterprises are outside the province, and there is still space and potential in the supporting chain.
To strengthen the thinking of the industrial chain and grasp the project, it is necessary not only to have the head enterprises continue to accumulate and achieve technological breakthroughs in the key links of the industrial chain; it is also necessary for all localities to cultivate, stimulate the " chain " lock response with strong chains to supplement and extend the chain, promote the coordinated layout of relevant supporting industries, and accelerate the construction of an independent, controllable, safe and reliable industrial chain supply chain.
To overcome difficulties and support enterprises, Hunan is still a hot and happy land with a good business environment and emerging market opportunities.
All parts of the province frequently make moves, make new moves, and make practical moves, believing that the " burden reduction " of enterprise relief will lead to the " acceleration " of high-quality development; Shaoyang implements " shareholder-style " service, which does not prevaricate for enterprises, does not discount policies, and does not solve problems overnight... In the process of recovering the losses caused by the epidemic, all kinds of " make every effort " to find out the short board pain points and achieve the living story of turning danger into opportunity.
Focusing on studying, cultivating and developing industries, and earnestly optimizing the business environment, we will surely win the favor of more investors.
The wind and waves are still ahead, but the state of riding the wind and waves has become the norm for the whole province to focus on the construction of industrial projects and promote high-quality development.
In this critical period, we must learn and implement the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's series of important instructions, effectively address external uncertainties with the certainty of our own work, persistently promote the construction of industrial projects, share enthusiasm and sweat, and ensure the successful conclusion of the 13th Five-Year Plan and the building of a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way.

The overall stability of employment and prices shows that the economy has a " temperature "-Chinanews.com

The overall stability of employment and prices shows that the economy has a " temperature "
Economic Daily · China Economic Network reporter Lin Huochan
In the first half of this year, in the face of the impact of the COVID-19 pneumonia epidemic, China made a concerted effort to promote epidemic prevention and control and economic and social development. The epidemic prevention and control situation continued to improve, the steady economic recovery was obvious, the employment and price performance closely related to people's livelihood were generally stable, and the Chinese economy handed over a report card of economic operation with temperature.
In the first two months of this year, the surveyed unemployment rate rose.
Especially in February, the production and operation activities of many enterprises were basically in a state of shutdown, the employment demand of enterprises decreased, recruitment was delayed or cancelled, and the urban survey unemployment rate increased.
With the gradual improvement of the epidemic prevention and control situation, the production and living order of the whole society has been continuously restored.
The CPC Central Committee adheres to the general tone of the work of stability and progress, further increases macro-policy hedging, comprehensively strengthens the employment priority policy, and actively promotes the work of assisting and stabilizing jobs and expanding employment.
China has increased its policies to hedge and stabilize jobs, played a combination of " relief, relief, slow return and compensation " policies, reduced and exempted the payment parts of three social insurance units in stages, allowed the postponement of the payment of social insurance premiums, expanded the benefits of unemployment insurance return and work-for-training policies for small and medium-sized enterprises, and provided absorption subsidies and internship subsidies to enterprises to absorb the employment of key groups.
With the implementation of various stable employment policies, the employment demand of enterprises has steadily picked up, the employment situation has gradually improved, and the surveyed unemployment rate in cities and towns has gradually decreased. In June, the surveyed unemployment rate was 5.7%.
Zhang Yi, director of the Population and Employment Statistics Department of the National Bureau of Statistics, said that in the second quarter, various employment policies continued to bear fruit, and the labor force that withdrew in the early period due to the impact of the epidemic returned one after another. The urban labor participation rate in June increased by about 10 percentage points compared with February, which is close to the level of the same period last year.
Data show that the total urban employment in June increased by more than 19% compared with February, and most industries reached the pre-epidemic level; the average weekly working hours of employees in enterprises reached 46.8 hours, 6.6 hours higher than in February and 0.1 hours higher than in January.
Prices also concern thousands of households.
In January this year, the CPI rose by 5.4% year-on-year, setting a new high for many years.
In February, although the year-on-year increase of CPI fell slightly, it was still in the " 5 range. "
The year-on-year increase of CPI is at a high level, which is driven by consumer demand before the Spring Festival, as well as the wrong month of the Spring Festival and a low year-on-year base.
However, the impact of the COVID-19 pneumonia epidemic on prices is particularly obvious.
Affected by the prevention and control of the epidemic, logistics delays, untimely supply of materials and increased transportation costs occurred in all parts of the country in January and February. In addition, some citizens hoarded and snapped up, and the prices of some basic necessities increased significantly.
In order to cope with the disturbance caused by epidemic prevention and control to the price situation, relevant departments have included important living materials in the scope of emergency transportation guarantee to ensure the smooth transportation of materials.
Under the effect of a series of policy measures, the market supply of vegetables, melons and fruits has been strongly guaranteed.
In response to the rapid rise in pork prices at the beginning of this year, after the central government issued the policy of stabilizing prices, all regions and departments quickly implemented it, the supply of pork reserves was significantly improved, the production capacity of pigs was restored in an orderly manner, and the production and marketing order was gradually normal.
Since March, pork prices have declined continuously, and the year-on-year increase in food prices fell to 10.6% in May. In June, pork prices rose slightly due to factors such as the slowdown in the number of pigs, the decrease in imports and the recovery of group consumption demand.
The seasonal variation of fresh vegetable prices is obvious, with an average increase of 3.4% in the first half of the year.
Affected by the high comparative base of the same period last year, fresh fruit prices continued to decline year-on-year, with an average decline of 13.3% in the first half of the year.
The basic livelihood of the masses has been effectively guaranteed, and the overall economic and social situation has remained stable and orderly.
With the gradual recovery of transportation and logistics, various places have increased their efforts, and the market supply and demand situation has improved.
Since March, the CPI has declined for four consecutive months, and the year-on-year increase has also fallen from 4.3% in March to 2.5% in June. The overall price level has returned to stability.
In the second half of the year, China's prices will continue to maintain a moderate level, and the overall inflationary pressure is small, but it is still necessary to promote the restoration of production and living order on the premise of normalizing epidemic prevention and control.
Effectively deal with natural disasters such as floods and droughts in major producing areas of grain, fruits and vegetables, strengthen market supervision, and resolutely crack down on acts that disrupt market order such as hoarding and pushing up prices.

Harry and Megan married in May 2018.
At that time, the marriage was seen as injecting Hollywood splendor and new era atmosphere into the British royal family, and the two became one of the most watched celebrity couples in the world.

China News Service, Qinghai, Hainan, July 26, Topic: " Flower Sea Studio " by Qinghai Lake: " Sweet " brings goods to help farmers increase their income
Author Hu Guilong Pan Yujie
" In midsummer, Qinghai Lake is full of golden flowers and thousands of bees flying. It has a high altitude, a large temperature difference between day and night, and less air pollution. The strong light has bred the most tenacious and generous bee colony, creating the characteristics of Qinghai royal jelly with high activity, high protein, rich nutritional value, low sugar and low fat. "
On the 26th, Zhang Jianxun, deputy director of the Industry and Information Administration of Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Qinghai Province, said.
On the same day, the live broadcast of bee products of " concentric war epidemic spring pulp to help farmers " was held on the shores of Qinghai Lake. The China Bee Products Association, representatives of entrepreneurs, bee farmers and other parties gathered to jointly promote Qinghai characteristic bee products. A total of nearly 10,000 bottles of Qinghai Plateau royal jelly were sold online and offline, with a total amount of nearly 3.8 million yuan.
The picture shows bee farmers showing bee products on the spot.
It is reported that this live broadcast activity uses Beijing Houdeli bee chain network, fast track, Taobao and other well-known domestic bee products retail enterprises, live broadcast and e-commerce platforms to promote the exchange and cooperation of " enterprises + bee farmers + growers, " and continues to issue " Qinghai Plateau spring pulp consumption vouchers " to consumers through online and offline channels, with an estimated total annual profit of nearly 5.28 million yuan.
In this regard, Wu Na, president of Beijing Houdeli Bee Industry Co., Ltd., thinks that it is " very worthwhile ": " This move can expand the popularity of Qinghai bee products, attract more consumers to understand and like pure natural bee products without adding, and drive bee farmers to increase their income. "
At present, the company has signed production cooperation strategic agreements with Qinghai Cloud Bee Industry Co., Ltd. and Qinghai Huabao Bee Industry Co., Ltd., hoping to jointly promote the rapid development of Qinghai local bee industry.
The picture shows the sea of rapeseed flowers by Qinghai Lake.
This spring, due to the need to set up road checkpoints for epidemic prevention and control, beekeepers were blocked from " chasing flowers for honey. " Many bees died due to missing flowering and lack of food, and beekeepers' income was seriously affected.
" Throughout the year, beekeepers travel long distances following the flowering period, moving all the way north from Yunnan and Sichuan to the northwest. They sleep in the open and have no fixed place to live, and they work very hard.
As businesses, we have a responsibility to help them. "
Wu Na said.
" Small bees are' environmental scouts', and bees in heavily polluted areas cannot survive. " Zhao Xiaochuan, executive vice president of China Bee Products Association, said that bee pollination is an important link in the ecological chain and plays an irreplaceable role in protecting plant diversity and improving the ecological environment.
At the same time, bee pollination can increase crop production and improve quality, especially in areas with wide variety and poor management conditions, pollination is of greater significance.
Research data show that pollination can increase rapeseed production by about 15% to 30%.
The picture shows Zhao Xiaochuan (right), executive vice president of China Bee Products Association, introducing Qinghai bee products.
" The economic, ecological and social benefits created by bee pollination are far greater than the value of bee products themselves. The bee industry has great potential in human health, crop production, vegetation reproduction and ecological protection, and people have always known little about this. "
Zhao Xiaochuan said.
Today, the number of beekeepers is decreasing. In addition to beekeepers who travel all year round, there are still many poor households with mobility difficulties who choose to invest in cooperatives with beehives.
" The state has financial support. We contact technical personnel to help guide. Beekeepers lack understanding and judgment of the market environment. To open a market, they also need the help and coordination of the government, enterprises and industry associations. "
Zhao Xiaochuan said.
" I hope you will pay more attention to and help beekeepers in the future, " Wu Na said. " Our bee products are also screened and controlled in strict accordance with national standards to ensure quality and protect the rights and interests of consumers while helping beekeepers. "

Liu Yunlong, the old face of spy drama, plays a stuttering hero-Xinhuanet
Produced by Liu Yunlong, directed by Yin Fei and starring Liu Yunlong, Su Qing, Liang Guanhua, Li Liqun and others, the large-scale spy drama " Winning " landed on Guangdong TV's " Vitality Theatre " at 7: 30 p.m. on July 16.
The play tells the story of Tang Fei (Liu Yunlong), an underground member of the Communist Party of China lurking in the Japanese fake police station, who joined forces with Soviet agents to assassinate the leader of Japanese agents and smash the shocking plot of the Japanese army.
" Winning " is based on historical facts, and the material is taken from the dusty Soviet military archives for many years.
During the defense of Moscow, the elite of the Soviet Red Army in the Far East advanced westward to help. At this time, the " Northern Advance " of the Japanese Kanto Army believed that there was an opportunity and intended to send troops.
In order to solve the danger of the enemy, the intelligence personnel of the Communist Party of China and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union jointly implemented the " Mudanula " plan.
According to this historical background, the well-known screenwriter Deng Yuan has been polished several times, making the plot twists and turns.
Liu Yunlong served as both producer and lead actor in " Winning " this time.
In the play, he plays Tang Fei, who is the head of the criminal section of Linhe Police Department. He is a stuttering policeman who is quite happy and even a little ruffian. His real identity is an underground member of the Communist Party of China.
Cai Meng, the heroine of the opposite play, is the head of the Linhe Security Bureau, which is deeply appreciated by Japanese boss Fukuhara, and there is an ambiguous and delicate relationship with Tang Fei.
Su Qing has tried many different types of roles in recent years, from Lu Ruowen in " Those Years We Are Young " to Er Qing in " Yanxi Guide, " all of which have impressed the audience and their acting has been recognized.
This time, Su Qing and Liu Yunlong are partners for the first time, and the setting of stuttering sheriff and charming policewoman is quite interesting and innovative.
In addition to the two main characters, Liang Guanhua, Li Liqun, Qian Bo, Lei Han, Shen Junyi and many other powerful actors joined in " Winning ". The old drama is also one of the highlights of the play.
It is understood that the production of " Winning " is also very excellent, with the crew shooting nearly 2,000 kilometers across Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Liaoning provinces.
In order to restore the bizarre urban style of the Japanese occupation period in Northeast China, the art and props team of the crew rushed to work day and night to carefully polish every detail of the scene construction and props, so that the scenes in the play are exquisite and rich in historical texture.

Greenfield Launches a New Round of Shanghai State-owned Assets to Transfer 17.5% Shares-Economic Observation Network-Professional Financial News Website
Economic Observer Network reporter Rao Xianjun On July 26, Greenfield Holdings (600606.SH) issued the " Indicative Notice that state-owned shareholders intend to transfer part of the company's shares and resume trading through public solicitation of transferees. "
The contents of the announcement show that in order to further deepen the reform of state-owned enterprises, optimize the structural adjustment of state-owned assets, and improve the ownership structure of Greenfield, Shanghai Real Estate (Group) Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as " Shanghai Real Estate ") and Shanghai City Investment (Group) Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as " Shanghai City Investment ") intend to transfer part of the company's shares by agreement through public solicitation of transferees, and the total proportion of shares to be transferred shall not exceed 17.5% of Greenfield's total share capital.
The price of the shares to be transferred this time shall not be lower than the higher of the following two: the arithmetic average of the daily weighted average price of the 30 trading days before the indicative announcement date (July 27, 2020); and the audited net asset value per share of the company in the most recent fiscal year.
At present, there is still no conclusion on the new strategic investors of Greenfield. According to the announcement and public information, it is estimated that the new strategic investors will need to pay about 14 billion yuan to win the 17.5% stake transferred by Greenfield this time.
It is worth noting that after the completion of this share transfer, it is expected that Greenfield still has no controlling shareholder and actual controller, but the control structure may change greatly.
Since its inception, Greenfield Holdings has carried out many institutional and mechanism reforms: from 1992 to 1997, it operated in accordance with market-oriented rules under a purely state-owned system; from 1997 to 2013, it established and continuously improved the joint-stock system of state-owned holding and employee shareholding; from 2013 to 2015, it introduced strategic investors to form a mixed ownership system of cross-shareholding and mutual integration of state-owned and non-public capital; since 2015, it has been listed as a public company.
Greenfield's current reform plan is similar to that of Gree. In December 2019, high-level capital led Zhuhai Mingjun to take over 15% of Gree Electric Appliance (000651.SZ) with 41.662 billion yuan. Gree Group retired as a minority shareholder. After completing the reform, Gree Electric Appliance implemented modern enterprise management methods such as executive incentive plan and no real controller structure.
Shanghai Real Estate and Shanghai City Investment are state-owned enterprise groups wholly owned by Shanghai SASAC. Zhang Yuliang, chairman and president of Greenfield Holdings, said that Greenfield's move is an important measure for Shanghai to promote the comprehensive reform of state-owned enterprises and accelerate the reform of state-owned enterprises in the new stage in accordance with the requirements of the Party Central Committee. It fully shows the new reform ideas adapted to local conditions and tailored to local conditions. By introducing new excellent strategic shareholders to listed companies, support enterprises to further improve the degree of marketization, enhance the freedom of operation and management, and accelerate the full release of reform vitality.

It is understood that in September last year, Lanxi City and Shanghai Railway International Tourism (Group) Co., Ltd. signed a strategic cooperation agreement on the project of " traveling by high-speed railway to Lanxi, " planning to run 12 high-speed railway tourist trains from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai and Anhui to Lanxi within a year.

White House advisers " bite back " states to resume work too early-Chinanews.com
White House advisers " bite back " states to resume work too early
On July 23, local time, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 pneumonia in the United States exceeded 4 million, accounting for 30% of global cases.
For months, US President Donald Trump has repeatedly asked states across the country to resume work and return to school. It was only recently that he changed his attitude and took the initiative to wear masks in public, and his advisers said that some state governments returned to work too early.
On the 22nd, White House presidential adviser Kellyanne Conway said at a press conference that some state governments did not comply with the standards for returning to work and reopened places such as bars prematurely.
Conway also mentioned that the previous claim that the president has " absolute power " to decide on the resumption of work in states is a false rumor.
" The president is a federalist and he believes that states have autonomy. "
She defended Trump.
However, the " rumor " in Conway's mouth was said by Trump himself at the White House epidemic briefing on April 13.
This self-beating operation has been derided by netizens as " rewriting history. "
Kellyanne Conway wants to rewrite history. She's a liar.
Trump called Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer a dictator because she followed medical guidelines and insisted on stopping work.
Trump wants to push for a return to work so that he can hold a rally.
This is not the first time that Kellyanne Conway has caused controversy.
In an interview with Fox News on April 15, Conway blurted out: " This is COVID-19, not COVID-1, friends! "
She seems to understand " 19 " as a version number, which was wildly ridiculed by netizens: read the newspaper without common sense!
Is it reasonable for a 3-year-old child to sue the school after being smashed in the college playground?
2020-07-26 05: 01: 11 Source: Legal Daily Author: Wang Sishuo Editor: Wang Sishuo
The playground was smashed and the child was compensated before suing the school
□ Zhao Yifan, correspondent of this newspaper
When 3-year-old Xiaowen was playing on a university playground, he was accidentally hit in the head by Chen Mou of the softball team while throwing the ball.
After Chen's compensation, Xiaowen's father, Mr. Wen, as Xiaowen's legal representative, sued the school to the court, demanding an apology from the school where the playground was located, and paying a total of 20,000 yuan for medical expenses and moral damages.
Recently, after hearing the case, the Haidian District People's Court of Beijing held that the school had set up a protective net in the playground at the time of the incident, and had fulfilled its appropriate security obligations, and Chen had made compensation, according to which the judgment rejected the plaintiff's claim.
Mr. Wen complained that during the summer vacation of 2019, he took Xiaowen to play on the school playground, when the softball team was training on the playground.
In order to avoid the risks, Xiaowen, Mr. Wen and many other children and parents operate in the safe area designated by the softball team.
But then softball team member Chen took off while throwing the ball, causing the softball to fly over the net to the above-mentioned safe area and hit Xiaowen in the back of the head.
Mr. Wen immediately took Xiaowen to the hospital for treatment and was diagnosed with head trauma.
Mr. Wen believes that the facilities of the school stadium do not comply with the relevant safety regulations and do not effectively manage the team and related facilities.
The school's negligence led to the above-mentioned events, which caused Xiaowen to suffer great physical and mental pain, but also brought great pain to his family, for which the school should bear legal responsibility.
In this regard, the school argued that the school had set up a protective net in the playground, and posted management regulations and training notices, informing them that entering the playground must maintain a safe distance from the training site and reminding them to pay attention to their own safety. The plaintiff could not prove that the school had " failed to fulfill its security obligations, " so it did not agree to compensation.
After hearing the case, the court held that the site of the incident was a site open to the public free of charge by the university involved. Although the school has a security obligation for the management of the playground, this security obligation only needs to meet the general duty of care.
At the time of the incident, the school set up a protective net in the playground, which has fulfilled its appropriate safety and security obligations, and Chen Mou also compensated Xiaowen for medical expenses, transportation expenses and other losses of more than 2,000 yuan in accordance with the previous compensation agreement. The two sides agreed to resolve the dispute at one time.
Later, Xiaowen's parents once again claimed compensation from the school, which had no basis in the law, and the court ruled to reject all the plaintiffs' claims.
After the verdict, neither party appealed, and the judgment has now entered into force.
According to Article 37 of China's Tort Liability Law, the school, as the manager of a public place, has the obligation of safety and security; in the case of damage caused by the behavior of a third party, the third party shall bear the liability of tort, while the manager of a public place who fails to fulfill the obligation of safety and security shall bear the corresponding supplementary liability.
The judge said that because, as the manager of a public place, he is most likely to understand the actual situation of the whole place and foresee the possible dangers and damage, so he is most likely to take necessary measures to prevent the occurrence of losses or mitigate the extent of damage, and the cost of avoiding and mitigating damage is the lowest, so the law stipulates that he shall bear the corresponding guarantee obligation to engage in social activities.
In this case, for the unspecified people entering the playground open to the public free of charge, the safety and security obligation of the school should be commensurate with the social activities it is engaged in. Specifically, it should mainly take basic safety measures and have the obligation to inform hidden dangers.
In judicial practice, it is not appropriate to impose excessive safety and security obligations on managers of public places.
If the school has set up a protective net and fulfilled its obligation to inform, it can be concluded that the school is not at fault and should not bear legal responsibility.
In addition, for third-party infringement, even if the administrators of schools and other public places fail to fulfill their safety and security obligations, their liability is also as a supplement to compensation for damages. According to the newly promulgated Civil Code, after assuming supplementary liability, the administrators can also recover compensation from the third party.
Therefore, in such accidents, the victim should not expand the scope of claim after having received compensation from the direct infringer.
Under the normalization of epidemic prevention and control, people's enthusiasm for sports and fitness is high.
With the gradual liberalization of inter-provincial tourism business, the tourism market is about to usher in a recovery.
Fujian Province resumed inter-provincial tourism business from July 21. In the first weekend after opening, Xiamen, as a popular tourist destination, ushered in a peak passenger flow.
As a popular tourist destination city, many tourists arrive in Xiamen on weekends.
Xiamen Railway Station expects that the summer transportation will send 3.7 million passengers, while the airport passenger flow is mainly students, tourism and family visits.
The tourism market has gradually picked up. In July, Xiamen Airport operated 440 flights per day, and domestic flights have returned to 80% of the pre-epidemic level.
Airlines have encrypted the air express line from Xiamen to Shanghai, Beijing, Kunming, Xi'an and other major cities to seize the recovered tourism market.
At present, many travel agencies in Xiamen have launched a number of summer domestic inter-provincial tourism products, and the team itinerary is mainly outdoor attractions.
In view of the summer passenger transport peak in railway stations and airports, relevant units have deployed more manpower to guide people in areas where people are easy to gather, such as check-in counters and security checkpoints. Fujian has also optimized and upgraded the " Labuan Health Code, " realizing health data sharing and mutual recognition with 31 provinces, and promoting the orderly recovery of the tourism market.
Can Andy Lau Liu Qingyun " dismantle " the new spark-Xinhuanet
" Bomb Disposal Expert 2 " recently announced that it will be released on December 24, becoming the first film scheduled for the Chinese New Year.
The second part is still directed by Qiu Litao, produced and starring Andy Lau, and opens with a brand-new story.
It is reported that the addition of the " nuclear bomb " element in the second part also makes the challenge faced by the bomb disposal experts more difficult. Several stunning scenes in the preview have made people hang. The mushroom cloud of the big explosion and the airport engulfed by fire are quite shocking.
Three years ago, " Bomb Disposal Expert, " produced by the original team, won the May Day box office title that year, and won seven nominations at the Hong Kong Film Awards. Qiu Litao × Andy Lau also became the gold medal partner in the eyes of the audience.
This time, " Bomb Disposal Expert 2 " also makes people look forward to whether this pair of ace combination can shine a new spark.
" Bomb disposal expert 2 " tells a whole new story: former bomb disposal expert Pan Jingfeng (Andy Lau) fainted at the scene of the explosion and was listed as a suspect by the police.
In order to find the truth, he had to ask his friend Dong Zhuowen (Liu Qingyun), who is also a bomb disposal expert, for help.
The female inspector who is eager to solve the case, and Pang Ling (Ni Ni), who is also Pan's ex-girlfriend, is also involved.
He is still a bomb disposal expert, but from the preview, you can feel the complexity of Andy Lau's new role: he broke a leg, put on a prosthetic limb, and was chased by Liu Qingyun, who is also a bomb disposal expert, while being directed by his ex-girlfriend Ni Ni.
What is the relationship between the three, what Andy Lau did at the Xiangdao Hotel, what kind of cases he was involved in, and what ups and downs he experienced in his career as a bomb disposal expert, all kinds of mysteries make people curious.
It is understood that the highlight of the film is the on-site shooting of Hong Kong's world landmark buildings, coupled with the top special effects production team, which brings stunning and realistic visual impact.

China News Service, Chongqing, July 26 (Reporter Liu Xian) Chongqing Development and Reform Commission announced on the 26th that the city has so far retired 4,404 fishermen, accounting for 42.54% of all fishermen involved.
Li Daiguo, 53, said in an interview with Xinhua News that his grandfathers have been fishing in the Longxi River. Since he was 11 years old, he has been fishing with his father, rocking a boat and walking along the Longxi River, up to Liangping, Chongqing, and down to longevity. Every time he leaves home, it is ten days and a half months, and he depends on fishing to support his family.
However, since 1997, as the rural population has gradually poured into the town, there are more and more residents in Gaoanchang town, causing more and more serious environmental pollution.
Paper mills, chemical plants and farms have been built along the Longxi River, which also pollutes the river.
By 2007 and 2008, the Longxi River had become a stinking ditch.
" The fish scales caught are black, and the inside is black after being cut open. "
Li Daiguo said that fishing is becoming more and more difficult after the river is polluted.
The local government began to make great efforts to control the pollution of Longxi River, including clearing and floating, river patrol, and management of aquatic resources.
Li Daiguo also retired from fishing and became a member of the river patrol team to protect aquatic resources.
From January 1, 2020, Chongqing Aquatic Biological Reserve and related waters in the main urban area have implemented a comprehensive ban on fishing.
According to the data of Chongqing Development and Reform Commission, so far, Chongqing has withdrawn 3,403 fishing vessels and 4,643 fishing vessels that have signed withdrawal agreements, accounting for 63.3% and 86.3% of the total three-year tasks, respectively.

Israel strengthens the prevention and control of repeated epidemics-Chinanews.com

Israel strengthens prevention and control of repeated epidemics
At the beginning of the COVID-19 pneumonia outbreak, Israel's prevention and control measures have achieved remarkable results.
However, with the gradual lifting of prevention and control measures, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 pneumonia in Israel has increased significantly recently, and the Israeli government has repeatedly taken urgent measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic.
On February 28, the first case of COVID-19 pneumonia was confirmed in Israel, so it quickly took measures to close all entry and exit ports, suspend non-essential industries, switch schools to online teaching, restrict public transport and non-essential social activities, block cities with serious epidemics, and jointly maintain prevention and control measures by the military and police.
This series of measures quickly achieved positive results. By mid-May, the new confirmed cases of COVID-19 pneumonia in Israel in one day fell to single digits.
As the epidemic has been brought under control, various prevention and control measures in Israel have been fully unlocked, and since June, the number of new confirmed cases of COVID-19 pneumonia has gradually rebounded.
Especially since the beginning of July, the spread of the epidemic has been accelerating.
In recent days, there have been more than 1,500 new cases per day in Israel for eight days, and as of the time of writing on July 25, there were 916 new cases on that day.
As of July 25, there were 59,745 confirmed cases and 448 deaths in Israel.
Faced with the rapid rebound of the epidemic, the Israeli government has repeatedly taken urgent measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic.
On July 6, after the number of confirmed cases exceeded 30,000, the Israeli government closed gymnasiums, swimming pools, bars, nightclubs and other public entertainment venues, and introduced a policy of restricting public transport, stipulating that the maximum number of passengers per bus should not exceed 20.
On the 17th, the Israeli government announced a series of new restrictions, including the implementation of the " Kwun Tong " on weekends, stipulating that the " Kwun Tong " will be implemented from 17: 00 every Friday to 5: 00 every Sunday.
During this period, people can go out, but shops, shopping centers, barber shops, beauty salons, libraries, zoos, museums, exhibition halls, swimming pools and tourist attractions will be closed, while basic service places such as supermarkets and pharmacies will remain open.
At the same time, on all dates and periods, gatherings of more than 10 people are prohibited, gyms, studios and other places will be closed, restaurants and cafes are prohibited from eating, and only take-out services are allowed.
At the same time, the Israeli people did not pay enough attention to the seriousness of the epidemic and failed to form joint efforts with the government in fighting the epidemic.
After repeated outbreaks in Israel, many people took to the streets to protest and march because the government's prevention and control measures affected their own economic interests.
On July 11, tens of thousands of people held a demonstration in Tel Aviv, arguing that the anti-epidemic policy affected the economy.
On the evening of the 21st, thousands more protesters gathered in front of Prime Minister Netanyahu's official residence in Jerusalem to protest against Prime Minister Netanyahu's promulgation of prevention and control measures such as banning restaurants and coffee halls without giving corresponding compensation.
In addition, many people do not abide by the regulations of wearing masks and maintaining a safe social distance of two meters when outdoors. In order to avoid being fined by the police for not wearing masks, many people only wear masks on their chin or hang them on their wrists.
During the repeated epidemic, the school was the hardest-hit area for the spread of the COVID-19 virus. According to the reporter's recent visit to this kindergarten, it was found that the teachers and students of the kindergarten did not wear masks as required by the government, nor did they maintain a safe social distance of two meters from each other, laying hidden dangers for a large number of teachers and students infected with the virus.
Professor Elie Waxman, a member of the expert advisory panel of the Israeli National Security Council to combat the epidemic, believes that Israel is moving towards a " dangerous situation, " pointing out that the epidemic prevention and control measures currently taken by Israel are not enough, and all leisure and recreational places and summer schools should be closed to control the further spread of the epidemic.
Waxman said that Israel lacks an overall plan to combat the epidemic. The parliament and government departments should abandon their respective interests as soon as possible, reach agreement on fighting the epidemic, and formulate clear steps including relevant restrictions in different departments.
Tel Aviv, July 25 - Wang Jiong, our correspondent in Tel Aviv
Wu Fengfang, a farmer in Guyuan, Ningxia, couldn't help but his old companion Dai Tianfu. The two men drove from their home 20 miles away to Liangyun Cultural Compound.
Despite the inconvenience of legs and feet in the past two years, 77-year-old Dai Tianfu is still counting on " coming here every other way to get addicted to drama. "
This is a humble courtyard in Yuanzhou District, Guyuan City. Unlike ordinary farmhouses, melodious Qin operas are often heard in the courtyard, as well as wonderful shadow plays, embroidery works, traditional Qin operas, eyebrow operas, etc.
The owner of the compound is Liang Yun, who used to be a carpenter.
More than 10 years ago, he, who loved shadow and singing, began planning to build a cultural compound.
With Liangyun Cultural Compound, the cultural life of the villagers has become rich and colorful.
Before the reporter entered the Liangyun Cultural Compound, the tune of Qin has been spread out.
Bai Lixiang, a villager from a neighboring village, is singing a selection of Qin cavity for the villagers.
She has loved Qin since she was a child, and now she is well-known in the local area. As long as she has free time, she will come to the cultural compound to perform programs for the villagers.
Recently, Bai Lixiang also played live webcasting.
Bai Lixiang said: " It is a very happy thing to have a stage for more people to see their performance. "
On the stage, the singers are one by one, and the players are one by one. Although they are amateurs, their enthusiasm is undiminished.
Just like the rustic style of the farmhouse, outside the Qin cavity, the " grass-roots " art and non-legacy culture in the Liangyun cultural courtyard come face to face.
The compound also has a collection of more than 300 agricultural utensils of different ages, traditional and handmade tiles, paper-cuts, embroidery, shadow and other physical objects.
Liang Yun led the reporter into the exhibition hall in the courtyard, which displayed his collection of old objects, old wine jugs, three strings, spinning wheels, etc.
Why does an ordinary farmer build a cultural compound?
" Shadow play is my family craft, and I have been learning it since I was 15 years old. "
Liangyun Cultural Compound was established in 2012 and became the first rural " intangible cultural heritage exhibition hall " in Ningxia. It is also a demonstration compound for the protection of intangible cultural heritage in Guyuan City.
In addition to Liangyun Cultural Compound, more than 120 cultural compounds and 79 folk performance groups have emerged in Yuanzhou District of Guyuan City. Among them, there are more than 50 cultural compounds of a certain scale, such as Shenjiahe Cultural Compound, Wang Yonghong Cultural Compound and Yang Lang Cultural Compound, covering towns and streets in Yuanzhou District, with more than 5,000 participants.
These grass-roots artists are active in the fields, enriching the cultural life of the masses and meeting their spiritual needs.
" As life gets better and better, traditional culture can't just be left behind. "
" Liu's Impossible War Drama " returns again " Winning Chance " to watch Liu Yunlong Li Liqun's opponent " racing drama "-Xinhuanet
The 40-episode spy war drama " Winning " will land on Beijing TV from July 16.
" Winning " is based on real historical facts and is based on the Soviet military archives, which have been sealed for many years and first published.
Actor Liu Yunlong, known to the audience as " spy drama, " broke through his image in the play and challenged a very happy " stuttering agent. "
In recent years, the popularity of dramas such as " The Pretender, " " Mask " and " Kite " has proved that spy war dramas have exuberant vitality.
Unlike previous spy works, " Winning " looks at the world and extends the background of the story to the Far East battlefield of the Soviet Union.
Against the background of the final stage of the Anti-Japanese War in 1944, it tells the story of Tang Fei (Liu Yunlong), a secret intelligence worker of the Communist Party of China, who carried out the " Mudanula " strategic operation of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Service under the leadership of the Linhe Party Secretary of the Chinese Underground Party and the Director of the Soviet Far East Intelligence Service.
In many spy dramas, the hero, as a senior spy, appears as a handsome, high IQ and mature perfect image.
However, in Liu Yunlong's view, such a person is not suitable to be a spy. " Spies should be the kind of people who can't be found in the pile of people. If they appear, they are the kind of handsome image. I wish everyone should pay attention to you. Can they still lurk? There is a line in " Kite, "' If you don't catch me, I forget that I am a Kuomintang'. Spies should be elitist. "
So in " Winning, " Liu Yunlong ingeniously designed his hero Tang Fei as a " stuttering agent " with a sense of joy.
The other camp in " Winning " is supported by Fukuhara, a Japanese played by Liang Guanhua, and Fang Shibao, director of the police department played by Li Liqun.
The two powerful actors, one south and one north, have added many points of interest to the whole play.
Director Yin Fei used the word " drama " to describe the opposite play between Li Liqun and Liu Yunlong in the play. " It is absolutely drama. The two of them have a special tacit understanding. This tacit understanding on them is very influential to me. Many times their plays are' hanging'. For example, we only wrote the length of half a page, and when I don't stop shooting, they can continue to play. "
The masters do not rob each other, and the director does not disturb the play. When the actors are in the role and ensure their character state, they cannot only shape the role from the perspective of the characters, but also bring more viewing possibilities to the audience. Yin Fei said that such a play is brilliant enough.
In the play, you can also see many familiar faces in " Liu's Impossible War Drama. " The famous and majestic " Mountain City F4 " in " Kite " also gathered three people in " Winning. "
Hou Yu and Liu Mingyang, who played Song Xiaoan and Zhao Jianzhi, played Tang Fei's right arm again this time.
Director Yin Fei said, " There is no inferiority in these two people. They just followed the tide in that era and environment. "
Liu Yunlong also offered, " We should have a human face. This human face means that there must be good and bad people around me. Bad people are enemies, but we should also develop them and our team should be strengthened. "
The ending of the two men in the play was also carefully designed by Liu Yunlong, who believed that he would give the audience a satisfactory answer.

Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, July 25 - Xu Zhengyu, Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, said that Hong Kong's financial market remains active and orderly.
He expressed optimism about Hong Kong's financial stability and economy.
Xu Zhengyu said at an online seminar jointly organized by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Toronto and the Hong Kong-Canada Chamber of Commerce (Canadian Federation) on the 24th (Toronto time) that Hong Kong is experiencing a difficult situation due to the " legislative reform storm " and the COVID-19 pneumonia epidemic.
The exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar is stable and biased towards the strong exchange guarantee level.
There are no obvious signs of capital outflows from the banking system; on the contrary, more than $11 billion has been flowing in since June.
The total amount of bank deposits has also continued to increase in the past few months. There has been a series of public offering fund-raising activities in the stock market, and market transactions have repeatedly increased.
Xu Zhengyu said that the COVID-19 pneumonia epidemic has put pressure on the global economy and financial markets, but Hong Kong's basic advantages remain unchanged.
Hong Kong's many advantages, including geography, rule of law, high-speed communication, free flow of information and capital, and simple and low tax system, make Hong Kong a leading international financial centre.
Xu Zhengyu pointed out that the SAR Government has set aside HK $6 billion in the " Anti-epidemic Fund " to create about 30,000 time-bound jobs in the public and private sectors in the next two years, covering people with different skills and educational qualifications.
In order to support the development of fintech, the SAR Government has also launched the " One-thousand Plan " to subsidize local fintech companies, start-ups and other enterprises with fintech-related business, in order to create 1,000 new jobs, hire local talents and enrich Hong Kong's fintech talent pool.
Looking ahead, Xu Zhengyu expressed optimism about Hong Kong's financial stability and economy.
He encouraged Canadian enterprises to make good use of Hong Kong's advantages and its position as an international financial center, an international asset and wealth management center and a global offshore RMB business hub to develop and invest in the Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area and nearby areas.
The Lancet published an article praising China's anti-epidemic efforts to encourage countries to learn from their experiences-Chinanews.com
The Lancet magazine published an article on the 25th that China, as a country with a population of 1.4 billion and a scale similar to that of Europe or the United States, has effectively controlled the COVID-19 epidemic at this stage, without large-scale spread, and has largely controlled the domestic epidemic.
The article said that in the past ten years, China has invested heavily in domestic research and public health construction, which makes China's preparation for COVID-19 much better than that for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).
The author said that when SARS broke out in 2002, China was initially ill-prepared, especially the pathogen could not be determined.
When COVID-19 was discovered in December 2019, Chinese scientists were soon able to identify the virus species and shared genome sequencing data with the international community on January 11, 2020.
By the end of January, doctors from mainland China and Hong Kong had clarified the clinical characteristics of the virus and warned the world of the threat of COVID-19 through research papers published in The Lancet.
China has also been at the forefront of vaccine research. Under the state of emergency declared by the state, such research has been carried out very quickly and strictly through close domestic cooperation. In May and July, the results of the early trial progress of the COVID-19 vaccine developed by China were published in The Lancet respectively.
China's experience shows that it is very important to invest in the national health and research system and effectively improve laboratory capacity.
This is the basis for a rapid and effective national response to health emergencies and global health security.
Other countries, especially low- and middle-income countries, are very worthy of reference and learning.
In addition, China's experience has proved that on the basis of strong research, there must be strong high-level people who decisively rely on scientific basis to make correct decisions, so that the COVID-19 epidemic can be effectively controlled.
The article emphasizes that the government and its leaders must respect science, understand the value of science, and act on it in the most beneficial way for society.
At the beginning of the outbreak, China's National Health Construction Committee sent three groups of infectious disease experts to Wuhan to investigate the risk and spread of the COVID-19 virus. Their suggestions provided the basis for the decision of Wuhan on January 23. When experts put forward the necessity and urgency of building a shelter hospital, the government quickly made a decision and quickly implemented it. At the same time, the extensive participation of the community and the masses also made the epidemic quickly and effectively controlled.
Finally, the article emphasizes that in response to global health emergencies, countries need to strengthen global cooperation and joint response.

Director Dapeng's " Good luck " was shortlisted for the Golden Viscount Award-Xinhuanet
On July 18, the 23rd Shanghai International Film Festival announced the official list of films selected for the Golden Viscount Award.
Dapeng's first realistic film, " Good luck, " was successfully shortlisted for the Golden Viscount Award at this year's Film Festival, and the film officially released its first poster.
Poster side for pictures
The film " Good luck " is Dapeng's first realistic theme work, and it is also his second bond with the Golden Viscount Award.
The film tells the story of a comedy film director who returned to his hometown in the northeast countryside on a whim, hoping to turn his family into a literary film for the New Year. As a result, he encountered a series of accidents.
The family members who gathered for the film finished the final party.
In the movie poster released today, Wang Jixiang, a member of this family, sits in the middle of the picture smoking. The background is the black land of Northeast China dressed in silver, and the foreground is the red lantern that Chinese people must hang during the holidays.
The red lantern, which symbolizes joy and reunion, forms a huge contrast with the lonely Wang Jixiang, which also seems to reveal the complexity and entanglement in the relationship of this large family.
It is reported that in the film, except that the daughter of " third uncle " Wang Jixiang is played by actor Liu Lu, the rest of the scenes are completed by the real director's family. The experimental audio-visual style of the film breaks the boundary between drama and reality and brings the audience a brand-new immersive viewing experience.
According to director Dapeng, the creation of " Good luck " originated from " a providence. " A series of sudden family changes during filming forced the original filming plan to be changed. Life without a script was finally recorded as a film, but the tension beyond design was released.
How does director Dapeng face this " providence " and how should he continue to meet the changes brought about by this providence?
There is no doubt that " Good luck " is full of experiments. The lineup of almost all people and innovative audio-visual style have turned the life in front of the camera into a film. Under the package of real images, the audience will also find the shadow of themselves and their families from the family presented in the film. With the end of this family gathering in the film, it evokes a series of thoughts.
NEWS .GOV.MO: COVID-19 Infection Response Coordination Center Enquiry Hotline Statistics (08H00, July 25 - 08H00, July 26)

At the Banong Zhuokang outpost, platoon commander Yu Wang and a soldier stood guard on duty.
In this place, where the average annual temperature is more than ten degrees below zero, a row of simple barracks stands at the mountain pass. A national flag is flying in the wind not far from the barracks. Soldiers stand guard in the wind every day. At the same time, they need to regularly patrol higher elevations.
The soldiers had to use both hands and feet to climb the steep slope of the rubble.
It was late July, when flowers and plants flourished in low-altitude areas, and in Ba Nong Zhuokang, only the ditch behind the barracks had a relatively dense green.
Gao Peng, a soldier who has been stationed at the outpost for six years, pointed to the ravine and said that this is their back garden. Only in July and August every year can the grass grow slowly. Soon after, it all turns yellow and is covered with snow.
A foot patrol may take about nine hours.
Under the harsh plateau environment, the soldiers stationed here are accompanied by snowy mountains and glaciers all the year round. They also regularly patrol mountain passes at higher elevations.
A few days ago, a patrol composed of eight soldiers, led by instructor Liang Yixin, once again took the patrol road.
Each soldier carried a weight of about 30 jin and headed for the target point early in the morning.
On the way, a soldier rebelled, and his comrades-in-arms rushed to rescue him.
In addition to patrol tasks, the soldiers at the Ba Nong Zhuokang outpost have to conduct tactical and physical training every day.
Time passes, the altitude is constantly rising, the oxygen content is getting lower and lower, and the physical strength is constantly overdrawn. These factors test the will of the patrol members.
They clenched their teeth and persisted, crossing several landslides and several dangerous beaches one after another.
At about 16: 00, it was lunch time for the patrol members. They took out their own dry food and sat on the ground at an altitude of more than 5,700 meters, accompanied by sleet and sleet, to supplement their physical strength with food.
The soldiers at the Banong Zhuokang outpost conducted tactical and physical training.
During the break, they will play cards together, and the losers will do push-ups, which can both entertain and exercise physical fitness.
After a short rest in the cold wind, they climbed to the target point of the patrol, took out the national flag on the mountain pass and took a solemn oath.
Behind them are snow-capped mountains, and in front of them are dozens of kilometers of no man's land. They are the safest guardians of the country.
Beijing consumption season restarts-Xinhuanet
Beijing will restart the activities of the Beijing consumption season in accordance with the principle of " comprehensive restart, key planning, orderly promotion and strict organization. "
On July 26, 1.5 million government and enterprise consumption coupons were issued, including 1 million offline catering and shopping coupons and 500,000 smart product coupons, which consumers can collect at Jingdong APP.
Liu Meiying, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Commerce, introduced at the media briefing held on the 25th that the restarted consumption season will further reduce the capital allocation of enterprises on the basis of maintaining the existing preferential subsidies for consumer vouchers and card bags.
From the beginning of August, the current 1: 1 allocation of government and enterprise capital will be adjusted to 2: 1. For example, if consumers receive a card bag to spend in the store, they can enjoy a discount of 120 yuan, including 60 yuan for government subsidies and 60 yuan for enterprises; 80 yuan for government subsidies and 40 yuan for enterprises after the adjustment.
During the consumption season, the three major operators will subsidize traffic and terminals around 5G consumption, further promoting Beijing's new 5G infrastructure and new 5G consumption.
Chen Maobo said that Hong Kong's economy was hit by another outbreak of the epidemic and called on all sectors to share the difficulties-Chinanews.com
China News Service, Hong Kong, July 26 Chen Maobo, Financial Secretary of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, said on the 26th that Hong Kong is facing the impact of a new wave of COVID-19 pneumonia epidemic, and business exchanges and economic activities that had seen signs of recovery have also been hit.
The SAR Government once again calls on major small business owners to reduce rent and share the difficult times with retailers, restaurants and small and medium-sized enterprises.
Chen Maobo published an article entitled " The rugged road to recovery " online on the same day.
He said that the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 pneumonia in Hong Kong is high and the situation is severe, which has affected the people's livelihood and plagued the economy.
When the epidemic is repeated, the first thing is to strictly prevent imported cases, and deal with and interrupt the virus transmission chain as quickly as possible; when the epidemic is under control, economic activities should be resumed in a timely and corresponding manner.
He pointed out that in the face of the impact of the new wave of epidemic, business exchanges and economic activities that had seen signs of recovery had also been hit.
For the business community, in addition to the spirit of contract, social responsibility is equally important, especially for those groups that have received large government subsidies under the Employment Protection Scheme.
He mentioned that Hong Kong's economic situation in the second quarter of this year is still very severe, but the contraction seems to have slowed slightly.
In terms of exports, he believes that the external situation of Hong Kong is still grim.
Chen Maobo said that the development history of Hong Kong in the past few decades shows that every crisis hides new opportunities, and every difficulty hides the key to future development.

Marinichev said that the change in value is affected by the devaluation of the ruble and the epidemic.
" Service costs are increasing, " he said.
Because of the epidemic, people are beginning to spend more time on the Internet. "
Marinichev does not rule out that Internet prices will rise seriously this year, and believes that operators can provide customers with higher speed and more services to offset people's dissatisfaction with the price rise.
" Chinese Doctor " plans to pay tribute to the heroes of fighting the epidemic-Xinhuanet
Recently, with the respect of the heroes of Chinese filmmakers fighting the epidemic, Yu Dong, chairman of Bona Film Group, and Liu Weiqiang, director (left), held a discussion and exchange with Academician Zhong Nanshan in Guangzhou on the filming and production of the anti-epidemic film " Chinese Doctor. "
Bona Pictures hopes to use " Chinese Doctor " to pay tribute to all the medical and epidemic prevention workers fighting on the front line of epidemic prevention and control!
In 2021, the film will be released nationwide as a tribute film to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China.
At present, Bona Films is organizing the original crew of the film " Captain of China " to prepare the film " Chinese Doctor " under the arrangement and deployment of the Central Propaganda Department and the National Film Bureau, and with the support of the Guangdong Film Bureau and the Hubei Film Bureau. This is a film that reflects the unity of the people of the whole country to fight the COVID-19 pneumonia epidemic under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee.
Focusing on the front line of fighting the epidemic in Wuhan, the film will take Wuhan medical staff and provincial and municipal medical teams as the background. From the perspective of human nature, using unique narrative and highly influential camera language, the panorama will show the touching stories of Chinese medical staff full of dedication and sacrifice on the front line of fighting the epidemic.
It is understood that at the first time on the day of the unblocking of Wuhan, Bona overcame many difficulties, sent a shooting team deep into the front line of the epidemic, exchanged understanding and collected information with hundreds of medical workers face-to-face. At present, it has interviewed Academician Zhong Nanshan himself, the first person in Guangzhou to help Wuhan, the Guangdong Wu Medical Team, as well as the white angels at the forefront of the anti-epidemic front, such as Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan Union Hospital, Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital and Wuhan Central Hospital, and took a large number of precious first-hand video materials.
Academician Zhong Nanshan also raised expectations and hopes for the filming of the film at this symposium: " I am looking forward to it. I hope you will not only visit some experts who have made more appearances, but also interview more medical staff who have worked hard on the front line. They are the majority. "
He said that he had seen " Me and My Motherland " and " Captain of China " before and thought it was a good way to tell the story of the big pattern from the perspective of ordinary people.
" Now some foreign friends still have some misunderstandings about China. "
When talking about the spread of the film, Academician Zhong Nanshan said that at present, some people abroad like to label the virus as politicized. He hopes that the film can impress the audience from the perspective of human nature: " In addition to being shown in China, it is best to show this film abroad. It is necessary to impress the audience with the true humanistic spirit in a way that both domestic and foreign audiences can understand. "
Academician Zhong Nanshan also deeply recalled the film " People to Middle Age " in the 1980s. " After so many years, what impressed me most about the film after the reform and opening up was " People to Middle Age. " At that time, my doctors and friends abroad all cried. If " Chinese Doctor " could play such a role, it would be great. "
Academician Zhong Nanshan said that if " Chinese Doctor " could resonate with foreign audiences, it would be very successful.
During the discussion and exchange, Academician Zhong Nanshan also shared his opinions and suggestions on the current international epidemic prevention and control. " I believe that people are always smarter than viruses. "
Academician Zhong Nanshan said that although the virus is difficult to predict, since the primitive society, mankind has overcome thousands of difficulties and risks. Now the modern society has developed medical technology and social management measures. In addition, medical personnel and even ordinary people all over the world have a basic understanding of the scientific response to the COVID-19 pneumonia epidemic. People will no longer be as passive as before. " Next, we should pay attention to two aspects of work, one is to study how the world can strengthen cooperation, and the other is to pay attention to the comfort of people's hearts. "

Cultural tourism " red fruit " gathered in Shaoshan-Xiangtan's first Red Expo-Shangbao Network-Huasheng Online
New Hunan Client Journalist Jiang Rui Correspondent Xiao Yan
Jiaxing red boat mold, Shaoshan bronze statue of Mao Zedong, Yan'an cloth pile flower handicrafts, Xiangxi Yongshun bacon... On July 25, the 2020 Hunan Red Tourism Culture Festival opened in Shaoshan.
As one of the main activities, the first Xiangtan Red Cultural Industry Expo was held in Shaoshan Global Tourism Consulting and Distribution Center.
The exhibition area is full of red creative and creative products and local products from the old revolutionary areas, attracting tourists from all over the world to buy them.
" This Red Expo is not only a demonstration of the achievements of the national red cultural industry, but also an important platform for exhibitors and enterprises to exchange experiences and explore development paths. "
The relevant person in charge of the executive committee of the first Xiangtan Red Expo introduced that the theme of this Red Expo is " Promoting red culture and promoting cultural tourism heating up, " with a total exhibition area of nearly 3,000 square meters, with an atmosphere creation area, a scenic spot exhibition area and an online shopping experience area for red cultural tourism.
Eight provincial cities, including Jiaxing in Zhejiang, Zunyi in Guizhou and Yan'an in Shaanxi, as well as 137 enterprises and units in Changsha, Zhuzhou, Yueyang and Chenzhou in our province, were invited to participate in the exhibition, with a total of 768 exhibits, including red cultural relics, handicrafts, food specialties, tourist routes, red training courses, red creative and creative products, etc.
The exhibition area will be on display until July 29.
As the host of the Red Expo, Xiangtan exhibition area has many bright spots.
According to the person in charge of the exhibition area, Xiangtan exhibition area is divided into two parts: red industry and red cultural industry development.

More than 30,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Japan-Xinhuanet
According to statistics, there were 239 new confirmed cases in Tokyo on the 26th, with more than 200 new cases in a single day for six consecutive days, with a cumulative total of 11,214 cases.
In addition, there were 141 new confirmed cases in Osaka Prefecture, 90 new cases in Fukuoka Prefecture and 80 new cases in Aichi Prefecture.
Telecommunication network fraud crimes rose by 70% in the first half of the year
China News Service, July 26 (Xinhua) According to the website of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, in the first half of this year, procuratorial organs nationwide prosecuted 58,101 people for fraud crimes, an increase of 35% compared with the previous year.
In particular, among the crimes impeding epidemic prevention and control, fraud crimes are frequent, and the number of fraud crimes prosecuted by procuratorial organs accounts for 43.4% of the total number of crimes impeding epidemic prevention and control.
The Supreme People's Procuratorate has carried out targeted guidance. At present, among the ten batches of typical cases involving epidemic prevention and control, there are a total of 9 cases involving fraud.
Judging from the handling of cases by the procuratorial organs in the first half of the year, there are many names involving fraud crimes, ranging from national macroeconomic policies to people's food, clothing and housing, including epidemic fraud, " medical care " fraud, " health care products " fraud, " enrollment intermediary " fraud, " routine loan " fraud, fraud to defraud state subsidies, fraud to unfreeze national assets, etc., and continue to " promote innovation, " covering education, medical care, employment, old age, social security, land acquisition and demolition, precision poverty alleviation, financial credit and other fields, which not only cause economic losses to the victims, but also seriously affect economic and social development.
In particular, some telecommunications network frauds break through the restrictions of national borders, regions and personnel, and have the characteristics of stakeholder, cross-border, remote and electronic payment. There are many unspecified victims and great harm.
For example, some set up special companies, rent high-end office buildings, set up multiple departments or posts, use legal network platforms to publicize and recruit, train and assess recruiters, and adopt enterprise operation mode management, wearing the " legal cloak, " which is more confusing.
It is incumbent upon the procuratorial organs to punish and prevent crimes in accordance with the law and issue early warning to the public and relevant departments in a timely manner.
In judicial cases, procuratorial organs conscientiously perform their duties, not only adhere to maintaining high pressure on fraud crimes, but also refine various law enforcement measures in a targeted manner, and promote social governance through the production and issuance of procuratorial recommendations.
The procuratorial organs strictly control the facts, evidence, procedure and application of the law in the arrest and prosecution of fraud cases, taking the facts as the basis and the law as the criterion, and doing nothing wrong.
Especially for the crime of telecommunications network fraud, we pay attention to the central role of electronic data in fact determination, and strive to build an evidence chain between electronic data, verbal evidence and documentary evidence.
For example, in response to an epidemic-related fraud handled by the Yinzhou District Procuratorate of Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province, the procuratorate intervened in advance at the first time, and it took only five days from the occurrence of the case to the conclusion, reflecting the attitude and determination to handle it quickly and strictly and maintain the stability of the overall social situation.
In the process of examining arrest and prosecution, we pay attention to the prosecution of missing offenders in cases, correct the omission of 733 arrests by public security organs, and correct the omission of 1,113 co-defendants by public security organs.
In the first half of the year, procuratorial organs nationwide issued 298 procuratorial recommendations on fraud crimes, promoting joint efforts to prevent fraud crimes and promoting in-depth governance.
For example, in view of the loopholes found in the supervision of telecommunications networks by telecommunications enterprises, banks and intermediary organizations in the handling of cases, the People's Procuratorate of Guangzhou City of Guangdong Province and the People's Procuratorate of Dongguan City put forward procuratorial suggestions in a timely manner, urging relevant units to strengthen supervision, improve mechanisms, and promote the construction of long-term systems.
Fourth, make every effort to recover assets and losses.
Procuratorial organs everywhere seize important links such as intervening in investigation, guiding evidence collection, prosecution and prosecution, urge investigative organs to actively recover stolen money, cooperate with relevant departments to do a good job in recovering stolen money and losses, and strive to minimize the economic losses caused by fraud crimes to the people.
For example, the Lin certain routine loan case handled by the Beijing Municipal Procuratorate involved 22 sets of properties waiting to be sealed up. In the case that the property may be disposed of first by other cases, the first creation and issuance of a " Suspension of Execution Letter " was sent to the relevant court in a timely manner. It was suggested that the previous closure court suspend the execution of the property involved, and uniformly dispose of it after the facts of the crime were ascertained, so as to make the best efforts to recover the property involved and recover the losses of the victims.
Prosecutors reminded everyone that they should be very vigilant against fraud crimes, do not expect " pie in the sky, " do not think cheap to be credulous, and keep their own " money bag. "
Yina Town, Weining County, Guizhou Province: Short apple trees widen the road to poverty alleviation-Zhongxin.com
2020-07-26 11: 42: 58 Source: China Economic Network Author: Zhu Yanjing Editor: Zhu Yanjing
In the heat, the reporter of Economic Daily-China Economic Network walked into Zhonghai Village, Yina Town, Weining County, Guizhou Province.
In the hot sun, villager Li Yuanzhong was weeding in the base. Although his face was red, he hummed a few songs from time to time.
Weining County, where Yina Town is located, has a certain reputation in the surrounding areas because of its low latitude, high altitude, abundant light and large temperature difference between day and night. However, because of its small size and many spots, it has not been able to sell a good price and form an industrial scale.
Yina Town used to be a poor township of " Baogu potato for spring and autumn, " and the incidence of local poverty was as high as 25.8% 10 years ago.
In the critical period when poverty alleviation is entering a decisive battle, it is urgent to change traditional planting habits, adjust industrial structure and increase farmers' income.
Chen Chao, the party secretary of Yina Town, and a group of people in the town believed after many visits that industrial development could no longer follow the old path.
To this end, Yina Town introduced leading enterprises and planted apples in a modern way.
Hou Jianwen, deputy general manager of Weining Beyond Agriculture Co., Ltd., came to Yina Town from Shaanxi Province in 2015 to conduct research. He kept an eye on the local planting conditions and began to plant apple trees locally in 2016.
At first, the village mobilized Li Yuanzhong to transfer the land to plant apple trees. Li Yuanzhong and his wife muttered in their hearts: " After planting apples for so many years, they have not seen anyone in the village grow apples and make a fortune. "
" The apples planted are dwarf apples, which will not make the apple tree grow too high. "
What Li Yuanzhong did not expect was that a new method was adopted for apple planting this time. Irrigation pipes were laid under each apple tree, and water and fertilizer were poured to the roots. When the fruit was harvested in autumn, the tractor drove directly into the orchard and could pick the fruit while standing.
At present, the Apple base has gradually entered a high-yield period, and the market is as expected by Hou Jianwen. Apple is not worried about selling and is deeply loved by consumers in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and other cities.
The growing apple industry has brought new changes to Li Yuanzhong's life. Although he is still farming, he has a new source of income.
Li Yuanzhong's family has more than 9 acres of land transferred to the Apple Base. Every year, in addition to the guaranteed land transfer fee, there are profit dividends after hanging fruit. The couple usually work in the base. " One person can get 80 yuan a day and have work all year round. "
Li Yuanzhong told reporters that last year's profit dividend earned more than 2,800 yuan, plus the land transfer fee and the couple's working income, the family earned more than 80,000 yuan, " don't worry about food and clothing, and a well-off life has passed. "
" At present, initial results have been achieved. The annual output value of one mu of apples exceeds 15,000 yuan, which is about 10 times that of growing corn. "
Chen Chao told reporters that 20,000 mu of apples have been planted in the whole town of Yina, and there are 6,000 mu in Zhonghai Village alone, covering 4,056 rural households and 17,200 people, including 656 poor households and 2,952 people, and the annual salary is more than 6 million yuan. The base is truly built on the doorstep and there is no need to go out to work.
Li Yuanzhong, whose pockets were bulging, also began to realize his " wish. "
This year's Lunar New Year, Li Yuanzhong bought an off-road vehicle and now drives his car to and from work every day. " There are still more than a dozen acres of land at home. When the next step is to expand the scale of the Apple base, all of it will be transferred to them, and the income will be more. "

How to efficiently capture and utilize carbon dioxide emitted by human beings is the focus of scientists' attention.
" Membrane separation method " is a new carbon dioxide capture technology. It separates carbon dioxide gas with the help of membrane materials. It has the characteristics of high efficiency, energy saving and simple operation.
How to make the membrane material " breathe deeply " and improve the gas separation efficiency is the bottleneck and difficulty of capturing carbon dioxide by membrane separation method.
The scientific research team of Tianjin University innovated ideas and explored the influence of different solvents on the separation performance of membrane gas through repeated experiments.
Experimental results show that using N-methylpyrrolidone as the preparation solvent, the carbon nanotubes in the membrane material are more evenly distributed and " more breathable, " effectively improving the gas separation efficiency and rate of the membrane material.
The carbon dioxide separation performance of the mixed matrix membrane prepared by this new technology is close to the theoretical separation upper limit of this kind of membrane material.
" The new technology provides a new idea for capturing carbon dioxide by membrane separation. "
Li Run, a member of the atmospheric environment and bioenergy team of Tianjin University, said: " We hope that this technology can provide strong support for future coal-fired power plants and chemical enterprises to deal with flue gas and play an important role in controlling greenhouse gas emissions.

Understand what is professional grade difference before volunteering to fill in-Chinanews.com

Understand what is professional grade difference before volunteering to fill in
Every year, some students or parents do not understand the nouns involved in the voluntary application, which affects the voluntary application.
This year, five colleges and universities, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing University of Science and Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing Forestry University and Beijing University of Chemical Technology, jointly issued the 2020 enrollment policy, eliminating the professional grade difference.
What is the meaning of professional grade difference and what is the significance in voluntary filing?
There are three ways of professional allocation rules
Experts remind that before filling in the volunteer, you must read the Admission Regulations of your favorite school in detail and understand the admission rules of colleges and universities, including the transfer ratio, professional allocation rules, etc.
The rules of professional allocation mean that after colleges and universities are transferred, there are three main ways of professional admission: professional priority, score priority and professional grade difference.
The specific method used by colleges and universities will be specified in the Admissions Charter.
However, the admission principle of some colleges and universities is that the total score is preferred, and there is no grade difference between majors.
That is to say, the candidates within the admission range will be queued according to the total score. When the score does not reach the first professional voluntary admission line, it depends on whether the second professional voluntary admission line has been reached, and so on until the last professional volunteer is admitted, and there is no grade difference between the professional volunteers.
The so-called " professional grade difference " means that when colleges and universities arrange candidates' majors, they determine the admission majors of volunteer candidates for different majors according to one or more score values published in the enrollment regulations. This score value is " professional grade difference. "
That is, the score difference between the first professional volunteer and the non-first professional volunteer when colleges and universities admit candidates, and the grade difference between the professional volunteers, such as 3 points, 2 points, 1 point, etc.
For example.
Suppose student Xiaoming applied for A University and scored 560 points. His professional volunteers are: computer, international trade, automation, mechanical engineering, and e-commerce. The professional admission of A University implements the method of professional grade difference, which is divided into 2 points, 1 point, 1 point, and 0 points.
In the professional allocation, if Xiaoming's first major volunteer meets the professional admission requirements and the major has a planned balance, then Xiaoming will be admitted to the " computer " major; if the computer is not admitted, his score will be subtracted by 2 points, and according to the score of 558 points, he will be sorted with the candidates who volunteer for the " international trade " of the first major to determine whether they meet the professional admission conditions; If they still cannot be met, the score will be subtracted by 1 point (i.e. 557 points) for the " automated " admission of the third major volunteer; If they still cannot be met, the score will be subtracted by 1 point (i.e. 556 points) for the admission of the fourth major, and so on.
Different universities have different professional grade difference settings
With the popularization of parallel volunteering, many colleges and universities have abolished the professional grade difference, but some colleges and universities still retain this method this year. Judging from the Admissions Charter published by each university, more than 20 universities have set up the professional grade difference this year.
For example, Sichuan Agricultural University, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Heilongjiang University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Jiangxi Normal University, Chengdu Medical College, Northeast Electric Power University, Jimei University, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing University of Technology, Ningxia University, Shandong University of Technology, China Civil Aviation Flight Institute, etc.
In these colleges and universities, each university has a different professional grade difference.
Some colleges and universities have grade differences in each major, such as Ningxia University. Candidates whose files have been submitted to the university are admitted according to the order in which the candidates fill in their professional volunteers.
Some universities have set different professional grade differences between different majors.
For example, at Jimei University, the total score of professional volunteer difference is 4 points, that is, the difference between the first professional volunteer and other professional volunteers is 3 points, there is no difference between other professional volunteers, which is regarded as parallel volunteers, and the professional difference between other professional volunteers and transfer professional volunteers is 1 point.
When filling in the volunteer, candidates and parents must carefully read the admission policy of the reported school to see if there is any professional grade difference and what is the form of grade difference. While fully considering the score, they should also reasonably analyze the school and major to be selected. If the institution clearly adopts the method of score difference in the admission charter, candidates should pay attention to the gradient between the majors when choosing a major to improve the admission probability.

Chengdu people gather to watch the US consulate police stop people from " looking too happy "
In response to the US closure of the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, China announced the closure of the US Consulate General in Chengdu on Friday.
On Saturday, the badge of the US consulate was removed, and on Sunday, a dark glass car drove away from the consulate amid boos from passers-by.
On Sunday, many people in Chengdu gathered in front of the US consulate to take pictures. Those who had not been here also came to take a look driven by curiosity about current affairs.
The reporter from Agence France-Presse Chengdu Station also went to observe near the US Consulate in Chengdu, and sent back the news that there was a steady stream of curious people, and many parents took their children for a walk to watch the consulate, take pictures of the building, or take self-portraits.
The consulate was surrounded by guards, and the police " corrected " people's behavior from time to time. They did not seem to allow any unusual behavior: a woman was stopped as soon as she was ready to sing a red song, and a guard confiscated a banner.
But residents of a nearby residential building succeeded in pulling up a giant Chinese flag on their balcony and shouting slogans in support of China.
The US Consulate in Chengdu opened in 1985, covering all consular-related affairs of the United States in southwestern China, especially the Tibet Autonomous Region.
A reporter from Agence France-Presse Chengdu Station said that the Chinese government's response to the United States was relatively restrained: many Chinese people asked the government to close the US consulate in Hong Kong online, but the official only said that " closing the US consulate in Chengdu is a necessary and legal response to the unreasonable behavior of the United States. "
At present, in addition to Chengdu, the United States also has consulates in Guangdong, Shanghai, Shenyang, Wuhan and Hong Kong in China.
Large-scale financial media action " Go to the Village Live to Watch Poverty Alleviation " -Shangbao Network-Shangbao Online
New Hunan Client on July 25 (This reporter) On July 25, the large-scale financial media action " Go to the Village Live to Watch Poverty Alleviation " sponsored by the Financial Program Center of the Central Radio and Television Station started from Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province. Two caravans carrying 5G new media mobile cloud production and broadcasting system slowly drove out of the scene under the eyes of the guests at the scene.
General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out that " 2020 is a landmark year. We will build a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way and achieve the first 100-year goal. 2020 is also the year of decisive battle against poverty. "
The large-scale financial media action " Go to the Village Live to Watch Poverty Alleviation " is an important measure taken by the Financial Program Center of the Central Radio and Television Station to coordinate with this major theme and do a good job in poverty alleviation publicity.
The action will go into poverty alleviation villages in more than 20 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the Central Government, dig fresh poverty alleviation stories, hit the great changes in the appearance of villages, and show how villagers break through the dilemma of survival and development and move towards the road of becoming rich.
The operation will last more than three months.
Starting from Xuzhou, the reporter took the southwest line all the way through Anhui, Hubei, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangxi, Guizhou, Sichuan, Chongqing, Yunnan, Tibet and other places; the other way took the northwest line through Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Hebei and other places, with a journey of more than 10,000 kilometers.
In the form of reporting, " Go to the Village Live to Watch Poverty Alleviation " is boldly integrated.
The economic development of the villages visited by the caravan will be broadcast through CCTV Financial Channel, Yangguang Economic Voice, China Communications Radio and CCTV Financial New Media.
Among them, the live television broadcast will be mainly completed in the noon news program " World Finance " of CCTV Financial Channel (premiere time: 12: 00-13: 00 from Monday to Sunday), and the golden news program " Economic Information Network " of CCTV Financial Channel will set up a poverty alleviation report column (premiere time: 20: 30-21: 30 from Monday to Sunday).
At the same time, the caravan will broadcast live for up to one hour to each village in the CCTV financial client. By downloading the CCTV financial APP, the audience can watch the live broadcast and participate in the lucky draw.
In terms of technology application and studio design, " Go to the Village Live to Watch Poverty Alleviation " has the courage to make a breakthrough and pioneered the " Outfield New Media Caravan. "
The car is equipped with 5G new media mobile cloud production and broadcasting system, and uses 5G + 4K / 8K + AI technology to realize the organic combination of online and offline, large and small screens, and television broadcasting.
It is equipped with a three-message studio area, which is converted from a container. It is 12 meters long, 2.55 meters wide and 3.98 meters high. The box adopts a hydraulic automatic expansion structure and can be turned up to 120 degrees.
The studio area can also be expanded automatically, and the external expansion platform, with an area of more than 50 square meters, can meet the scene requirements of most programs.
At present, Dongchuan District of Kunming City is already hot in summer, and what is hotter than the weather is the poverty alleviation workshop next to the relocation site.
Lu Ling, an employee of Kunming Esford Electronic Technology Company, said, " Now, as soon as you leave home, you enter the factory to make money and take care of your family, thanks to the free vocational skills training of the trade union organization. "
Walking into the poverty alleviation workshop of electronic components processing in Tongdu Street, Dongchuan District, a busy picture came into view.
Lü Ling, in her 40s, is a single mother who takes care of her children alone and takes care of her elderly parents.
In her most difficult time, the Dongchuan District Federation of Trade Unions helped to come up with ideas and ways to " send coal in the snow " after being busy before running.
Since 2018, Lü Ling has enjoyed assistance policies such as housing, schooling, social security and employment, as well as assistance funds issued by trade unions at all levels.
This year, her child has successfully graduated and employed, and she herself has a job and income after participating in skills training, and was out of poverty at the end of April.
It is reported that the special skills training project of Dongchuan District General Organization to help alleviate poverty is part of the skills training work of Yunnan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions.
In the light of the characteristics of the workers in difficulty in the relocation and resettlement sites for poverty alleviation in the district, the District General Administration conducted an in-depth investigation to understand the training needs and determine the types of training. In the near future, it plans to train a total of 450 electricians, welders, pasta designers, etc.
Recently, Li Yi, an employee of the Menglian County Branch of Agricultural Bank of Yunnan, wrote a sincere thank-you letter to the County Federation of Trade Unions.
In her letter, she sincerely thanked the union for giving her a golden autumn grant from August 2013 to January 2017 to help her complete her studies.
In 2004, Li Yi's father died in a car accident, and her mother was included in the files of workers in difficulty. Since then, she has been enjoying the care of the policy.
With the help of the local trade union, Li Yi successfully completed her studies.
Since 2016, 3,809 households have been lifted out of poverty through institutional guarantees and precise assistance.
The successful relief of Lü Ling's family and Li Yi is a microcosm of the work of Yunnan trade unions to promote the relief of workers in difficulty.
According to Duan Kaiyuan, a staff member of the Legal and Human Rights Work Department of the Yunnan Federation of Trade Unions, the provincial government will strengthen the dynamic management of the files of workers in difficulty, promote the normalization of filing work, and promptly integrate the workers in difficulty who meet the conditions for filing into the assistance system; broaden the application channels for workers in difficulty, and use WeChat to open an online filing service platform for workers in difficulty to facilitate workers in difficulty to declare in a timely manner.
During the epidemic period, it was difficult to go out to work. In order to help workers with difficulties in filing alleviate the pressure of life, Yunnan Province arranged a total of more than 13 million yuan to send warm funds. According to the standard of 2,000 yuan per household for workers with difficulties in filing at the national level and 1,500 yuan per household for workers with difficulties in filing at the provincial level, special warm and condolence activities were implemented for more than 6,000 national and 1,000 provincial workers with difficulties in filing.
At the same time, the provincial head office docks with various Internet recruitment platforms such as social security departments and Zhilian recruitment, pushes recruitment information to workers in difficulty, and provides employment consulting, employment guidance and other services.
