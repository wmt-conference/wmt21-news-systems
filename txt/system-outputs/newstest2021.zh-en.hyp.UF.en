Where to find talents?
Excellent migrant workers returning home are an indispensable new force.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 26 th: Turning outstanding returning migrant workers into a new force for rural revitalization
Zhang Xiong, 34, lives in guoyuan, Meishan City, Sichuan Province. In 2010, he quit his job in Beijing with a monthly salary of tens of thousands and returned to his hometown to start a business.
After several years of hard work, the annual income of the grape growing family farm he runs now exceeds one million yuan, and he has become a famous leader in getting rich, and has also been selected into the "two committees" of the village.
In recent years, inspired by a series of policies to support agriculture and benefit farmers, such as poverty alleviation and rural revitalization, more and more outstanding migrant workers like Zhang Xiong choose to return home to start businesses, which activates a pool of spring water in the countryside.
Sichuan, a province with a large population and a large labor export in western China, implemented the "excellent migrant workers' returning training project" according to the situation. In 2019 alone, more than 8,000 village party branch secretaries, 61,000 village reserve forces and more than 20,000 party members were produced, which provided a strong guarantee for winning the tough fight against poverty and implementing the rural revitalization strategy.
Well-off is not well-off, the key depends on fellow villagers.
Since the reform and opening-up, a large number of young and middle-aged laborers in rural China have gone out to work and increased their income, and some have set up their own enterprises through hard work.
But objectively, it also leads to the rural hollowing out to varying degrees, especially the weakening of rural grass-roots organizations. The village party branch secretaries and party members are characterized by "one old and one low", that is, aging, low academic qualifications, weak leaders of village party organizations, and outstanding problems.
If rural talents and other factors flow to cities all the time, and the countryside is in a state of "blood loss" and "anemia" for a long time, revitalization is empty talk.
Attract those migrant workers who are capable, conscious and interested in serving their hometown, guide them to return home to start businesses and become rich leaders, and train them to become party members and rural cadres on the basis of merit, and enrich the ranks of grassroots cadres. This is the fundamental policy to solve the problem that the ranks of rural party members and grassroots party organizations are not connected with each other.
Excellent migrant workers are attracted back, but they must be retained and well done.
In recent years, Sichuan started from paying close attention to the party building of migrant workers, and established institutional mechanisms such as directional return, service guarantee, training and promotion, and selection and use of outstanding migrant workers on the basis of strict candidate criteria, so that they can improve their abilities, secure their jobs, have hope in their lives, truly take root in the countryside, and have a sense of accomplishment as entrepreneurs.
This year is the final year of the decisive battle against poverty, and talents are the key factor in the connection between poverty alleviation and rural revitalization.
Party committees and governments at all levels should attach great importance to this group of outstanding migrant workers returning home, and through comprehensive measures, turn them into a team and a new force that can stay, fight and take away, so as to provide strong organizational guarantee and talent support for the rural areas to get rid of poverty and run a well-off society and develop and revitalize.
Because of the epidemic, this year's college graduates are a very special class. On the evening of July 11th, bilibili Summer Graduation Song Club brought a special live online performance to the graduates, and musicians such as Lao Lang, Pu Shu, Chris Lee and Mao Bubi sent songs and blessings to the graduates.
SealWu Wu Yifan, a well-known upmaster, also brought a "Wild Grass", which is a rap song adapted from Lu Xun's prose poems of the same name, and is very popular among young people.
Due to the epidemic situation, many graduates failed to experience the ritual feeling of picking ears and granting degree certificates on the spot, so they transferred the ritual feeling online.
According to the data, the peak popularity of live broadcast of this 2.5-hour concert exceeded 35 million.
"Follow your heart, seize the opportunity, don't care about the consequences, and sometimes you will have unexpected gains."
Although it is a graduation song party, many songs also move non-graduates.
"I really want to cry when I look at the whole game. Whoever's youth is full of beauty and regret, but it is worth remembering and must go bravely."
Beijing's natural ecology continues to improve, attracting more than 500 kinds of wildlife cities to "settle down"-Zhongxin.com

The natural ecology of the capital continues to improve, attracting wildlife cities to "settle down"
There are more than 500 species of wild animals in Beijing
(Reporter Wang Bin) The Beijing Youth Daily reporter learned from the Municipal Bureau of Landscaping and Greening that in recent years, with the continuous improvement of the natural ecological environment in the capital, the species and quantity of wild animals have also increased continuously.
At present, the number of terrestrial vertebrate wild animals inhabiting Beijing has increased to more than 500 species, including brown pheasant, black stork and other national first-class protected animals, as well as impala, swan, grey crane, mandarin duck and other national second-class protected animals.
Whether planted in an urban forest in the Second Ring Road or embedded in a small wetland between buildings, it not only brings the wild interest of nature to the citizens of the capital, but also attracts wild animals to settle in the city.
In midsummer, Songshan National Nature Reserve, located in Yanshan Mountains in the northwest of Yanqing District, is full of vitality.
A raccoon dog plays leisurely beside the mountain stream, while two badgers fight with each other.
Looking back, a wild boar couldn't resist the "scratching" of his body, and was rubbing against the bark. Hu Qiaoli, director of Songshan National Nature Reserve Management Office, said that by the end of 2019, there were 178 kinds of wild animals living in this green sea with a total area of over 6,200 hectares, including the national first-class protected animals Golden Eagle and the national second-class protected animals Scoop Chicken and Impala, and nearly one third of the wild animals in the city could be found here.
"In Songshan, wild animals are the real' masters', and our staff can only be regarded as the' bodyguards' of others at best."
Hu Qiaoli said that in order to know the wild animals and plants in the reserve on the spot, more than 30 professional patrol members patrol along 16 carefully formulated protection routes every day, and there will be a "big circle" every month, which will almost travel all over the reserve in a whole day.
"During the inspection, we should not only check and record the biodiversity, but also check and install artificial bird nests, rescue injured wild animals, install wild infrared cameras, and so on."
More than 200 infrared cameras have been installed in Songshan National Nature Reserve to record the living conditions of wild animals in the forest.
Hu Qiaoli introduced that in recent years, with the increasing biodiversity in nature reserves, more and more wild animals appeared in the camera, and leopard cats, raccoons and pigs and badgers have become "permanent guests", and the "appearance rate" of the national second-class protected animal Impala is getting higher and higher.
Zhang Zhiming, Director of Wildlife and Wetland Protection Division of Beijing Municipal Bureau of Landscaping and Greening, said that the number of terrestrial vertebrate wild animals in Beijing has increased from 461 in 1994 to more than 500 now, and the species and quantity of wild animals in Beijing have been increasing continuously in recent years.
Wild animals are becoming more and more common in cities, which is closely related to the continuous upgrading of greening in the capital city in recent years.
In particular, the new round of afforestation and greening construction starting in 2018 proposed to reshape the urban ecological environment, enhance the ecological function of woodland and green space, and highlight the concept of "near nature".
In planning, we strive to realize interconnection and interaction with the surrounding green space, which is convenient for wild animals to "visit relatives and friends", and the trees planted are also honey and food plants that animals like.
Black land "grows" out of agricultural modernization-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 26 th: Black land "planted" agricultural modernization
In midsummer, two pesticide spraying planes pass by the 10,000-mu high-yield demonstration field in the second operation station of the fifth management area of Friendship Farm, forming two white lines, and the characters "the first field in the world" planted with black rice seedlings in the green fields are particularly eye-catching.
Kong Lingqiang, the stationmaster of this operation station, said that this kind of aircraft can spray chemicals on more than 6,000 mu of cultivated land every day, and its efficiency is about 8 times that of unmanned aerial vehicles and hundreds of times that of artificial ones.
This farm is located in Youyi County, Heilongjiang Province, the largest grain-producing province in China. From the past "swish" sound of rice cutting to the present "rumbling" sound of motors, Chinese traditional farming and farms have changed in this black soil belt.
Besides airplanes, satellites are also used in modern agricultural production of Friendship Farm.
Kong Lingqiang introduced that on the one hand, they use satellite remote sensing technology to achieve precise fertilization, reduce agricultural investment and reduce pollution; On the other hand, satellite navigation technology can improve the standardized operation level of agricultural machinery in the field.
In this year's rice production process, the farm expanded the operating area of satellite navigation unmanned transplanting technology from 3000 mu last year to 30000 mu.
This technology makes the seedling planting more uniform, maximizes the utilization of sunlight and cultivated land resources, and saves the labor cost of 16 yuan per mu.
Farms try new technologies such as informationization and intelligence in agricultural production, forming the largest agricultural machinery group in China from the ground to the sky.
According to statistics, at present, the total quantity of farm machinery is 49,000 units, and the comprehensive mechanization rate in the field reaches 99.8%.
100% GPS satellite navigation, 100% precision sowing in dry land and 100% high horsepower locomotive operation in dry land are realized in agricultural machinery operation.
"Green agriculture, smart agriculture and digital agriculture are the exploration directions of agricultural modernization."
Liu Hualian, director of Friendship Farm, said.
The key to agricultural modernization lies in scientific and technological progress.
Heilongjiang Land Reclamation, represented by farms, has played a leading role in the demonstration of modern large-scale agriculture in recent years, and initially established a modern agricultural industrial system dominated by large-scale planting, standardized production and industrialized operation.
In the suburb of Youyi County, there is an agricultural machinery exposition park covering an area of 350,000 square meters.
Here, more than 140 sets (pieces) of agricultural machinery introduced and used by Heilongjiang Land Reclamation for many years are exhibited.
These agricultural machinery and farms have witnessed the development of China's agricultural modernization.
Give up a small family for everyone-direct attack on mass transfer in Jiangkou River Lianwei, Hefei, Anhui Province-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, July 26 th: Shexiaojia is for everyone-the mass transfer of Jiangkou River in Hefei, Anhui Province
Xinhua News Agency reporters Chen Shangying, Wang Liwu and Liu Xiacun
At 4 o'clock in the afternoon on July 25th, Fu Kunbao went back and forth with his wife Zhou Yan, wearing rubber shoes covered with mud.
"I received a call from the village cadres to transfer, and I was still weeding in the fields."
Fu Kunbao said that he has transferred more than 60 acres of land and planted rice. Now he is growing well. "I also took medicine yesterday, and the tools have not been cleaned up."
Fu Kunbao pointed to the pesticide sprayer placed in the corner. "No one wants to be flooded at home, let's give up a small family for everyone."
In order to cope with the continuous high water pressure and possible heavy rainfall in Chaohu Lake, Hefei City, Anhui Province is going to start flood diversion and water storage in Jiangkou River Lianwei where Fu Kunbao's family is located on 26th.
Jiangkou River Union Fair is located in Feixi County, close to Chaohu levee.
There are thousands of villagers involved in Yandian Township and sanhe town who need to be transferred.
As of 16: 00 on the 25th, the water level of Chaohu Lake, the fifth largest freshwater lake in China, remained at a high level of 13.2 meters, exceeding the guaranteed water level of 0.7 meters.
Fu Kunbao's kitchen is clean, with a pot of pumpkin head vegetables on the table, eggs and some pot-stewed vegetables in the refrigerator.
"I didn't expect to move. The water in Jiangkou River is still good."
Zhou Yan said that the home is a bungalow, and some large objects haven't decided where to put them yet.
"Put away valuable items first. Large items such as refrigerators and televisions can be temporarily placed in high-lying neighbors or relatives."
Wang Liwen, a village cadre, gave Fu Kunbao advice.
Wang Liwen was responsible for the transfer and resettlement of 13 villagers, and each household notified and confirmed the resettlement plan of each person.
The nearest settlement to Fu Kunbao's home is Su Xiaoxiao School in Yandian Township, about 2 kilometers away.
In addition to the big ones, Fu Kunbao's family suffered from more than 1,000 kilograms of grain and some newly bought furniture.
"Food is ready to be dragged to relatives' homes, and furniture can't be moved."
As soon as the couple discussed it, they put a stool under the newly bought bed and raised it about half a meter.
At 6 pm, Fu Kunbao began to transport things to relatives' homes by tricycle, while Zhou Yan continued to clean up at home.
At 11 o'clock in the evening, the couple watched it back and forth at home, turned on the switch, and prepared to go to the resettlement site.
"I hope the water will return early."
Fu Kunbao said.
At 9: 30 a.m. on July 26th, the reporter saw at the scene of Jiangkou River Lianwei that the local area had made all preparations before flood diversion.
Team up in Hana Lin, ZhangJike to support organic teenagers-Xinhuanet
On July 11th, "Sports Boys", a hot-blooded sports show for sports teenagers, officially landed on Hunan Satellite TV.
ZhangJike, the sports leader, and Hana Lin, the sports assistant, cross the border on the same stage. Lin Dan and Fu Yuanhui commented on each other's styles, and the hard core of the "monster"-like power pulling device came on the stage, which made the program "burning".
In the first episode, 11 sports teenagers appeared on the power track, and their appearance surprised the audience. At the same time, the "strong conflict", "strong confrontation" and "strong heart" on the arena also received attention.
Among them, the "strong conflict" comes from Qiao Wenyi, a super A sports student. Before the competition, he openly challenged Xu Zhibin, who is known as "beautiful boys" in the track, choking Xu Zhibin's appearance condition should go to sing and dance programs, and even released the malicious words of "Don't cry your makeup when you lose".
Some remarks made teenagers and sports leaders on the field breathe in a gasp.
The "strong confrontation" is more like a fairy fight. Jianqi Sun, who is known as the "Great Devil", meets Zhang Xindong, who has the same strength, and performs a strong confrontation.
Their identities are unexpected. Jianqi Sun is an actor who loves fitness, while Zhang Xindong is a retired special warfare player and a winner of the Warriors Medal for three times.
At the beginning of the competition, the two teenagers tried their best to pull out the small pole quickly, and the lasting confrontation on the big pole made the audience sweat for them.
Under the tense competition situation, ZhangJike, as one of the sports leaders of "Sports Boys", also watched the game carefully.
In the comment session, he was also very careful, patiently encouraging the teenager who lost the game and helping every mistake in the process of re-closing.
Hana Lin, the sports assistant, is a fancy assistant, and she makes no secret of her appreciation for the teenagers who are online in value and strength.
When learning about the overloaded daily training of sports teenagers, they are even more admired.
Lin Dan and Fu Yuanhui, who are also sports leaders, have their own styles. One is a calm "prophet", and the other is a "wild girl" who dispels tension with a smile.
In addition, Summer and Liu Ye, as sports assistants, also created a lot of hilarious topics around sports teenagers.
Church fire in Nantes, France: parish volunteers admit arson is usually kind and taciturn-Zhongxin.com
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) According to foreign media reports, on July 18, the famous Cathedral of St. Peter and St. Paul, a religious and historical building treasure in Nantes, France, was severely damaged in a fire, and the big organ was completely destroyed.
On the 26th local time, the Nantes prosecutor announced that a parish volunteer in charge of security work in the cathedral had been charged with arson and destruction.
He has admitted that he started the fire in the church.
According to the report, local prosecutor senas said that the 39-year-old parish volunteer from Rwanda admitted that he set fire to three places in the cathedral at night.
The person's lawyer said that the arsonist now regrets doing such a thing.
This person entered France through asylum several years ago, and was sheltered in the parish where the fire happened, and was taken in in the church.
The prosecution pointed out that recently, he tried to renew his visa and was talking with the police station about it.
However, the church said it still couldn't believe that this kind-hearted, smiling but quiet believer would destroy the church he loved so much.
On the day of the fire on July 18th, the volunteer had been questioned and investigated by the police because of the illogical problems in the narrative, but he was later released.
The picture shows firefighters on the scene.
On the evening of 25th, the professional engineers in the laboratory of Paris Central Police Department obtained new evidence, and this person was arraigned again.
This time, the man admitted his arson.
According to reports, if convicted of arson, the suspect may face 10 years imprisonment and a fine of 150,000 euros.
According to reports, the fire caused serious losses to St. Pierre and St. Paul's Cathedral. The organ in the church was completely burned, and the stained glass windows behind the organ were also seriously damaged.
Brunet, the chief architect of French historic buildings, believes that it is conservatively estimated that the restoration of Nantes Cathedral will take at least three years.
Comprehensive news: US unilateralism undermines relations between the two countries. International public opinion supports China's counter-measure against the United States-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26-Comprehensive Xinhua News Agency reporters abroad reported: On the morning of July 24, the Chinese Foreign Ministry informed the US Embassy in China that China had decided to revoke the establishment and operation license of the US Consulate General in Chengdu, and put forward specific requirements for the Consulate General to stop all business and activities.
International public opinion holds that the unilateral measures taken by the United States have caused serious troubles to Sino-US relations, and it is justified and necessary for China to take countermeasures in response to the unreasonable provocation of the United States.
Andres Borchers, director of the Center for Chinese Studies at the Institute of International Studies of the University of Chile, said that the unilateral measures of the United States have destroyed the bridge of understanding between the Chinese and American peoples and brought the relations between the two major powers into crisis.
China's notification to the United States to close its Consulate General in Chengdu is a counter-measure against the unilateral measures taken by the United States, which is in line with diplomatic practice.
Patricio Giusto, a professor at the Catholic University of Argentina and director of the Arab-Chinese Research Center, believes that China's above-mentioned decision is a legitimate and necessary counter-measure against the previous provocation of the United States, not against ordinary Americans.
The United States tried to cover up its ineffective response to the COVID-19 outbreak by pressuring China, thus diverting the attention of the American people.
Bambang Suryono, chairman of the Asian Innovation Research Center, an Indonesian think tank, said that the provocative diplomatic attitude of the United States has caused serious troubles to Sino-US relations, and the relations between the two countries are facing severe challenges.
It is a normal counter-measure for China to inform the United States to close its Consulate General in Chengdu, which is in line with diplomatic practice. It not only reflects China's principled stand of resolutely safeguarding its own interests, but also reflects the rationality, advantages and restraint of China's diplomacy.
Francis Semwinza, a commentator on current affairs in Tanzania, said that China's above decision is a legitimate and necessary response to the provocation of the United States.
Sino-US relations should return to normal, and the US should take the initiative to improve relations with China and stop interfering in China's internal affairs.
The United States should focus on how to achieve economic and political win-win with China, and how to benefit the two peoples and the whole international community.
Ali Yusuf, executive director of the Sudan-based Arab-Chinese Friendship Association Federation, said that China's forced counter-measures are a legitimate and necessary response to the unreasonable actions of the US side, in line with international law and the basic norms of international relations, and also in line with diplomatic practices.
Earlier, the United States demanded the closure of the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, which seriously violated international law and the basic norms of international relations.
It is hoped that the US side will rescind its previous decision and create the necessary conditions for the relations between the two countries to return to normal.
Singapore's Lianhe Zaobao published an editorial saying that the greater strategic intention of the United States is to contain China and prevent China from continuing to rise.
In the face of the American pressure, although China is unwilling to see Sino-US relations continue to deteriorate, it has to take countermeasures.

It is understood that 8 ships and 2 helicopters were dispatched in this joint operation, which was divided into several action groups to fight together, and the whole chain was cracked down on smuggling at sea and illegal operation on land, and all 35 major criminal suspects arrived at the case.
At present, the case is under further investigation.
The relevant person in charge of Guangdong Marine Police Bureau said that in the future, it will continue to maintain the high-pressure situation, crack down on all kinds of smuggling and criminal activities at sea, and maintain a good order in the sea area under its jurisdiction.
Hurricane Hannah Landed in the United States or Caused River Surge and Flash Flood-Zhongxin.com
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua)-According to foreign media reports, Hurricane Hannah landed in Texas at 5 pm local time on the 25th, which will bring strong storms, soaring rivers and possibly life-threatening flash floods to Texas.
According to the National Hurricane Center, Hurricane Hannah is expected to carry heavy rain and sweep across parts of southern and northeastern Texas, which may cause some streams to surge and life-threatening flash floods.
According to the report, the area south of Corpus Christi to the mouth of the Rio Grande River was the most seriously affected by Hurricane Hannah, and a large-scale flash flood may erupt in the Rio Grande Valley.
Texas Governor Abbott said on the 25 th: "Any hurricane is a huge challenge."
There are 32 counties in the state in a state of disaster emergency due to hurricanes.
Corpus Christi, a city with a population of over 320,000, has closed its libraries and museums, and its residents are waiting for it.
Abbott also said that while Texas is being hit hard by the COVID-19 epidemic, the hurricane can no longer bring more casualties to Texas.
According to reports, the precipitation in southern Texas is expected to reach 6 to 12 inches at night on the 26th, and there will be 3 to 5 inches of rainfall in northern Texas and coastal areas of Louisiana.
Due to global warming and other factors, "Hannah" was formed earlier than the previous Atlantic hurricane season.
Under normal circumstances, the first hurricane in the Atlantic usually does not form until mid-August.
Poland will withdraw from the European treaty to prevent violence against women
Poland will take steps to withdraw from the European Treaty on the Prevention of Violence against Women next week, the Polish Ministry of Justice said Saturday.
Poland's right-wing government cabinet said that the treaty required schools to teach students about gender issues, trampling on the parents' rights.
Polish Minister of Justice Joblo held a press conference and said that his Ministry of Justice would ask the Ministry of Labor and Family to withdraw from the treaty on Monday.
That treaty is also known as Istanbul Convention.
Gioblo said, "The treaty contains some elements that we think are harmful to the ideological nature."
Poland's ruling Law and Justice Party and its ruling coalition partners have a close alliance with the Roman Catholic Church and advocate a conservative social agenda.
During his successful re-election campaign this month, Polish President Duda made hostility to gay rights one of the main topics.
On Friday, thousands of Poles (most of them women) held protests against their withdrawal from the Convention in Warsaw and other cities.
Lempat, one of the organizers of the protest, said in a protest March in Warsaw that "the purpose of withdrawing from the treaty is to legalize domestic violence".
Some protesters held banners with the words "Law and Justice Party is Women's Hell".
The Law and Justice Party has long complained about the Istanbul Convention.
Poland's former centrist government ratified the Convention in 2015.
The government of Law and Justice Party stated that the treaty does not respect religion and requires teaching liberal social policies in schools.
But up to now, the party has not decided to withdraw from the convention.

At present, the first two upgraded Wuzhikas are undergoing renovation and replacement in the Far East Helicopter Factory of Russia's "Progress" Aerospace Corporation, and its national testing and improvement finishing work will be completed before October 2022.
According to Russian experts who understand the above upgrading work, Wuzhika -52, the "predecessor" of "Super Alligator", was officially installed in November 2011, and some weaknesses were exposed in the use of this model. This transformation and upgrading is just to "fill the shortcomings".
The report said that compared with the card -52, the card -52M will partially adopt new protective materials that will not increase weight, and its cockpit will be reinforced and equipped with new equipment to resist missile attacks, thus increasing the survival probability of the battlefield; Assemble more powerful generators to supply power to more complex airborne electronic equipment; The photoelectric system is upgraded to be able to detect and identify battlefield targets that are farther apart; The new light multi-purpose missile equipped with mainly attacking armored combat vehicles and reinforced concrete fortifications has a range of 20 kilometers, which is about double the range of similar missiles used by Russia's active military forces; Its defense weapons and communication equipment will be used in common with Mi -28NM helicopter gunships that can attack air targets to the maximum extent, thus making related maintenance simple and economical.
In addition, Ka -52M will have more advanced electronic guidance system, weapon aiming system and navigation equipment.
Russian experts also said that it is worth paying attention to that the Ka -52M will be equipped with communication equipment to communicate with unmanned aerial vehicles, so as to obtain information transmitted by nearby unmanned aerial vehicles in real time in the air, such as displaying images taken by unmanned aerial vehicles on the cockpit screen of the helicopter.
According to the plan, the pilot of Ka -52M can directly control the UAV with which it cooperates, thus improving the pilot's mastery of the battlefield situation and the guidance of long-range missiles.
According to Russian media reports, Russian Deputy Defense Minister Krivoruchko said in December last year that the Russian Defense Ministry planned to purchase more than 110 Wuzhikas-52Ms by 2027.

(Deutsche Welle Chinese website) In the past two weeks, the confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Spain have risen sharply, and thousands of new cases have appeared in many days.
On Saturday night (July 25th), the British government temporarily decided to remove Spain from the safe travel list from 0: 00 local time on the 26th, and people entering the UK from Spain must be isolated for 14 days.
British tourists who are vacationing in Spain have expressed surprise, worry and even anger when they heard this decision, because the news was unexpected and caught off guard.
It is reported that British Transport Secretary Grant Shapps is also on vacation in Spain.
Before Britain issued the quarantine measures, Norway also announced that people returning from Spain would be quarantined for 10 days.
France and Belgium advise their residents to give up their plans for holidays in Barcelona and its surrounding areas.
The beaches in these areas are overcrowded, and people can't keep a social distance. The police once needed to take measures to reduce the number of beach tourists.
Tourism is an important pillar industry in Spain
Spain: It's safe here
In response to the British decision, the Spanish Foreign Ministry said on Sunday that the epidemic situation in the country was under control.
Spanish Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya stressed to the media: "Spain is safe, not only for Spaniards but also for tourists."
The Spanish government will try to persuade the British government to exclude the Balearic Islands and Canary Islands from the isolation measures.
The reason is that the infection rate in these two tourist resorts is much lower than that in Britain.
To prevent the spread of the epidemic, Catalonia, Spain, has also restarted the "grounding order".
Tourism is an important pillar industry in Spain, and Spain is one of the most popular resorts for British tourists.
This decision by Britain is expected to greatly affect Spain's tourism industry.

Engine may stall FAA urgently ordered to check 2000 Boeing passenger planes-Xinhuanet
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an emergency airworthiness directive on the 24th, requiring an emergency inspection of about 2,000 Boeing 737NG and 737Classic passenger aircraft registered in the United States, because the corrosion of the air check valves of these passenger aircraft may cause the engine to stop in the air.
According to the FAA, so far, it has received four reports of engine parking of 737NG and 737Classic passenger aircraft in the air, so it made an urgent inspection request. The inspection targets are passenger aircraft that have been parked continuously for 7 days or more and passenger aircraft that have flown less than 11 times since re-flying.
The FAA warned that if the 5th check valves of all two engines of the passenger plane are corroded, they may be stuck in the open position, resulting in the complete loss of power of the passenger plane and the inability to restart the engines.
The aviation regulator ordered that once the check valve is found to be corroded, the airline operator must replace this key component before the passenger plane is put into service again.
Boeing responded later that day, because the COVID-19 outbreak reduced travel demand, many passenger planes were sealed up or used less, and "check valves were more susceptible to corrosion".
Boeing also said that it has advised airline operators to inspect the passenger aircraft involved in the directive, and if problems are found, Boeing will provide assistance in overhauling and replacing check valves.
The Associated Press reported that the passenger planes of major US air carriers usually fly several times a day, but after the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic, a large number of passenger planes were grounded; With the slow growth of passenger travel demand recently, some passenger planes have been put into operation again.
The FAA has not released the details of four air parking reports.
Alaska Airlines disclosed one of the incidents later on the 24th.
The airline operator said in a statement that one of its passenger planes flew from Seattle, Washington to Austin, Texas on July 15th, when an engine suddenly turned off and the passenger plane finally made an emergency landing at Austin Airport.
Alaska Airlines said that it had replaced the engine of the passenger plane and inspected the engines of six passenger planes according to FAA instructions.
American Airlines, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines respectively said on the 24th that there was no engine flameout associated with air check valves in their passenger planes.
Four passenger planes owned by American Airlines will be inspected, and 28 passenger planes owned by United Airlines will be inspected.
Delta Air Lines said it would inspect its 20 passenger planes, but did not say whether there had been any engine flameout.
Many media reported that FAA's Emergency Airworthiness Directive is another impact on Boeing.
A Boeing 737MAX passenger plane of Indonesian Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashed in October 2018 and March 2019 respectively, killing 346 people in total.
This series of passenger aircraft was subsequently grounded globally, which was discontinued in January this year and resumed production in May.
In June, FAA Director Steve Dixon admitted that the FAA "made a mistake" in the supervision of Boeing.

A "Nutritive" that Often Completes the Party History and the History of New China-Zhongxin.com
2020-07-26 17:37:29 Source: People's Forum Network Author: Zhu Yanjing Editor: Zhu Yanjing
Recently, when visiting the Siping Campaign Memorial Hall, General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized: "Let 1.4 billion people, more than 90 million party members, especially leading cadres at all levels learn the history of the Communist Party of China and the history of New China."
Studying the Party history and the history of New China seriously is a compulsory course for Party members and cadres to keep in mind their mission and Do not forget your initiative mind. It is necessary to draw rich nourishment from it, cultivate the feelings of home and country, and take the Long March of the new era.
A magnificent history of party history and new China records the arduous struggle and glorious course of the Communist Party of China since its birth, and shows the belief and loyalty forged by the Communists with their lives and blood, and the initial intention and mission that they will always stick to.
History is the best textbook. For party members and cadres, the party history and the history of New China are the brightest chapters in this textbook.
Every party member and cadre should constantly strengthen the historical thinking of taking history as a mirror and moving towards the future, base on the new journey and new mission, take the "baton" of the times, and take the long March of contemporary people well.
Cast the soul with history, and stick to the original mission in studying the party history and the history of New China.
Turning over the party history and the history of New China, it is full of the eternal initial mission and rock-solid belief of the Chinese Communists, which shows the simple feelings of the Communists always staying with the people.
Understanding the important events, important meetings and important figures in the history of Party history and New China at close range is not only an intuitive spiritual shock and ideological baptism, but also a deep understanding of the connotation of the initial faith and the weight of the mission.
For party members and cadres, if they want to constantly sharpen their initial mission and keep their advanced qualities, they must find the starting point and initial fulcrum from the history of the Party and New China, keep a clear understanding and firm stand, stir up the strength to fight bravely for the country and the people, and ensure that the red country created by the revolutionary ancestors with blood and life will be passed down from generation to generation.
It is wise to learn history, and inherit the lofty spirit in the study of party history and the history of New China.
Since the founding of the Communist Party of China, a series of great spirits, such as Red Boat Spirit, Jinggangshan Spirit, Long March Spirit, Yan 'an Spirit, Anti-Japanese War Spirit, Xibaipo Spirit, "Two Bombs and One Star" Spirit and Aerospace Spirit, have been created successively.
These great spirits precipitated by history provide powerful spiritual incentives for our party to overcome various risks and challenges on the way forward, and are precious spiritual wealth that cannot be defeated, washed away or robbed.
The process of studying Party history and Chinese history is a process of revisiting these spirits and shaping self-spirits. We should consciously take the lofty spirits of revolutionary ancestors as a mirror, stick to the spiritual home of the Communists, build a solid spiritual foundation for advancing the great cause and realizing the great dream, and inherit and carry forward these spirits to glow with the new era.
Read history and introspect, and constantly keep the righteousness and eliminate evil in the study of party history and the history of New China.
For party members and cadres, there has never been any history, which can bring more profound warning, enlightenment and reference than the party history and the history of New China.
In the history of Party history and New China, we can not only see the great deeds of the older generation of revolutionaries who are determined to devote themselves to their beliefs and work tirelessly to achieve the set goals, but also see the profound lessons of some people who have shaken their ideals and beliefs and walked to the opposite side of the revolution, which enlightens and warns us that with firm determination and will, we will never stagnate and never slacken, and we will always have abundant and tenacious fighting spirit, and constantly purify party spirit and cultivate self-discipline.
To truly become a firm believer and faithful practitioner of the lofty ideal of communism, it is necessary to brush off the dust of thoughts and prevent the dirt from being stained. Party history and the history of New China should be the basis for every party member cadre to examine himself and warn himself.
Knowing history is inspiring, and bravely shouldering the important task of the times in studying the party history and the history of new China.
General Secretary Xi Jinping once pointed out: "Studying party history and national history is a compulsory course for upholding and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics and pushing forward the various undertakings of the party and the country."
Looking back at history, inquiring about the original heart, in order to continue glory and move towards the future.
Every party member and cadre should take the study of the Party history and the history of New China as a lifelong pursuit, constantly set the course of life in the study, and bravely shoulder the historical mission, dare to take responsibility and take the initiative in their respective jobs.
Adhere to the advanced deeds of the older generation of revolutionaries as a reference and guide, constantly polish the political nature of the Communists, maintain the struggling attitude of seizing every minute and striving for success and the fighting spirit of moving forward more and more difficultly, and write your own brilliant stroke in the mighty journey of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
Pursuing Poetic "Yellow River Dream"-Zhongxin.com
(China's poverty reduction story) "blocking the south of the Yangtze River" pursues the poetic "Yellow River Dream"
China News Service, Yinchuan, July 26 (Yang Di) "The Jiuqu Yellow River has thousands of miles of sand, and the waves and winds are from the end of the world."
The Yellow River, which aroused the lofty sentiments of countless scholars, gave birth to the beautiful and rich Ningxia Plain. Nowadays, Ningxia, which has the reputation of "blocking the south of the Yangtze River", is adhering to the concept of "ecological priority and green development" and pursuing the poetic "Yellow River Dream".
"Blue Wave Dream" with beautiful rivers and waters
"Ningxia, Huang Hefu", the Yellow River flows through Ningxia for 397 kilometers, which is the "mother river" for raising one side.
However, with the rapid advancement of industrialization and urbanization, the development, utilization, management and protection of rivers and lakes are out of balance, and chaos such as excessive sewage discharge, reclamation of land around lakes and encroachment on water areas are highlighted, resulting in black and smelly water bodies, excessive water quality, dirty environment and ecological degradation.
Now, Ningxia is promoting diversified restoration of water ecology, and striving to restore the Yellow River with beautiful water and clear river.
Water control should start from the source.
In Yinchuan, Ningxia, the local government adopted the method of "upgrading standard+pollution control+strict management", all industrial park sewage was treated centrally, all urban sewage treatment plants were discharged according to Grade A standard, and the black and odorous water bodies in urban built-up areas were basically eliminated, which successfully applied for the third batch of black and odorous water demonstration cities in China.
In addition, Ningxia fully implemented the river and lake length system in 2017, and now it has achieved full coverage of the five-level responsibility system of river and lake length system in districts, cities, counties and villages, and it has become the norm for rivers and lakes to patrol rivers.
Gu Jincheng, 64, lives in a village near the Yellow River. He witnessed the changes of the Yellow River: "The water used to smell bad, and after remediation, the smell disappeared."
Gu Jincheng said that the ecological environment is better, and his life is more comfortable. Now he often goes for a walk along the Yellow River with his family to feel the clear water and blue sky.
"Wetland Dream" in Xiangji, Sha Ou
Birds, green trees, plank roads, clear water … Fan Zhongyan's beautiful scenery of "Sha Ou Xiangji" has become a reality in the Yellow River Wetland Park in Yinchuan, Ningxia.
The Yellow River flows through Ningxia, forming various wetlands along the way, such as river wetlands, lake wetlands and swamp wetlands, which play an important role in promoting the rational utilization of water resources and water ecological balance, and at the same time become an important international bird migration channel.
Since 2009, relevant departments in Ningxia have invested about 3.45 billion yuan in wetland protection projects. At present, Yinchuan has a wetland area of 19,200 hectares, with a wetland protection rate of 78.5%, with nearly 200 natural lakes and marshes, 5 national wetland parks, 1 national urban wetland park, 6 autonomous region-level wetland parks and 8 municipal parks.
Lv Jinhu, deputy director of Yinchuan Wetland Protection Center, told reporters that wetland protection has increased biodiversity, especially in birds. "The gull is an endangered bird, with only 20,000 in the world, of which Yinchuan Wetland is inhabited. More than 2,000."
At the same time, Ningxia has demarcated the red line of 500 meters in the wetland protection area on both sides of the Yinchuan section of the Yellow River according to law, which stipulates that no unit or individual may carry out development, construction and business activities within the scope of protection except for public welfare projects.
Zhao Shaoyong, deputy director of Yinchuan Water Resources Service Center, said that through pollution source control, comprehensive improvement of river and lake ecology and terminal wetland construction, the water quality of nine main yellow drainage ditches in Ningxia has reached Class IV standard. "Now the water is clear, and the fish are also Swimming, the flowers are also blooming."
The "Drinking Water Dream" of Pu Huimin's Life
Yinchuan City, Ningxia once had an embarrassing title: the only city along the Yellow River that "guards the Yellow River and lacks water to drink".
Since 2010, Yinchuan has been facing the problem of persistent water shortage in the summer peak period. In recent ten years, "the pain of water shortage" has become a painful experience for many high-rise residents in summer. However, under the current situation that the major water sources are at the limit of over-exploitation and a large area of groundwater over-exploitation funnel area has been formed underground in the urban area, water shortage from water sources has become a difficult problem that puzzles Yinchuan.
Thanks to the improvement of the water quality of the Yellow River, drinking purified Yellow River water has become a good solution to the drinking problem of local residents.
Ming Ding, deputy director of Yinchuan Water Affairs Bureau, said that in order to improve the living and production water demand of urban and rural residents in Yinchuan, Ningxia started the water supply project on the west line of urban and rural areas in Yinchuan metropolitan area in due course, replacing the original underground water source with high-quality Yellow River water.
"On December 29, 2019, the water supply project officially passed through the three districts of Yinchuan City. In 2020, residents of Suining Town and Helan County also drank the Yellow River water."
Ding Ming said that the Yinchuan water resources department will make overall plans to consider the transformation of regional rural drinking water and urban water supply integration. "Next, we will integrate all the scattered water supply points in rural areas and connect them to the west line water supply project. It is expected that the urban and rural areas in Yinchuan will be basically realized by the end of this year. Integrated water supply."
Compaction Responsibility Departments Strengthen Flood Control and Disaster Relief Work-Zhongxin.com
Compaction responsibility departments strengthen flood control and disaster relief work
CCTV news (news broadcast): According to the news from the Ministry of Water Resources, at 12: 00 today (July 25), the water level of the river section below Wangjiaba in the Huaihe River was 0.64 ~ 3.31 meters, and that of the river section below Shashi in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the two lakes was 0.05 ~ 2.02 meters.
Taihu Lake has exceeded the warning water level for 28 days since June 28.
At 12 o'clock today, the average water level of Taihu Lake was 4.67 meters, which exceeded the guaranteed water level by 0.02 meters.
Today, after consultation and judgment, the National Defense General decided to continue to maintain the Class II flood control response of the Yangtze River and Huaihe River, requiring all localities to compact their responsibilities and further implement flood control and disaster relief work.
Today, the National Defense Office and the Emergency Management Department urgently dispatched professional drainage trucks from Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Fujian to help Jiangxi solve problems such as urban waterlogging caused by heavy rainfall.
For the first time, the United States launched a countervailing investigation against China with "undervalued RMB exchange rate"
In response to the recent announcement by the US Department of Commerce, it decided to launch an anti-dumping and countervailing investigation on the cable ties (ties) originating in China, and launched an investigation on the project of "RMB exchange rate undervaluation".
China's Ministry of Commerce pointed out that this is the first time that the United States has filed a case to investigate the so-called "undervalued RMB exchange rate", which China firmly opposes.
China's Ministry of Commerce issued a special press release on the evening of 23rd, saying that China implements a managed floating exchange rate system based on market supply and demand and adjusted with reference to a basket of currencies, and the market plays a decisive role in the formation of exchange rate.
The press release stressed that, on the whole, the RMB exchange rate is at a reasonable and balanced level and has not been underestimated.
Since 2005, the RMB has appreciated more than 17% against the US dollar.
According to the data released by the Bank for International Settlements, from the beginning of 2005 to May 2020, the nominal effective exchange rate of RMB appreciated by 38% and the real effective exchange rate appreciated by 49%, making it the strongest currency in G20 economies and one of the currencies with the largest appreciation in the world.
The Ministry of Commerce pointed out that the exchange rate issue is beyond the authority of members to conduct countervailing investigations in accordance with WTO rules.
The United States amended its laws and regulations in February this year to conduct countervailing investigations on other countries' exchange rates, which was suspected of violating WTO rules and was opposed by many parties.
According to the press release, even in accordance with American regulations, there are a lot of errors in the content of the applicant's complaint, and it does not have the necessary anti-subsidy elements such as financial assistance, benefit granting and specificity.
China urges the US to abide by existing international rules and stop conducting countervailing investigations on the so-called "undervalued RMB exchange rate".
Affected by the further rising tension between China and the United States, the offshore and onshore RMB exchange rates against the US dollar fell sharply in intraday trading on the 22nd, and both fell below the 7.0 yuan mark of one dollar against the RMB.
Whether the US Department of Commerce's move is intended to push up the RMB is worth paying attention to.
The spot exchange rate of RMB against US dollar rose above the 7.0 mark on the 23rd and closed at 6.9961.
The central parity of the RMB against the US dollar, which was officially regulated, was lowered by 17 basis points to 6.9938 on the 24th.

Lewis family: John Lewis is a soldier who fights for the weakest.
John Lewis, an American congressman and civil rights fighter, was remembered as a fighter who fought for the weakest on Saturday (July 25th).
Lewis's public memorial service has been held in Alabama since Saturday.
There were two memorial services on the first day.
At a public memorial service at Troy University in Alabama on Saturday, Lewis's five brothers and sisters and a grandnephew talked about him as a loving, fearless and family-oriented man.
Henry “Grant” Lewis, Lewis's youngest brother, said at the meeting: "He devoted his life to helping others."
Samuel Lewis said that his mother had warned John "don't make trouble, don't make trouble."
He added that John didn't listen to his mother's warning. He said: "We all know that John will always get into trouble, always causing trouble, but it is because he insists on the right thing, which is a good trouble."
Lewis's brothers and sisters reminded the people at the memorial service that John's most famous argument is to create "good trouble", that is, just for the sake of justice, he would not shy away from provoking trouble.
John applied to Troy University in Troy, Alabama, where he was born, but Troy University, which was a white school at that time, refused his application.
John Lewis, who preached the gospel to chickens on his farm as a child, finally got a degree in religion and philosophy from Fisk University.
Years later, the University of Troy awarded Lewis an honorary doctorate.
Senator Doug Doug Jones from Alabama said that the protesters are "protesting peacefully and non-violently", just as Lewis did in the civil rights movement.
Jones said: "Even if President Trump knocked over a boatload of people and described all the protesters as thugs, he was wrong.
The protesters are patriots who want the United States to move towards a more equal country. "
A series of six-day activities in memory of Lewis will culminate in a funeral in Georgia this week.
On Saturday, Lewis's coffin was parked in a public memorial service at Troy University, and people came to pay tribute to the pioneer of civil rights movement.
Later on Saturday, a private ceremony paid tribute to him in a small church in Selma, Alabama, followed by a public memorial service.
On Sunday, Lewis's body will pass the Edmund Peeters Bridge in Selma.
In 1965, he and the demonstrators demanding black voting rights were beaten by Alabama police in front of this bridge, and the police also fired tear gas at the demonstrators.
Lewis was almost killed.
This day will be called "Bloody Sunday".
Lewis's body will be transported to Montgomery, the capital of Alabama.
Steven Reed, the mayor, encouraged people to line up on the sidewalk and finish the final journey with Lewis.
At the same time, officials asked the public to wear masks and keep social distance when participating in activities.
Alabama Governor Kay Ivey ordered the flag to be lowered at half-mast on Saturday and Sunday in memory of Lewis.
During the nearly one-week commemoration, Lewis's body will be placed in the Alabama State Capitol in Montgomery, the Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta, and the U.S. Capitol in Washington for public mourning.
House Speaker Nancy Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced last week that people can pay tribute to Lewis on Monday and Tuesday at the US Capitol.
Because of the coronavirus epidemic, a public event to mourn Lewis will be held outdoors.

Recently, during his inspection tour in Jilin Province, General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized that it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of the Party, promote the extension of party organizations to the grassroots level, improve the working system of grassroots party organizations, and provide a strong guarantee for urban and rural community governance.
Adhering to the guidance of Party building and implementing the Party's leadership in all fields and links of grass-roots governance is the directional and fundamental requirement of doing a good job in grass-roots governance.
To improve the level of grass-roots governance, we must adhere to the leadership of party building, and promote the transformation of the party's political advantages, organizational advantages and mass work advantages into governance advantages by strengthening political leadership, building a fighting fortress and condensing red forces, and transmitting the party's strength and proposition to the "nerve endings" and "last mile".
Pay attention to calcium supplementation, strengthen political guidance.
To strengthen the political guidance of grass-roots governance, we must implement the project of "supplementing calcium and casting soul" well.
It is necessary to thoroughly understand Xi Jinping's socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era as the primary task, take "Do not forget your initiative mind, keep in mind the mission" as the eternal topic of party building and the lifelong topic of party members and cadres, strengthen the principle of reading the original text, and pass special training. Batch training, seminars and exchanges, holding lecture halls, etc., continue to promote the party's innovative theory to be armed and realistic, and promote party members and cadres to further enhance the "four consciousnesses" and strengthen the "four self-confidences",
Through the combination of online and offline learning methods, we can broaden the channels of learning and education, and guide grassroots party organizations and party members and cadres to truly integrate learning and education into daily life and pay attention to it frequently.
Pay attention to practice and exercise, in the process of resolving key and difficult problems in the field of grass-roots governance, solve the worries and troubles that the masses pay attention to, and temper party spirit and ability.
Grasp the standard and upgrade, and build a fighting fortress.
Grass-roots party organizations are not only an important part of grass-roots governance system, but also an important carrier of governance ability.
To promote the standardization construction of grass-roots party organizations, we should start with grasping the working regulations of the Party branch, focus on the weakening and impoverishment of the leadership of the Party organization, and strengthen the foundation, supplement the shortcomings and promote development by establishing the linkage mechanism from top to bottom, innovating the setting form of the branch, normalizing and rectifying the weakness and laxity, establishing and perfecting the decision-making and deliberation mechanism and serving the masses.
In rural areas, we should strengthen the standardization construction of village-level party organizations, standardize organizational forms, study activities and management mechanisms according to the standardization construction standards of party branches, and earnestly promote the implementation of the system of "three sessions and one lesson" and the theme party day activities.
In cities, pay attention to street communities, explore innovative forms of setting branches, focus on weak areas, "blocking points" and "pain points", and actively build urban party building alliances to achieve effective coverage of the party's work.
At the same time, we should establish and improve the governance system and mechanism of grass-roots governance, improve the decision-making and deliberation mechanism led by grass-roots party organizations, discuss major issues together, do practical things together, resolve important issues together, discuss urgent matters together, and solve difficult problems together, improve the mechanism of party members and cadres contacting and serving the masses, gather people's hearts in serving the people, enhance the sense of gain, happiness, honor and pride of party members and the masses, and make grass-roots governance more warm.
Give play to the vanguard role and unite the red power.
Grass-roots party members and cadres are the cornerstone of grass-roots governance.
To improve the grass-roots governance ability, we should focus on improving the governance ability of grass-roots party members and cadres, giving full play to the leading role of "red cells" in grass-roots governance, and condensing red forces at the forefront of contacting and serving the masses.
It is necessary to take the improvement of governance capacity as a compulsory course for grassroots party members and cadres, constantly strengthen ideological refinement, professional training and practical training, carry forward the spirit of taking responsibility in their own posts and in urgent, difficult and dangerous tasks, and lay a solid foundation and contribute to the modernization of the national governance system and governance capacity.
It is necessary to carry out the activities of "community whistle blowing and party members reporting for duty" extensively, and participate in community construction, management and service by participating in theme party day activities, contacting people in difficulty, determining service items, claiming micro wishes, and putting forward reasonable suggestions, so that party members can play a role in community governance.
We should give full play to the role of rural unemployed party members, and guide the majority of grassroots party members to actively participate in poverty alleviation, ecological construction, letters and visits to maintain stability, straw burning ban and other work by setting up vanguard posts for unemployed party members and setting up task forces for unemployed party members, so as to better integrate the red forces and serve the people.
A solid foundation makes a strong building.
Grass-roots party organizations are the foundation of the ruling mansion.
Only by insisting on keeping close relations between the party and the masses, increasing people's well-being, and taking party building as the fundamental way to promote innovation and development of grass-roots governance, can we lay a solid foundation, make grass-roots party organizations pull out and top up, make grass-roots party members and cadres catch up and rush up, and promote grass-roots governance with "soul", order, power and effectiveness.

Tibetan antelope in Hoh Xil enters the migration season-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, July 25 (Reporter Wang Jinjin) The reporter learned from Wudaoliang Protection Station, Hoh Xil Management Office, Yangtze River Source Park, Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration, that the monitoring showed that Tibetan antelopes who had migrated to Zhuonaihu Tibetan Antelope Aggregation area, the hinterland of Hoh Xil, were finishing giving birth one after another and began to bring their cubs back to their original habitat.
According to the monitoring picture near Wudaoliang Protection Station, on July 25th, about 40 female Tibetan antelopes led three young Tibetan antelopes to pass through the Beida Bridge of Wudaoliang on the Qinghai-Tibet Highway 3002 km in succession, and the Tibetan antelopes have started to move back.
According to expert analysis, in recent years, the number of Tibetan antelope cubs in the migrating sheep accounted for one fourth to one fifth of the total number of Tibetan antelopes.
Lian Xinming, an associate researcher at the Northwest Plateau Institute of Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, said: "In the early stage of migration, Tibetan antelopes faced a higher risk of being preyed, so the number of cubs in the flock will be relatively small, and there may even be no cubs."
According to the statistics of Hoh Xil Management Office of Yangtze River Source Park of Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration, the number of Tibetan antelopes has been increasing year by year. In 2019, the number of Tibetan antelopes was 4,860, an increase of 338 compared with 2018.
Lian Xinming said: "It is expected that the migration of Tibetan antelopes will end in early September this year, and the number of Tibetan antelopes is still expected to continue to increase."
Tibetan antelope is a national first-class protected animal.
At the end of May every year, Tibetan antelopes from Sanjiangyuan in Qinghai, Qiangtang in Tibet and Altun Mountain in Xinjiang all go to Zhuonaihu Tibetan Antelope Aggregation in the hinterland of Hoh Xil to give birth to lambs.
Wu Xiaomin, an expert on Tibetan antelope protection in China and a researcher at Shaanxi Institute of Zoology (Northwest Institute of Endangered Animals), said: "The migration of Tibetan antelopes is a process in which female Tibetan antelopes return to their habitats one after another after giving birth. At first, the returning group that left the litter place was relatively large, but then the Tibetan antelopes will return to their respective habitats along different paths according to different geographical populations. "
In order to ensure the safe relocation of Tibetan antelopes, the reporter learned that the Hoh Xil Management Office of Yangtze River Source Park of Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration has arranged staff to continuously carry out video surveillance and patrol in the main relocation areas.
If it is found that Tibetan antelopes try to cross the highway, the mountain patrol team will carry out temporary traffic control at the first time, so that the flocks can safely pass through the wildlife passage, and ensure that they are as little disturbed by human beings as possible during the migration.
So, how to get rid of the summer heat in daily life?
Experts suggest that when going out in summer, try to avoid the high temperature period, and it is best not to walk or work in the hot sun around noon, because the sunshine is the strongest in this period, and the possibility of heatstroke is higher.
If you have to go out at this time, you must do a good job of protection, such as wearing a parasol, sun hat and sunglasses. If you have the conditions, it is best to apply sunscreen to prevent sunburn.
Try to choose light-colored, breathable cotton, hemp and silk fabrics, and wear less chemical fiber clothing, so as to avoid heat stroke caused by excessive sweating.
In hot and sultry weather, prepare plenty of water to drink in time, and don't wait for thirst to drink water, because once you feel thirsty, your body is already short of water, so drink 150 ml to 200 ml each time, and drink warm boiled water instead of ice water.
According to the temperature, the average person drinks 1.5 liters to 2 liters of water every day, and the high-temperature workers drink 3 liters to 5 liters of water every day.
When sweating more, you can supplement some salt water appropriately to make up for the salt lost by sweating.
In addition, the human body is prone to potassium deficiency in summer, which makes people feel tired and fatigued. Potassium-containing tea is an excellent summer drink.
Eat more fruits and vegetables with high water content in summer, such as lettuce, cucumber and tomatoes; Fresh fruits, such as peaches, apricots, watermelons, melons, etc., have a water content of 80% to 90%, which can be used to supplement water; Dairy products can not only replenish water, but also meet the nutritional needs of the body.
In addition, people working in high temperature environment should properly supplement drinks containing potassium, magnesium and other elements.
Summer is long and the night is short, the temperature is high, the metabolism of the human body is vigorous, the consumption is large, and it is easy to feel tired.
Adequate sleep can relax brain and body systems, which is beneficial to work and study, and is also a measure to prevent heatstroke.
Experts say that the best time to go to bed is from 22: 00 to 23: 00 and the best time to get up is from 5: 30 to 6: 30.
Be careful not to lie under the air conditioner outlet and electric fan when sleeping, so as not to suffer from air conditioning diseases and hot cold.
Experts suggest that people who are outdoors or working at high temperature can carry heatstroke prevention drugs such as ten drops of water, Rendan, Huoxiang Zhengqi Water or Huoxiang Zhengqi Pill with them, or put them in the nearest workplace and use them at any time to prevent heatstroke.
Graduates' Art Exhibition Moved into Shopping Mall for Public Welfare Exhibition-Xinhuanet
In the "cloud graduation" season of colleges and universities, a rare offline graduate art exhibition kicked off warmly last weekend.
However, it is neither in the art museum nor in the campus, but in the public space of Chaoyang Joy City, and will be open to the public free of charge until August 23rd.
The reporter learned that this 2020 graduates' art exhibition collected 50 works/groups of 57 young artists from the Central Academy of Fine Arts, Communication University of China and Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts, and the exhibition space was extended from 2 floors to 6 floors, and the light boxes in the building were fully used to display the plane works, thus maximizing the artistic atmosphere in the graduation season.
Under the epidemic situation, the significance of this exhibition is particularly special.
Ge Pingyan, head of Meichen, Chaoyang Joy City, said: "We choose to bring the graduation exhibition to the' cloud' back to the offline space again. We also hope that more people can see the youth's exploration of themselves and understanding of the world, and enlarge the art for society and The healing power of the soul."
She revealed that the works exhibited this time were collected from graduates from several major art colleges, and they were selected to be suitable for commercial space display. The works ranged from traditional easel painting and sculpture to new media installations, interactive animation and VR panorama, with the highest volume and richness in the past years.
Among them, Li Yunxiao expressed his feelings in the epidemic through the creative language of mechanical and manual mixing in the First Battle of 2020; Liu Jiaying's work "Sound Money" created by Ethereum Blockchain discusses the themes of "cryptocurrency", "credit creation" and "transaction"; Zhang Jiaqi's "Cat Forest" and Qiu Daqiang's "Ji" show animals that are often accompanied by human beings, from which we can see young artists' understanding of the relationship between man and animals; Zhu Zhongyu's work "Winter of Faith-Gift" is to remind young people who are growing up. "When one day has a successful career, Do not forget your initiative mind remembers that simplicity and sincerity."
Li Jingyin from the Sculpture Department of Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts is one of the few graduates who personally arranged the exhibition.
"I came to Beijing on July 7. At that time, I was actually a little worried about the epidemic. I also did nucleic acid testing three days in advance, which was carried out with alcohol cotton and test reports."
His work "Yesterday as a Mystery" has a complicated structure, so he must do it himself.
At the same time, he also undertakes the task of helping students repair damaged works.
"The exhibition was held until 4: 30 in the morning, and then repaired. The time was very tight. I forgot to take a photo with the work, and it was a bit regrettable."
He hopes that when the epidemic situation is more stable, he will come to Beijing with his classmates to see his works exhibition.

New drugs developed by Australian universities are expected to be used to treat vascular occlusion caused by COVID-19-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Sydney, July 26 (Reporter Yu Chen) Researchers at Monash University in Australia are developing a new drug that can help prevent heart disease and stroke, and hope that this drug can be used to treat blood vessel blockage caused by Covid-19.
Researchers have found that an enzyme in platelets accelerates platelet coagulation before a heart attack or stroke.
Therefore, they developed a drug that can temporarily inhibit platelet coagulation, thus avoiding blood vessel blockage and preventing heart disease and stroke.
Researchers say the drug will only inhibit the clotting effect of platelets when there are signs of heart disease or stroke.
As studies have shown that similar vascular occlusion is one of the main causes of death of severe patients in COVID-19, researchers hope that this drug can be used in the treatment of such severe patients in the future.
At present, the drug has achieved good results in animal model experiments, and researchers are preparing to conduct human clinical trials in the next stage.
The research results have been published in American Journal of Science and Translational Medicine recently.
He became the first audience to enter the arena after allowing the audience to watch the match in the CBA league rematch.
On the same day, in the second stage (Laoshan Division) of the rematch of Chinese Men's Basketball Professional League (CBA) held in Qingdao, Shandong Province in 2019-2020 season, medical staff, teachers and public security front personnel went to watch the match between Shanghai Jiushi Team and Shandong Xiwang Team after completing the relevant procedures including nucleic acid detection through the official ticketing platform.
During the competition, the spectators must wear masks throughout the competition, take seats according to the numbers, and keep the seats at a strict interval of one meter.
When exiting, the audience must leave in an orderly manner, keeping the social distance of "one meter line" in the order from back to front, from both sides to the middle.
Xinjiang Deeply Cultivates Sunflower Field and Makes Good Use of Clean Energy-Zhongxin.com
2020-07-26 15:43:42 Source: China News Network Author: Chen Haifeng Editor: Chen Haifeng
China News Service, Hami, Xinjiang, July 26 th: Xinjiang cultivates "sunflower fields" and uses clean energy
More than 6,000 pentagonal heliostats, each of which is 48 square meters, are arranged neatly in a circle, such as a silver sunflower field, which rotates with the sun and reflects the sunlight to a heat absorption tower with a height of more than 200 meters in the center to realize power generation.
On the 25th, the reporter saw this scene in Hami Molten Salt Tower Photothermal Power Plant of CLP Project in Naomaohu Town, Yiwu County, Hami City, Xinjiang.
"The so-called molten salt tower photothermal power generation is to reflect sunlight through the mirror to the heat absorption tower to form heat energy, and then convert the heat energy into electric energy through traditional power generation technology."
Zhang Yong, deputy general manager of CLP Hami Solar Thermal Power Generation Co., Ltd., said that its design principle is similar to that of solar cookers used in rural areas in northwest China, and it is necessary to gather sunlight.
The power plant started construction in October 2017 and was connected to the grid at the end of last year. It covers an area of 6,600 mu and plans to install 14,500 heliostats in total.
"Compared with traditional solar power generation technology, its biggest advantage is that it can store the accumulated heat energy and generate electricity at night."
Zhang Yong said that the 13-hour heat storage system configured in the project can keep the generator set running continuously and stably, and is not affected by light changes; It can also quickly participate in peak shaving of power grid according to peak and valley demand of power grid load.
After the project is completely completed, it can realize annual power generation of 198 million kWh, save more than 60,000 tons of standard coal, reduce more than 60 tons of sulfur dioxide, more than 60 tons of nitrogen oxides, about 20 tons of smoke and dust, and more than 150,000 tons of carbon dioxide every year, providing a steady stream of clean energy for the local area.
In addition, there is another silver sunflower field in Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park in Hami City.
Hami Fuguang Solar Photovoltaic Power Station covers an area of more than 2,300 mu, and 714 power generation equipments have been built to rotate with the sun, always keeping the sunlight at a 90-degree right angle with the condensing plate surface.
"We adopt dual-axis tracking concentrated power generation technology. Through unified integrated control, all power generation equipment will adjust the angle according to the height of the sun and maintain power generation efficiency."
Duan Mengqi, the stationmaster of the power station, said that under good weather conditions, the power generation efficiency of this power generation technology can be improved by about 20% compared with the traditional photovoltaic power generation.
In the first half of this year, the power station has generated more than 7 million kWh of electricity, supplementing the local electricity demand.
Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park is a photovoltaic industry demonstration park with the largest single unit and the most complete types of photovoltaic modules in Xinjiang. There are 38 photovoltaic power generation projects with a total installed capacity of 820,000 kilowatts.
In the first half of this year, the power generation exceeded 110 million kWh, an increase of 6% compared with the same period in 2019.
Hami is one of the areas with the best solar energy resources in China.
The annual average total solar radiation is more than 6200 megajoules per square meter, and the annual sunshine hours are about 3200 hours.
In recent years, the city has vigorously developed photovoltaic industry and planted "sunflower fields".
More than 2.5 million kilowatts of solar power generation has been built. In the first half of this year, the photovoltaic power generation in the city exceeded 1.4 billion kWh, an increase of about 14% year-on-year.
At present, there are more than 330 grid-connected photovoltaic power stations in Xinjiang with installed capacity exceeding 10 million kilowatts.
It is estimated that photovoltaic power generation will reach 15 billion kWh this year, which can replace more than 6 million tons of standard coal.
The police informed that the search and rescue work for the details of "Female College Students Lost Travel to Qinghai" is still going on-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, July 26 (Reporter Wang Jinjin, Zhou Zhe) Recently, "a female college student lost contact after traveling to Golmud, Qinghai" has aroused the attention of netizens.
The Public Security Bureau of Golmud City, Haixi Mongolian and Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province reported on the 26th that Huang Moumou, a student of a university in Nanjing, is still in a state of losing contact, and police in many places are going deep into the lost area of Huang Moumou to actively carry out the search work.
On July 10, 2020, the Public Security Detachment of Golmud City Public Security Bureau in Haixi Prefecture received a notice from its superior that Huang Moumou, a student from a university in Nanjing, took the Z164 train from Nanjing to Golmud on July 5, and turned off his mobile phone and lost contact at the southwest area of Qingshuihe in Sonam Dajie Protection Station, Qumalai County, Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province on July 9, asking for assistance in searching.
According to the investigation of Golmud City Public Security Bureau, Huang entered Qinghai Province at 19: 54 on July 6th and arrived in Golmud City at 4: 00 on July 7th.
At 8: 00 on the same day, Huang Moumou, a lost person, took a taxi from Golmud Yellow River Hotel to G109 National Road, and arrived at Hoh Xil Sonandajie Protection Station at 12: 00. The taxi driver returned alone. Huang Moumou arrived at Qingshuihe area near Sonandajie Protection Station at 15: 00 on the 7th until he shut down at 18: 00 on the 9th.
In further investigation, the police found that Huang had passed the Naijigou checkpoint at 17: 07 on July 13th.
Naijigou checkpoint is a checkpoint set up by Naqu City, Tibet Autonomous Region in Nanshankou, Golmud. Because there is no video surveillance at this checkpoint, it is impossible to determine the information of the person and the vehicle, so the police can only drive along the way to search, and coordinate with each checkpoint along Tibet to contact Golmud Public Security Bureau immediately if Huang is found.
According to the latest situation, at 1: 00 a.m. on July 26th, Golmud Public Security Bureau organized rescue forces to carry rescue equipment, went to the Frozen Spring Protection Station and Sonandajie Protection Station along the Qinghai-Tibet Highway for searching, and actively contacted Sichuan police, Tibet police and Nanjing police to work together. At present, the search and rescue work is still continuing.
The local police hope that if the netizens and all sectors of society have relevant clues, they will provide them to Golmud police and Nanjing Jiangning police in time, so as to find the missing person Huang Moumou as soon as possible.
At the same time, relevant experts suggest that tourists should be standardized, rational and civilized in outdoor activities, pay attention to roadside warning signs at any time, do not venture into no-man's land, and report to the police in time in case of unexpected situations.
The US media unveiled the truth that the US unreasonably asked China to close the Consulate General in Houston-Zhongxin.com

The US media unveiled the truth that the US unreasonably asked China to close the Consulate General in Houston
On the 24th, the Chinese Foreign Ministry informed the US Embassy in China that China had decided to revoke the license for the establishment and operation of the US Consulate General in Chengdu, and put forward specific requirements for the Consulate General to stop all its business and activities, as a counter-measure to the US's sudden request on the 21st that China close its Consulate General in Houston.
This behavior of the U.S. government has attracted much attention, and its political motivation has been questioned by foreign media and scholars.
Why did you ask China to close the Consulate General?
Many foreign media said that it is not clear why the United States chose the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, but for the purpose of this move, the foreign media said bluntly: for the general election.
CNN reported on the 23rd that the US side's request to close the Consulate General in Houston caused people to question its political motives.
According to the article, the catastrophic response of the US government to the COVID-19 epidemic caused the low support rate of President Trump's polls before the election.
White House officials said privately that the tough strategy against China was to save Trump's support rate, and at the same time, to shift the responsibility of the White House to deal with the failure of the epidemic.
The article holds that the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is a "politically driven and very cautious" goal chosen by the United States, and the American government chose it "to create a tough attitude and avoid the risk of major conflicts".
The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) also believes that Trump believes that "playing the Chinese card has political advantages" when the US election season is approaching and the US economy is severely hit by the epidemic.
The current situation is "a spiral and tit-for-tat struggle", which is promoted by the US government from the perspective of domestic considerations to a certain extent, and will only worsen the tension between China and the United States.
CBS reported that Trump's prospects for re-election were under pressure because of the outbreak, and he repeatedly blamed China for the outbreak.
Almost every day, the United States takes new actions against Trump's absurd argument that "China exploited the United States".
"The Consulate General of Houston is very important in establishing ties between the two countries."
The Associated Press commented that the United States asked China to close its Consulate General in Houston, which aggravated the tension between the two largest economies in the world.
If the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is closed, besides the diplomatic influence, Chinese citizens in the southern United States will face difficulties in obtaining consular services, and American citizens seeking visas and other services will also face difficulties.
A Houston business group expressed regret that the US side asked China to close its Consulate General in Houston, saying that the Consulate General played an important role in establishing trade, investment and cultural ties between the two countries.
Associated Press believes that this reflects the importance of China's economy.
According to the website of American Foreign Policy magazine, this move by the US side is "part of a series of provocative measures, which will only worsen US-China relations".
Reuters quoted Jonathan Pollack, an expert on East Asian issues at Brookings Institution, an American think tank, as saying that since the establishment of comprehensive diplomatic relations between the United States and China in 1979, he could not think of any action comparable to the US action against the Chinese Consulate General in Houston.
Hong Kong's South China Morning Post reported that this move by the US side is unprecedented in the diplomatic relations between China and the United States for more than 40 years.
Analysts believe that this move may cause lasting damage.
Established in 1979, the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is the first Chinese Consulate General in the United States.
At present, China has one embassy and five consulates in the United States.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 26 (Reporter Lu Jinbo) Russian fleets held a military parade on the 26th to celebrate Navy Day, commemorating the 324th anniversary of the establishment of the Russian Navy.
On the same day, Russian North Sea, Baltic Sea, Black Sea, Caspian Sea and Pacific Fleet held military parades in the waters where their bases were located, with 15,000 soldiers, 219 ships of various types and 71 military aircraft participating.
Russian President Putin, the supreme commander of the armed forces, attended the parade of the Baltic Fleet.
About 4,000 soldiers, 46 ships and more than 40 fighter planes attended the local military parade.
Putin first inspected the ship formation in the waters of the naval base in Kronstadt, Baltic Sea.
After that, he arrived in the waters of neva river in the center of St. Petersburg by speedboat and went ashore to watch the military parade on the Neva River.
Putin delivered a speech at the military parade, saying that the modern technical level of Russian naval equipment has been continuously improved in recent years, and the Russian navy will receive about 40 new ships equipped with unique hypersonic strike systems in 2020.
In addition, Evmenov, commander-in-chief of the Russian Navy, said in an interview with Red Star, the official newspaper of the Russian Ministry of Defense, that Russia's plan to build ships has been effectively implemented, and the number of new ships that the Russian Navy plans to receive in 2020 is relatively large in recent years.
In 1696, Tsar Peter the Great set out to form a sea fleet, which initiated the history of Russian navy.
The last Sunday in July every year is the Russian Navy Day.
In view of the new changes in the epidemic prevention and control work, since July 17th, trade unions at all levels in Xinjiang have responded to the call of the Autonomous Region Federation of Trade Unions and actively participated in the epidemic prevention and control work.
Trade union cadres, workers and model workers from the north and south of Tianshan Mountains went into street communities and residents to carry out activities such as delivering vegetables and medicines, disinfecting and sterilizing, propagating knowledge of epidemic prevention, etc., serving the workers and masses, and demonstrating the "hard core power" of trade unions with practical actions.
Recently, the condolence group of Tianshan District Federation of Trade Unions in Urumqi sent a batch of urgently needed living materials for epidemic prevention and control to the workers in 12 isolation points.
After the outbreak, Tianshan District invested more than 1.05 million yuan in the first time, which was urgently allocated to 23 directly affiliated grass-roots trade unions.
Zhao Xiangguo, deputy secretary of the Party Committee and chairman of the trade union of China Construction Xinjiang Construction Engineering First Construction Company, took the initiative to volunteer after receiving the notice of the company on epidemic prevention and control, and chose to stay on duty in the unit to escort the employees.
He sent cooking utensils, food and daily necessities to the employees who lived in the dormitory and joined the company, and organized personnel to send them daily necessities every two days.
"From July 21 ST, we will find out the cadres and workers who stick to the front line of the war' epidemic disease', and adopt the method of placing orders online and delivering goods to the door. First, we will supplement the purchase of epidemic prevention supplies and living materials for 704 front-line workers in Urumqi."
The person in charge of Xinjiang Transportation Trade Union told reporters that in the face of sudden epidemic, they made every effort to ensure epidemic prevention and control services, steadily push forward the development of transportation, and create a strong atmosphere of fighting the epidemic with one heart.
At present, because of the high temperature in summer, trade unions at all levels keep a close eye on frontline workers in key areas of epidemic prevention and control, and put the care of "sending cool and refreshing" into practice.
On July 19th, urumqi county Federation of Trade Unions launched a condolence activity of "sending coolness" to frontline workers in epidemic prevention and control, and police stations, checkpoints and health systems in the county received condolences such as drinks and fruits.
"Trade union cadres should further improve their political positions, strengthen their responsibilities, warm people's hearts with care, and inspire their morale with actions.
We should give full play to the role of trade unions in rallying and uniting workers, do a good job in epidemic prevention and control services, actively safeguard the health rights and interests of workers, and send care to front-line workers. "
The relevant person in charge of the Autonomous Region Federation of Trade Unions said.
Direct recruitment of non-commissioned officers in full swing in 2020-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26 (Reporter Jia Qilong) Recently, the Political Work Department of the Military Commission and the National Defense Mobilization Department of the Military Commission jointly issued a notice to deploy the direct recruitment of non-commissioned officers from graduates of ordinary colleges and universities in 2020.
This year, the direct recruitment of non-commissioned officers covers 64 categories of more than 270 military and civilian majors, such as computer, automation and machinery, with emphasis on increasing the recruitment of unmanned aerial vehicles, navigation, aerospace, electronic information and small languages, with the recruitment scale increasing by nearly 2,000 compared with last year.
This year, the direct recruitment of noncommissioned officers and the recruitment of conscripts were organized and implemented simultaneously, starting on August 1 and ending on September 30.
Young candidates can inquire about the conditions of direct recruitment of noncommissioned officers and the professional distribution in various places through the national recruitment network (website: http://www.gfbzb.gov.cn), submit the registration information online in line with the professional scope and recruitment conditions, and participate in the follow-up recruitment work such as physical examination and political assessment according to the unified requirements of the military service organs in the places where candidates apply.
Qualified young people who fail to be recruited as noncommissioned officers due to recruitment professional and planning restrictions can participate in the recruitment of conscripts. When they are selected as noncommissioned officers after the expiration of their compulsory military service, the number of years of study in ordinary institutions of higher learning according to the prescribed educational system shall be regarded as their service time.
This year's recruitment of non-commissioned officers is organized by the conscription office of the provincial or prefecture-level people's government. The majors with rich registration potential will be selected on the basis of comprehensively measuring the educational level of the applicants, the results of professional courses during school, and obtaining professional qualification certificates; Scarce majors will be recruited for local colleges that meet professional requirements and have recruitment advantages.
According to the requirements of epidemic prevention and control, in principle, non-commissioned officers recruited directly this year will not arrange to report on their own, and will be transported into the camp simultaneously with conscripts.
The time for directly recruiting non-commissioned officers to join the army starts from September 1, 2020, and the time for the troops to issue orders for serving non-commissioned officers is December 1, 2020.

Spokesperson of the Embassy in the UK: The Chinese government is a staunch defender of cybersecurity-Chinanews.com
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) According to the website of the Chinese Embassy in the UK, on the 25th, a spokesman of the Chinese Embassy in the UK answered a reporter's question about false remarks about cyber attacks.
The spokesman stressed that the Chinese government is a staunch defender of cyber security and has always resolutely opposed and cracked down on cyber attacks and cyber crimes in any form.
A reporter asked: According to media reports, hacker organizations related to China interfered with the network system of a British company, launched attacks on British and American technology companies with patent data, and invaded the government networks of European Union countries.
The spokesman said that the Chinese government is a staunch defender of cyber security and has always resolutely opposed and cracked down on cyber attacks and cyber crimes in any form.
Cyberspace is virtual, difficult to trace, and diverse in actors. When investigating and characterizing network events, sufficient evidence should be produced, and it is impossible to guess for no reason.
The spokesman said that a series of incidents such as the "Prism Gate" in the past proved that the United States has been carrying out the world's largest network stealing operation.
Maintaining peace and stability in cyberspace is in the common interest of all countries.
The spokesman pointed out that China's achievements in scientific and technological innovation were not stolen or robbed, but gained through self-reliance and hard work.
In 2019, China submitted about 59,000 patent applications through the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), with an annual growth rate of 10.6%, making it the country with the largest number of international patent applications.
China has become a big country in innovation and intellectual property rights.
According to the data of Urumqi Central Sub-branch of the People's Bank of China, in the first half of the year, new loans for agriculture-related and small and micro enterprises in Xinjiang exceeded the annual increase in 2019.
In the first half of this year, Urumqi Central Sub-branch of the People's Bank of China used a variety of monetary policy tools to guide the banking industry to continuously increase loan investment, which provided sufficient financial guarantee for epidemic prevention and control and resumption of production.
Most areas of free nucleic acid testing in Urumqi have basically completed secondary testing in high-risk areas-Zhongxin.com
Urumqi, July 26 (Reporter Sun Tingwen Zhao Yamin) Zhang Wei, director of Urumqi Health and Health Commission, reported the latest epidemic situation and nucleic acid detection in Urumqi on the 26th, saying that at present, free nucleic acid detection work in most districts of Urumqi has been basically completed.
The expert group of the State Council and experts from autonomous regions and Urumqi are making further evaluation on the development of the epidemic situation based on the results of nucleic acid detection and epidemiological investigation.
The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Press Office held a press conference on the 26th to report the epidemic situation and prevention and control in Xinjiang.
According to him, from 00: 00 to 24: 00 on July 25th, there were 22 new cases confirmed by Covid-19 in Urumqi (including 5 cases of asymptomatic infected persons) and 38 new cases of asymptomatic infected persons.
As of 24: 00 on July 25th, there were 135 confirmed cases and 147 asymptomatic infected cases in Urumqi.
25, the new asymptomatic infected people are basically through the city's free nucleic acid testing, active screening out.
Zhang Wei, director of the Health and Health Commission of Urumqi, said on the 26th that free nucleic acid detection has been basically completed in most districts of Urumqi.
He also said that from the experience of other regions in China, there are many factors that affect the results of nucleic acid detection, such as the sensitivity of detection reagents, the infection time and detoxification time of the tested personnel, the cooperation of the tested personnel when taking samples (poor cooperation may lead to the samples not being taken in place), the detection environment and the operation proficiency of the inspectors, etc.
For various reasons, false negative results will also appear in nucleic acid detection.
False negative means that the tested person is really infected, but the nucleic acid test result is negative.
In addition, people who have had close contact with confirmed cases and suspected cases usually need two nucleic acid tests before they can be excluded.
For people who have been to high-risk areas in the epidemic situation, if fever and respiratory symptoms occur, it is possible to have false negatives if one nucleic acid test is negative, so it needs two nucleic acid tests to eliminate them.
He said that in view of the above situation and for the health of the people of all ethnic groups in the city, starting from today, Urumqi will carry out secondary free nucleic acid testing in key areas such as Tianshan District and Shayibak District, and at the same time, carry out "tracing and trapping".
It is reported that Tianshan District and Shayibak District are areas with high risk of epidemic situation.

White House epidemic expert Fudge: I am cautiously optimistic about the development of vaccines in early 2021
Fauci made the above remarks at an online video conference hosted by the International Leadership Foundation on the 25th.
He reminded that it is not clear how the COVID-19 epidemic will develop in autumn and winter, nor what the final impact of the epidemic will be. "The only way to end all this is for each of us to choose to be part of the solution.".
According to Johns Hopkins University data, as of 21: 00 on the 25th, there were 4.176 million confirmed cases and 146,000 deaths in COVID-19.
Fauci said that some areas in the United States are struggling to fight against the rebounding epidemic.
Although the epidemic situation varies from place to place, it is necessary to respond to local conditions, but diversified anti-epidemic strategies do not mean that there is no close connection between regions.
An epidemic in one area will eventually affect other areas.
"Now is not the time for complacency," Fauci said. "Our work has not been completed, we must step up our efforts, and we must be vigilant against the uncertainty in the future."
He Dayi, an American Chinese medical expert and founder of "cocktail therapy" for treating AIDS, pointed out at the meeting that the COVID-19 epidemic in the United States has not yet reached its peak.
"Each of us must do our part to slow down the spread of this virus."
He Dayi called on the public to use their practical actions to buy time for scientists to step up research and development of COVID-19 therapeutic drugs and vaccines.
International Leadership Foundation is a non-profit organization aiming at promoting international exchange activities in the United States and Asia-Pacific region, and is committed to promoting the status of Asian-Pacific Americans and cultivating international young leaders.
On the same day, U.S. Secretary of Transportation Zhao Xiaolan, U.S. Congressman Grace Meng and Dong Jiling, founding president of the International Leadership Foundation, spoke at the meeting respectively.
They paid special tribute to the Asian-Pacific medical workers and volunteers who fought the epidemic in the front line, and called on the American public to continue to adhere to the epidemic prevention guidelines such as "social distance" to curb the spread of the epidemic.

On the 25th, 2020 Hunan Red Tourism Culture Festival and Xiangtan First Red Cultural Industry Expo opened in Shaoshan.
In recent years, the demand for red tourism has gradually increased.
However, the development of red tourism industry is also faced with difficulties such as fewer young people, homogenization of tourist projects and single commercialization channel.
Especially in this year's epidemic raid, the national cultural and tourism industry has been severely frustrated, and red tourist attractions are also facing severe challenges.
For example, the use of drone shooting, VR immersion experience and other scientific and technological means can meet the tourist needs of tourists who have not arrived yet; Introducing live webcasts and promoting famous and famous products in red scenic spots can directly improve the economic benefits of red tourism; Introduce "cloud" technology to create a boutique exhibition with prominent theme, clear orientation and rich connotation, and fully display and enhance the propaganda function of the red scenic spot; Innovate the way of spreading red culture, make revolutionary cultural relics "live", make red tourism popular, pass on red genes and enhance the attraction of red scenic spots.
This cultural festival uses the popular way of "county and city (district) chief+professional anchor special promotion" to promote red cultural tourism specialties, and uses 5G technology to provide real-time viewing and smart city demonstration services to promote red cultural tourism attractions, which are all efforts to insert wisdom wings into red tourism, expecting Hunan red tourism to become more and more prosperous.
Representatives of the US-China trade talks met in August
Hong Kong's South China Morning Post quoted an anonymous insider as saying on the 25th that Liu He, head of China's trade negotiation team and Vice Premier of the State Council, and Lai Haizhe, co-leader of the US team and trade representative, are expected to hold formal talks in August to evaluate the implementation of the first-stage trade agreement between China and the United States.
The report said that although China has greatly increased the quantity of agricultural products purchased from the United States in the past few months, due to the Covid-19 epidemic and other factors, the quantity of Chinese purchases is still far from the quantity promised in the trade agreement.
Analysts say that the recent closure of each other's consulates between the United States and China, coupled with other disputes, may undermine any progress in trade between the two sides.
The first-stage trade agreement between China and the United States came into effect one month after it was signed on January 15th, which stipulated that the trade framework group composed of high-level officials from both sides should hold talks once every six months.
According to informed sources, this meeting will be "an important turning point", allowing both parties to assess the progress of the agreement.
However, this person also said that if the tension between the United States and China leads to a low willingness to talk at this time, the two sides may agree that the conference call between Lai Haizhe and Liu He on May 8 has already met the terms of the trade agreement for talks once every six months.
Since the beginning of this year, Sino-US relations have deteriorated rapidly. The disputes between the two sides include a series of issues such as the origin of Covid-19, trade, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, South China Sea and ideology.
Although President Trump boasted about his achievements in the first-stage agreement at the beginning of the year, his attitude has changed recently.
He said at the White House press conference on the 23rd that although China recently purchased a record number of corn from the United States in a single day and bought a lot of soybeans, "this trade agreement is not as meaningful to me as it was when it was reached".
An anonymous Beijing government consultant also believes that a new round of trade negotiations is unlikely due to poor US-China relations, and "trade issues have lost weight in Sino-US relations".
However, he revealed that China's economic and trade related units still met on the 23rd to discuss a series of issues, including how to increase imports from the United States. "We have tried our best to buy them, so any additional purchases will be difficult.".
Peng Jiening, vice president of u.s.-china business council, said that it is "more important than ever" to maintain the momentum of the first-stage agreement, and pointed out that China has made progress in further opening its financial market to American enterprises this year.
An analyst at Plenum, an independent research company, said: "It is better to talk than not to talk, although it may only be regarded as routine."
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26 (Reporter Wei Yukun) The reporter learned from the emergency management department on the 26 th that the National Defense Office and the emergency management department, together with the State Grain and Material Reserve Bureau, urgently dispatched 6 types of central reserve flood control materials such as woven bags, woven fabrics of 1.2 million square meters and geotextiles of 130,000 square meters to Anhui to support Anhui's flood fighting and rescue work.
According to the relevant person in charge of the emergency management department, at present, the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the Huaihe River Basin maintain high water level fluctuations, and the "No.3 Flood of the Yangtze River in 2020" formed in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River on the 26th, which increases the risks in some areas.
The meteorological department predicts that there will be heavy rainfall in Chongqing, Guizhou and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in the next three days, and the flood control situation is still severe and complicated.
According to reports, since the flood season, the Emergency Management Department has deployed a national comprehensive fire rescue team to pre-set professional rescue forces in key flood control areas, and has participated in 10,364 flood fighting rescues, dispatched more than 130,000 commanders, 17,778 fire engines and 11,887 boats, rescued 37,777 people trapped in distress, and evacuated and transferred more than 107,000 people trapped.
Hao Yusheng, chief representative of Nasdaq China: It is now the best time node for Chinese companies to go to the US IPO-Economic Watch-professional financial news website
Zhang Bin, a reporter from Economic Observer Network, has implemented stricter supervision on Chinese stocks in the US market because of the fraud incident in Luckin coffee. In addition, the valuation has been under pressure for a long time, and Chinese stocks listed in the US are under pressure. Netease, JD.COM and other Chinese stocks have recently started their journey to return to Hong Kong for listing.
Recently, companies such as Shell and Ideal Auto are enthusiastic about listing in the US.
Under the epidemic situation and China stock market crisis, is it the best time for Chinese companies to go public in the US?
"As far as the recent IPO cases and the companies going to go public in the US are concerned, the IPO in the US has not been affected in essence. On the contrary, the market is very good now. Even now this time is the best IPO for Chinese companies in the US in the past 10 years. Time node."
Hao Yusheng, the chief representative of Nasdaq Stock Exchange in China, said at the "Stock Sharing Branch of the Leaders Summit of Listed Companies in 2020" hosted by Snowball.
In April this year, the Securities and Futures Commission (SEC) and the Public Company Accounting Supervision Committee (PCAOB) issued the Statement on the Important Role of Audit Quality and Supervision in Obtaining Audit and Other International Information-Discussion on the Challenges of Information Acquisition of American Listed Companies with Large Business in China.
The statement said that although international cooperation and coordination have increased significantly in recent years, the problems of information acquisition in the US regulatory authorities still exist, and SEC and PCAOB still face legal and practical challenges; Corresponding to this document, the PCAOB website lists in detail the list of listed companies that have encountered audit obstacles and their audit institutions, and a large number of Chinese stock companies are listed.
In addition, in May this year, the U.S. Senate passed the Foreign Companies Accountability Act, which put forward additional information disclosure requirements for foreign companies listed in the United States.
In Hao Yusheng's view, the China Stock Exchange crisis did not affect investors' appetite.
"When this news first came out, it caused everyone's panic, and everyone was asking whether they could go public in the US in the future. However, we later found that these problems were not a problem for investors. Investors might ask these questions when they went to the IPO roadshow in the US recently, and even become a standardization problem, but this was not regarded as an important factor for investors to vote for or not to vote for a Chinese company.
It is suggested that we treat the current situation with a normal heart as far as possible.
Of course, this may appear to be the worst situation in the past two years, but as far as investors' appetite is concerned, it has not been affected at all.
Therefore, from now until the end of this year or before the US election, the upsurge of IPO going to the US will continue. "
On May 9 this year, Jinshan Cloud officially went public on NASDAQ in the United States, becoming the first Chinese company to go to the United States for IPO after the epidemic.
"The listing of Jinshan Cloud gives great confidence to Chinese companies preparing IPOs later."
Hao Yusheng said.
According to the data report released by Snowball in the first half of 2020, in the first half of this year, there were 20 IPO Chinese companies in the United States, an increase of 17.6% over the same period of last year; Judging from the total amount of initial fundraising, 20 companies raised a total of 2.725 billion yuan, which has rebounded compared with the same period of last year, up more than 52.4%; In terms of industry distribution, the number of IPOs in healthcare industry was outstanding in the first half of this year, which increased by 100% compared with the same period of last year.
According to Hao Yusheng, Chinese companies that went to the US IPO in the first half of this year have higher quality, excellent fundamentals and high-quality growth companies, which will be more favored by investors.
In the short-term, medium-term and long-term, Hao Yusheng is optimistic about the IPO of Chinese companies going to the United States.
"In the short term, the upsurge of IPO in the United States is still going on; In the medium term, Chinese companies have more choices, A shares, Hong Kong stocks and US stocks. Everyone will take the US election and Sino-US relations as considerations for market choice and time choice; In the long run, everything will return to normal, and market fluctuations are cycles, both political and economic, and will eventually return to the normal stage. The stock market has always been fluctuating. "
Hao Yusheng also said, "There are many uncertain factors this year, but for high-quality companies, no matter whether the market is good or bad, as long as they are solid and have growth that investors can see, other factors are relatively secondary. Investors need to invest in excellent Chinese companies."

Commentator of People's Daily: Concentrate on doing your own thing well to create new advantages for future development —— On studying and implementing General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech at entrepreneurs' forum-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 25 th, People's Daily, July 26 th, commentator's article: Concentrate on doing your own thing and create new advantages in future development
At present, the global epidemic situation and the world economic situation are still severe and complicated, and China's development is facing unprecedented challenges.
Maintaining strategic strength, enhancing confidence in winning, and concentrating on doing our own thing are the key to our response to various risks and challenges.
At the entrepreneur symposium held recently, General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized that under the current external environment of rising protectionism, sluggish world economy and shrinking global market, we must concentrate on doing our own thing well, give full play to the advantages of domestic super-large-scale market, gradually form a new development pattern with domestic big circulation as the main body and domestic and international double circulation promoting each other, upgrade the modernization level of industrial chain and supply chain, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation, speed up key core technology research, and create new advantages for future development.
He who observes the situation is wise, and he who controls the situation wins.
Under the external environment of the in-depth development of economic globalization, the market and resources have played an important role in China's rapid development.
Now, the world under the impact of the epidemic is undergoing profound changes, facing more unstable and uncertain factors, and economic globalization is facing headwinds and turning back waves.
One of the most important aspects of making good ideological and work preparations for coping with changes in the external environment for a long time and promoting China's economy to ride the wind and waves and achieve stability and far-reaching, is to take expanding and meeting domestic demand as the strategic basis for development, give full play to its own advantages, and add impetus to China's economic development and promote the recovery of the world economy by prospering the domestic economy and smoothing the domestic circulation.
We should profoundly realize that building a complete domestic demand system is related to China's long-term development and long-term stability.
The CPC Central Committee has judged the situation and clearly put forward the strategy of expanding domestic demand, which is the need to cope with the impact of the epidemic, to maintain the long-term sustained and healthy development of China's economy and to meet the people's growing needs for a better life.
The advantage of a big country's economy is that it can be recycled internally.
China has the most complete and largest industrial system in the world, strong production capacity and perfect supporting capacity. It has more than 100 million market players and more than 170 million talents with higher education or various professional skills, and a super-large domestic demand market formed by 1.4 billion people including more than 400 million middle-income groups. It is in the stage of rapid development of new industrialization, informationization, urbanization and agricultural modernization, and has great investment demand potential.
The basic socialist economic system, such as public ownership as the main body, multi-ownership economy developing together, distribution according to work as the main body, and multi-distribution modes coexisting, can not only stimulate the vitality of various market players, liberate and develop social productive forces, but also promote the organic unity of efficiency and fairness and continuously realize common prosperity.
We should firmly grasp the strategic basis of expanding domestic demand, make production, distribution and circulation rely more on the domestic market to achieve a virtuous circle, clarify the strategic direction of supply-side structural reform, and promote the dynamic balance between total supply and total demand at a higher level.
It is necessary to speed up the construction of a complete domestic demand system, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation and other aspects of innovation, accelerate the promotion of strategic emerging industries such as digital economy, intelligent manufacturing, life and health, and new materials, form more new growth points and growth poles, and gradually form a new development pattern with the domestic big cycle as the main body and the domestic and international double cycles promoting each other.
Opening brings progress, while closing is bound to lag behind.
General Secretary Xi Jinping has repeatedly stressed that the door to China's opening will not be closed, but will only open wider.
Taking the domestic circulation as the main body, it is by no means a closed operation behind closed doors, but by exerting the potential of domestic demand, the domestic market and the international market can be better connected, and the international and domestic markets and resources can be better utilized to achieve stronger and more sustainable development.
At the same time, there is no contradiction between expanding domestic demand and opening up. The smoother the domestic circulation, the more conducive it is to building a new pattern of opening up and forming new advantages in participating in international cooperation and competition.
Although protectionism is on the rise in the world, we should stand on the right side of history, persist in deepening reform, expanding opening up, strengthening open cooperation in the field of science and technology, and promoting the construction of an open world economy and a community of human destiny.
The Chinese nation has experienced many hardships in its history, but it has never been crushed. Instead, it has become more and more frustrated, constantly growing up and rising from hardships.

Yu 'ebao saves money "retaliatedly" instead of "after 90"?
With the decline of Yu 'ebao's income, the "post-90s" not only did not escape Yu 'ebao, but began to "retaliate" to save money?
The "Report on Savings after 90 Years" (2020 Edition) released by China New Economic Research Institute and Alipay recently shows that in the first half of the year, the "post-90 s" loved to save more: the per capita savings amount increased by nearly 40% compared with 2019.
Interestingly, the "post-90 s" tend to start with a small amount of money, and 60% of the average amount of money saved is below 20 yuan ...
Saving money with Yu 'ebao has also become the habit of saving money for the post-90s generation.
Data show that among the 700 million Yu 'ebao users, 134 million are "post-90s".
There are 174 million "post-90s" in China, that is to say, about three out of every four "post-90s" in China are saving money with Yu 'ebao.
At present, the 7-day annualized rate of return of money funds such as Yu 'ebao has dropped to about 1.5% from the level higher than 2% at the beginning of the year.
Even so, it has not affected the pace of saving money for the post-90s generation.
Under the background of the "saving effect" of Yu 'ebao, many young people who are used to using Yu 'ebao are directly transformed into "basic people".
According to Alipay data, as of July 13th, the number of new "basic people" on Alipay has more than doubled in recent months, and more and more young people have realized "advanced" financial management on Alipay.
Some analysts believe that the inflow of funds from Yu 'ebao into the stock market is also an important reason for the clear decline in the share of money funds in June.
The report also shows that "post-90 s" girls are more inclined to save money, with an average of 20% higher than boys' money; Among the users who hold funds on Alipay platform, 60% are men, and women tend to choose more stable financial management methods than men.
After saving money, what are the plans for the post-90s generation?
According to Alipay data, "post-90s generation" have the habit of saving money for their goals, and most users take travel as their goal of saving money.
Affected by the epidemic, many "post-90 s" saved money to prepare for travel after the epidemic; The reopening of cinemas also provides a new way to change from saving money to spending.

France increases military investment in space-Xinhuanet
French Defense Minister Floran Paley said on the 24th that France will add hundreds of millions of euros to its space defense budget and develop its space military force to prevent other countries from taking "unfriendly actions" in outer space.
On the same day, Paley told Provence that from 2019 to 2025, the expenditure budget of French space military projects will increase from 3.6 billion euros (about 4.2 billion dollars) to 4.3 billion euros (5 billion dollars).
According to the French Military Planning Act 2019-2025 approved by the French Parliament in 2018, France is expected to update the existing observation satellites and communication satellites and launch three electromagnetic interception satellites to improve the modernization level of space surveillance radar.
French President Emmanuel Macron announced in July last year that a space military command and an "aviation and space force" would be set up within the French Air Force.
Pali said that she will officially announce the establishment of this space force when she visits a military academy in Salon, Provence.
Paley said that this space force belongs to the Air Force and will have 500 personnel by 2025.
She said: "People used to think that space served the common interests of science, but this idea is gone forever. Today, space is a place where countries compete for global hegemony. "
Pali reiterated Macron's previous statement that France has no intention of provoking an arms race.
"We are by no means engaged in an arms race. But I have the responsibility to thoroughly recognize the threats we may face. "
Paley revisited the surveillance of a military satellite shared by France and Italy in 2017.
She said that "peeping" was a Russian satellite.
Russia denies this claim.
Paley said that France "will soon" have a small patrol satellite capable of detecting and targeting "those black hands behind unfriendly actions".
According to French media, the reason why France seeks to establish a space force is that US President Donald Trump asked the US Department of Defense to draft a bill to establish a space force in February last year.
Trump signed the National Defense Authorization Act in December last year, approving the establishment of the sixth largest US military service, the Space Force.
Some experts are worried that these measures by the United States have accelerated the pace of militarization of American space and may trigger a new round of space arms race.

Zhongshan Hospital affiliated to Xiamen University said that after the vascular surgery of the two hospitals officially formed a cooperative unit, they will conduct remote consultation, formulate treatment plans with Changhai Hospital in real time online consultation, select talents for further training, and jointly carry out surgical technical exchanges and teaching rounds every week. Wait; For complex cases, Changhai experts can be invited to the hospital for operation according to the needs of patients, so that patients in southwestern Fujian can enjoy the top medical resources in China without leaving the province.
The two hospitals will also jointly carry out innovative scientific research on surgery, popular science of aortic diseases and early screening, etc.
A special symposium on aorta sponsored by Beijing Health Promotion Association and undertaken by Zhongshan Hospital affiliated to Xiamen University was held in Xiamen on the same day.
The two well-known hospitals in Shanghai and Xiamen held the signing ceremony of vascular surgery collaboration center at the same time, and announced the formation of collaboration units to jointly improve the treatment level of vascular surgery-related diseases in Southwest Fujian.
The vascular surgery of Shanghai Changhai Hospital is the only institute of vascular surgery in the whole army and the only clinical medical center of vascular system diseases in Shanghai. It is also the first national key discipline of vascular surgery. It is the top team with profound accumulation in the industry.
Professor Huang Xiaojin, Director of Vascular Surgery, Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University, was interviewed by the media.
Vascular Surgery of Zhongshan Hospital affiliated to Xiamen University is the first independent discipline of vascular surgery in Fujian Province. It has been dedicated to the diagnosis and treatment of aortic and peripheral vascular diseases for a long time, and was approved to build a provincial key clinical specialty in 2018.
In the treatment of aortic diseases, besides dissecting aneurysm and aortic aneurysm, he has rich experience in emergency ruptured aortic aneurysm.
"The vascular surgery of Zhongshan Hospital affiliated to Xiamen University is outstanding in the region from the development history, the breadth, difficulty and complexity of the operation. Therefore, this time we set up a collaboration center, which can also be used in the diagnosis and treatment of lower limb arteries and carotid arteries. Carry out all-round in-depth cooperation in medicine, teaching and scientific research."
Professor Rui Feng, deputy director of vascular surgery at Shanghai Changhai Hospital, said.
In 2018, Zhongshan Hospital affiliated to Xiamen University and Shanghai Changhai Hospital signed a contract to establish Li Zhaoshen's Famous Doctor Studio in Department of Gastroenterology.
Professor Huang Xiaojin, director of vascular surgery in our hospital, said in an interview with Zhongxin.com that the vascular surgery in our hospital also has a long history of exchanges with Changhai Hospital. The two hospitals formally formed a cooperative unit, which brought the cooperation and exchanges between the two sides to a new level.

Currently, it plans to conduct remote consultations once a week; In addition, the department will also send personnel to study and exchange, and strengthen the training and development of discipline talents.
At the meeting, the reporter learned that vascular disease is the leading cause of death in China, and the aorta, as the main road of various organs of the human body, flows from the heart to the whole body and plays an important role.
The occurrence of aortic diseases is often accompanied by high risk, high mortality and high difficulty in treatment. The diameter of the thickest section of aorta is up to 4cm. Once hemangioma is formed, rupture occurs, or vascular intima rupture produces dissection, it will cause massive bleeding, which is very dangerous.
In recent years, with the change of people's life style and accelerated pace of life, China has become the world's largest country with high blood pressure, and aortic diseases have also increased. Nowadays, with the development of surgical technology and industrial materials, the treatment of aortic diseases continues to develop in the direction of minimally invasive, rapid and efficient.
Doctors can properly "change lanes" for blood flow by puncturing the thigh and placing stents in the aorta, so as to avoid the impact on aneurysm or ruptured dissection and achieve good therapeutic effect. Some operations only need local anesthesia.
This academic seminar invited more than ten domestic experts to discuss the new progress of aortic disease treatment, and conducted cutting-edge technical training and difficult case discussion in the form of conference salon.
At the meeting, the reporter learned that with the development of surgical technology and industrial materials, the treatment of aortic diseases is developing towards minimally invasive, rapid and efficient direction.

Chongqing, July 26 (Reporter Han Lu) The reporter learned from China Railway Chengdu Bureau Group Co., Ltd. on July 26 that the Zheng Wan High-speed Railway Small Three Gorges Tunnel, with a total length of about 18.9 kilometers, was completed on the same day.
It is understood that the Small Three Gorges Tunnel is not only the longest high-speed railway tunnel in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, but also the longest single-hole double-track high-speed railway tunnel with a design speed of 350 km/h among the projects currently under construction in China.
Zhengzhou-Wanzhou high-speed railway is located in Henan, Hubei and Chongqing, connecting Beijing-Guangzhou high-speed railway and Xulan high-speed railway in the north of Zhengzhou, and connecting Chongqing-Wanzhou high-speed railway to Chongqing in the south of Wanzhou. It is an important part of the Yangtze River Passage and Hunan Passage in China's "eight vertical and eight horizontal" high-speed railway network.
Zhengwan High-speed Railway Small Three Gorges Tunnel was completed on the 26th.
The picture shows running through the site.
Zhengwan high-speed railway starts from Zhengzhou City, Henan Province, and goes southwest through Pingdingshan City, Nanyang City and Xiangyang City, Hubei Province to Wanzhou District, Chongqing. The newly-built line is about 818 kilometers long, with a design speed of 350 kilometers per hour, and about 184 kilometers in Chongqing.
Among them, Zhengzhou-Xiangyang section has been put into operation in advance on December 1, 2019, and Chongqing section is stepping up construction.
The Small Three Gorges Tunnel, which runs through the whole line on 26th, is a control project of Zhengwan High-speed Railway. The project is located at the junction of fengjie county and Wushan County in Chongqing, with a total length of about 18.9 kilometers and a maximum buried depth of 890 meters.
Construction of the tunnel began in February 2017, and the whole tunnel was completed on July 26, 2020.
According to Wang Guojun, the person in charge of the design of Zhengwan High-speed Railway Tunnel of China Railway Second Institute Engineering Group Co., Ltd., which is the survey and design party, the topographic and geological conditions of the small Three Gorges Tunnel are very complex, facing the risks of karst, sudden mud gushing, large deformation of soft rock, etc. It is a Class I high-risk tunnel, and the design and construction of the tunnel are extremely difficult.
"In the process of project construction, we used geological survey method, geophysical prospecting method and advanced drilling method to make advance geological forecast, and adopted special design schemes for more than 30 karst caves of various types. For example, a bridge with a length of 24 meters was designed and built, crossing a large cave with a longitudinal length of over 10 meters and a depth of over 55 meters in the tunnel to avoid tunnel settlement. " Wang Guojun said.
According to the introduction of the construction party, China Railway Tunnel Bureau, when the tunnel was constructed, the combination of dredging and blocking was adopted. By building horizontal tunnel guide, grouting and blocking water, strengthening tunnel structural support and building sewage treatment station, the orderly progress of the project was ensured, and the damage of construction drainage to the water body of the Small Three Gorges Scenic Area was avoided. At the same time, the construction problems such as bad geology such as large deformation of soft rock with a length of 7 kilometers, and water inrush from multiple mud with a daily maximum water inflow of 157,000 cubic meters were successfully overcome.
After the entire Zhengzhou-Wanzhou high-speed railway line is completed and opened to traffic, it will become a new convenient and fast passenger transport main channel from Southwest China to Central Plains, North China and Northeast China. It is of great significance to improve the capacity and quality of the northeast railway channel in Southwest China, improve the layout of regional road network, speed up the development of tourism resources and urbanization along the line, promote regional coordinated development, and promote the implementation of the western development strategy.
Experts say it is unconstitutional to collect immigration data through the U.S. census for the allocation of seats in the House of Representatives
Some civil rights organizations and several American cities and counties sued the US federal government, saying that it was impracticable and unconstitutional for Trump Presidential Office to try to exclude undocumented immigrants from the US census.
The U.S. census will determine the distribution of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Sarah brannon, executive lawyer of the American Civil Rights Freedom League, told VOA, "This will not work."
She went on to say that Trump's request to determine the citizenship of the census takers in the census is difficult to achieve and "not very reliable."
Another civil liberties organization, the Common Business Organization, filed a lawsuit on Thursday, challenging Trump's executive order.
Some cities in New Jersey and Georgia joined the lawsuit.
Arlington County, Virginia, joined the lawsuit Friday.
Garvey, chairman of the management board of Arlington County, said, "The U.S. Constitution requires that our population be accurately counted every 10 years. We must accurately count everyone living in Arlington County, and we must not let this illegal attempt to scare people away and compress the number of our immigrant communities succeed. "
Other organizations and individuals praised President Trump's executive order.
Alabama Attorney General Marshall called the executive order a "victory" for the state.
He said, "When allocating seats in the House of Representatives and electoral college seats in each state, it must be based on the number of residents living in each state and the number of residents living legally."
Last year, the US Supreme Court prevented the Trump administration from including citizenship in the 2020 census.
Earlier this week, President Trump signed an executive order, instructing Secretary of Commerce Ross, who oversees the U.S. Census Bureau, to submit the census data of undocumented population, so that the administrative authorities can exclude these undocumented population from the census figures of each state, and determine whether each state should increase, decrease or maintain the seats of the House of Representatives.
Every 10 years, the United States redistributes seats in the House of Representatives according to demographic changes.

Move according to the situation and promote the construction of industrial projects-headlines-Hunan Daily News-Huasheng Online
In the midsummer of Hunan, the heat wave blows.
However, the enthusiasm released by the provincial industrial project construction to promote the on-site observation meeting has overshadowed the summer heat in the dog days, and the clear guidance of "comparing strength with industry and discussing heroes with projects" encourages the three Hunan and four rivers.
The development of Hunan always depends on building projects and cultivating industries.
Facing the extremely unusual first half of the year, under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, the whole province adhered to a chess game, went all out to fight two hard battles of epidemic prevention and flood control, and regarded industrial projects as the "first move" to implement the "six guarantees" and "six guarantees".
It is self-evident that the GDP in the first quarter decreased by 1.9% year-on-year and increased by 1.3% year-on-year in the first half of the year.
In this precious report card, the construction of industrial projects is the key support for Hunan to accelerate economic recovery and develop stably.
It is inevitable and irreversible.
The construction of industrial projects should be put into the general situation, and be good at accumulating, gaining and seeking potential, as well as recognizing, seeking and adapting to changes.
Under the complicated and severe international situation, in addition to making painstaking efforts to attract investment, it is necessary to calm down and study the new situation and new characteristics, grasp the laws more scientifically and accurately, and better integrate into the new development pattern with the domestic big cycle as the main body and the domestic and international double cycles promoting each other.
Pay more attention to improving industrial basic ability.
In the first half of the year, not only did a large number of heavyweight investment projects in emerging industries break ground and sow hope in our province, but also industrial enterprises with traditional advantages accelerated their distribution in the digital, intelligent and green industrial transformation.
The Yiyang Oskon Third Science Park project transforms the existing production line, and the high-end printed circuit board intelligent production line seizes the opportunity; The new factory area of Hunan Zhongyan Changde Cigarette Factory is committed to the process of intelligent transformation and building a modern factory, which is also a vivid portrayal of "old trees sprout" ... Focusing on the major national strategy and "two new and one heavy", efforts should be made to consolidate and upgrade advantageous industries, actively cultivate and develop new industries, and comprehensively intensify scientific and technological innovation and localization substitution, so as to continuously consolidate the basic conditions and accumulate transformation kinetic energy.
Pay more attention to cultivating and developing new economy, new format and new mode.
The sudden outbreak of COVID-19 has brought the popularity of "cloud economy", stimulated the potential of digital economy and provided new opportunities for industrial transformation: in the first half of the year, the computer and office equipment manufacturing industry, electronic and communication equipment manufacturing industry in our province increased by 12.6%, the online retail sales of wholesale and retail enterprises above designated size increased by 32.2% year-on-year, and the online meal fee income of catering enterprises increased by 35.6% year-on-year.
It is the general trend to nurture new machines in the crisis, open new bureaus in the changing situation, actively promote digital industrialization and industrial digitalization, and guide the integration and development of digital economy and real economy.
Pay more attention to optimizing and stabilizing the industrial chain and supply chain.
Construction machinery is the main force of Hunan industry, but two thirds of supporting enterprises are outside the province, and there is still room and potential in the supporting chain.
To strengthen the thinking of industrial chain and grasp the project, we must not only have the continuous accumulation of head enterprises, but also achieve technological breakthroughs in key links of the industrial chain; It is also necessary for all localities to devote themselves to cultivation, stimulate the "chain" lock reaction with strong chain compensation and chain extension, promote the coordinated layout of related supporting industries, and accelerate the construction of an independent, controllable, safe and reliable industrial chain supply chain.
Hunan is still a hot land with a good business environment and emerging market opportunities.
All parts of the province frequently make moves, make new moves, and make real moves, so that the "burden reduction" of enterprise bail-out will promote the "acceleration" of high-quality development; Shaoyang implements "shareholder-style" service, doing things for enterprises without prevarication, fulfilling policies without discounts, and solving problems for too long … In the process of recovering the losses caused by the epidemic, all kinds of "do everything possible" to identify short-board pain points and achieve a vivid story of turning crisis into opportunity.
It is sure to win the favor of more investors by focusing on studying, cultivating and developing industries and optimizing the business environment in a down-to-earth manner.
The wind and waves are still ahead, but the state of braving the wind and waves has become the normal state for the whole province to grasp the construction of industrial projects and promote high-quality development.
In this critical period, we must learn and implement the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's series of important instructions, effectively deal with external uncertainties with the certainty of our own work, and persistently promote the construction of industrial projects, so as to ensure the successful conclusion of the 13th Five-Year Plan and building a well-off society in an all-round way.

The overall stability of employment and prices shows that the economy has "temperature"-Zhongxin.com

The overall stability of employment and prices shows that the economy has "temperature"
Economic Daily China Economic Net reporter Lin Huocan
In the first half of this year, facing the impact of the Covid-19 epidemic, China made overall plans to promote epidemic prevention and control and economic and social development. The situation of epidemic prevention and control kept improving, and the steady economic recovery was obvious. The employment and price performance closely related to people's livelihood were generally stable, and the Chinese economy handed over a transcript of economic operation with temperature.
In the first two months of this year, the surveyed unemployment rate increased.
Especially in February, the production and operation activities of many enterprises were basically in a state of suspension of production, the employment demand of enterprises decreased, recruitment was delayed or cancelled, and the unemployment rate in urban survey increased.
With the gradual improvement of epidemic prevention and control situation, the production and living order of the whole society has been continuously restored.
The CPC Central Committee adheres to the general tone of striving for stability, further intensifies the macro-policy opposition, comprehensively strengthens the employment priority policy, and actively promotes the work of aiding enterprises to stabilize posts and expand employment.
China has stepped up policies to hedge and stabilize jobs, playing a combination of "reduction and exemption, slow return and subsidy" policies, reducing and exempting three social insurance unit contributions in stages, allowing deferred payment of social insurance premiums, expanding the benefits of stable post return of unemployment insurance for small and medium-sized enterprises, and replacing training with workers, and providing absorption subsidies and probation subsidies for enterprises to absorb employment of key groups.
With the implementation of various policies to stabilize employment, the employment demand of enterprises has steadily rebounded, the employment situation has gradually improved, and the surveyed unemployment rate in cities and towns has gradually declined. In June, the surveyed unemployment rate was 5.7%.
Zhang Yi, director of the Department of Population and Employment Statistics of the National Bureau of Statistics, said that in the second quarter, various employment policies continued to take effect, and the labor force who quit due to the epidemic situation in the early stage returned one after another. The urban labor participation rate in June increased by about 10 percentage points compared with February, which was close to the same level last year.
The data shows that the total urban employment in June increased by more than 19% compared with February, and most industries reached the pre-epidemic level; The average weekly working hours of employees in enterprises reached 46.8 hours, 6.6 hours higher than that in February and 0.1 hour higher than that in January.
Prices are also related to thousands of families.
In January this year, CPI rose by 5.4% year on year, setting a new high for many years.
In February, the year-on-year increase of CPI declined slightly, but it was still in the "5 range".
The year-on-year increase of CPI is at a high level, which is caused by the consumption demand before the Spring Festival, the wrong month of the Spring Festival and the low year-on-year base.
However, the impact of the Covid-19 epidemic on prices is particularly obvious.
Affected by epidemic prevention and control, logistics delay, untimely material supply and increased material transportation cost occurred all over the country in January and February. In addition, some citizens hoarded and snapped up, and the prices of some daily necessities increased significantly.
In order to cope with the disturbance of price situation caused by epidemic prevention and control, relevant departments have brought important living materials into the scope of emergency transportation guarantee to ensure smooth transportation of materials.
Under the action of a series of policy measures, the market supply of vegetables and fruits has been strongly guaranteed.
In response to the rapid increase in pork prices at the beginning of this year, after the central government issued the policy of ensuring supply and stabilizing prices, all regions and departments quickly implemented it, and the pork reserve supply was significantly improved, the pig production capacity was restored in an orderly manner, and the production and marketing order gradually became normal.
Since March, pork prices have continued to decline, and in May, the year-on-year increase in food prices has dropped back to 10.6%; In June, pork prices rose slightly month on month due to factors such as the slow release of live pigs, the decrease in imports and the rebound in group consumption demand.
Seasonal changes of fresh vegetable prices are obvious, with an average increase of 3.4% in the first half of the year.
Affected by the high base of comparison in the same period last year, the price of fresh fruits continued to decline year on year, with an average decline of 13.3% in the first half of the year.
The basic livelihood of the masses has been effectively guaranteed, and the overall economic and social situation has remained stable and orderly.
With the gradual recovery of transportation and logistics, all localities have increased their efforts to ensure supply, and the market supply and demand situation has improved.
Since March, the CPI has declined for four consecutive months, and the year-on-year increase has also dropped from 4.3% in March to 2.5% in June, and the overall price level has returned to a stable level.
In the second half of the year, China's prices will continue to maintain a moderate level, and the overall inflationary pressure is not great, but it is still necessary to promote the restoration of production and living order on the premise of normalization of epidemic prevention and control.
Effectively deal with natural disasters such as floods and droughts in the main producing areas of agricultural products such as grain, fruits and vegetables, strengthen market supervision, and resolutely crack down on hoarding, price gouging and other behaviors that disrupt market order.

After they officially removed their royal family status in March, they are now living in Los Angeles with their son Archie in pursuit of a new career.
Harry and Megan got married in May 2018.
At that time, the marriage was regarded as injecting Hollywood's glamour and new era atmosphere into the British royal family, and they became one of the most famous celebrity couples in the world.

Zhongxin. com, Hainan, Qinghai, July 26 th: Qinghai Lake "Huahai Live Room": "Sweet" brings goods to help farmers increase their income
Author Hu Guilong Pan Yujie
"In the midsummer, Qinghai Lake is full of golden flowers and bees flying. The altitude here is high, the temperature difference between day and night is large, and the air pollution is less. The strong light breeds the most tenacious and generous bee colony, which has created Qinghai royal jelly with high activity, high protein and rich nutrition. Value, low sugar and low fat characteristics."
On the 26th, Zhang Jianxun, deputy director of the Industry and Information Administration of Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, said.
On the same day, the live bee product delivery activity of "Fighting against the plague with spring pulp to help farmers" was held on Qinghai Lake. China Bee Products Association, entrepreneurs' representatives, beekeepers and other parties gathered together to promote Qinghai characteristic bee products, and sold nearly 10,000 bottles of Qinghai Plateau royal jelly online and offline, with a total delivery value of nearly 3.8 million yuan.
The picture shows beekeepers displaying bee products on the spot.
It is reported that this live delivery activity promotes the exchange and cooperation of "enterprise+beekeeper+grower" with the help of Beijing Houdeli Bee Chain Store Network, Aauto Quicker, Taobao and other well-known domestic bee product retail enterprises, live broadcast and e-commerce platforms, and continuously distributes "Qinghai Plateau Spring Slurry Consumption Voucher" to consumers through online and offline channels. It is estimated that the total profit of enterprises in the whole year will be nearly 5.28 million yuan.
In this regard, the president of Beijing Houdeli Bee Industry Co., Ltd. believes that it is "very worthwhile": "This move can expand the popularity of Qinghai bee products, attract more consumers to understand and like bee products without adding pure natural, and drive beekeepers to increase their income."
At present, the company has signed strategic agreements on production cooperation with Qinghai Yunbee Industry Co., Ltd. and Qinghai Huabao Bee Industry Co., Ltd., aiming to jointly promote the rapid development of local bee industry in Qinghai.
The picture shows the sea of rape blossoms along Qinghai Lake.
This spring, because of the need to set up road access checkpoints for epidemic prevention and control, the beekeepers' journey of "chasing flowers and honey" was blocked, and many bees died due to missing the flowering period and lack of food, which seriously affected the beekeepers' income.
"All the year round, beekeepers travel long distances along with the flowering period, moving from Yunnan and Sichuan journey to the south to the northwest region. They have no fixed place to live, and they are very hard.
As enterprises, we have the responsibility to help them. "
Wu Na said.
"Little bees are' environmental scouts', and bees in heavily polluted areas cannot survive." Zhao Xiaochuan, executive vice president of China Bee Products Association, said that bee pollination is an important link in the ecological chain and plays an irreplaceable role in protecting plant diversity and improving the ecological environment.
At the same time, bee pollination can increase the yield and improve the quality of crops, especially in areas with wide variety and poor management conditions.
Research data show that pollination can increase the yield of rapeseed by about 15%-30%.
The picture shows Zhao Xiaochuan (right), executive vice president of China Bee Products Association, promoting Qinghai bee products.
"The economic, ecological and social benefits created by bee pollination are far greater than the value of bee products themselves. The bee industry has great potential in human health, crop production, vegetation reproduction and ecological protection, but people have always known very little about it."
Zhao Xiaochuan said.
Nowadays, the number of beekeepers is becoming less and less. Besides beekeepers who have been running around all the year round, there are still many poor households who have difficulty in moving to join the cooperative with beehives.
"The state has financial support. We contact technical personnel to help guide. Bee farmers lack understanding and judgment on the market environment. To open up sales, they also need the help and coordination of the government, enterprises and industry associations."
Zhao Xiaochuan said.
"I hope that everyone will pay more attention to and help beekeeping groups in the future," said Wu Na. "Our bee products are also screened and controlled in strict accordance with national standards to ensure quality and protect consumers' rights while helping beekeepers."

Israel regards Hezbollah in Lebanon as a major security threat for a long time, and accuses Iran of sending weapons to Hezbollah in Lebanon via the Syrian land corridor. The situation near the border between Israel and Lebanon is tense from time to time.

Liu Yunlong, the old face of spy war drama, plays a stuttering actor-Xinhuanet
Produced by Liu Yunlong, directed by Yin Fei, and starring Liu Yunlong, Su Qing, Guanhua Liang and Li Liqun, the large-scale spy war drama "Winning" landed in Guangdong Satellite TV's "Vitality Theater" at 7:30 pm on July 16th.
The play tells the story of Tang Fei (Liu Yunlong), an underground member of the Communist Party of China who lurked in the Japanese puppet police station, who joined Soviet agents to assassinate the Japanese agent leader and smash the terrible conspiracy of the Japanese army.
"Winning" is adapted from historical facts, and its material is taken from Soviet military archives which have been dusty for many years.
During the defending war in Moscow, the elite of the Far East of the Soviet Red Army rushed westward to help, while the "Northward School" of the Japanese Kwantung Army thought that there was an opportunity to send troops.
In order to solve the crisis of being attacked from both sides of the abdomen, the intelligence personnel of CPC and CPSU jointly implemented the "Mudan Ula" plan.
According to this historical background, Deng Yuan, a well-known screenwriter, has been polished several times, which makes the plot tortuous and brain-burning.
Liu Yunlong is the producer and the leading actor in Winning.
In the play, Tang Fei, played by him, is the criminal section chief of Linhe Police Department. He is a stuttering policeman who is quite happy and even a little angry. His real identity is an underground member of the Communist Party of China.
Cai Meng, the heroine who played the opposite play, is the head of Linhe Security Bureau, which is highly appreciated by Japanese boss Fukuhara. There is a subtle relationship between Cai Meng and Tang Fei, which is both enemy and friend and ambiguous.
In recent years, Su Qing has tried many different roles, from Lu Ruowen in Those Years We Are Young to Er Qing in Story of Yanxi Palace, all of which impressed the audience deeply and were recognized for their acting skills.
This time, Su Qing and Liu Yunlong are partners for the first time. The arrangement of stuttering police chief with charming policewoman is quite interesting and innovative.
In addition to the two protagonists, there are many powerful actors such as Guanhua Liang, Li Liqun, Qian Bo, Lei Han, Shen Junyi, etc., and the old drama is also one of the highlights of the drama.
It is understood that "Winning" is also very sophisticated in production, and the crew spans nearly 2,000 kilometers in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Liaoning provinces.
In order to restore the grotesque city features during the Japanese occupation period in Northeast China, the artists and props group of the crew worked day and night, carefully polishing every detail of the scene construction and props, which made the scenes in the play delicate and rich in historical texture.
Floods in western Yemen killed 16 people-Zhongxin. com.
Xinhua News Agency, Kuwait City, July 26 (Reporter Nie Yunpeng, Wang Wei) Sana 'a News: According to local media reports on the 26th, Hodeidah province and Hajj province in western Yemen suffered heavy rainfall, and floods have caused at least 16 deaths in the past 48 hours.

In addition, dozens of houses were destroyed by floods in northern Hodeidah province and southern Hajj province, and some roads and farmland were damaged to varying degrees.
The military conflict that lasted for several years caused Yemen's health system to nearly collapse.
According to the statistics of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, since 2017, the number of people infected with cholera in Yemen has exceeded 1 million, and the death toll has exceeded 2,000.
Medical institutions in Yemen are worried that the continuous flooding will lead to the cholera epidemic spreading again.
"Jedi Attack" is released. Fight the ring and dream for life-Xinhuanet
Directed by young director Gao Zhuangzhuang, the online movie Jedi Attack starring Liao William, Dong Yu, Yang Xinran and Yibo Wang was officially released in iQiyi.
The film tells the story of Venus, a down-and-out boxer, returning to the ring and fighting for dignity, showing a passionate journey of pursuing dreams.
The movie "Jedi Attack" takes Thailand as the main plot and takes "Muay Thai" as the starting point for the lonely boxing champion Venus to pursue her dream. The whole story is carried out under the adaptation of traditional Chinese cultural values. Whether Venus made up her mind to fight for Master in the early stage, or revived her efforts to fight for dignity with the support of friends and lovers in the later stage, it shows men's pursuit and great love for family and dreams in Chinese traditional culture.
Combined with the classic Hollywood sports film story mode and the strong cooperation between Chinese and Thai professional teams, "Jedi Attack" not only presents an international effect, but also will impress different audiences.
At the same time, "Jedi Attack" shows a lot of plots of fighting and training in Muay Thai, and the scenes are intense and bloody.
In the film, Zhang Xiaoliang, a game designer played by Dong Yu, helps Venus played by Liao William to return to the ring and win the crown through fighting games, which combines novel and interesting high-tech with hot-blooded competitive competitions, and also shows the brotherly friendship between Zhang Xiaoliang and Venus, which seems to be "different in Tao" but in fact has the same goal.
In addition, the long-flowing love between Venus and Jingjing is also very touching. Jingjing's silent support for Venus and Venus's firm commitment to Jingjing make the audience see Venus's "iron tenderness" and add a lot of human touch to this lonely champion.

Greenland opens a new round of mixed reform. Shanghai State-owned Assets plans to transfer 17.5% of shares-Economic Observer Network-Professional Financial News Website
On July 26th, Rao Xianjun, reporter of Economic Observer Network, Greenland Holdings (600606.SH) issued the "Prompt Announcement on State-owned Shareholders' Intention to Transfer Some Shares of the Company and Resumption of Trading by Public Solicitation of Transferees".
According to the announcement, in order to further deepen the reform of state-owned and state-owned enterprises, optimize the adjustment of the layout structure of state-owned assets, and improve the shareholding structure of Greenland, Shanghai Real Estate (Group) Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Shanghai Real Estate") and Shanghai Chengtou (Group) Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Shanghai Chengtou") intend to transfer part of the shares held by the company through public solicitation of transferees, and the total proportion of shares to be transferred shall not exceed 17.5% of the total share capital of Greenland.
The price of the shares to be transferred this time is not lower than the higher of the following two: the arithmetic average of the daily weighted average price of the first 30 trading days before the announcement date (July 27, 2020); The audited net asset value per share of the company in the latest fiscal year.
At present, the new strategic investors of Greenland are still inconclusive. According to the announcement information, it is estimated that the new strategic investors need to pay about 14 billion yuan to win the 17.5% equity transferred in the mixed reform of Greenland.
It is worth noting that after the completion of this share transfer, Greenland is expected to still have no controlling shareholder and actual controller, but the control structure may change greatly.
Since its establishment, Greenland Holdings has carried out many institutional reforms: from 1992 to 1997, it operated according to market-oriented rules under the pure state-owned system; From 1997 to 2013, establish and continuously improve the shareholding system of state-owned holding and employee stock ownership; From 2013 to 2015, strategic investors were introduced to form a mixed ownership system with cross-shareholding and mutual integration of state-owned and non-public capital; Since 2015, it has been listed as a public company.
Greenland's current mixed reform scheme is similar to Gree's. In December 2019, Zhuhai Mingjun led by Gao Yan Capital took over 15% equity of Gree Electric Appliances (000651. SZ) with RMB 41.662 billion, and Gree Group retired as a minority shareholder. After completing the mixed reform, Gree Electric Appliances implemented modern enterprise management methods such as executive incentive plan and no real controller structure.
Shanghai Real Estate and Shanghai Chengtou are state-owned enterprise groups wholly owned by Shanghai State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission. Zhang Yuliang, chairman and president of Greenland Holdings, said that Greenland's move is an important measure for Shanghai to promote the comprehensive reform of state-owned enterprises and accelerate the reform of state-owned enterprises in the new stage in accordance with the requirements of the CPC Central Committee, which fully demonstrates the new reform ideas tailored to local conditions. By introducing new outstanding strategic shareholders to listed companies, it supports enterprises to further improve the degree of marketization, enhance the freedom of operation and management, and accelerate the full release of reform vitality.

The White House consultants "bite" the States to return to work too early
On July 23rd, local time, the number of confirmed cases in Covid-19 exceeded 4 million, accounting for 30% of the global cases.
For several months, US President Trump repeatedly asked all the States in the country to return to school, and only recently did he change his attitude and take the initiative to wear masks in public. His advisers even "bite back" and said that some state governments returned to work too early.
On the 22nd, White House Presidential Advisor Kylie Conway said at a press conference that some state governments failed to comply with the standards for resuming work and restarted places like bars too early.
Conway also mentioned that the previous statement that the president has "absolute power" to decide the resumption of work in each state is a misinformed rumor.
"The president is a federalist, and he believes that every state has autonomy."
She defended Trump.
However, the "rumor" in Conway's mouth was uttered by Trump himself at the White House briefing on April 13th.
This self-bashing operation was ridiculed by netizens as "rewriting history".
Kylie Conway wants to rewrite history. She is a liar.
Trump called Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer a dictator because she followed medical standards and insisted on stopping work.
Trump wants to push back to work so that he can hold a rally.
This is not the first time Kylie Conway has caused controversy.

Is it reasonable for a 3-year-old child to sue the school after he has been smashed in the university playground?
2020-07-26 05:01:11 Source: Legal Daily Author: Wang Sishuo Editor: Wang Sishuo
The playground was smashed, and the children were compensated and then appealed to the school
□ Correspondent of this newspaper Zhao Yifan
When 3-year-old Xiaowen was playing in a university playground, he was accidentally shot in the head by Chen Mou of softball team.
After Chen Mou paid compensation, Xiaowen's father, Mr. Wen, as Xiaowen's legal representative, sued the school to the court, demanding the school where the playground happened to apologize, and paying a total of 20,000 yuan for medical expenses and mental damages.
Recently, after hearing the case, Haidian District People's Court of Beijing held that the school had set up a protective net in the playground at the time of the incident, and had fulfilled its proper security obligation, and that Chen Mou had already made compensation, so it ruled that the plaintiff's claim was rejected.
Mr. Wen claimed that during the summer vacation in 2019, he took Xiaowen to play in the school playground, when the softball team was training in the playground.
In order to avoid the risks, Xiaowen, Mr. Wen and many other children and parents are active in the safe areas designated by softball teams.
However, Chen Mou, a softball team member, dropped the ball when he threw the ball, causing the softball to fly over the protective net to the above-mentioned safe area and hit Xiaowen's back.
Mr Wen immediately took Xiaowen to the hospital for treatment and was diagnosed as head injury.
According to Mr Wen, the facilities of the school stadium do not meet the relevant safety regulations, and the team and related facilities are not effectively managed.
The school's fault led to the above incidents, which caused Xiaowen to suffer great pain physically and mentally, and also brought great pain to his family, and the school should bear legal responsibility for this.
In this regard, the school argued that the school had set up a protective net in the playground, and posted management regulations and training notices, telling that entering the playground must keep a safe distance from the training ground and remind people to pay attention to their own safety. The plaintiff could not prove that the school "failed to fulfill its security obligations", so it did not agree to compensation.
After hearing the case, the court held that the place where the incident occurred was a place open to the public free of charge by the university involved in the case. Although the school has the obligation of security for the management of the playground, this obligation of security only needs to meet the general duty of care.
At the time of the incident, the school set up a protective net in the playground, which has fulfilled its proper security obligations. In addition, Chen Mou also compensated Xiaowen for medical expenses, transportation expenses and other losses of more than 2,000 yuan according to the compensation agreement reached before, and both parties agreed to solve the dispute once.
Afterwards, Xiaowen's parents once again advocated school compensation, which was unfounded in law. The court ruled that all the plaintiff's applications were rejected.
After the verdict was pronounced, neither party appealed, and the verdict is now in effect.
According to Article 37 of China's Tort Liability Law, schools, as managers of public places, have the obligation of security; In the case that the third person's behavior causes damage to others, the third person bears tort liability, while the public place manager who fails to fulfill the security obligation should bear corresponding supplementary liability.
According to the judge, as the manager of public places, he is most likely to know the actual situation of the whole place, foresee the possible dangers and damages, and thus most likely to take necessary measures to prevent the occurrence of losses or reduce the degree of damages, and the cost of avoiding and reducing damages is the lowest, so the law stipulates that he shall bear the corresponding guarantee obligations for engaging in social activities.
In this case, for unspecified people entering the playground which is open to the public free of charge, the school's security obligation should be adapted to the social activities it engages in. Specifically, it should mainly take basic security measures and have the obligation to inform hidden dangers.
In judicial practice, it is not appropriate to impose excessive security obligations on managers of public places.
If the school has set up a protective net and fulfilled its obligation of informing, it can be concluded that the school is not at fault and should not bear legal responsibility.
In addition, even if the managers of public places such as schools fail to fulfill their security obligations, their responsibilities are also a supplement to damages. According to the newly promulgated Civil Code, managers can also claim compensation from the third party after taking supplementary responsibilities.
Therefore, in such accidents, the victim should not expand the scope of claims after receiving compensation from the direct infringer.
Under the normalization of epidemic prevention and control, people's enthusiasm for sports and fitness is soaring.
With the gradual liberalization of inter-provincial tourism business, the tourism market is about to usher in a recovery.
Fujian Province resumed the inter-provincial tourism business from July 21st, and Xiamen, as a popular tourist destination, ushered in the peak of passenger flow in the first weekend after opening up.
As a popular tourist destination city, many tourists arrive in Xiamen on weekends.
Xiamen Railway Station is expected to send 3.7 million passengers during the summer vacation, while the passenger flow at the airport is mainly students, tourists and visiting relatives.
The tourism market gradually recovered. In July, Xiamen Airport operated 440 flights daily, and domestic flights had recovered to 80% before the epidemic.
Airlines have encrypted the air express lines from Xiamen to Shanghai, Beijing, Kunming, Xi 'an and other major cities to seize the revived tourism market.
At present, many travel agencies in Xiamen have launched a batch of summer domestic inter-provincial tour products, and the team trips mainly focus on outdoor attractions.
In view of the summer passenger transport peak in railway stations and airports, relevant units have sent more staff to guide the passengers in areas where people are easy to gather, such as check-in counters and security check passages. Fujian has also optimized and upgraded the "Eight Fujian Health Codes", realizing the sharing and mutual recognition of health data with 31 provinces, and promoting the orderly recovery of the tourism market.
Can Andy Lau Liu Qingyun "tear down" a new spark-Xinhuanet
Shock Wave 2 recently announced that it will be released on December 24th, becoming the first film to be finalized for the Lunar New Year.
The second part is still directed by Qiu Litao, supervised by Andy Lau and starring in it, with a brand-new story.
It is reported that the addition of the "nuclear bomb" element in the second part also makes the challenge faced by bomb squad even more difficult. Several glimpses in the preview have already made people's hearts hang on the line. The mushroom cloud of the big explosion and the airport engulfed by flames are quite shocking.
Three years ago, Shock Wave 2, produced by the original team, won the 51st box office champion and won seven nominations at the Hong Kong Film Awards. Qiu Litao × Andy Lau also became the gold medal partner in the audience's mind.
This Shock Wave 2 also makes people look forward to whether this ace combination can spark a new spark.
Shock Wave 2 tells a brand-new story: Former bomb squad Pan Cheng Feng (Andy Lau) fainted at the scene of the bombing and was listed as a suspect by the police.
In order to find the truth, he had to ask Dong Zhuowen (Liu Qingyun), who is also a good friend of bomb squad, for help.
Pang Ling (NiNi), the female inspector who is eager to solve the case and Pan Chengfeng's ex-girlfriend, was also involved.
It's still bomb squad, but we can feel the complexity of Andy Lau's new role from the preview: he broke a leg, put on a prosthetic leg, was chased by Liu Qingyun, who is also bomb squad, and was directed by his ex-girlfriend NiNi.
What is the relationship between the three people, what did Andy Lau do in Xiangdao Hotel, what kind of cases he was involved in, and what twists and turns he experienced in his career in bomb squad, all kinds of mysteries make people curious.
It is understood that the main event of the film is to take pictures of the world landmarks in Hong Kong on the spot, and with the top special effects production team, it brings shocking and vivid visual impact.

Chongqing, July 26 (Reporter Liu Xian) The Chongqing Municipal Development and Reform Commission announced on the 26th that 4,404 fishermen have been arrested so far, accounting for 42.54% of all fishermen involved.
Li Daiguo, 53, said in an interview with Zhongxin.com that his grandparents were fishing in Longxi River. Since he was 11 years old, he has been fishing with his father, rocking a boat, going along Longxi River, going up to Liangping in Chongqing, and going down to longevity. Every time he leaves home, it takes ten days and a half months, and he depends on fishing to support his family.
However, since 1997, with the gradual influx of rural population into the town, there are more and more residents in Gao 'anchang town, and the environmental pollution is becoming more and more serious.
Paper mills, chemical plants and farms were built along the Longxi River, which also polluted the river.
By 2007 and 2008, Longxi River had become a stinking ditch.
"The scales of the fish caught are all black, and the inside is also black after being cut open."
Li Daiguo said that it is more and more difficult to fish after river pollution.
The local government began to make great efforts to control the pollution of Longxi River, including cleaning and floating, patrolling the river, and protecting and protecting aquatic resources.
Li Daiguo also retired from fishermen and became a member of the river patrol team to protect aquatic resources.
From January 1, 2020, Chongqing Aquatic Biological Reserve and related waters in the main city have been completely banned from fishing.
According to the data of Chongqing Municipal Development and Reform Commission, up to now, Chongqing has accumulated 3,403 fishing boats and 4,643 fishing boats that have signed fishing agreements, accounting for 63.3% and 86.3% of the total tasks for three years respectively.
4404 fishermen have been arrested, accounting for 42.54% of all fishermen involved.

The old-age insurance covers 2,691 people, accounting for 61.10% of the fishermen who have retired.
In the next step, Chongqing will carry out various special rectification actions in depth, accelerate the clean-up and rectification of the Yangtze River shoreline utilization project, complete a new round of census of the Yangtze River sewage outlets and carry out corresponding rectification actions, and basically complete the "three phosphates" (referring to phosphate rock, phosphorus chemical industry and phosphogypsum reservoir) rectification tasks, small hydropower clean-up and rectification work, promote the special action of afforestation and greening on both sides of the Yangtze River, strengthen the construction of green mines, consolidate the special rectification results of illegal docks and illegal sand mining in the Yangtze River mainstream, and further promote the ban on catching in the Yangtze River Basin
Israel strengthens repeated prevention and control of epidemic situation-Zhongxin.com

Israel has strengthened its repeated prevention and control of the epidemic
At the early stage of Covid-19 outbreak, Israeli prevention and control measures have achieved remarkable results.
However, with the gradual lifting of the ban on prevention and control measures, the number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Israel has increased obviously recently, and the Israeli government has taken urgent measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic.
On February 28th, the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in Israel, so that all entry and exit ports were quickly closed, non-essential industries were suspended, schools were taught online, public transportation and non-essential social activities were restricted, cities with severe epidemics were blocked, and military and police jointly maintained prevention and control measures.
This series of measures quickly achieved positive results. By mid-May, the number of newly confirmed Covid-19 cases in Israel once fell back to single digits.
With the epidemic under control, all Israeli prevention and control measures were completely unsealed. Since June, the number of newly diagnosed cases in Covid-19 has gradually rebounded.
Especially after entering July, the epidemic spread rapidly.
In recent days, there are more than 1,500 new cases in Israel every day for eight days, and as of July 25, the number of new cases reached 916 on that day.
As of July 25th, there were 59,745 confirmed cases and 448 deaths in Israel.
Facing the rapid rebound of the epidemic, the Israeli government has taken urgent measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic.
On July 6th, after the number of confirmed cases exceeded 30,000, the Israeli government closed gymnasiums, swimming pools, bars, nightclubs and other public entertainment places, and introduced a policy of restricting public transportation, stipulating that the maximum number of passengers on each bus should not exceed 20.
On the 17th, the Israeli government announced a series of new restrictive measures, including the implementation of "city closure" on weekends, which stipulated that "city closure" should be implemented from 17: 00 every Friday to 5: 00 every Sunday.
During this period, people can go out, but shops, shopping centers, barbershops, beauty salons, libraries, zoos, museums, exhibition halls, swimming pools and tourist attractions will be closed, while supermarkets, pharmacies and other basic service places will remain open.
At the same time, gatherings of more than 10 people are prohibited on all dates and time periods, gymnasiums, studios and other places will be closed, restaurants and cafes are prohibited from having meals, and only take-out services are allowed.
At the same time, the Israeli people did not pay enough attention to the severity of the epidemic and failed to form a joint force with the government in fighting the epidemic.
After repeated outbreaks in Israel, many people took to the streets to protest and March because the government's prevention and control measures affected their own economic interests.
On July 11th, tens of thousands of people held demonstrations in Tel Aviv, arguing that the anti-epidemic policy affected the economy.
On the evening of the 21st, thousands of protesters gathered in front of Prime Minister Netanyahu's residence in Jerusalem to protest against Prime Minister Netanyahu's promulgation of prevention and control measures against restaurants and coffee halls without giving corresponding compensation.
In addition, many people do not abide by the regulations of wearing masks and keeping a safe social distance of two meters when they are outdoors. In order to avoid being fined by the police for not wearing masks, many people only wear masks on their chin or hang them on their wrists.
During the repeated outbreaks, schools were the hardest hit areas in Covid-19. According to a reporter's recent visit to this kindergarten, teachers and students in the kindergarten did not wear masks as required by the government, and did not keep a safe social distance of two meters from each other, which laid a hidden danger for a large number of teachers and students to be infected with viruses.
Professor Elie Wachsman, a member of the expert advisory group of Israel's National Security Council against the epidemic, thinks that Israel is moving towards a "dangerous situation", pointing out that the epidemic prevention and control measures taken by Israel at present are not enough, and all leisure and entertainment venues and summer schools should be closed to control the further spread of the epidemic.
Wachsman said that Israel lacks an overall plan to fight the epidemic, and the parliament and government departments should abandon their respective interests as soon as possible, reach an agreement on fighting the epidemic, and formulate clear steps including relevant restrictive measures in different departments.
Tel Aviv, July 25 th, by reporter Wang Wei in Tel Aviv
Wu Fengfang, a farmer from Guyuan, Ningxia, couldn't beat his wife Dai Tianfu. Two people arrived at Liang Yun Cultural Courtyard by car from their home 20 miles away.
Despite the inconvenience of legs and feet in the past two years, Dai Tianfu, 77, is counting on "coming here every three or five times and having a trick addiction".
This is an unremarkable courtyard in Yuanzhou District of Guyuan City. Different from ordinary farmhouses, there are often melodious Qin Opera, splendid shadow play, embroidery works, traditional Qin Opera, eyebrow and Hu Opera and so on.
The owner of the compound is Liang Yun, who used to be a carpenter.
More than 10 years ago, he started planning to build a cultural compound, who loved shadow play and singing opera.
With the Liang Yun Cultural Courtyard, the cultural life of the villagers has become rich and colorful.
Before the reporter entered the Liang Yun Cultural Courtyard, the tune of Shaanxi Opera had already spread out.
Bai Lixiang, a villager from neighboring village, is singing excerpts of Qin Opera for villagers.
She loved Qin Opera since childhood, and now she is famous in the local area. Whenever she has free time, she will come to the Cultural Courtyard to perform for the villagers.
Recently, Bai Lixiang also played a live webcast.
Bai Lixiang said: "It is a very happy thing to have a stage for more people to see their performances."
On the stage, the singer is one-size-fits-all, while the player is an amateur, but his enthusiasm is undiminished.
Just like the rustic style of the farmyard, besides the Shaanxi Opera, the "grassroots" art and non-legacy culture in the Liang Yun Cultural Courtyard come to the fore.
The compound also has a collection of more than 300 agricultural tools of different ages, traditional and hand-made tiles, paper-cuts, embroidery and shadow puppets.
Liang Yun led the reporter into the exhibition hall in the courtyard, which displayed his old collection of objects, such as old hip flask, Killer, spinning wheel, etc.
Why did an ordinary farmer build a cultural compound?
"Shadow play is my family craft. I have been learning this craft since I was 15 years old."
Established in 2012, Liang Yun Cultural Courtyard has become the first rural "intangible cultural heritage exhibition hall" in Ningxia, and is also a demonstration compound for the protection of intangible cultural heritage in Guyuan City.
In addition to Liang Yun Cultural Courtyard, there are more than 120 cultural courtyards and 79 folk performance groups in Yuanzhou District of Guyuan City, among which there are more than 50 cultural courtyards with a certain scale, such as Shenjiahe Cultural Courtyard, Wang Yonghong Cultural Courtyard and Yanglang Cultural Courtyard, covering all towns and streets in Yuanzhou District, with more than 5,000 participants.
These grassroots artists are active in the fields, enriching the cultural life of the masses and meeting their spiritual needs.
"As life gets better and better, traditional culture can't be left behind."
"Liu's spy war drama" returns again, "Winning" to see Liu Yunlong Li Liqun's opponent "racing drama"-Xinhuanet
The 40-episode spy war drama "Winning" will land on Beijing Satellite TV from July 16th.
According to the real historical facts, "Winning Chance" is based on the Soviet military archives that have been dusty for many years and are first published.
Actor Liu Yunlong, who is well known to the audience for his "spy war drama", broke through his image in the drama and challenged a "stuttering agent" who is quite happy.
In recent years, the popularity of dramas such as "Pretender", "Mask" and "Kite" has proved that spy war dramas have strong vitality.
Different from previous spy war works, "Winning" looks at the world and extends the story background to the Far East battlefield of the Soviet Union.
With the final stage of War of Resistance against Japan in 1944 as the background, it tells the story of Tang Fei (Liu Yunlong), a secret intelligence worker of the Communist Party of China, who, under the leadership of the secretary of Linhe Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese underground party and the director of the Far East Intelligence Bureau of the Soviet Union, carried out the strategic action of "Mudanwula" of the Far East Intelligence Bureau of the Soviet Union.
In many spy war dramas, the hero, as a senior spy, is a perfect image of handsome, high IQ and maturity.
However, in Liu Yunlong's view, such a person is not suitable for being a spy. "A spy should be the kind of person who can't be found in a pile of people. If he comes out, he is a very handsome image. I wish everyone should pay attention to you. Can he still lurk?" There is a line in "Kite",' If you don't catch me, I forget that I am a Kuomintang', and spies are going to be elite. "
Therefore, in Winning, Liu Yunlong ingeniously designed Tang Fei, his hero, as a "stuttering agent" with a sense of joy.
The other camp in Winning is supported by Japanese Fukuhara, played by Guanhua Liang, and Fang Shibao, director of the police department, played by Li Liqun.
One south, one north and two powerful schools play bones, which add many points of view to the dramatic increase of the whole department.
Director Yin Fei used the word "drag-racing" to describe the opposite play between Li Liqun and Liu Yunlong. "It's definitely drag-racing. They have a special tacit understanding. This tacit understanding between them is very impactful to me. Many times their plays are' hanging now'. For example, we only wrote a half-page length. I don't stop when shooting, and they can continue to play. "
Masters don't rob each other of the play, and directors don't stir up the play. When the actors are in the role and guarantee their character status, they can not only shape the role from the character's point of view, but also bring more watching possibilities to the audience. Yin Fei said that such a play is brilliant enough.
In the play, you can also see many familiar faces in Liu's spy war drama. The famous and majestic "Mountain City F4" in Kite also gathered three people in Winning.
Hou Yu and Liu Mingyang, who once played Song Xiaoan and Zhao Jianzhi, once again played Tang Fei's right-hand man.
Director Yin Fei said, "There is no inferiority in these two people. They just went with the flow in that era and that environment."
Liu Yunlong also offered, "We should have a human touch. This human touch means that people around me must have good and bad, and bad people are enemies, but they must also be developed and our team must grow up. "
The ending of these two people in the play was also carefully designed by Liu Yunlong, who believed that he would give the audience a satisfactory answer.

Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, July 25-Xu Zhengyu, Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, said that Hong Kong's financial market remained active and operated in an orderly manner.
He expressed optimism about Hong Kong's financial stability and economy.
Xu Zhengyu said at an online seminar co-organized by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Toronto and the Hong Kong-Canada Chamber of Commerce (Canadian Federation) on 24th (Toronto time) that Hong Kong was experiencing a difficult situation because of the "storm of legislative amendments" and the Covid-19 outbreak.
The exchange rate of Hong Kong dollar is stable and biased towards the level of strong exchange guarantee.
There is no obvious sign of capital outflow from the banking system. On the contrary, more than $11 billion has flowed in since June.
The total deposits of banks have also increased continuously in the past few months. There have been a series of public offering fund-raising activities in the stock market, and the market turnover has increased frequently.
Xu Zhengyu said that the Covid-19 epidemic has brought pressure to the global economy and financial market, but Hong Kong's basic advantages remain unchanged.
Hong Kong has many advantages, including geography, rule of law, high-speed communication, free flow of information and capital, and simple and low tax system, which make Hong Kong a leading international financial center.
Xu Zhengyu pointed out that the SAR Government has set aside HK$ 6 billion in the "Epidemic Prevention and Control Fund", which will create about 30,000 time-limited jobs in the public and private sectors in the next two years, covering people with different skills and academic qualifications.
To support the development of financial technology, the SAR Government has also launched the "Thousand Talents Program" to subsidize local financial technology companies, start-ups and other enterprises with financial technology-related businesses, so as to create 1,000 new jobs, hire local talents and enrich Hong Kong's financial technology talent pool.
Looking ahead, Xu Zhengyu expressed optimism about Hong Kong's financial stability and economy.
He encouraged Canadian enterprises to make good use of Hong Kong's advantages and its status as an international financial center, an international asset and wealth management center and a global offshore RMB business hub, and to develop and invest in Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and nearby areas.
The The Lancet article praised China's anti-epidemic efforts and encouraged countries to learn from their experiences-Chinanews.com
The Lancet magazine published an article on the 25th, saying that China, as a country with a population of 1.4 billion and a scale similar to that of Europe or the United States, has effectively controlled the COVID-19 epidemic at the present stage, and has not spread widely again, thus largely controlling the domestic epidemic.
The article indicates that in the past decade or so, China has invested heavily in domestic research and public health construction, which makes China's preparation for COVID-19 much better than that for SARS.
According to the author, when SARS broke out in 2002, China was not prepared enough at first, especially the pathogen could not be determined.
When Covid-19 was discovered in December 2019, Chinese scientists were able to identify the virus species quickly, and shared the genome sequencing data with the international community on January 11, 2020.
By the end of January, doctors from Chinese mainland and Hong Kong had clarified the clinical features of the virus, and warned the world about the threat of Covid-19 through research papers published in The Lancet.
China has also been at the forefront of vaccine research. Under the state of emergency declared by the country, such research has been carried out very quickly and strictly through close domestic cooperation. In May and July, the results of early trials of COVID-19 vaccine developed by China were published in The Lancet respectively.
China's experience shows that it is very important to invest in the national health and research system and effectively improve the laboratory capacity.
This is the basis for the country to respond quickly and effectively to health emergencies and global health security.
Other countries, especially low-income and middle-income countries, are worth learning from.
In addition, China's experience proves that, on the basis of strong research, it is necessary to have a strong high-level and decisive scientific basis to make correct decisions, so that the COVID-19 epidemic can be effectively controlled.
The article emphasizes that the government and its leaders must respect science, understand its value, and take action against it in the most beneficial way to society.
In the early stage of the outbreak, China National Health and Construction Committee sent three groups of infectious disease experts to Wuhan to investigate the risk and spread of Covid-19, and their suggestions provided the basis for the decision to "close the city" in Wuhan on January 23; When some experts put forward the necessity and urgency of building a shelter hospital, the government quickly made a decision and implemented it quickly; At the same time, the extensive participation of the community and the masses also makes the epidemic situation quickly and effectively controlled.
Finally, the article emphasizes that countries need to strengthen global cooperation and joint response to global health emergencies.

Dapeng director The Reunions was shortlisted for Golden Goblet Awards-Xinhuanet
On July 18th, the 23rd Shanghai International Film Festival announced the official list of films selected by Golden Goblet Awards.

Photo courtesy of poster film
The film The Reunions is the first realistic work directed by Dapeng, and it is also his second connection with Golden Goblet Awards.
The film tells a story: a comedy director came back to his hometown in the northeast countryside on a whim, hoping to make a art cinema for the Chinese New Year, but he encountered a series of accidents.
The family members gathered for filming finished the final party.
In the movie poster released today, Wang Jixiang, a member of this family, sits in the middle of the picture and smokes a cigarette. The background is the northeast black land covered with silver, and the prospect is the red lantern that Chinese people must hang on holidays.
The red lantern symbolizing joy and reunion is in great contrast with the lonely Wang Jixiang, which seems to reveal the complexity and entanglement in this big family relationship.
It is reported that in the film, except for the daughter of "Three Uncle" Wang Jixiang, who is played by actor Liu Lu, all other plays are performed by the real director's family. The experimental audio-visual style of the film breaks the boundary between drama and reality, and brings the audience a new immersive viewing experience.
According to director Dapeng, The Reunions's creation originated from "an act of god". A series of sudden family changes during the filming made the original shooting plan have to be changed. Life without script was finally recorded as a film, but it released the tension beyond design.
How does director Dapeng face this "providence" and how can he continue to meet the changes brought by this providence?
There is no doubt that The Reunions is full of experiments. The almost all-round amateur lineup and innovative audio-visual style have turned the life in front of the camera into a movie. Under the package of real images, the audience will find the shadow of themselves and their families from the family presented in the film. With the end of this family gathering in the film, a series of thoughts are aroused.
NEWS.GOV.MO: Statistics of the hotline of novel coronavirus Infection Response Coordination Center (08H00 on July 25-08H00 on July 26)
From 08H00 on July 25, 2020 to 08H00 on July 26, 2020, the enquiry hotline of novel coronavirus Infection Response Coordination Center received 292 telephone enquiries.
291 inquiries about the epidemic situation have been immediately transferred to representatives of relevant departments for follow-up. The situation is as follows:
Health Bureau 271 cases (involving: inquiring about isolation; Query nucleic acid detection; Check the cards of the two places; Health code; Others. )
17 public security police stations (involving: inquiring about immigration measures; Inquire about the entry and exit measures of licensed vehicles in Guangdong and Macao; Inquire about Zhuhai government affairs hotline; Inquire about the stay of documents. )
1 case from Tourism Bureau (involving: inquiring about isolated hotels. )

1 case from the Maritime and Water Affairs Bureau (involving: asking whether Hong Kong fishing boats need to report to the Maritime and Water Affairs Bureau and related matters of nucleic acid detection when entering Hong Kong. )
At Zhuokang sentry post in Banong, platoon leader Yu Wang and a soldier stood guard on duty.
In this place where the annual average temperature is MINUS ten degrees, a row of simple barracks stands at the mountain pass, and a national flag is flying in the wind not far from the barracks. The soldiers are on duty in the wind every day, and at the same time, they need to patrol regularly at higher altitude.
The soldiers have to use both hands and feet to climb the steep slopes of rocky piles.
It was in late July, when flowers and plants flourished at low altitude. In Banong Zhuokang, only the valley behind the barracks had relatively dense green.
Gao Peng, a soldier who has been stationed at the sentinel for six years, pointed to the ravine and said that this is their back garden. Every year, only in July and August can grass grow slowly. Soon after, it turns yellow and is covered with snow.
It may take about 9 hours to patrol on foot.
Under the harsh plateau environment, the soldiers stationed here are accompanied by snow-capped mountains and glaciers all the year round, and they also regularly patrol the mountain pass at higher altitude.
A few days ago, a patrol consisting of eight soldiers, led by instructor Liang Yixin, once again took to the patrol road.
Each soldier bears about 30 kg of weight and goes to the target point early in the morning.
On the way, a soldier fought high and his comrades gave first aid.
In addition to patrol duty, the soldiers at Bangong Zhuokang sentry post have to carry out tactical and physical training every day.
Time passes by, the altitude is rising, the oxygen content is getting lower and lower, and the physical strength is constantly overdrawn. These factors test the will of patrol members.
They gritted their teeth and persisted, crossing several landslide points and several dangerous beaches one after another.
At about 16 o'clock, it was lunch time for the patrol team members. They took out their own dry food and sat on the spot at an altitude of more than 5,700 meters. With sleet, they used food to supplement their physical strength.
Soldiers at Zhuokang sentry post in Banong carry out tactical and physical training.
During the break, they will play cards together, and the losers will do push-ups, which can not only entertain but also exercise their physical fitness.
After a short rest in the cold wind, they climbed to the target point of this patrol, took out the national flag on the mountain pass and solemnly swore.
Behind them are snowy mountains, and in front of them are dozens of kilometers of no man's land. They are the safest guardians of the country.
Beijing consumption season restarts-Xinhuanet
According to the principle of "comprehensive restart, key planning, orderly advancement and strict organization", Beijing restarted all activities in Beijing consumption season.
On July 26, 1.5 million government and enterprise vouchers were issued, including 1 million offline food and beverage vouchers and 500,000 smart product vouchers, which can be collected by consumers in JD.COM APP.
Liu Meiying, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Commerce, introduced at the media briefing held on the 25th that after the restart, the consumption season will further reduce the allocation of funds by enterprises on the basis of maintaining the preferential subsidies for existing coupons and cards.
From the beginning of August, the current 1: 1 allocation of government and enterprises will be adjusted to 2: 1. For example, if consumers receive a card package and go to the store for consumption, they can enjoy the 120 yuan discount, in which the government subsidizes 60 yuan and the enterprise allows 60 yuan; After adjustment, the government subsidized 80 yuan, and enterprises made profits in 40 yuan.
During the consumption season, the three major operators will subsidize traffic and terminals around 5G consumption, and further promote Beijing's new 5G infrastructure and new 5G consumption.
Chen Maobo pointed out that Hong Kong's economy was hit by another outbreak of the epidemic, calling on all sectors to tide over the difficulties together-Zhongxin.com
China news agency, Hong Kong, July 26-Chen Maobo, Financial Secretary of the Hong Kong SAR Government, said on the 26 th that Hong Kong was facing a new wave of Covid-19 epidemic, and business contacts and economic activities that had shown signs of recovery were also hit.

He said that the number of confirmed cases in Covid-19 in Hong Kong is high and the situation is grim, which has affected the people's livelihood and plagued the economy.
When the epidemic is repeated, the first priority is to prevent imported cases and deal with and interrupt the virus transmission chain as quickly as possible; When the epidemic situation is under control, economic activities should be resumed in a timely manner.
He pointed out that in the face of a new wave of epidemic impact, business contacts and economic activities that had shown signs of recovery were also hit.
For the business sector, apart from the spirit of contract, social responsibility is equally important, especially for those groups that have received large subsidies from the government under the Employment Guarantee Scheme.
He mentioned that Hong Kong's economic situation in the second quarter of this year was still very grim, but the contraction seemed to slow down slightly.
On the export side, he believes that the external situation of Hong Kong is still grim.

China Seismological Network measured the earthquake as magnitude 5.5.
The maximum earthquakes in all parts of Taiwan are Hualien County (Level 4), Yilan County, Taitung County, Nantou County and Yunlin County (Level 3), and other counties and cities have measured earthquakes of Level 1 to 2.
According to the meteorological department of Taiwan Province, this earthquake is the largest one in Taiwan this year, and it belongs to the subduction zone at the boundary of plates. The epicentre of this earthquake often occurred in the past, and it is also active this year.
In the next week, aftershocks of magnitude 4 or above will not be ruled out.
Marinichev said that the change in value is affected by the devaluation of the ruble and the epidemic situation.
"The cost of services is increasing," he said.
Because of the epidemic, people began to spend more time on the Internet. "
Marinichev does not rule out that the Internet price will rise seriously in 2008, and thinks that operators can provide customers with higher speed and more services to offset people's dissatisfaction with the price increase.
The Doctors plans to shoot to pay tribute to anti-epidemic heroes-Xinhuanet
Recently, with the respect of Chinese filmmakers for fighting against epidemic heroes, Yu Dong, chairman of Bona Film Group, and Liu Weiqiang (pictured left), director of Bona Film Group, had a discussion and exchange with Academician Zhong Nanshan on the filming and production of anti-epidemic film The Doctors in Guangzhou.
Bona Film hopes to pay tribute to all medical and epidemic prevention workers fighting in the front line of epidemic prevention and control through The Doctors!
In 2021, the film will be released nationwide as a tribute film celebrating the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China.
At present, Bona Film Co., Ltd., under the arrangement and deployment of the Central Propaganda Department and the National Film Bureau, and with the support of the Guangdong Film Bureau and the Hubei Film Bureau, is organizing the original crew of the film The Captain to prepare for the film The Doctors, which is a film that reflects the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the people of the whole country unite as one to fight against the Covid-19 epidemic.
Focusing on the front line of anti-epidemic in Wuhan, the film will show the touching stories of Chinese medical staff who are full of dedication and sacrifice in the front line of anti-epidemic from the perspective of humanity, using unique narrative and powerful lens language.
It is understood that Bona Company overcame many difficulties at the first time on the day when Wuhan was unsealed, sent a shooting team to go deep into the epidemic front, and exchanged face-to-face information and collected information with hundreds of medical workers. At present, it has interviewed Academician Zhong Nanshan himself, Guangzhou's first aid to Wuhan, Guangdong's aid to Hubei medical team, and angels in white at the forefront of the anti-epidemic front such as Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, wuhan union hospital, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University and Wuhan Central Hospital, etc., and photographed a large number of precious first-hand videos
Academician Zhong Nanshan also put forward expectations and hopes for the filming in this symposium: "I am looking forward to it. I hope that you will not only visit some experts who have made more appearances, but also interview more medical staff who are working hard in the front line. They are the majority."
He said that he had seen The Captain in My People，My Country before and thought it was a good way to tell the story of the big pattern from the perspective of ordinary people.
"Now some foreign friends still have some misunderstandings about China."

He hopes that the film can impress the audience from the perspective of human nature: "This film is best shown in China, but also in foreign countries. It is necessary to impress the audience with a true humanistic spirit in a way that both domestic and foreign audiences can understand."
Academician Zhong Nanshan also deeply recalled the film "People to Middle Age" in the 1980 s. "After so many years, what impressed me most about the film after the reform and opening up was" People to Middle Age ".At that time, my foreign doctors and friends all cried. If The Doctors can play such a role, it would be great."
Academician Zhong Nanshan said that if The Doctors can resonate with foreign audiences, it will be very successful.
During the discussion and exchange, Academician Zhong Nanshan also shared his opinions and suggestions on the current international epidemic prevention and control. "I believe that people are always smarter than viruses."
Academician Zhong Nanshan said that although the virus is difficult to predict, since the primitive society, human beings have overcome all kinds of difficulties. Nowadays, modern society has developed medical technology and social management measures. In addition, medical staff and even ordinary people all over the world have a basic understanding of scientific response to the Covid-19 epidemic, and people will not be as passive as before. "Next, we should pay attention to two aspects of work, one is to study how to strengthen cooperation around the world, and the other is to pay attention to soothing people's hearts."

Cultural Travel "Red Fruits" Gathering in Shaoshan-The First Red Expo in Xiangtan-Today's Highlights-Hunan Daily Net-Huasheng Online
Hunan Daily New Hunan Client Reporter Jiang Rui Correspondent Shane
Jiaxing Red Boat Mould, Shaoshan Mao Zedong Bronze Statue, Yan 'an Budui Flower Crafts, Xiangxi Yongshun Bacon … On July 25th, 2020 Hunan Red Tourism Culture Festival opened in Shaoshan.
As one of the main activities, the first Red Cultural Industry Expo in Xiangtan was held in Shaoshan Global Tourism Consulting and Distribution Center.
Red cultural and creative products in the exhibition area and native products in the old revolutionary base areas are dazzling, attracting tourists from all over the world to buy them.
"This Red Expo is not only a demonstration of the achievements of the national red cultural industry, but also an important platform for exhibitors and enterprises to exchange experiences and explore development paths."
According to the relevant person in charge of the Executive Committee of Xiangtan First Red Expo, the theme of this Red Expo is "Promoting Red Culture and Boosting Cultural Travel", with a total exhibition area of nearly 3,000 square meters. There are an atmosphere building area, a scenic exhibition area and an online shopping experience area for Red Cultural Travel.
Eight provinces and cities including Jiaxing, Zhejiang, Zunyi, Guizhou and Yan 'an, Shaanxi, and 137 enterprises and units from Changsha, Zhuzhou, Yueyang and Chenzhou in our province were invited to participate in the exhibition. A total of 768 kinds of exhibits were exhibited, including red cultural relics, handicrafts, food specialties, tourist routes, red training courses and red cultural and creative products.
The exhibition area will be held until July 29th.
As the owner of the East Road of the Red Expo, Xiangtan exhibition area has many bright spots.
According to the person in charge of the exhibition area, Xiangtan exhibition area is divided into two parts: red industry and red cultural industry.
There are 31 exhibits from 6 enterprises including Valin Xianggang, Valin Cable and Xiangdian Power in the Red Industrial Zone, and nearly 200 products from 27 units including red series books, red series foods and red series cultural and creative products in the Red Cultural Industry Development Zone.
In Yan 'an exhibition area, many tourists are attracted by the handicrafts and paper-cut works of art in Chen Zhan.
Ma Dongpo, director of Yan 'an Cultural Tourism Bureau, introduced that the exhibition carefully selected Yan 'an's outstanding red cultural and creative products in recent two years, among which 16 kinds of products were outstanding works of national red cultural and creative products in 2019.

The cumulative number of confirmed cases in COVID-19 exceeds 30,000-Xinhuanet
According to statistics, there were 239 new confirmed cases in Tokyo on the 26th, and there were more than 200 new cases in a single day for six consecutive days, with a total of 11,214 cases.
In addition, there were 141 new confirmed cases in Osaka Prefecture, 90 new cases in Fukuoka Prefecture and 80 new cases in Aichi Prefecture.
In the first half of the year, telecommunication network fraud crimes rose by 70%. The highest inspection summary characteristics-Zhongxin.com
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) According to the website of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, in the first half of this year, procuratorial organs nationwide prosecuted 58,101 people for fraud, up 35% year-on-year.
In particular, fraud crimes occur frequently, and the number of fraud crimes prosecuted by procuratorial organs accounts for 43.4% of all crimes against epidemic prevention and control.
The Supreme People's Procuratorate has carried out targeted guidance. At present, among the ten typical cases involving epidemic prevention and control, there are 9 cases involving fraud.
Judging from the handling of cases by procuratorial organs in the first half of the year, there are many names of fraud crimes, ranging from national macro policies to people's food, clothing, housing and transportation, including epidemic fraud, "medical care" fraud, "health care products" fraud, "enrollment intermediary" fraud, "routine loan" fraud, defrauding state subsidy fraud, national assets thawing fraud, etc., constantly "innovating", covering education, medical care, employment, and so on
In particular, some telecommunication network frauds break through the restrictions of national boundaries, regions and personnel, and have the characteristics of stakeholder, cross-border, remote, electronic payment, etc., with many unspecified victims and great harm.
For example, some set up specialized companies, rent high-end office buildings, set up multiple departments or posts, publicize and recruit by legal network platform, train and assess recruiters, adopt enterprise operation mode management, and wear "legal cloak", which is more confusing.
It is the unshirkable responsibility of procuratorial organs to punish and prevent crimes according to law and issue early warnings to the public and relevant departments in time.
In the judicial handling of cases, the procuratorial organs conscientiously perform their duties, not only insisting on maintaining a high pressure on fraud crimes, but also refining various law enforcement measures in a targeted manner, and promoting social governance by issuing procuratorial suggestions.
Procuratorial organs strictly control the facts, evidence, procedure and application of laws in cases of arrest and prosecution of fraud, taking facts as the basis and law as the criterion, so as not to waste anything.
Especially for telecommunication network fraud, pay attention to the core role of electronic data in fact finding, and strive to build an evidence chain of mutual confirmation among electronic data, verbal evidence and documentary evidence.
For example, when the Procuratorate of Yinzhou District, Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province handled a fraud case involving an epidemic, the procuratorate intervened in advance at the first time, and it took only five days from the occurrence of the case to the completion, which reflected the attitude and determination to handle it quickly and strictly and maintain the stability of the overall social situation.
In the process of reviewing arrest and prosecution, attention was paid to the prosecution of missing criminals, and 733 people were corrected by the public security organs, and 1113 people were corrected by the public security organs.
In the first half of the year, procuratorial organs across the country issued 298 procuratorial suggestions against fraud crimes, promoting joint efforts to prevent fraud crimes and promote deep governance.
For example, in view of the loopholes found in telecommunication network supervision by telecommunication enterprises, banks, intermediary organizations, etc., Guangzhou Procuratorate and Dongguan Procuratorate of Guangdong Province put forward procuratorial suggestions in time, urging relevant units to strengthen supervision, improve mechanisms and promote the construction of long-term system.
Fourth, we should do our best to recover the damage.
Procuratorial organs all over the world seize the important links of intervening in investigation, guiding evidence collection, examining and prosecuting, etc., urge investigative organs to actively recover stolen money, cooperate with relevant departments to do a good job in recovering and recovering losses, and strive to minimize the economic losses caused by fraud crimes to the people.
For example, in the case of Lin Moumou's routine loan handled by Beijing Procuratorate, which involved 22 properties waiting to be sealed up, when the property may be disposed of in advance by other cases, it initiated the issuance of a "Suspension Letter", which was sent to the relevant court in time, and suggested that the previously sealed-up court suspend the execution of the property involved, and dispose of it uniformly after the criminal facts were ascertained, so as to make the best efforts to recover the property involved and recover the losses of the victims.
Prosecutors remind everyone that they should be very vigilant against fraud, don't expect "pie in the sky", don't believe in cheap things, and keep their own "money bags".
Yina Town, Weining County, Guizhou Province: Shorter apple trees and wider road to poverty alleviation-Zhongxin.com
2020-07-26 11:42:58 Source: China Economic Net Author: Zhu Yanjing Editor: Zhu Yanjing
Hot summer, Economic Daily-China Economic Net reporter walks into Zhonghai Village, Yina Town, Weining County, Guizhou Province.
Against the scorching sun, Li Yuanzhong, a villager, was weeding in the base. Although his face was red with sunshine, he sang a few songs in his mouth from time to time.
Weining County, where Yina Town is located, has a certain reputation in the surrounding areas because of its low latitude, high altitude, sufficient sunshine and large temperature difference between day and night. However, because of its small size and many spots, it has not been able to sell a good price and form an industrial scale.
Dina Town used to be a poor township with "covering the valley and potatoes for the spring and autumn". Ten years ago, the incidence of local poverty was as high as 25.8%.
It is extremely urgent to change the traditional planting habits, adjust the industrial structure and increase farmers' income in the critical period of getting rid of poverty and getting into decisive battle.
After many visits, Chen Chao, secretary of the Party Committee of Yina Town, and a group of people in the town thought that industrial development could no longer follow the old path.
Therefore, Yina Town introduced leading enterprises and planted apples in a modern way.
Hou Jianwen, deputy general manager of Weining Beyond Agriculture Co., Ltd., came to Yina Town from Shaanxi in 2015 for investigation, took a fancy to the local planting conditions at a glance, and planted apple trees locally from 2016.
At first, the village mobilized Li Yuanzhong to transfer the land to plant apple trees. Li Yuanzhong and his wife made a mistake in their hearts: "I have planted apples for so many years, and I have not seen who planted apples in the village to make a fortune."
"The apples planted are dwarf apples, which will not make the apple trees grow too high."
What Li Yuanzhong didn't expect was that this apple planting adopted a new method. Irrigation pipes were laid under each apple tree, and water and fertilizer were poured to the roots. When harvesting fruit in autumn, the tractor drove directly into the orchard, and the fruit could be picked when standing.
At present, the apple base has gradually entered a high-yield period, and the market is just as expected by Hou Jianwen. Apples are not to be sold, and are deeply loved by consumers in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and other cities.
The growing apple industry has brought new changes to Li Yuanzhong's life. Although farming is still in progress, there is a new source of income.
Li Yuanzhong's family has transferred more than 9 mu of land to the Apple Base. Every year, in addition to the guaranteed land transfer fee, there is also a profit dividend after hanging fruit. The couple usually work in the base. "One person can get 80 yuan every day and have a job all the year round".
Li Yuanzhong told reporters that last year's profit dividend was more than 2,800 yuan, plus the land transfer fee and the couple's income from working, and the family earned more than 80,000 yuan. "There is no need for food and clothing, and the well-off life has already passed.".
"At present, it has achieved initial results. The annual output value of 1 mu of apples exceeds 15,000 yuan, which is about 10 times that of corn."
Chen Chao told reporters that 20,000 mu of apples have been planted in the whole town of Yina, with 6,000 mu in Zhonghai Village alone, covering 4,056 households and 17,200 people, including 656 households and 2,952 poor households who set up files and set up cards. The annual salary is more than 6 million yuan, which really realizes that the base is built at the door of the house and there is no need to go out to work.
Li Yuanzhong, whose pockets are bulging day by day, has also begun to realize his "wish".
During the Lunar New Year this year, Li Yuanzhong bought an off-road vehicle. Now he drives to and from work every day. "There are still more than ten acres of land at home. When the next step is to expand the scale of the Apple base, all of them will be transferred to them, and the income will be even more."

Membrane separation technology helps to crack the "greenhouse effect"-Zhongxin.com
Membrane separation technology helps to crack the "greenhouse effect"
Schematic diagram of preparation technology of new mixed matrix membrane
Reporter Shang Rui reports: Recently, the team of atmospheric environment and bioenergy of Tianjin University made great progress on "carbon dioxide capture by membrane separation method", and successfully developed a new preparation technology of mixed matrix membrane, which greatly improved the carbon dioxide capture performance of membrane materials.
Related achievements have been published as cover articles of international journal Greenhouse Gas: Science and Technology.
"Greenhouse effect" is a major environmental problem that puzzles human development, and carbon dioxide emission is the culprit of "greenhouse effect".
How to efficiently capture and utilize carbon dioxide emitted by human beings is the focus of scientists' attention.
"Membrane separation" is a new carbon dioxide capture technology, which separates carbon dioxide gas with the help of membrane materials, and has the characteristics of high efficiency, energy saving and simple operation.
How to make membrane materials "breathe deeply" and improve the efficiency of gas separation is the bottleneck and difficulty of carbon dioxide capture by membrane separation.
The research team of Tianjin University innovated ideas and explored the influence of different solvents on membrane gas separation performance through repeated experiments.
The experimental results show that with N- methylpyrrolidone as the preparation solvent, the carbon nanotubes in the membrane material are more evenly distributed and more breathable, which effectively improves the gas separation efficiency and rate of the membrane material.
The carbon dioxide separation performance of the mixed matrix membrane prepared by this new technology is close to the theoretical upper limit of this kind of membrane material at present.
"The new technology provides a new idea for capturing carbon dioxide by membrane separation."
Li Run, a member of the atmospheric environment and bioenergy team of Tianjin University, said: "We hope that this technology can provide strong support for future coal-fired power plants and chemical enterprises to deal with flue gas and play a major role in controlling greenhouse gas emissions."
Understand what is the professional level difference before volunteering to fill in the report-Zhongxin.com

Understand what is the professional level difference before volunteering to fill in the report
Every year, students or parents do not understand the terms involved in volunteering for college entrance examination, which affects volunteering.
This year, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing University of Science and Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing Forestry University and beijing university of chemical technology jointly issued the enrollment policy in 2020, eliminating the difference in majors.
What is the meaning of professional level difference, and what is the significance in volunteering?
There are three ways of professional assignment rules
Experts remind that before filling in your volunteers, you must carefully read the Admissions Charter of your favorite school and understand the admission rules of colleges and universities, including the ratio of shifting files and the rules of professional assignment.
Professional allocation rules refer to three ways of professional admission, namely, professional priority, score priority and professional grade difference.
Which way to use in colleges and universities will be specified in the Admissions Charter.
However, there are also some colleges whose admission principle is to give priority to the total score, and there is no grade difference between majors.
That is to say, the candidates in the admission range will be queued according to the total score. When the score does not reach the first professional volunteer admission score line, it will be seen whether it has reached the second professional volunteer admission score line, and so on until the last professional volunteer is admitted. There is no grade difference between professional volunteers.
The so-called "professional grade difference" means that when colleges and universities arrange candidates' majors, they determine the admission majors of candidates who choose to apply for different majors according to one or several score values published in the enrollment charter. This score value is called "professional grade difference".
That is, the difference in scores between the first professional volunteers and the non-first professional volunteers in colleges and universities, and the differential scores among the professional volunteers, such as 3 points, 2 points, 1 point, etc.
For example.
Let's say that Xiao Ming, a student, applied for college A and scored 560 points. His professional volunteers are: computer, international trade, automation, mechanical engineering and e-commerce. The professional admission of college A adopts the method of professional grade difference. The grade difference is divided into 2 points, 1 point, 1 point and 0 point.
In the professional assignment, if Xiaoming's first professional volunteer meets the professional admission requirements and the professional has a planned balance, then Xiaoming is admitted to the "computer" major; If the computer is not accepted, his score will be deducted by 2 points, and the candidates who apply for "international trade" with the first major will be sorted according to the score of 558 points to determine whether they meet the professional admission conditions; If it is still not satisfied, the score will be deducted by 1 point (ie 557 points) for the admission of the third professional volunteer "automation"; If it is still unsatisfied, the score will be deducted by one point (i.e., 556 points) for admission to the fourth major. If the follow-up major still fails to meet its professional aspirations, it will not be deducted any more, and so on.
Different universities have different professional level differences
With the popularization of parallel volunteer, many colleges and universities have abolished the professional grade difference, but some colleges and universities still retain this method this year. According to the Admissions Charter published by each school, more than 20 universities have set up professional grade difference this year.
For example, Sichuan Agricultural University, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Heilongjiang University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Jiangxi Normal University, Chengdu Medical College, northeast dianli university, Jimei University, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing University of Technology, Ningxia University, Shandong University of Technology, China Civil Aviation Flight Academy, etc.
Among these universities, each university has different professional levels.
Some colleges and universities have grade differences in each major, such as Ningxia University, where candidates whose files have been put into the school are admitted according to the order in which candidates fill in their professional volunteers.
However, some universities have different professional grades between different majors.
Jimei University, for example, has a total score of 4 points, that is, the difference between the first professional volunteer and other professional volunteers is 3 points, and there is no difference between other professional volunteers, which is regarded as parallel volunteer, while the difference between other professional volunteers and adjustment professional volunteers is 1 point.
When filling in their volunteers, candidates and parents must carefully read the admission policies of the schools reported to see if there is any professional grade difference, and what is the form of the grade difference. While giving full consideration to the scores, they should also reasonably analyze the schools and majors to be selected. If the colleges and universities explicitly adopt the grade difference method for admission in the enrollment charter, candidates should pay attention to the gradients among the majors when choosing majors to improve their admission chances.

At present, Dongchuan District of Kunming is already hot in summer, and what is hotter than the weather is the poverty alleviation workshop next to the relocation site.
Ling Lv, an employee of Kunming Aisifu Electronic Technology Co., Ltd. said, "Now, as soon as you leave your home, you will enter the factory door to make money and take care of your family. Thanks to the free vocational skills training organized by the trade union."
Walking into the poverty alleviation workshop of electronic components processing in Tongdu Street, Dongchuan District, a busy picture with great enthusiasm came into view.
Ling Lv, who is in her forties, is a single mother, who takes care of her children and her elderly parents.
When she was in the most difficult time, Dongchuan District Federation of Trade Unions helped to give advice and find a way to "get help in the snow".
Since 2018, Lv Ling has received assistance policies such as housing, schooling, social security and employment, as well as assistance payments from trade unions at all levels.
This year, her children have successfully graduated and got employment, and she herself got a job and income after taking part in skills training, and got out of trouble at the end of April.
It is reported that Dongchuan District has organized a special skill training program to help overcome poverty, which is part of the skill training work of Yunnan Federation of Trade Unions.

With the help of local trade unions, Li Yi successfully completed her studies.
Since 2016, 3,809 households have been lifted out of poverty through institutional guarantee and precise assistance.
The success of Lv Ling's family and Li Yi in getting rid of difficulties is a microcosm of Yunnan trade unions' efforts to promote the relief of difficult workers.
According to Duan Kaiyuan, a staff member of the Legal and Rights Protection Work Department of the Yunnan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the provincial government has strengthened the dynamic management of the files of difficult employees, promoted the normalization of the filing work, and timely incorporated the difficult employees who meet the filing conditions into the assistance system; Broaden the application channels for employees with difficulties, and use WeChat to open an online filing service platform for employees with difficulties, so as to facilitate employees with difficulties to declare on their own initiative in a timely manner.
During the epidemic period, it was difficult to go out to work.

At the same time, the provincial general manager connects with various internet recruitment platforms such as human and social departments and Zhaopin recruitment, pushes recruitment information to employees in difficulty, and provides employment consulting and employment guidance services.
