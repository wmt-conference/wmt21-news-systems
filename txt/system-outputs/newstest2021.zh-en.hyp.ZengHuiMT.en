where to find talents?
Excellent returning migrant workers are an indispensable force.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 26 th. Title: building outstanding returning migrant workers into a new force for rural revitalization
Zhang Xiong, 34, lives in Guoyuan Village, Meishan City, Sichuan Province. In 2010, he quit his job in Beijing with a monthly salary of 10,000 yuan and returned home to start a business.
After several years of hard work, he now has an annual income of more than one million yuan. He has become a well-known rich leader and has been selected into the "two committees" of the village.
In recent years, inspired by a series of policies to support agriculture and benefit agriculture, such as poverty alleviation and rural revitalization, more and more outstanding migrant workers like Zhang Xiong have chosen to return home to start businesses, which has activated a pool of spring water in the countryside.
Sichuan, a province with a large population in western China and a large labor output province, has implemented the "excellent migrant workers back to the training project" according to the situation. In 2019 alone, more than 8,000 village party branch secretaries have been generated from the outstanding migrant workers who have been returned to the village, 61,000 village reserve forces and more than 20,000 party members have been developed to provide a strong guarantee for winning the fight against poverty and implementing the strategy of rural revitalization.
Whether a well-off society is not a well-off society, the key lies in the villagers.
Since the reform and opening up, a large number of young and middle-aged workers in rural areas of China have gone out to work to increase their income, and some have set up their own enterprises through hard work.
However, objectively, it also leads to the "hollowing out" of rural areas to varying degrees, especially the weakening of rural grassroots organizations. The village party branch secretaries and party members show the characteristics of "one old and one low", that is, aging, low education, the village party organization leaders are not strong and the problem is prominent.
If rural talents and other factors have been flowing to cities in one direction, and the rural areas are in a state of "blood loss" and "anemia" for a long time, revitalization is empty talk.
To attract those migrant workers who are capable, conscious and willing to serve their hometown and guide them to return to their hometown to start businesses and become rich leaders, and select them into party members and rural cadres, and enrich the grassroots cadre team. This is the fundamental solution to the problem of rural party members and grassroots party organizations.
Excellent migrant workers need to stay and do a good job.
In recent years, Sichuan has paid close attention to the party building of migrant workers, and on the basis of strict selection criteria, it has established institutional mechanisms such as directional recruitment, service guarantee, training and promotion, selection and use of outstanding migrant workers, so that they can improve their ability, have security in their work, and there is hope in their life, so that they can really take root in the countryside.
This year is the final year of the decisive fight against poverty. Talent is the key factor to make a good connection between poverty alleviation and rural revitalization.
Party committees and governments at all levels should attach great importance to the group of outstanding migrant workers who have returned to their hometown and build them into a working team and a new force that can stay, fight and cannot be taken away, so as to provide strong organizational guarantee and talent support for rural poverty alleviation and development and revitalization.
Because of the epidemic, this year's college graduates are a very special one. On the evening of July 11, bilibili summer graduation song will bring a special online live performance to the graduates. Lao Lang, Pu Shu, Li Yuchun, Mao Buyi and other musicians sent songs and wishes for the new graduates.
The well-known up master SealWu Yifan also brought a song "Wild Grass", which is a rap style song adapted from Lu Xun's collection of prose poems of the same name and is very popular among young people. It is very popular among young people.
Due to the epidemic situation, many graduates failed to experience the ceremony of picking ears and awarding degree certificates on the spot, so they transferred the sense of ceremony to the online.
Statistics show that the 2.5-hour live show has a peak popularity of more than 35 million.
"Follow your heart, seize the opportunity, do not care about the consequences, sometimes there will be unexpected gains."
Although it is a graduation song festival, many songs also move non-fresh graduates.
"I really want to cry when I look at the whole scene. Everyone's youth is full of beauty and regret, but it is worth remembering and must go on bravely."

The natural ecology of the capital continues to improve, attracting wildlife cities to "settle down"
There are more than 500 species of wild animals in Beijing
(Reporter Wang Bin) Beijing Youth Daily reporter learned from the Municipal Bureau of Landscaping that in recent years, as the natural ecological environment of the capital continues to improve, the species and number of wild animals have also continued to increase.
At present, the number of terrestrial vertebrate wild animals living in Beijing has increased to more than 500 species, including national first-class protected animals such as brown horse chicken and black stork, as well as national second-class protected animals such as impala, big swan, grey crane and mandarin duck.
Whether it is planted in the urban forests in the second ring road or the small wetlands embedded in the buildings, it not only brings the wild interest of nature to the citizens of the capital, but also attracts wild animals to "settle" in the city.
In midsummer, Songshan National Nature Reserve, located in the Yanshan Mountains in the northwest of Yanqing District, is full of vitality.
A raccoon dog was playing leisurely by the mountain stream, while two badgers were fighting each other.
Looking back, a wild boar could not resist the "scratch" on his body and was rubbing hard against the bark. According to Hu Qiaoli, director of the Management Office of Songshan National Nature Reserve, as of the end of 2019, in this green sea with a total area of more than 6,200 hectares, there are 178 species of wild animals, including the national first-class protected animal golden eagle and the national second-class protected animal spoon chicken and impala, and nearly one third of the wild animal species in the city can be found here.
"In Songshan, wild animals are the real 'masters', and our staff can only be regarded as the'bodyguards' at best."
Hu Qiaoli said that in order to understand the situation of wild animals and plants in the reserve on the spot, more than 30 professional patrol members patrol along 16 carefully formulated protection routes every day, and there will be a "big circle" every month and spend a whole day walking almost all over the reserve.
"During inspections, we should not only check and record biodiversity, but also check and install artificial bird nests, rescue injured wild animals, install field infrared cameras and so on."
More than 200 infrared cameras have been installed in Songshan National Nature Reserve to record the living conditions of wild animals in the forest.
Hu Qiaoli introduced that with the increasing biodiversity of the reserve in recent years, more and more wild animals have appeared in the camera, leopard cats, raccoon dogs and pig badgers have become "resident guests", and the "appearance rate" of the national second-class protected animals is also getting higher and higher.
According to Zhang Zhiming, director of the wildlife and wetland protection department of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Landscaping, the number of terrestrial vertebrate wild animals in Beijing has increased from 461 in 1994 to more than 500 now, and the number of wild animals in Beijing has continued to increase in recent years.
The appearance of wild animals in cities is becoming more and more common in recent years, which is closely related to the continuous upgrading of the capital urban greening in recent years.
In particular, the new round of afforestation and greening construction of one million mu started in 2018 proposes to reshape the urban ecological environment, enhance the ecological function of woodland and green space, and highlight the concept of "near nature".
The planning strives to achieve interconnection and interaction with the surrounding green space, so as to facilitate wild animals to "visit relatives and friends". The trees planted are also the nectar and food plants that animals love.
Black soil "plants" agricultural modernization
Harbin, July 26, Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 26, Title: black land "planting" agricultural modernization
In midsummer, two pesticide spraying planes passed over the 10,000-mu high-yield demonstration field in the second operation station of the fifth management area of Friendship Farm, forming two white lines. In the green field, the characters "the first field in the world" planted with black rice seedlings were particularly eye-catching.
Kong Lingqiang, director of the operation station, said that this kind of aircraft can spray chemicals on more than 6,000 mu of cultivated land a day, and the efficiency is about 8 times that of drone and hundreds of times that of manual work.
This farm is located in Youyi County of Heilongjiang Province, the largest grain-producing province in China. From the sound of rice cutting in the past to the sound of motors in the past, traditional Chinese farming and farms have changed in this black soil belt.
In addition to airplanes, satellites are also used in modern agricultural production of Friendship Farm.
Kong Lingqiang introduced that on the one hand, they use satellite remote sensing technology to achieve precise fertilization, reduce agricultural input and reduce pollution; On the other hand, satellite navigation technology can improve the standard operation level of agricultural machinery in the field.
In the process of rice production this year, the farm expanded the operation area of satellite navigation unmanned rice transplanting technology from 3,000 mu last year to 30,000 mu.
This technology can make the planting of seedlings more uniform, minimize the utilization of sunlight and arable land resources, and save 16 yuan in labor costs per mu.
The farm tried new technologies such as informatization and intelligence in agricultural production, and formed the largest agricultural machinery group in China from the ground to the sky.
According to statistics, the total number of farm machinery is 49,00, and the comprehensive mechanization rate in the field reaches 99.8%.
In agricultural machinery operation, 100% GPS satellite navigation, 100%.
"Green agriculture, smart agriculture and digital agriculture are the direction of agricultural modernization."
Liu Hualian.
The key to agricultural modernization lies in scientific and technological progress.
In recent years, Heilongjiang Agricultural reclamation, represented by farms, has played a demonstration and leading role in modern agriculture, and initially established a modern agricultural industrial system dominated by large-scale planting, standardized production and industrialized management.
In the suburb of Youyi County, there is an agricultural machinery Expo Park covering an area of 350,000 square meters.
More than 140 agricultural machinery and tools introduced and used by Heilongjiang Agricultural Reclamation over the years are on display here.
These agricultural machinery and farms have witnessed the development of agricultural modernization in China.
give up a small family for everyone
Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, July 26 (Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, July 26 th. Title: give up a small family for everyone-the mass transfer of Jiangkou River Lianwei in Hefei, Anhui Province
Xinhua News Agency reporters Chen Shangying, Wang Liwu and Liu Xiacun
At about 4 pm on July 25, Fu Kunbao was wearing rubber shoes covered with mud and went from the front room to the back room, busy packing things back and forth with his wife Zhou Yan.
"After receiving a call from the village cadre to transfer, I was still weeding in the field."
Fu Kunbao said that he has transferred more than 60 mu of land and planted rice. Now he is growing well."I took medicine yesterday, and the tools have not been cleaned yet."
Fu Kunbao pointed to the pesticide sprayer placed in the corner."No one wants their home to be flooded, give up a small home for everyone."
In order to cope with the continuous high water level pressure and possible heavy rainfall in Chaohu Lake, Hefei City, Anhui Province, plans to use the Jiangkou River Lianwei where Fu Kunbao's family is located on the 26 th.
Jiangkou River Lianwei is located in Feixi County, close to the Chaohu levee.
There are thousands of villagers involved in Yandian Township and Sanhe Township who need to be transferred.
As of 16:00 on the 25 th, the water level of Chaohu Lake, the fifth largest freshwater lake in China, remained at a high level of 13.2 meters, 0.7 meters above the guaranteed water level.
Fu Kunbao's kitchen is clean, with a pot of pumpkin head vegetables on the table and eggs and some salt vegetables in the refrigerator.
"I did not expect to move it. The water in Jiangkou River looks good at the moment ."
Zhou Yan said that the home is a bungalow, and some big things have not yet decided where to put them.
"When you clean up your valuables first. Large items such as refrigerators and TV sets can be temporarily put in the high-ground neighbors or relatives."
Wang Liwen, a village cadre, gave Fu Kunbao advice.
Wang Liwen was responsible for the transfer and resettlement of 13 villagers, and informed each household to confirm their resettlement plan.
The nearest resettlement site to Fu Kunbao's home is Su Xiao primary school in Yandian Township, about 2 kilometers away.
In addition to the big items, Fu Kunbao and his wife also have a headache with more than 1,000 kilograms of grain and some newly bought furniture.
"The food is ready to be trailed to relatives."
As soon as the couple discuss, they put a stool under the newly bought bed and raised the bed by about half a meter.
At 6 in the afternoon, Fu Kunbao began to use a tricycle to transport things to relatives, and Zhou Yan continued to clean up at home.
After 11:00 in the evening, the couple went back and forth at home, turned on the switch, and prepared to go to the resettlement site.

Zhang Jike Lin Xiaozhai team up to support the muscular youth
"Sports Boys" officially landed on Hunan Satellite TV on July 11.
Zhang Jike, the sports leader, and Lin Xiaozhai, the sports assistant. Lin Dan and Fu Yuanhui commented on their own styles, and the hard core of the "monster" like a power pulling device makes the program "burning" full of power.
In the first episode, 11 sports teenagers appeared on the power track, and their appearance surprised the audience. At the same time, the "strong conflict", "strong confrontation" and "strong heart" on the stage also attracted attention.
Among them, the "strong conflict" comes from the super A sports student Qiao Wenyi. He openly challenged Xu Zhibin, who is known as the "beautiful man" on the track before the race. He choked that Xu Zhibin's appearance conditions should go to singing and dancing, and even released the "lose".
Some remarks made the teenagers and sports leaders on the field take a breath.
The "strong confrontation" is more like a fairy fighting. Sun Jianqi, known as the "big devil", met with Zhang Xindong, who is also strong, and staged a strong confrontation.
And their identity is also unexpected. Sun Jianqi is an actor who loves fitness, while Zhang Xindong is a retired special combat member and three time warrior medal winner.
At the beginning of the competition, the two teenagers tried their best to pull out the small pole quickly. The lasting confrontation on the big pole made the audience sweat for them.
In the tense competition, Zhang Jike, as one of the sports leaders of "Sports Boys", also watched the game seriously.
In the comment session, he was also very careful, patiently encouraged the teenager who lost the game, and helped every mistake point in the process of resuming the game.
Lin Xiaozhai, a sports assistant, is a fancy assist. She makes no secret of her appreciation of the teenagers who are on the line.
When I learned about the overloaded daily training of sports teenagers, it was even more admiration.
Lin Dan and Fu Yuanhui, who are also sports leaders, have their own styles. One is a calm "prophet" and the other is a "absurd girl" who dispels the tense atmosphere with a smile.
In addition, Jike Junyi and Liu Ye, as sports assistants, also created a lot of hilarious topics around sports teenagers.
Church fire in Nantes, France: parish volunteers admit to arson
China News Agency, July 26. According to foreign media reports, on July 18, the famous St. Peter's and St. Paulo Cathedral in Nantes, France, was seriously damaged in a fire and the organ was completely destroyed.
On the 26th local time in Nantes announced that a parish volunteer who was responsible for security in the cathedral had been charged with "arson and destruction".
He has admitted that he set the fire in the church.
According to the report, the local prosecutor Senas said that the 39-year-old parish volunteer from Rwanda admitted that he had set fire in three places in the cathedral at night .
The lawyer of the person said that the arsonists now regret doing such a thing.
A few years ago, this person entered France through the way of refuge and was sheltered in the parish where the fire occurred and taken in in the church.
Prosecutors pointed out that recently, he tried to renew his visa and was in dialogue with the police.
But the church said it still could not believe that this normally very kind, smiling but quiet believer would destroy the church he loved so much.
On the day of the fire on July 18, the volunteer had already been questioned and investigated by the police because of the illogical problems in the narration, but he was later released.
The picture shows firefighters rescue at the scene.
On the evening of the 25 th, this person was summoned again because professional engineers from the laboratory of the Central Police Department in Paris obtained new evidence.
This time, the man admitted his arson.
According to reports, if convicted of arson, the suspect may face 10 years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros.
According to the report, the fire caused serious damage to St. Pierre and St. Paulo Cathedral. The organ in the church was completely destroyed and the stained glass window behind the organ was also seriously damaged.
Brunet, chief architect of historic buildings in France, believes that it will take at least three years for the restoration of Nantes.
Comprehensive news: US unilateralism undermines relations between the two countries. International public opinion supports China's countermeasures against the US
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26 (Xinhua News Agency reported that on the morning of July 24, the Chinese Foreign Ministry informed the US Embassy in China that China had decided to revoke the permission for the establishment and operation of the US Consulate General in Chengdu and put forward specific requirements for the Consulate General to suspend all business and activities.
International public opinion believes that the unilateralism measures taken by the United States have caused serious problems to bilateral relations, and it is legitimate and necessary for China to respond to the unreasonable provocations of the United States and take countermeasures.
Andres Borquez, director of the Center for Chinese Studies at the Institute of International Studies at the University of Chile, said that the unilateral measures of the United States have destroyed the bridge of understanding between the Chinese and American peoples and caused a crisis in the relations between the two major powers.
Chinese notification to the United States to close its Consulate General in Chengdu is a countermeasure to unilateral measures taken by the United States and is in line with diplomatic practice.
Patricio Giusto, a professor at the Catholic University of Argentina and director of the Arab-Chinese Research Center, believes that the above decision of China is a legitimate and necessary countermeasure against the previous provocation of the United States, not against ordinary Americans.
The United States tried to cover up its ineffective response to COVID-19 and divert the attention of the American people.
Bambang Suryono, chairman of the Asian Innovation Research Center, an Indonesian think tank, said that the provocative diplomatic stance taken by the United States has caused serious problems to bilateral relations, and the relations between the two countries are facing severe challenges.
China's notification to the United States to close its Consulate General in Chengdu is a normal countermeasure, which is in line with diplomatic practice. It not only reflects China's principled position of resolutely safeguarding its own interests, but also reflects the rationality of Chinese diplomacy.
Francis Semwenza, a commentator on current affairs in Tanzania, said that China's decision is a legitimate and necessary response to the provocation of the United States.
For China and the United States to return to normal, the US side should take the initiative to improve its relations with China and stop interfering in its internal affairs.
The United States should focus on how to achieve win-win economic and political results with China and how to benefit the two peoples and the entire international community.
Ali Yusuf, executive director of the Federation of Arab-Chinese Friendship Association based in Sudan, said that the countermeasures China was forced to take are a legitimate and necessary response to the unreasonable actions of the US side, which is in line with international law and the basic norms of international relations, as well as diplomatic practice.
Earlier, the US request to close the Chinese Consulate General in Houston seriously violated international law and the basic norms of international relations.
It is hoped that the US side will revoke the previous decision and create necessary conditions for the return of bilateral relations to normal.
Singapore Lianhe Zaobao published an editorial saying that the greater strategic intention of the United States is to contain China and prevent China from continuing to rise.
In the face of the pressure of the United States step by step, although China is very reluctant to see Sino-US relations continue to deteriorate, it has to take countermeasures.

Poland will withdraw from European treaty to prevent violence against women
Poland will take steps next week to withdraw from the European Treaty on the Prevention of Violence against Wom
Polish right-wing government cabinet said the treaty required schools to teach students about gender issues and violated the rights of parents.
Polish Justice Minister Gioblo held a press conference and said that his Ministry of Justice will ask the Ministry of labor and family to start withdrawing from the treaty on Monday.
That treaty is also known as the Istanbul Convention.
"The treaty contains some elements that we think are harmful."
Polish ruling Law and Justice Party and its coalition partners have a close alliance with the Roman Catholic Church and promote a conservative social agenda.
Polish President Duda made hostility to gay rights one of the main issues during his successful re-election campaign this month.
On Friday, thousands of Poles, most of them women, protested against withdrawing from the Convention in Warsaw and other cities.
"The purpose of withdrawing from the treaty is to legalize domestic violence."
Some protesters held banners that said "Law and Justice Party is a hell for women".
The Law and Justice Party has long complained about the Istanbul Convention.
Poland's previous centrist government ratified the Convention in 2015.
The Law and Justice Party government says the treaty does not respect religion and requires liberal social policies to be taught in schools.
But so far the party has not decided to withdraw from the Convention.

FAA urgently ordered 2,000 Boeing airliners
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an emergency airworthiness directive on the 24 th, requiring an emergency inspection of about 2,000 Boeing 737NG and 737Classic aircraft registered in the United States. The reason is that the corrosion of the air check valves of the aircraft may cause the engine to stop in the air.
The FAA said that it has received four reports of engine parking of the 737NG and 737Classic passenger aircraft so far, so it has made an emergency inspection request. The inspection targets are passenger aircraft that have been parked for 7 days or more and those that have been flying less than 11 times since they have been put into flight again.
The FAA warned that if the level 5 check valves of all two engines of the passenger plane are corroded, they may become stuck in the open position, causing the passenger plane to completely lose power and unable to restart the engine.
The aviation regulator ordered that once the check valve is found to be corroded, the aviation operator must replace this key component before the passenger plane is put into use again.
Boeing responded later in the day that the outbreak of COVID-19 led to lower travel demand, and many passenger aircraft were sealed or used less."check valves are more likely to be corroded."
Boeing also said that it has advised aviation operators to inspect the aircraft involved in the directive and if problems are found, Boeing will provide assistance in repairing and replacing check valves.
The Associated Press reported that the major US airline operators usually fly many times in a day, but after the outbreak of COVID-19, a large number of aircraft were grounded; With the slow growth of passenger travel demand recently, some passenger aircraft have been put into operation again.
The FAA did not release the details of the four air parking reports.
Alaska Airlines disclosed one of the incidents later on the 24 th.
The airline said in a statement that one of its passenger planes was on the way from Seattle, Washington, to Austin, Texas on July 15, when an engine suddenly stalled and the passenger plane finally made an emergency landing at Austin Airport.
Alaska Airlines said it had replaced the engine of the passenger plane and had inspected the engines of six airliners in accordance with FAA instructions.
American Airlines, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines each said on the 24th that there was no engine stuttering associated with air check valves on their airliners.
Four American Airlines will be inspected, and 28 United Airlines will be inspected.
Delta said it would inspect its 20 passenger planes, but did not say whether there had been engine stalls.
Many media reported that the FAA's emergency airworthiness directive is another impact on Boeing.
A Boeing 737MAX passenger plane of Indonesian Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashed in October 2018 and March 2019 respectively, killing a total of 346 people.
This series of passenger planes were subsequently grounded around the world, stopped production in January this year and resumed production in May.
FAA director Steve Dixon admitted in June that the FAA had "made a mistake" in its supervision of Boeing for the 737MAX airliner.

Often fill the history of the party and the new China
2020-07-2617:37:29 Source: People's Forum Author: Zhu Yanjing Editor: Zhu Yanjing
Recently, General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized when visiting the Siping Battle Memorial Hall: "We must let 1.4 billion people and more than 90 million party members, especially leading cadres at all levels, learn the history of the Communist Party of China and the history of New China well."
To conscientiously study the history of the Party and the history of New China is a required course for Party members and cadres to not forget their original intention and keep in mind their mission. They should draw rich nourishment from it, cultivate the feelings of family and country, and take the Long March in the new era.
A magnificent history of the Party and the history of New China records the hard struggle and glorious course of the Communist Party of China since its birth, and shows the faith and loyalty forged by the Communists with their lives and blood, and the original intention and mission that they will always stick to it.
History is the best textbook. For Party members and cadres, party history and the history of New China are the most brilliant chapters in this textbook.
Every party member and cadre should constantly strengthen the historical thinking of taking history as a mirror and moving towards the future, based on the new journey and new mission, take the "baton" of the times, and walk the long march of contemporary people.
Cast the soul with history, and stick to the original mission in studying the history of the Party and the history of New China.
The history of the Party and the history of New China is full of the eternal original mission of the Chinese Communists, and the rock-solid belief of the Chinese Communists, which shows the simple feelings of the Communists who will always be with the people.
To understand the important events, important meetings and important figures in the history of the Party and New China up close is not only an intuitive spiritual shock and ideological baptism, but also a deep understanding of the connotation of the original belief and the weight of the mission.
For party members and cadres, if they want to constantly sharpen their original mission and maintain their advanced nature, they must find the starting point and the fulcrum of our original intention from the history of the party and the history of New China, maintain a clear understanding and a firm stand, stir up the strength of fighting bravely for the country and the people, and ensure that the Red River that the revolutionary ancestors laid down with their blood and life will be passed on from generation to generation.
It is wise to study history and inherit the lofty spirit in learning the history of the Party and the history of New China.
Since the founding of the Communist Party of China, it has successively shaped a series of great spirits such as the Red Boat Spirit, the Jinggangshan Spirit, the Long March Spirit, the Yan'an Spirit, the Anti-Japanese War Spirit, the Xibaipo Spirit, the "Two Bombs and One Star" Spirit, and the Space Spirit.
These great spirits precipitated by history have provided a strong spiritual incentive for our party to overcome various risks and challenges on the way forward. It is a precious spiritual wealth that cannot be beaten down, washed away and taken away.
The process of studying Party history and Chinese history is the process of reviewing these spirits and shaping self-spirit. We should consciously take the lofty spirit of the revolutionary ancestors as a mirror, stick to the spiritual home of the Communists, build a solid spiritual foundation for advancing the great cause and realizing the great dream, inherit and carry forward these spirits, and glow with the light of the new era.
Reading history and introspective in the study of the history of the Party and the history of New China.
For Party members and cadres, there has never been any period of history that can bring more profound warning, enlightenment and reference than the history of the Party and the history of New China.
In the history of the party and the history of New China, we can not only see the great deeds of the older generation of revolutionaries who are determined to devote themselves to their beliefs and persevere in striving to achieve the set goals, but also see the profound lessons of some figures who have gone to the opposite side of the revolutionary because of their ideals and beliefs, which enlighten and warn us with firm determination and will to never stagnate and never slack, always maintain a full and tenacious fighting spirit, and constantly purify the party spirit and cultivate self-discipline.
If you want to truly become a firm believer of the lofty ideal of communism, you need to brush off the ideological "dust" and guard against the "dirt" to pick up your body. The history of the Party and the history of New China should be the basis for every party member and cadre to examine and warn themselves.
Know the history is inspirational, and bravely take the important task of the times in studying the history of the Party and the history of New China.
General Secretary Xi Jinping once pointed out that "the study of the history of the Party and the history of the country is a required course to adhere to and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics and push forward the various undertakings of the party and the country."
Looking back at history and asking about the original intention in order to continue to be glorious and move towards the future.
Every party member and cadre should take the study of the history of the party and the history of New China as a lifelong pursuit, constantly set the course of life in the study, and bravely assume the historical mission, dare to take responsibility, and take the initiative in their respective posts.
Adhere to the reference and guidance of the advanced deeds of the older generation of revolutionaries, constantly polish the political nature of the Communists, maintain the struggle attitude of seizing the day and making every effort and the fighting spirit of the more difficult and dangerous we are in the great journey of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation
Seizing the Poetic "Yellow River Dream"
(Story of Poverty Reduction in China
China News Agency, Yinchuan, July 26 (Yang Di) "Jiuqu Yellow River is thousands of miles of sand, and the waves and wind are from the end of the world."
The Yellow River, which aroused the lofty feelings of countless scholars, gave birth to the beautiful and rich Ningxia Plain. Now, Ningxia, which has the reputation of "blocking the south of the Yangtze River", is adhering to the concept of "ecological priority and green development" and pursuing the poetic "Yellow River Dream".
River beautiful "blue waves dream"
"The Yellow River in the world is rich in Ningxia". The Yellow River flows through Ningxia for 397 kilometers and is the "mother river" that nurtures one side.
However, with the rapid advancement of industrialization and urbanization, the development, utilization, management and protection of rivers and lakes are out of balance, and chaos such as excessive sewage discharge, reclamation of lakes and encroachment of water areas are emerged, resulting in black and smelly water, excessive water quality, dirty environment, and ecological degradation.
Now, Ningxia is promoting the restoration of water ecology and striving to make the Yellow River beautiful and clear.
Water control should start from the source.
In Yinchuan, Ningxia, the local government adopted the method of "raising standards+pollution control+strict management". All sewage in the industrial park was treated in a centralized manner. All the urban sewage treatment plants were discharged according to the first class A standard, the black and odorous water bodies in the urban built-up areas were basically eliminated, and the third batch of Chinese black and odorous water demonstration cities were successfully declared.
In addition, Ningxia fully implemented the river and lake chief system in 2017, and now it has achieved full coverage of the five-level responsibility system of river and lake leaders in districts, cities, counties and villages.
64-year-old Gu Jincheng lives in a village near the Yellow River. He has witnessed the changes of the Yellow River: "The water used to have a bad smell, but after treatment, the smell is gone."
Gu Jincheng said that the ecological environment is better and his life is more comfortable. Now he often goes for a walk along the Yellow River with his family to feel the clear water and blue sky.
"Wetland Dream"
Birds, green trees, plank roads and clear water... The beautiful scenery of Fan Zhongyan's "Sand Ou Xiangji" has become a reality in the Yellow River Wetland Park in Yinchuan, Ningxia.
The Yellow River flows through Ningxia, forming many kinds of wetlands such as river wetlands, lake wetlands and swamp wetlands along the way, which play an important role in promoting the rational utilization of water resources and water ecological balance, and also become an important international migration channel for birds.
Since 2009, relevant departments in Ningxia have invested about 3.45 billion yuan in wetland protection projects. At present, Yinchuan wetland covers an area of 19,200 hectares, with a wetland protection rate of 78.5%. There are nearly 200 natural lakes and marshes, including 5 national wetland parks, 1 national urban wetland park, 6 autonomous regional wetland parks and 8 municipal parks.
Lu Jinhu, deputy director of Yinchuan Wetland Protection Center, told reporters that wetland protection has increased biodiversity, especially in birds."Relict gull is an endangered bird. There are only more than 20,000 in the world, of which there are more than 2,000 in Yinchuan Wetland."
At the same time, Ningxia has set a red line of 500 meters for the wetland protection area on both sides of the Yinchuan section of the Yellow River in accordance with the law, stipulating that except for public welfare projects, no unit and individual is allowed to conduct development, construction and business activities within the protection area.
Zhao Shaoyong, deputy director of Yinchuan Water Conservancy Service Center, said that through pollution source treatment, comprehensive improvement of river and lake ecology and terminal wetland construction, now the water quality of nine main drainage ditches in Ningxia has reached 100% of class IV standard, "now the water is clear, the fish are swimming, and the flowers are blooming."
"Drinking Water Dream"
Yinchuan City in Ningxia used to have a "embarrassing" title: the only city along the Yellow River "guarding the Yellow River and lacks water to drink".
Since 2010, Yinchuan City has begun to face the problem of water shortage in the peak of summer . The pain of water shortage in the past ten years has become a painful experience for many high-rise residents in the summer, but under the current situation that the major water sources are in the limit of overdraft and the urban underground has formed a large area of groundwater overdraft funnel area, water shortage has become a problem in Yinchuan City.
Thanks to the improvement of the water quality of the Yellow River, drinking purified Yellow River water has become a good way to solve the drinking water problem of local residents.
Ding ming, deputy director of Yinchuan Municipal Water Affairs Bureau, said that in order to improve the living and production water demand of Yinchuan urban and rural residents in Yinchuan, Ningxia timely started the water supply project of the western line of urban and rural areas in Yinchuan, replacing the original underground water source with high-quality Yellow River water.
"On December 29, 2019, the water supply project officially supplied water to the three districts of Yinchuan City. In 2020, residents of Minning Town and Helan County will also drink the Yellow River water."
Ding Ming said that Yinchuan Water Conservancy Department will consider the transformation of the integration of regional rural drinking water and urban water supply."In the next step, we will integrate all the scattered water supply points in rural areas into the western water supply project, and it is expected to basically realize the integration of urban and rural water supply in Yinchuan area by the end of this year."

For the first time, the United States launched a countervailing investigation against China with "undervalued RMB exchange rate"
For the US Department of Commerce recently announced that it has decided to launch an anti-dumping and countervailing investigation on Chinese stronghold products, and launched an investigation on the "undervalued RMB exchange rate" project.
Chinese Ministry of Commerce pointed out that this is the first time that the United States has filed an investigation into the so-called "undervalued RMB exchange rate" project in a countervailing case, and China firmly opposes this.
China's Ministry of Commerce issued a special press release on the evening of the 23 rd, saying that China implements a managed floating exchange rate system based on market supply and demand, with reference to a basket of currencies, and the market plays a decisive role in the formation of the exchange rate.
The press release stressed that on the whole, the RMB exchange rate is at a reasonable and balanced level and has not been undervalued.
Since 2005, the RMB has appreciated by more than 17% against the US dollar.
According to the data released by the Bank of International Settlements, from the beginning of 2005 to May 2020, the nominal effective exchange rate of RMB appreciated by 38% and the real effective exchange rate appreciated by 49%. It is the strongest currency in the G20 economies and one of the currencies with the largest appreciation in the world.
The Ministry of Commerce pointed out that the exchange rate issue is beyond the authority of members to conduct countervailing investigations in accordance with WTO rules.
In February this year, the United States amended its laws and regulations to conduct countervailing investigations on the exchange rates of other countries. It has been suspected of violating WTO rules and has been opposed by many parties.
According to the press release, even in accordance with U.S. regulations, there are a large number of errors in the content of the applicants, and they do not have the necessary elements of countervailing such as financial assistance, grant of benefits and specificity.
China urges the US to abide by existing international rules and stop conducting countervailing investigations into the so-called "undervalued RMB exchange rate".
Affected by the further rising tension between China
Whether the U.S. Department of Commerce move is intended to push up the RMB is worth attention.
The spot exchange rate of the RMB against the US dollar rose above the 7.0 mark on the 23rd to close at 6.9961.
The official central parity rate of the RMB against the US dollar was lowered by 17 basis points to 6.9938 on the 24 th.

Lewis family: John Lewis is a fighter "fighting for the weakest"
John Lewis, a US congressman and civil rights fighter, was remembered as a soldier "fighting for the weakest" at a memorial service held for him on Saturday (July 25).
Lewis's public memorial service has been held in Alabama since Saturday.
There were two memorial services on the first day.
At a public memorial service at the University of Troy in Alabama on Saturday, Lewis's five brothers and sisters and a nephew spoke of him as a loving, terrible, family oriented man.
Henry "Grant" Lewis, Lewis" his youngest brother, said at the meeting that "he devoted his life to helping others."
Samuel Lewis said that his mother had warned John "do not get into trouble, do not get into trouble."
He added that John did not listen to his mother warning. He said: "We all know that John always gets into trouble, always getting into trouble, but that is because he insisted on the right thing, that is a good trouble."
Lewis's brothers and sisters reminded people at the memorial service that John's most famous argument is to create "good trouble", that is, as long as it is for the sake of justice, it is not taboto stir up trouble.
John applied to Troy University in Troy, Alabama, where he was born, but Troy University, an all-white school at that time, rejected his application.
John Lewis, who preached the gospel to chickens on his farm as a child, eventually received a degree in religion and philosophy from Fisk University.
Years later, Troy University awarded Lewis an honorary doctorate.
Senator Doug Jones from Alabama said that the current protesters are "protesting peacefully and non-violently," just as Lewis did in the civil rights movement.
Jones said: "Even if President Trump turned over a boat of people with a pole and described all the protesters as thugs, he was wrong.
The protesters are patriots who want the United States to move towards a more equal country."
A six-day series of events in memory of Lewis will culminate this week at a funeral in Georgia .
Lewis's coffin was parked at a public memorial service at Troy University on Saturday, and people came to pay tribute to the civil rights pioneer.

On Sunday, Lewis's body will pass the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma.
In 1965, he was beaten by Alabama police in front of the bridge, and the police also used tear gas to the protesters.
Lewis was almost killed.
This day will be called "Bloody Sunday".
Lewis's body will be transported to Montgomery, the capital of Alabama.
Mayor Steven Reed encouraged people to line up on the sidewalk to complete the final journey with Lewis.
At the same time, officials asked the public to wear masks and maintain social distance when participating in activities.
Alabama Governor Kay Ivey ordered flags to be lowered at half mast on Saturday and Sunday to commemorate Lewis.
During the nearly week of commemoration, Lewis's body will be placed in the Alabama Capitol in Montgomery, the Georgia Capitol in Atlanta, and the U.S. Capitol in Washington for public mourning.
Nancy Pelosi, chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives, and Mitch McConnell, majority leader of the Senate, announced last week that people can go to the U.S. Capitol on Monday and Tuesday to pay tribute to Lewis.

Tibetan antelope in Hoh Xil enters migration season
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, July 25 (Reporter Wang Jinjin) The reporter learned from the Wudaoliang Protection Station of the Hoh Xil Management Office of the Sanjiangyuan National Park Management Bureau that monitoring showed that Tibetan antelopes who had migrated to Zhuonai Lake area in the hinterland of Hoh Xil to give birth one after another and began to return to their original habitat.
Monitoring images near the Wudaoliang Protection Station show that on July 25, about 40 female Tibetan antelopes led three young Tibetan antelopes through the 3,002 kilometers along the Qinghai-Tibet highway and the Wudaoliang North Bridge on the Qinghai-Tibet Railway. Tibetan antelopes have begun to move back.
According to expert analysis, in recent years, the number of Tibetan antelope cubs in the relocated flock accounts for one fourth to one fifth of the total number of Tibetan antelope colony.
Lian Xinming, an associate researcher at the Northwest Plateau Institute of Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, said: "In the early stage of the migration, Tibetan antelopes face a higher risk of predation, so the number of cubs in the sheep will be relatively small, and even there may be no cubs."
According to statistics from the Hoh Xil Management Office of Jiangyuan Park, director of Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration, the number of Tibetan antelopes returning is increasing year by year. In 2019, the number of Tibetan antelopes returning is 4,860, an increase of 338 compared with 2018.
Lian Xinming said: "The migration of Tibetan antelopes is expected to end in early September this year, and the number of Tibetan antelopes is expected to continue to increase."
Tibetan antelope is a national first-class protected animal.
At the end of May every year, Tibetan antelopes from Sanjiangyuan of Qinghai, Qiangtang of Tibet and Altun Mountains in Xinjiang go to Zhuonai Lake in the hinterland of Hoh Xil to give birth.
Wu Xiaomin, an expert on Tibetan antelope protection in China and a researcher at the Shaanxi Institute of Zoology (Northwest Institute of endangered animals), said: "The migration of Tibetan antelopes is a process in which the female Tibetan antelopes return to their habitats with their cubs after they have finished giving birth. At first, there are a large number of migration groups that leave the breeding land, but then the Tibetan antelopes will return to their respective habitats along different paths according to different geographical populations."
In order to ensure the safe migration of the Tibetan antelope colony, the reporter learned that a few days ago, the Hoh Xil Management Office of Jiangyuan Park of Sanjiangyuan National Park has arranged staff to continuously carry out video monitoring and patrol in the main relocation areas.
If the Tibetan antelope sheep are found trying to cross the highway, the patrol team will carry out temporary traffic control at the first time, so that the sheep can safely pass through the wildlife passage and ensure that they are as little disturbed by human beings as possible on the way back.

Fresh fruits, such as peaches, apricots, watermelons, melons, etc. have a water content of 80% to 90%, which can be used to replenish water; Dairy products can not only replenish water, but also meet the nutritional needs of the body.
In addition, people working in high temperature environment should be properly supplemented with drinks containing potassium, magnesium and other elements.
In summer, the days are long and the nights are short, the temperature is high, the metabolism of the human body is strong, the consumption is also large, and it is easy to feel tired.
Adequate sleep can relax the brain and body systems, which is not only conducive to work and study, but also a measure to prevent heatstroke.
Experts say that the best bedtime is from 22:00 to 23:00, and the best time to get up is from 5:30 to 6:30.

A new drug developed by the University of Australia is expected to be used to treat blood vessel blockage caused by COVID-19
Xinhua News Agency, Sydney, July 26 (reporter Chen Yu) Researchers at Monash University in Australia are developing a new drug to help prevent heart disease and stroke, and hope that this drug can be used to treat blood vessel blockage caused by Novel coronavirus.
Researchers have found that an enzyme in platelets accelerates platelet clotting before a heart attack or stroke.
So they developed a drug that can temporarily inhibit platelet clotting to avoid blood vessel blockage and prevent heart disease and stroke.
Researchers say the drug can only inhibit the clotting effect of platelets when there are signs of heart disease or stroke.
Since studies have shown that similar vascular blockage is one of the main causes of death in severe patients with COVID-19, researchers hope that this drug can be used in the treatment of such severe patients in the future.
At present, the drug has achieved good results in animal model experiments, and researchers are preparing for the next phase of human clinical trials.
The research results have been published in the American journal Science Translational Medicine.
He became the first spectator to enter the CBA rematch after allowing spectators to watch the match live.

China News Agency, Hami, Xinjiang, July 26 th, Title: Xinjiang deeply cultivates "sunflower fields" and makes good use of clean energy
More than 6, 000 pentagonal heliostats of 48 square meters, each of 48 square meters, are arranged neatly in a circle, such as a silver "sunflower field". With the rotation of the sun, the sunlight is reflected to the heat absorption tower more than 200 meters high in the center, so as to realize power generation.
The reporter saw this scene on the 25 th.
"The so-called molten salt tower photothermal power generation is to reflect the sunlight through the mirror to the heat absorption tower to form heat energy, and then convert the heat energy into electric energy through traditional power generation technology."
Zhang Yong, deputy general manager of CLP Hami solar thermal power generation Co., Ltd., said that its design principle is similar to that of solar cookers used in rural areas in Northwest China, which should gather sunlight.
The power plant started construction in October 2017 and was connected to the grid at the end of last year. It covers an area of 6,600 mu and plans to install 14,500 heliostats.
"Compared with traditional solar power generation technology, its biggest advantage is that it can store the accumulated heat energy and generate electricity at night."
Zhang Yong said that the 13-hour heat storage system configured in the project can keep the generator set in continuous and stable operation without being affected by light changes; It can also quickly participate in power grid peak regulation according to the peak and valley demand of power grid load.
After the completion of the project, the project can generate 198 million kilowatt-hours of electricity per year, save more than 60,000 tons of standard coal each year, reduce emissions of more than 60 tons of sulfur dioxide, more than 60 tons of nitrogen oxides, about 20 tons of soot and more than 150,000 tons of carbon dioxide, and provide a steady stream of clean energy for the local area.
In addition, there is another silver "sunflower field" in Shichengzi photovoltaic industrial park in Hami City.
Hami Fuguang solar photovoltaic power station covers an area of more than 2,300 mu. The 714 power generation equipment that has been built also follow the sun rotation, always keeping the sunlight and the concentrating board at a 90 degrees right angle.
"We use dual-axis tracking concentrating power generation technology. Through unified integrated control, all power generation equipment will adjust the angle according to the height of the sun to maintain power generation efficiency."
Duan Mengqi, director of the power station, said that in good weather conditions, the power generation technology can improve the efficiency of traditional photovoltaic power generation by about 20%.
In the first half of this year, the power station has generated more than 7 million kilowatt-hours of electricity, supplementing local demand for electricity.
Shichengzi photovoltaic industrial park is currently a photovoltaic industrial demonstration park with the largest single scale and the most complete types of photovoltaic modules in Xinjiang, with a total of 38 photovoltaic power generation projects with a total installed capacity of 820,000 kilowatts.
In the first half of this year, the power generation exceeded 110 million kWh, an increase of 6% over the same period in 2019.
Hami is one of the regions with the best solar energy resources in China.
The annual average total solar radiation is more than 6200 megajoules per square meter, and the annual sunshine hours are about 3200 hours.
In recent years, the city has vigorously developed the photovoltaic industry and planted "sunflower fields".
A solar power generation scale with an installed capacity of more than 2.5 million kilowatts has been built. In the first half of this year, the photovoltaic power generation capacity of the city exceeded 1.4 billion kWh, an increase of about 14% year on year.
At present, there are more than 330 grid-connected photovoltaic power stations in Xinjiang with an installed capacity of over 10 million kilowatts.
It is estimated that photovoltaic power generation this year will reach 15 billion kWh, which can replace more than 6 million tons of standard coal.

The US media uncovered the truth of the US request for China to close the Consulate General in Houston

The US media uncovered the truth of the US unreasonable request for China to close the Consulate General in Houston
On the 24 th, the Chinese Foreign Ministry informed the US Embassy in China that China had decided to revoke the establishment and operation license of the US Consulate General in Chengdu, and put forward specific requirements for the Consulate General to suspend all business and activities as a countermeasure to the US sudden request for China to close the Consulate General in Houston on the 21 st.
This behavior of the US government has aroused many concerns, and its political motives have been questioned by foreign media and scholars.
Why do you ask China to close the Consulate General?
Many foreign media said that it was not clear why the United States chose the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, but for the purpose of this move, the foreign media bluntly said: for the general election.
CNN reported on the 23rd that the move by the US request for China to close the Consulate General in Houston has aroused people to question its political motives.
The article said that the disastrous response of the US government to COVID-19 epidemic caused President Trump's poll support rate before the election.
White House officials said privately that the tough strategy taken against China was to save Trump's approval rate, but also to shift the responsibility of the White House's failure to respond to the epidemic.
The article holds that the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is a "politically driven and very cautious" target chosen by the United States, and the US government chose it "to create a tough attitude while avoiding the risk of major conflict."
The BBC also believes that when the US election season is approaching and the US economy is seriously hit by the epidemic, Trump believes that "playing the China card has a political advantage".
The current situation is "a spiral and tit-for-tat struggle", which is driven by the US government from the perspective of domestic considerations to a certain extent, and will only worsen the tension between China and the United States.
CBS reported that Trump's re-election prospects were under pressure due to the outbreak, and he has repeatedly accused China of the epidemic.
Almost every day, the United States takes new actions against Trump's absurd argument that "China exploits the United States".
"The Consulate General of Houston is very important in establishing ties between the two countries."
The Associated Press commented that the US request for China to close its Consulate General in Houston has increased tensions between the two largest economies in the world.
If the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is closed, in addition to diplomatic influence, Chinese citizens in the southern United States will face difficulties in obtaining consular services, as well as American citizens seeking visas and other services.
A business group in Houston expressed regret over the US request for China to close the Consulate General in Houston, saying that the Consulate General has played an important role in establishing trade, investment and cultural ties between the two countries.
The Associated Press believes that this reflects the importance of Chinese economy.
According to the website of the US Foreign Policy, the US move is "part of a series of provocative measures that will only worsen US-China relations".
Reuters quoted Jonathan Pollack, an expert on East Asian issues at the Brookings Institution, an American think tank, as saying that since the establishment of comprehensive diplomatic relations between the United States and China in 1979, he could not think of anything comparable to the US action against the Chinese Consulate General in Houston.
Hong Kong South China Morning Post reported that the US move is unprecedented in more than 40 years of diplomatic relations between China and the United States.
Analysts believe that this move may cause lasting damage.
The Chinese Consulate General in Houston was established in 1979 and is the first Chinese Consulate General in the United States.
At present, China has one embassy and five consulates in the United States.

In 1696, Tsar Peter the Great set out to form a naval fleet, creating the history of the Russian navy.
The last Sunday in July every year is the Russian Navy Day.
In response to the new changes in the epidemic prevention and control work, since July 17, trade unions at all levels in Xinjiang have responded to the call of the Autonomous Region Federation of trade unions and actively participated in the epidemic prevention and control work.
Tianshan North and South trade union cadres, workers and model workers went into the streets and communities and residents to carry out activities such as delivering vegetables and medicines, disinfection and sterilization, and publicity of epidemic prevention knowledge to serve the workers and demonstrate the "hard core power" of trade unions with practical actions.
Recently, the consolation group of Tianshan District Federation of trade unions in Urumqi delivered a batch of urgently needed living materials for epidemic prevention and control to the staff of 12 quarantine points.
After the outbreak of the epidemic, Tianshan District invested more than 1.05 million yuan at the first time and urgently allocated it to 23 grassroots trade unions directly affiliated to the grassroots trade unions.
Zhao Xiangguo, deputy secretary of the Party Committee and chairman of the trade union of China Construction Xinjiang Construction Engineering First Construction Co., Ltd., volunteered to stay in the unit on duty after receiving the notice from the company on epidemic prevention and control.
He sent cooking utensils, food and daily necessities to the workers living in the dormitories and new employees, and organized personnel to send them necessary materials every two days.
"Starting from July 21, we will find out the cadres and workers who stick to the front line of the fight against the epidemic, and take the way of online orders and merchants to deliver goods to their homes to supplement the purchase of epidemic prevention supplies and living materials for 704 front-line workers in Urumqi."
The person in charge of the Xinjiang Transportation Trade Union told reporters that in the face of sudden epidemic, they made every effort to ensure epidemic prevention and control services, steadily promote the development of transportation, and create a strong atmosphere of fighting the "epidemic" together.
At the current high temperature in summer, trade unions at all levels focus on front-line workers in key areas of epidemic prevention and control, and implement the care of "sending coolness".
On July 19, Urumqi County Federation of trade unions launched a "send cool" condolence activity to the front-line workers of epidemic prevention and control. Police stations, checkpoints and health systems in the county received drinks and fruits.
"Trade union cadres should further improve their political positions, strengthen their responsibility, warm people's hearts with care, and inspire fighting spirit with actions.
It is necessary to give full play to the role of trade union organizations in rallying and uniting workers, do a good job in epidemic prevention and control services, actively safeguard the health rights and interests of workers, and send care to front-line workers."
The relevant person in charge of the Autonomous Region Federation of trade unions said.

spokesman of the Chinese Embassy in the UK: The Chinese government is a staunch defender of cyber security
China News Agency, July 26. According to the website of the Chinese Embassy in the UK, on the 25 th, the spokesman of the Chinese Embassy in the UK answered a reporter question about the wrong remarks about cyber attacks.
The spokesman stressed that the Chinese government is a staunch defender of cyber security and has always resolutely opposed and cracked down on any form of cyber attacks and cyber crimes.
A reporter asked: According to media reports, hacker organizations related to China have interfered with the network system of a British company, launched attacks on British and American technology companies with patent data, and invaded the government networks of EU countries.
The spokesman said that the Chinese government is a staunch defender of cyber security and has always resolutely opposed and cracked down on any form of cyber attacks and cyber crimes.
Cyberspace has strong virtuality, difficulty in tracing the source and diverse actors. Adequate evidence should be presented in the investigation and characterization of network events, and no unreasonable guessing should be allowed.
The spokesman said that a series of incidents such as the "Prism Gate" in the past have proved that the United States has been carrying out the largest cyber theft operation in the world.
Maintaining peace and stability in cyberspace is in the common interest of all countries.
The spokesman pointed out that China's achievements in scientific and technological innovation were not stolen or robbed, but obtained through self-reliance and hard work.
In 2019, China submitted about 59,000 patent applications through the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), with an annual growth rate of 10.6%, making it the country with the largest number of international patent applications.
China has become a big country in innovation and intellectual property rights.
According to data from the Urumqi Central Sub-branch of the People's Bank of China, in the first half of the year, new loans for agricultural and small and micro enterprises in Xinjiang exceeded the annual increase in 2019.
In the first half of this year, the Urumqi Central Sub-branch of the People's Bank of China used a variety of monetary policy tools to guide the banking industry to continuously increase loans and provide sufficient financial guarantee for epidemic prevention and control and resumption of work and production.
Most areas of free nucleic acid testing in Urumqi have basically completed secondary testing in high-risk areas
China News Urumqi, July 26 (Reporter Sun ting Wen Zhao Yamin) Zhang Wei, director of the Urumqi Municipal Health Commission of Urumqi, said in the latest epidemic situation and nucleic acid detection in Urumqi on the 26th that at present, most of the free nucleic acid detection work in Urumqi has been basically completed.
According to the results of nucleic acid detection and epidemiological investigation, the expert group of the State Council and experts from the autonomous region and Urumqi are making further assessment of the development of the epidemic.
The Information Office of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region held a press conference on the 26th to report the epidemic situation and prevention and control in Xinjiang.
According to him, from 0:00 to 24:00 on July 25, there were 22 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Urumqi (5 of them were asymptomatic infections transferred to confirmed cases), and 38 new asymptomatic infections.
As of 24:00 on July 25, there have been 135 confirmed cases and 147 asymptomatic infections in Urumqi.
On the 25 th, the new asymptomatic infections were basically screened out through free nucleic acid testing and active screening in the whole city.
Zhang Wei, director of the Urumqi Municipal Health Commission, said on the 26th that most of the free nucleic acid testing work in Urumqi has been basically completed.
He also said that from the experience of other regions in China, there are many factors that affect the results of nucleic acid testing, such as the sensitivity of the detection reagent, the infection time and detoxification time of the tested personnel, the cooperation of the tested personnel when taking samples (poor cooperation may lead to the failure of the sampled in place) as well as the testing environment, the operation proficiency of the inspectors and so on.
For various reasons, nucleic acid detection will also appear false negative results.
The so-called false negative means that the tested person is really an infected person, but the nucleic acid test result is negative.
In addition, for people who have had close contact with confirmed cases and suspected cases, two nucleic acid tests are usually needed to exclude them.
For people who have been to high-risk areas of the epidemic, if they have fever and respiratory symptoms, a negative nucleic acid test may be false negative, so two nucleic acid tests are needed to rule out.
He said that in view of the above situation, for the health of the people of all ethnic groups in the city, starting today, Urumqi will carry out secondary free nucleic acid testing in key areas such as Tianshan District and Shayibak District, and at the same time carry out.
It is reported that Tianshan District and Shayibak District are high-risk areas of the epidemic.

It is expected that Hunan red tourism will become more and more prosperous.
US and China trade talks met in August
Liu He, head of the Chinese trade negotiation team, and Lai Haizhe, co-leader of the US team and trade representative, are expected to hold formal talks in August to assess the implementation of the first phase of the US trade agreement.
The report said that although China has significantly increased the number of US agricultural products in the past few months, due to the Novel Coronavirus epidemic and other factors, the amount of Chinese purchases is still some distance from the amount of the commitment in the trade agreement.
Analysts say that the recent closure of each other by the United States and China, together with other disputes, may undermine any progress in trade between the two sides.
The first phase of the trade agreement between China and the United States came into effect one month after it was signed on January 15. The agreement stipulates that the trade framework group composed of high-level officials of the two sides should hold talks every six months.
The meeting will be "an important turning point" for both sides to assess the progress of the agreement.
However, this person also said that if the tension between the United States and China leads to low willingness for talks at this time, the two sides may agree to the conference call between Lai Haizhe and Liu He on May 8, which has met the terms of the trade agreement every six months.
Relations between China and the United States have deteriorated rapidly since the beginning of this year, and disputes between the two sides include a series of issues such as the origin of novel coronavirus, trade, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, the South China Sea and ideology.
Although US President Trump boasted about his achievements in the first phase of the agreement at the beginning of the year, his attitude has changed recently.
He said at the White House press conference on the 23rd that although China has recently purchased a record amount of US corn in a single day and also bought a lot of soybeans, "this trade agreement is not as meaningful to me as it was when it was reached".
An anonymous Beijing government adviser also believes that a new round of trade talks is unlikely due to poor relations between the United States and China, and "trade issues have lost weight in Sino-US relations".
However, he revealed that Chinese economic and trade related units still met on the 23rd to discuss a series of issues, including how to increase imports from the United States."We have tried our best to buy, so any additional purchases will be difficult."
Peng Jiening, vice president of the US and China Business Council, said that it is "more important than ever" to maintain the momentum of the first phase of the agreement, and pointed out that China has made progress this year in further opening its financial market to US companies.
Analysts at Plenum, an independent research company, said: "It is better to talk than not to talk about it, although it may only be regarded as routine."
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26 (Reporter Wei Yukun) The reporter learned from the Ministry of Emergency Management on the 26th that the State Defense Office and the Ministry of emergency management, together with the State Food and materials Reserve Bureau, once again urgently transported 1.35 million woven bags, 1.2 million square meters of woven cloth and 130,000 square meters of geotextiles to Anhui to support flood fighting and rescue work in Anhui.
According to the relevant person in charge of the emergency management department of the Yangtze River, at present, the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the Huaihe River Basin maintain high water level fluctuate and the "No.3 flood of the Yangtze River in 2020" formed in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River on the 26 th, increasing the risk in some areas.
The meteorological department predicts that there will be heavy rainfall in Chongqing, Guizhou and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in the next three days, and the flood control situation is still grim and complex.

Hao Yusheng, chief representative of NASDAQ China: Now is the best time for Chinese companies to go to the US for IPO-Economic Watch-professional financial news website
Economic observation network reporter Zhang Bin, because of the lucky coffee fraud incident, the US market has implemented more stringent supervision on Chinese concept stocks, coupled with the long-term pressure on the valuation of Chinese concept stocks listed in the United States are under pressure from the Chinese concept stocks, Netease, Jingdong and other Chinese stocks have recently started their journey to return to Hong Kong for listing in recent years.
Recently, companies such as Shell and ideals have been enthusiastic about listing in the United States.
Is it the best time for Chinese companies to go public in the United States under the epidemic and the Chinese stock crisis ?
"In terms of the recent IPO cases and the situation of the companies to go to the United States for listing in the future, the IPO in the United States has not been affected in essence. On the contrary, the market is very good now. Even now is the best time for Chinese companies to go to the United States for IPO in the past 10 years."
Hao Yusheng, chief representative of NASDAQ stock exchange in China, said at the "2020 listed company leaders summit in 2020".
In April this year, the United States Securities Regulatory Commission (SEC) and the United States Public Company Accounting Supervision Committee (PCAOB) issued the "Statement on Audit Quality and the Important Role of Supervision in Obtaining Audit and Other International Information-Discussion on the Current Challenges of Information Acceptance of US listed companies with large business in China".
The statement said that although international cooperation and coordination have increased significantly in recent years, problems in access to information by US regulatory authorities still exist, and the SEC and PCAOB still face legal and practical challenges.Corresponding to the document, the PCAOB website detailed a list of listed companies that have encountered audit obstacles and their audit institutions, including a large number of Chinese stock companies.
In addition, in May this year, the U.S. Senate passed the Foreign Companies Accountability Act, which put forward additional information disclosure requirements for foreign companies listed in the United States.
According to Hao Yusheng, the crisis of Chinese stocks has not affected investors appetite.
"When the news first came out of the United States, everyone was asking if they could go public in the United States in the future, but later we found that these problems are not a problem for investors. Investors may ask these questions during the recent IPO roadshow in the United States, and even become standardized problem, but this has not been regarded by investors as an important factor to invest in a Chinese company.
I suggest that you treat the current situation with a normal heart as much as possible.
Of course, this may seem to be the most serious situation in the past two years, but in terms of investor appetite, it has not been affected in any way.
So from now until the end of this year or before the US election, the upsurge of IPO in the US will continue."
On May 9 this year, Jinshan Cloud was officially listed on NASDAQ in the United States, becoming the first Chinese company to go to the United States for IPO after the epidemic.
"The listing of Jinshan Cloud gives a lot of confidence for Chinese companies preparing for IPO."
Hao Yusheng said.
In the first half of 2020, according to the data report of China stocks, the number of Chinese companies going to the United States for IPO in the first half of this year, an increase of 17.6% compared with the same period last year, 20 companies raised a total of 2.725 billion yuan, up by more than 52.4% compared with the same period last year. In terms of industry distribution, the number of IPOs in the health care industry in the first half of this year was outstanding, up 100% over the same period last year.
According to Hao Yusheng, in the first half of this year, the quality of Chinese companies that went to the United States for IPO in the first half of this year is high, and high-quality companies with excellent fundamentals and growth will be more favored by investors.
In the short, medium and long term, Hao Yusheng continues to be optimistic about Ming China's IPO in the United States.
"In the short term, the upsurge of IPO in the United States continues; In the medium term, Chinese companies will have more choices, such as A shares, Hong Kong stocks and US stocks, and we will consider the US election and China and US relations as market selection and time choices. In the long run, everything will return to normal. The market fluctuation is a cycle, there is a political cycle and an economic cycle, which will eventually return to the normal stage. The stock market has always been fluctuate forward."
Hao Yusheng also said, "There are many uncertain factors this year, but for high-quality companies, no matter whether the market is good and bad, as long as they are solid and have the growth that investors can see, other factors are relatively minor, investors need to invest in excellent Chinese companies."

Commentator of People's Daily: concentrate on doing your own affairs well and create new advantages for future development--on learning and implementing General Secretary Xi Jinping, his important speech at the entrepreneurs forum: Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 25 (Xinhua News Agency, July 26, Commentator: concentrate on your own affairs and create new advantages for future development
At present, the global epidemic situation and the world economic situation are still grim and complex, and the challenges facing China's development are unprecedented.
Maintaining strategic determination, enhancing confidence in winning and concentrating our efforts to do our own affairs is the key to our response to various risks and challenges.
At the recent symposium, General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed that under the current external environment of rising protectionism the world economy is low and the global market is shrinking we must concentrate our efforts to do a good job in our own affairs and give full play to the advantages of the domestic super large-scale market, and gradually form a new development pattern with the domestic big cycle as the main body and the domestic and international double cycles promote each other, enhance the modernization level of the industrial chain and supply chain, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation, speed up key core technology research, and create new advantages for future development.
He who observes the trend is wise, and he who controls the trend wins.
Under the external environment of the in-depth development of economic globalization, the "two ends" of the market and resources have played an important role in the rapid development of our country.
Now, the world under the impact of the epidemic is undergoing profound changes, facing more unstable and uncertain factors, and economic globalization has encountered headwinds and waves.
For a long period of time to respond to the changes in the external environment, one of the extremely important aspects is to take expanding and meeting domestic demand as the strategic basis of development, give full play to their own advantages, and add impetus to our economic development by prospering the domestic economy and unblocking the domestic circulation and driving the recovery of the world economy.
We must deeply realize that building a complete domestic demand system is related to China's long-term development and long-term stability.
The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Communist Party of China assessed the situation and made it clear that it is necessary to resolutely implement the strategy of expanding domestic demand, which is the need to cope with the impact of the epidemic, to maintain the long-term sustained and healthy development of our economy, and to meet the needs of the people for a better life.
The advantage of a big country economy is that it can be recycled.
China has the most complete and largest industrial system in the world, strong production capacity and complete supporting capacity. It has more than 100 million market players and more than 170 million talents with higher education or various professional skills, as well as a super large-scale domestic demand market formed by 1.4 billion people, including more than 400 million middle-income groups, which is in the stage of rapid development of new industrialization, informationization, urbanization and agricultural modernization, with huge potential for investment demand.
Public ownership is the main body, multiple ownership economies develop together, distribution according to work is the main body, and multiple distribution methods coexist. The socialist basic economic systems such as the socialist market economic system can not only stimulate the vitality of various market subjects, liberate and develop social productive forces, but also promote the organic unity of efficiency and fairness, and continuously realize common prosperity.
We should firmly grasp the strategic basis of expanding domestic demand, make production, distribution and circulation rely more on the domestic market to achieve a virtuous circle, clarify the strategic direction of supply side structural reform, and achieve dynamic balance between total supply and total demand at a higher level.
It is necessary to accelerate the construction of a complete domestic demand system, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation and other aspects of innovation, accelerate the promotion of strategic emerging industries such as digital economy, intelligent manufacturing, life and health, and new materials, form more new growth points and growth poles, and gradually form a new development pattern with the domestic big cycle as the main body and the domestic and international double cycles promote each other.
Openness brings progress, and closing is bound to behind.
General Secretary Xi Jinping has repeatedly stressed that the door to China's opening will not be closed, but will only open wider and wider.
Taking the domestic circulation as the main body, it is by no means behind closed doors. Instead, by giving full play to the potential of domestic demand, the domestic market and the international market are better connected, and the international and domestic markets and resources are better used to achieve stronger and more sustainable development.
At the same time, there is no contradiction between expanding domestic demand and opening up. The smoother the domestic cycle, the more conducive it is to building a new pattern of opening up and forming new advantages in participating in international cooperation and competition.
Despite the rising trend of protectionism in the world, we need to stand on the right side of history, persist in deepening reform, expanding opening up, strengthen opening up and cooperation in the field of science and technology, promote the construction of an open world economy, and promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.
The Chinese nation has experienced a lot of hardships in its history, but it has never been crushed. Instead, it has become more and more brave, growing up and rising from tribulations.
On the way forward we have the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, the remarkable advantages of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, strong mobilization ability and strong comprehensive strength, and the unity and struggle of the whole party, the whole army and the people of all ethnic groups in the country, we will be able to overcome all difficulties and obstacles, maintain the momentum of good economic and social development of our country, build a well-off society in an all-round way, and successfully start a new journey of building a socialist modern country in an all-round way!
Yu'ebao's income declines, "post-90 s" but "retaliate" to save money?
With the decline of Yu'e Bao's income, the "post-90 s" not only did not escape from Yu'e Bao, but began to "retaliate" to save money?
According to the "post-90 s saving report" (2020 version) released by the China New Economic Research Institute and Alipay recently, in the first half of the year, the "post-90 s" were more likely to save money: the average amount of money saved increased by nearly 40% compared with 2019.
Interestingly, the "post-90 s" tend to start saving from a small sum of money, with 60% of them saving less than 20 yuan on average ...
Saving money with Yu'ebao has also become a saving habit of the post-90 s.
Data show that among the 700 million Yuebao users, 134 million are "post-90 s".
There are 17.4 million "post-90 s" in China, that is to say, about three out of every four "post-90 s" in the country are saving money with Yuebao
At present, the 7-day annualized rate of return of Yu'ebao and other monetary funds has fallen to about 1.5% from a level higher than 2% at the beginning of the year.
Even so, it did not affect the pace of "post-90 s" saving money.
In the context of the "saving effect" of Yu'e Bao, many young people who are used to using Yu'ebao are directly transformed into "basic people".
According to Alipay data, as of July 13, the number of new "basic people" on Alipay has more than doubled year-on-year in the past month, and more and more young people have achieved "advanced" financial management on Alipay.
Some analysts believe that the inflow of funds from Yu'ebao into the stock market is also an important reason for the clear decline in the share of money funds in June.
The report also shows that "post-90 s" girls are more likely to save more money, 20% more than boys on average compared with men. Among the users who hold funds on Alipay platform, 60% are men, and women tend to choose more stable financial management methods compared with men.
After saving money, what are the plans for the post-90 s?
According to Alipay data, the "post-90 s" have the habit of saving money for their goals, and the number of users who take travel as a saving goal.
Affected by the epidemic, many "post-90 s" save money to prepare for travel after the epidemic; The reopening of movie theaters also provides a new way to shift from saving money to consumption.

France increases military investment in space
French Defense Minister Florence Pali said on the 24th that France will add hundreds of millions of euros in space defense budget to develop space military forces to prevent "unfriendly actions" that other countries may make in outer space.
Pali told Provence that day that from 2019 to 2025, the budget for French space military projects will increase to 4.3 billion euros (5 billion US dollars) from the previously proposed 3.6 billion euros (about 4.2 billion US dollars) to 4.3 billion euros (5 billion US dollars).
According to the French Military Planning Act from 2019 to 2025 approved by the French Parliament in 2018, France is expected to update the existing observation satellites and communication satellites, launch three electromagnetic listening satellites, and improve the modernization level of space surveillance radar.
French President Emmanuel Macron announced in July last year that a space military command and an "aviation and space force" will be set up within the French Air Force.
Pali said she will officially announce the formation of the space force when she visits a military academy in Saron, Provence later.
Pali said that the space force is part of the air force and will have 500 personnel by 2025.
"The idea of space serving the common interests of science in the past is gone forever. Now space is a place where countries compete for global hegemony."
Pali reiterated Macron's previous statement, saying that France has no intention of provoking an arms race.
"We are by no means engaged in an arms race. But I have a responsibility to thoroughly recognize the threats we may face."
Pali recalled the surveillance of a military satellite shared by France and Italy in 2017.
She said it was a Russian satellite.
The Russian side denies this statement.
Pali said that France "soon" will have a small patrol satellite capable of detect and lock "the black hands behind those unfriendly actions".
According to French media, the reason why France seeks to set up a space force is that US President Donald Trump asked the US Department of Defense in February last year to draft a bill to establish a space force.
Trump signed the National Defense Authorization Act in December last year, approving the establishment of the space force.
Some experts worry that these US measures have accelerated the militarization of US space and may trigger a new round of space arms race.

The two famous hospitals in Shanghai and Xiamen held the signing ceremony of the Vascular Surgery Cooperation Center at the same time of the meeting and announced the formation of a cooperative unit to jointly improve the treatment level of vascular surgery related diseases in southwest Fujian.
Vascular Surgery of Shanghai Changhai Hospital is the only Institute of vascular surgery in the army and the only clinical medical center of vascular system diseases in Shanghai. It is also the first national key discipline of vascular surgery. It takes the lead in the establishment of the Chinese Medical Doctor Association Endovascular Committee and is a top team with deep accumulation in the industry.
Professor Huang Xiaojin, director of vascular surgery of Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University, was interviewed by the media.
The vascular surgery department of Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University is the first independent discipline of vascular surgery in Fujian Province. It has been committed to the diagnosis and treatment of aortic and peripheral vascular diseases for a long time. In 2018, it was approved to build a provincial key clinical specialty.

"The vascular surgery department of Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University is outstanding in this region in terms of the history of development, the breadth, difficulty and complexity of the operation. Therefore, this time we set up a cooperation center. In addition to the aorta, we can also carry out in-depth cooperation in medicine, teaching and scientific research in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases such as lower limb artery and carotid artery ."

In addition, the department will also send personnel for further study and exchange to strengthen the training and development of discipline talent team.
Reporters learned at the meeting that vascular disease is the largest cause of death in China. As the main road of various organs of the human body, the aorta flows from the heart to the whole body and plays an important role.
The occurrence of aortic disease is often accompanied by high risk, high mortality and high difficulty in treatment. The thickest segment of the aorta is 4 cm. Once hemangioma is formed, rupture occurs, or the intima rupture produces dissection, it will cause massive blood, which is very dangerous.
In recent years, with the change of human lifestyle and the accelerated pace of life, China has become the largest country in the world with hypertension, and aortic diseases have also increased. Nowadays, with the development of surgical technology and industrial materials, the treatment of aortic diseases is developing in the direction of minimally invasive, rapid and efficient.
Doctors can puncture from the thigh and place a stent in the aorta to properly "divert" the blood flow, so as to avoid the impact on aneurysm or ruptured dissection, and achieve a good therapeutic effect. Some operations even require local anesthesia.
More than ten domestic experts were invited to the academic seminar to discuss the new progress in the treatment of aortic diseases, and to carry out cutting-edge technology training and difficult case discussion in the form of conference salon.
The reporter learned at the meeting that with the development of surgical technology and industrial materials, the current treatment of aortic diseases continues to develop in the direction of minimally invasive, rapid and efficient.

Zheng-Wan high-speed railway is located in Henan, Hubei and Chongqing provinces and cities. It connects Beijing-Guangzhou and Xulan high-speed railway in the north of Zhengzhou and Yu-Wan high-speed railway in the south of Wanzhou, which is an important part of the riverside passage
The small Three Gorges Tunnel of Zhengwan high-speed railway was completed on the 26 th.
The picture shows the scene.
The Zhengwan high-speed railway starts from Zhengzhou City, Henan Province, and runs southwest through Pingdingshan City, Nanyang City and Xiangyang City of Hubei Province to Wanzhou District of Chongqing City. The new line has a total length of about 818 kilometers, a design speed of 350 kilometers per hour, and about 184 kilometers in Chongqing.
Among them, the Zhengzhou-Xiangyang section has been put into operation in advance on December 1, 2019, and the Chongqing section is stepping up its construction.
The Small Three Gorges Tunnel, which is completed on the 26 th, is a control project of the Zhengwan high-speed railway. The project is located at the junction of Fengjie County and Wushan County in Chongqing, with a total length of about 18.9 kilometers and a maximum buried depth of 890 meters.
Construction of the tunnel began in February 2017, and the tunnel was completed on July 26, 2020.
According to Wang Guojun, head of Zhengwan high-speed railway tunnel design of China Railway Eryuan Engineering Group Co., Ltd., the small Three Gorges Tunnel is located in a very complex terrain and geological condition, facing risks such as karst, mud inrush and large deformation of soft rock, which is a class I high-risk tunnel, which is extremely difficult for tunnel design and construction.
"During the construction of the project, we used geological survey method, geophysical exploration method and advanced drilling method to advance geological prediction, and adopted special design plans for more than 30 karst caves of various types. For example, a bridge with a length of 24 meters is designed and built to cross a large karst cave with a longitudinal length of over 10 meters and a depth of over 55 meters in the tunnel to avoid tunnel settlement." Wang Guojun said.
According to the introduction of the China Railway Tunnel Bureau of the construction party, the construction of the tunnel adopted the combination of dredging and blocking through the construction of horizontal tunnel, grouting and blocking the water, strengthening the tunnel structure support and building the sewage treatment station, which not only ensure the orderly progress of the project, but also avoid the damage of construction drainage to the water body of the small Three Gorges scenic spots. At the same time, it successfully overcomes the construction problems such as the seven kilometers of soft rock large deformation and so on, and the daily maximum water inflow of 157,000 cubic meters.
After the completion and opening of Zhengwan high-speed railway will become a new convenient and fast passenger transport main channel from Southwest China to Central Plains, North China and Northeast China. It is of great significance to improve the capacity and quality of northeast railway channel in Southwest China, improve the regional road network layout, speed up the development and urbanization along the route, promote regional coordinated development and promote the implementation of the western development strategy. It is of great significance.
Experts say it is unconstitutional to collect immigration data through the U.S. Census for the allocation of seats in the House of Representatives
Some civil rights organizations and several U.S. cities and counties have sued the U.S. federal government, saying it is unworkable and unconstitutional to try to exclude undocumented immigrants from the U.S. census
The U.S. census will determine the distribution of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Sarah Brannon, an executive lawyer of the American civil rights alliance, told VOA that "this will not work."
She went on to say that Trump's request to determine the citizenship of people in the census is difficult to do and "not very reliable."
Another civil liberties organization Common Ccause filed a lawsuit Thursday to challenge Trump's executive order.
Some cities in New Jersey and Georgia joined the lawsuit.
Arlington County, Virginia, joined the lawsuit Friday.
"The U.S. Constitution requires an accurately count of our population every 10 years. We must accurately count everyone who lives in Arlington County, and we cannot let this illegal attempt to scare away people and reduce the number of our immigrant communities."
Other organizations and individuals praised President Trump's executive order.
Alabama Attorney General Marshall called the executive order a "victory" for the state.
"The allocation of seats in the House of Representatives of each state must be based on the number of residents who live in each state, and the number of residents who are legally resident," he said."
The U.S. Supreme Court last year prevented the Trump administration from including citizenship in the 2020 census.
President Trump signed an executive order earlier this week to instruct the Secretary of Commerce of the U.S. Census Bureau to submit data on the undocumented population obtained from the census so that the administration can exclude these undocumented population from the state census figures and determine whether each state will increase or decrease or maintain the seats in the House of Representatives.
The United States redistributes seats in the House of Representatives every 10 years based on demographic changes.

Promote the construction of industrial projects in response to the trend
In the midsummer of Hunan.
The enthusiasm released by the on-site observation meeting of the promotion of industrial project construction in the whole province overcame the heat of the dog days, and the clear guidance of "comparing strength with industry and discussing heroes by project" encouraged Sanxiang and Sishui.
The development of Hunan always depends on building projects and training industries.
In the face of the extremely unusual first half of the year, under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, the whole province insisted on a game of chess, went all out to fight the two hard battles of epidemic prevention and flood control, and took the industrial project as the "first hand chess" to implement the "six stability" and "six guarantees".
From a year-on-year decline of 1.9% in the first quarter to a year-on-year growth of 1.3% in the first half of the year, it is self-evident that the difficulties and efforts of the period were huge.
In this precious report card, the construction of industrial projects is the key support for Hunan to accelerate economic recovery and stable development.
The potential is smooth and irreplaceable
The construction of industrial projects should be put into the overall situation. They should be good at accumulating, accumulation and seeking momentum, and are good at recognizing, seeking and responding to changes.
Under the background of the complex and grim international situation, in addition to painstaking efforts to attract investment, we need to calm down to study the new situation and new characteristics, grasp the laws more and be more scientific and precise to better integrate into the new development pattern with the domestic big cycle as the main body and the domestic and international double cycles promote each other.
Pay more attention to improving the basic industrial capacity.
In the first half of the year, not only did a large number of heavyweight investment projects in emerging industries break ground and sow hope in our province, but also enterprises with traditional advantages accelerated their deployment in the digital, intelligent and green industrial transformation.
The third science park project of Yiyang Aoshikang the existing production line, and the intelligent production line of high-end printed circuit board to take the lead; The new plant of Hunan Zhongyan Changde Cigarette Factory is committed to the process of intelligent transformation and the construction of a modern factory, and it is also a vivid portrayal of "old trees sprouting new bud"... Focusing on the major national strategy and the "two new and one heavy", we should focus on consolidating and upgrading advantageous industries, actively cultivate and develop emerging industries, and comprehensively increase scientific and technological innovation and localization, so that we can continuously consolidate the basic conditions and save momentum for transformation.
We will pay more attention to cultivating and developing new economy, new formats and new models.
The sudden COVID-19 epidemic has brought the popularity of the "cloud economy", stimulated the potential of the digital economy, and provided new opportunities for industrial transformation. In the first half of the year, the computer and office equipment manufacturing, electronic and communication equipment manufacturing industry in our province increased by 12.6%, the online retail sales of wholesale and retail enterprises above designated size increased by 32.2% year-on-year, and the online meal income of catering enterprises increased by 35.6% year on year.
It is the general trend to cultivate new opportunities in the crisis, open a new situation in the changing situation, actively promote digital industrialization and industrial digitalization, and guide the integrated development of digital economy and real economy.
Pay more attention to optimizing and stabilizing the industrial chain supply chain.
Construction machinery is the main force of Hunan industry, but two-thirds of the supporting enterprises are outside the province, and there is still room and potential in the supporting chain.
To strengthen the thinking of the industrial chain and grasp the project, we should not only have the continuous accumulation of leading enterprises, but also achieve technological breakthroughs in the key links of the industrial chain; It is necessary for all localities to devote themselves to cultivation, stimulate the "chain" response by strengthening the chain to supplement the chain and extend the chain, promote the coordinated layout of related supporting industries, and speed up the construction of an independent, controllable, safe and reliable industrial chain supply chain.
Hunan is still a hot and happy place with good business environment and emerging market opportunities.
All parts of the province have frequently recruited, new and practical measures, thinking that the "reduce the burden" of enterprise relief has given birth to the "acceleration" of high-quality development; Shaoyang implements the "shareholder" service to do things for enterprises and does not shirk. The policy is not discount and the problem is not solved overnight... In the process of recovering the losses caused by the epidemic, all kinds of "do everything possible" to find out the short board pain points, and turn crisis into opportunities.
Focusing on industry research, industry cultivation, industry development, and optimizing the business environment in a solid way will surely win the favor of more investors.
The wind and waves are still ahead, but the state of riding the wind and waves has become the norm for the whole province to focus on the construction of industrial projects and promote high-quality development.
In this critical period, we must learn and implement the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's series of important instructions, effectively respond to external uncertainties with the certainty of our own work, persevere in promoting the construction of industrial projects, share enthusiasm and sweat to ensure the successful conclusion of the 13th Five-Year Plan and the building of a well-off society in an all-round way.

Employment and prices are generally stable
Economic Daily · China Economic Net reporter Lin Huocan
In the first half of this year, in the face of the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic, China made overall efforts to promote epidemic prevention and control and economic and social development. The situation of epidemic prevention and control continued to improve, the steady economic recovery was obvious, and the performance of employment and prices, which is closely related to people's livelihood was generally stable.
In the first two months of this year, the surveyed unemployment rate rose.
Especially in February, the production and business activities of many enterprises were basically in a state of shutdown, the employment demand of enterprises decreased, the recruitment was delayed or cancelled, and the surveyed unemployment rate in cities and towns increased.
With the gradual improvement of the epidemic prevention and control situation, the production and living order of the whole society has been continuously restored.
The Party Central Committee adheres to the general tone of seeking progress in the midst of stability, further strengthens macro policy hedging, comprehensively strengthens the policy of giving priority to employment, and actively promotes the work of assisting enterprises to stabilize jobs and expand employment,
China has stepped up policy hedging to stabilize posts, played a combination of policies of "reduction and exemption, slow back and compensation of three social insurance units to be reduced and exempted in phase, allowed to postpone the payment of social insurance premiums, and expanded the benefits of the policy of unemployment insurance for small and medium-sized enterprises for the benefit of the employment of key groups, such as subsidies for enterprises to absorb the employment of key groups.
With the implementation of various policies to stabilize employment, the employment demand of enterprises has steadily picked up, the employment situation has gradually improved, and the surveyed unemployment rate in urban areas has gradually decreased. In June, the surveyed unemployment rate was 5.7%.
Zhang Yi, director of the Department of Population and Employment Statistics of the National Bureau of statistics, said that in the second quarter, various employment policies continued to take effect, and the labor force that withdrew due to the impact of the epidemic in the early stage returned one after another. The urban labor participation rate in June increased by about 10 percentage points compared with February and was close to the level of the same period last year.
Data show that the total urban employment in June increased by more than 19% compared with February, and most industries reached pre-epidemic levels; The average weekly working hours of employees in enterprises reached 46.8 hours, 6.6 hours higher from February and 0.1 hours higher than that in January.
Prices are also related to millions of households.
In January this year, CPI rose by 5.4% year-on-year, setting a new high for many years.
In February, although the year-on-year increase of CPI dropped slightly, it was still in the "5 range".
The year-on-year increase of CPI is at a high level, which is not only driven by consumer demand before the Spring Festival, the wrong month of the Spring Festival and the low year-on-year base.
However, the COVID-19 epidemic has a particularly significant impact on prices,
Affected by the prevention and control of the epidemic, in January and February, there were delays in logistics, untimely supply of materials, and increased transportation costs across the country. In addition, some citizens hoarded and snapped up, and the prices of some daily necessities increased significantly.
In response to the disturbance caused by the epidemic prevention and control to the price situation, relevant departments have included important living materials into the scope of emergency transportation guarantee to ensure smooth transportation of materials.
Under the action of a series of policy measures, the market supply of vegetables and fruits has been strongly guaranteed.
In response to the rapid rise in pork prices at the beginning of this year, after the central government issued the policy of ensuring supply and stabilizing prices, various regions and departments quickly implemented it. The supply of pork reserves was significantly improved, the pig production capacity was recovered in an orderly manner, and the production and sales order was gradually normal.
Since March, pork prices have continued to decline and the year-on-year increase in food prices has dropped to 10.6% in May. In June, pork prices rose slightly from the previous month due to factors such as the slow down of pig production, the decrease in imports and the rebound of group consumer demand.
The seasonal changes in fresh vegetable prices were obvious, with an average increase of 3.4% in the first half of the year.
Affected by the high base of comparison in the same period last year, the price of fresh fruit continued to decline year-on-year, with an average decline of 13.3% in the first half of the year.
The basic livelihood of the masses has been effectively guaranteed, and the overall economic and social situation has remained stable and orderly.
With the gradual recovery of transportation and logistics, all localities have increased their efforts to ensure supply, and the market supply and demand situation has improved.
Since March, CPI has declined for four consecutive months, and the year-on-year increase has also dropped from 4.3% in March to 2.5% in June. The overall price level has returned to a stable level.
In the second half of the year, China's prices will continue to maintain a moderate level, and the overall inflationary pressure is not large, but it is still necessary to promote the restoration of production and living order on the premise of normalization of epidemic prevention and control.
We will effectively respond to natural disasters such as floods and droughts in major agricultural production areas such as grain, fruits and vegetables, strengthen market supervision, and resolutely crack down on activities that disrupt market order such as hoarding and driving up prices,

author Hu Guilong Pan Yujie
"In midsummer, Qinghai Lake is full of golden flowers and thousands of bees. The altitude here is high, the temperature difference between day and night is large, and the air pollution is less. The strong light gave birth to the most tenacious and generous bee colony, creating Qinghai royal jelly with high activity, high protein, rich nutritional value, low sugar and low fat."
On the 26 th, Zhang Jianxun, deputy director of the Industry and Information Administration of Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, said.
On the same day, the live broadcast of bee products was held on the banks of Qinghai Lake. China Bee Products Association, representatives of entrepreneurs and beekeepers gathered together to jointly promote Qinghai characteristic bee products, and nearly 10,000 bottles of Qinghai Plateau royal jelly were sold online and offline, with a total amount of nearly 3.8 million yuan.

This spring, due to the need for epidemic prevention and control in various places to set up road checkpoints for beekeepers to "chasing flowers and honey". Many bees died due to missing flowering and lack of food, and the income of beekeepers was seriously affected.
"All the year round, the beekeepers follow the flowering season and travel long distances from Yunnan and Sichuan all the way north to the northwest region.
As a business, we have a responsibility to help them."
Wu Na said.
"Little bees are 'environmental scouts' and bees cannot survive in heavily polluted areas." Zhao Xiaochuan, executive vice president of China Bee Products Association, said that bee pollination is an important link in the ecological chain, which plays an irreplaceable role in protecting plant diversity and improving the ecological environment.
At the same time, bee pollination can increase the yield and improve the quality of crops, especially in the areas with wide species and poor management conditions, pollination is of greater significance.

The picture shows Zhao Xiaochuan (right), executive vice president of China Bee Products Association, promoting Qinghai bee products.
"The economic, ecological and social benefits created by bee pollination are far greater than the value of bee products themselves. The bee industry has huge potential in human health, crop production, vegetation reproduction and ecological protection, and people have always known little about it."
Zhao Xiaochuan said.
Nowadays, the number of beekeepers is getting less and less. In addition to beekeepers who travel all the year round, there are still many poor households with mobility difficulties who choose to use beehives to invest in cooperatives.
"The state has financial support. We contact technical personnel to help guide, and beekeepers lack understanding and judgment of the market environment. To open the market, they also need the help and coordination of the government, enterprises and industry associations."
Zhao Xiaochuan said.
"I hope you will pay more attention to and help beekeepers in the future." Wu Na said."Our bee products are also screened and controlled in strict accordance with national standards to ensure quality and protect consumer rights and interests while helping beekeepers."

White House adviser "bites back" states return to work too early
White House adviser "bites back" states to resume work too early
On July 23, local time, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the United States exceeded 4 million, accounting for 30% of global cases.
Over the past few months, US President Trump has repeatedly asked all states across the country to return to work and return to school. It was only recently that he changed his attitude and took the initiative to wear masks in public, and his advisers even "bite back" that some state governments resumed work too early.
On the 22 nd, White House presidential adviser Kellyanne Conway said at a press conference that some state governments failed to comply with the standards of returning to work and restarted places such as bars prematurely.
Conway also mentioned that the previous statement that the president has the "absolute power" to decide the resumption of work in each state is a false rumor.
"The president is a federalist. He believes that every state has autonomy."
She defended Trump.
However, the "rumor" that Conway spoke of it was personal remarks by Trump at the White House epidemic briefing on April 13.
This self-slapping operation was ridiculed by netizens as "rewriting history".
Karen Conway wants to rewrite history. She is a liar.
Trump called Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer a dictator because she followed medical guidelines and insisted on stopping work.
Trump wants to push for a return to work so that he can hold a rally.
This is not the first time Harry Conway has caused controversy.
In an interview with Fox News on April 15, Conway blurted out: "This is COVID-19, not COVID-1, friends!"
She seemed to understand "19" as a version number, which was ridiculed by netizens: read the newspaper without common sense!
Is it reasonable for a 3-year-old child to sued the school after being compensated
2020-07-2605:01:11 Source: Legal Daily Author: Wang Sishuo Editor: Wang Sishuo
After the playground was smashed, the children sued the school
Our correspondent Zhao Yifan
Xiaowen, 3, was accidentally hit in the head by Chen of the softball team while playing on the playground of a University.
After Chen made compensation, Xiaowen's father, Mr. Wen, as Xiaowen's legal representative, sued the school to the court, demanding that the school where the playground was located apologize and pay a total of 20,000 yuan for medical expenses and mental damage.
Recently, after hearing the case, the Haidian District People's Court of Beijing held that the school had set up a protective net on the playground at the time of the incident, and had fulfilled the appropriate security obligations, and Chen had made compensation, so the judgment rejected the plaintiff's claim.
Mr. Wen complained that he took Xiaowen to play on the school playground during the summer vacation in 2019, when the softball team was training on the playground.
In order to avoid the risk, Xiaowen, Mr. Wen and many other children and parents play in the safe area designated by the softball team.
But then the softball team member Chen dropped the ball while pitching, causing the softball to fly over the net to the above-mentioned safe area and hit Xiaowen in the back of the head.
Mr. Wen immediately took Xiaowen to the hospital for treatment and was diagnosed with head trauma.
Mr. Wen believes that the facilities of the school stadium do not meet the relevant safety regulations, and the team and related facilities are not effectively managed.
The school fault led to the above incident, which caused Xiaowen to suffer great physical and mental pain, and also brought great pain to his family. The school should bear legal responsibility for this.
In this regard, the school argued that the school had set up a protective net on the playground, and posted management regulations and training notices, informing them that entering the playground must keep a safe distance from the training ground and remind them to pay attention to their own safety. The plaintiff could not prove that the school "failed to fulfill its security obligations", so he did not agree to compensation.
After hearing the case, the court held that the site of the incident was open to the public free of charge by the university involved in the case. Although the school had a security obligation for the management of the playground, this security obligation only needed to meet the general duty of care.
At the time of the incident, the school set up a protective net on the playground, which has fulfilled the proper security obligations, and Chen also compensated Xiaowen for medical expenses, transportation expenses and other losses of more than 2,000 yuan in accordance with the previously reached compensation agreement. The two sides agreed that the dispute should be solved at one time.
After the incident, Xiaowen's parents once again claimed compensation from the school, and there was no basis in the law, and the court rejected all the plaintiff's claims.
After the verdict was declared, neither party appealed, and the verdict is now in effect.
According to Article 37 of the Tort Liability Law of China, schools, as managers of public places, have the obligation of safety guarantee; In the case that the actions of the third party cause damage to others, the third party shall bear the tort liability, while the public place manager who fails to fulfill the security obligation shall bear the corresponding supplementary liability.
The judge said that as the manager of a public place, he is most likely to understand the actual situation of the whole place and foresee the possible danger and damage, so it is most likely to take necessary measures to prevent the occurrence of losses or reduce the degree of damage, and the cost of avoiding and reducing the damage is the lowest. Therefore, the law stipulates that it shall bear the corresponding guarantee obligations for engaging in social activities.
In this case, for unspecified people entering the playground open to the public free of charge in the playground, the school should have the security obligation of the school should adapt to its social activities. Specifically, it should take basic safety measures and have the obligation of informing hidden dangers.
In judicial practice, it is not appropriate to impose excessive security obligations on the managers of public places.
If the school has set up a protective net and fulfilled the obligation of informing, it can be determined that the school is not at fault and should not bear legal responsibility.
In addition, for the infringement of the third party, even if the managers of public places such as schools fail to fulfill their security obligations, their responsibilities are also a supplement of damages. According to the newly issued civil code, after the managers bear the supplementary liability, they can also claim compensation from the third party,
Therefore, in this kind of accident, the victim should not expand the scope of claim after receiving the compensation from the direct infringer.
Under the normalization of epidemic prevention and control, people's enthusiasm for sports and fitness is high.
With the gradual opening of cross-provincial tourism business, the tourism market is about to ushered in a recovery.
Fujian Province resumed inter-provincial tourism business from July 21, and Xiamen, a popular tourist destination, ushered in the peak of passenger flow in the first weekend after opening up.

Israel strengthens prevention and control of repeated outbreaks

Israel strengthens prevention and control of the repeated epidemic
In the early stage of the outbreak of COVID-19, Israeli prevention and control measures were effective.
However, with the gradual lifting of the ban on prevention and control measures, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Israel has increased significantly recently, and the Israeli government has repeatedly taken emergency measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic.
On February 28, the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Israel, so it quickly closed all entry and exit ports, suspended non-essential industries, changed schools to online teaching, restricting public transportation and non-essential social activities, blocking cities with severe epidemics, and jointly maintaining prevention and control measures by military and police.
This series of measures quickly achieved positive results. By mid-May, the number of newly confirmed cases of COVID-19 pneumonia in Israel had once dropped to single digits in a single day.
Since June, the number of new confirmed cases of COVID-19 has gradually rebounded.
Especially since July, the spread of the epidemic has been accelerating.
In recent days, there have been more than 1,500 new cases in Israel every day for 8 days. As of July 25, the number of new cases on that day reached 916.
As of July 25, there have been 59,745 confirmed cases and 448 deaths in Israel.
facing the rapid rebound of the epidemic, the Israeli government has repeatedly taken emergency measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic.
On July 6, after the number of confirmed cases exceeded 30,000, the Israeli government closed gyms, swimming pools, bars, nightclubs and other public entertainment places, and introduced a policy to restrict public transportation, stipulating that the number of passengers per bus should not exceed 20.
On the 17 th, the Israeli government announced a series of new restrictive measures, including the implementation of "closure of the city" on weekends, stipulating that the "closure of the city" will be implemented from 17:00 every Friday to 5:00 every Sunday.
During this period, people can go out, but shops, shopping centers, barber shops, beauty salons, libraries, zoos, museums, exhibition halls, swimming pools and tourist attractions will be closed, while supermarkets, pharmacies and other basic service places will remain open.
At the same time, gatherings of more than 10 people will be ban on all dates and period of time, gyms, studios and other places will be closed, restaurants and cafes are not allowed to eat in the hall, and only take out service is allowed.
At the same time, the Israeli people did not pay enough attention to the severity of the epidemic, and failed to form a joint force with the government in fighting the epidemic.
After repeated outbreaks in Israel, many people took to the streets to protest because the government's prevention and control measures affected their economic interests.
On July 11, tens of thousands of people held a demonstration in Tel Aviv, believing that the anti-epidemic policy affected the economy.
On the evening of the 21 st, thousands of protesters gathered in front of Prime Minister Netanyahu's residence in Jerusalem to protest against Prime Minister Netanyahu's ban on prevention and control measures such as restaurants and cafes and did not give corresponding compensation.
In addition, many people do not abide by the rules of wearing masks and maintaining a safe social distance of two meters during outdoor activities. In order to avoid being fined by the police for not wearing masks, many people only wear masks on their chin or hang them on their wrists.
During the epidemic, the school was the hardest hit area for the spread of novel coronavirus. According to a reporter recent visit to the kindergarten, the teachers and students in the kindergarten did not wear masks as required by the government, nor did they maintain a safe social distance of two meters from each other.
Professor Eli Waxman, a member of the expert advisory group of the Israeli National Security Council on the fight against the epidemic, believes that Israel is moving towards a "dangerous situation" and pointed out that the current epidemic prevention and control measures taken by Israel are not enough, and all leisure and entertainment places and summer schools should be closed to control the further spread of the epidemic.
Waxman said that Israel lacks an overall plan to fight the epidemic, and the parliament and government departments should abandon their own interests as soon as possible, reach an agreement on the fight against the epidemic, and formulate clear steps including relevant restrictive measures of different departments.
Tel Aviv, July 25, by our reporter in Tel Aviv, Wang Jiong
Wu Fengfang, a farmer from Guyuan, Ningxia, could not beat his wife Dai Tianfu. They drove from their home 20 miles away and rushed to Liangyun cultural compound.
Despite the inconvenience in the past two years, Dai Tianfu, 77, still hopes to "come here every once in a while and have a trick."
This is a humble courtyard in Yuanzhou District of Guyuan City. Different from ordinary farmyard, melodious Qin Opera is often heard in the courtyard, as well as wonderful shadow play, embroidery works, traditional Qin Opera, Mei Hu Opera and so on.
The owner of the compound is Liang Yun. He used to be a carpenter.
More than 10 years ago, he began to plan to build a cultural compound.
With the Liangyun cultural compound, the cultural life of the villagers has become rich and colorful.
Before the reporter entered the Liangyun cultural compound, the tune of Qin opera has been spread out.
Bai Lixiang, a villager from a neighboring village, is singing excerpts of Qin opera for the villagers.
She has loved Qin opera since she was a child, and now she is well-known in the local area. As long as she has free time, she will come to the cultural compound to perform for the villagers.
Recently, Bai Lixiang also played a webcast.
Bai Lixiang said: "There is a very happy thing to have a stage for more people to see their performances."
On the stage, the singers looked at each other and the players tuned one tune. Although they were amateurs, their enthusiasm was not reduced at all.
Just like the rustic style of the farmyard, outside the Qin opera, the "grassroots" art and intangible cultural heritage in the Liangyun cultural compound rushed to the face.
More than 300 items of farming utensils of different ages, traditional and handmade tile sculptures, paper-cuts, embroidery, shadow puppets and so on.
Liang Yun led the reporter into the exhibition hall in the courtyard, where he showed his collection of old objects, such as old hip pot, three strings, spinning wheel, etc.
Why does an ordinary farmer build a cultural compound?
"Shadow play is my family skills, I have been learning it since I was 15 years old."
Established in 2012, Liangyun cultural compound has become the first rural "intangible cultural heritage exhibition hall" in Ningxia, and it is also a demonstration compound of intangible cultural heritage protection in Guyuan City.
In addition to Liangyun cultural compound, more than 120 cultural compound and 79 folk performance groups have emerged in Yuanzhou District of Guyuan City, among which there are more than 50 cultural compound of a certain scale, such as Shenjiahe cultural compound, Wang Yonghong cultural compound and Yanglang cultural compound, covering all towns and streets in Yuanzhou District, with more than 5,000 participants.
These grassroots artists are active in the fields, enriching the cultural life of the masses and meeting their spiritual needs.
"As life gets better and better, traditional culture cannot just be left behind."
"Liu's spy war drama" return again to "odds" to see Liu Yunlong Li Liqun opponent "Biao drama"-Xinhuanet
Beijing Satellite TV will land on July 16.
"Odds" is adapted based on real historical facts and is based on the Soviet military archives that have been sealed for many years and have been published for the first time.
Actor Liu Yunlong, who is well known to the audience with "spy war drama", broke through the image in the play and challenged a "stuttering agent" with a sense of joy.
In recent years, the popularity of dramas such as "Pretender", "mask" and "kite" has proved that spy war drama has strong vitality.
Different from previous spy war works, chance of victory looks at the world and extends the background of the story to the Soviet Far East battlefield.
It is set against the background of the final stage of the Anti-Japanese War in 1944. It tells the story of Tang Fei (Liu Yunlong), a secret intelligence worker of the Communist Party of China, under the leadership of the Secretary of the Linhe Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese underground party and the director of the Far East Intelligence Agency of the Soviet Union.
In many spy war dramas, the hero as a senior spy, a perfect image of handsome, high intelligence and maturity.
But in the view of Liu Yunlong, such a person is not suitable for being a spy."A spy should be the kind of person who can't be found in a pile of people. If he appears on the stage, he will be a very handsome. I wish everyone should pay attention to you. Can he still lurk? There is a line in "Kite", 'If you not come to arrest me, I forget that I am a Kuomintang." spies want to be elite."
Therefore, in "odds", Liu Yunlong ingeniously designed his hero Tang Fei as a "stuttering agent" with a sense of joy.
The other camp in "odds" is supported by Fukuhara, a Japanese played by Liang Guanhua, and Fang Shibao, the director of the police department played by Li Liqun.
A south and a north two powerful play bone, for the whole play added a lot of highlights of the master of the tricks.
Director Yin Fei used the word "Biao play" to describe the opposite play between Li Liqun and Liu Yunlong in the play, "absolutely Biao play, the two of them have a special tacit understanding, The tacit understanding between them has a great impact on me.Most of the time their plays are "hanging on". For example, we only wrote half the length of the page and if they do not stop when shooting, they can continue to play."
The masters do not rob each other and the director does not stir the play. When the actors are in the role and ensure their own character status, they can not only shape the role from the perspective of the characters, but also bring more viewing possibilities to the audience. Yin Fei said that such a play is brilliant enough.
In the play, you can also see many familiar faces in "Liu's spy drama". The famous and majestic "mountain city F4" in "Kite" also gathered three people in "odds".
Hou Yu and Liu Mingyang, who played Song Xiaoan and Zhao Jianzhi, once again played Tang Fei.
Director Yin Fei said, "These two people do not have bad roots. They just drifted with the tide in that era and environment."
Liu Yunlong also took the initiative to say, "We need to have a human touch. This human touch means that there must be good and bad people around me. The bad people are the enemy, but we should also develop them and our team should also grow."
The ending of the two people in the play is also carefully designed by Liu Yunlong, and he believes that he will give the audience a satisfactory answer.

The Lancet published an article praised China's anti-epidemic efforts to encourage countries to learn from the experience
China is a country with a population of 1.4 billion and a scale similar to Europe or the United States, and the COVID-19 epidemic has been effectively controlled at this stage, and there has not been a large-scale spread, which has largely controlled the domestic epidemic.
China has made a lot of investment in domestic research and public health construction in the past ten years, which makes China's preparation for COVID-19 much better than that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).
The author said that when SARS broke out in 2002, China was underprepared at first, especially the pathogen could not be identified.
When novel coronavirus was discovered in December 2019, Chinese scientists were soon able to identify the virus species and shared genome sequencing data with the international community on January 11, 2020.
By the end of January, doctors from mainland China and Hong Kong had clarified the clinical characteristics of the virus and warned the world about the threat of the novel coronavirus through research papers published in The Lancet.
China has also been at the forefront of vaccine research. Such research has been carried out very quickly and strictly through close domestic cooperation under the state of emergency announced in the Lancet in May and July respectively published the results of progress in the early trials of the COVID-19 vaccine developed by China in the Lancet.
Chinese experience shows that it is very important to invest in national health and research systems to effectively improve laboratory capacity.
This is the basis for the country to respond quickly and effectively to health emergencies and global health security.
Other countries, especially low-income and middle-income countries, are worth learning from.
In addition, Chinese experience has proved that on the basis of strong research, a strong high-level decision must be made decisively based on scientific evidence, so that COVID-19 can be effectively controlled.
The article emphasizes that the government and its leaders must respect science, understand the value of science, and act on it in the most beneficial way to society.
In the early stage of the outbreak, the National Health and Construction Commission of China sent three groups of infectious disease experts to Wuhan to investigate the risk and spread of novel coronavirus. Their suggestions provided the basis for the decision to "close the city" in Wuhan on January 23; When some experts put forward the necessity and urgency of building a shelter hospital, the government quickly made a decision and implemented it quickly. At the same time, the extensive participation of the community and the masses also made the epidemic quickly and effectively controlled.
At the end of the article, it is stressed that countries need to strengthen global cooperation and joint response in response to global health emergencies.

The film "Good Luck" is the first realistic work directed by Dapeng, and it is also his second affinity with the Golden Goblet Award.

The family members gathered for the film finished the final gathering.
In the movie poster released today, Wang Jixiang, a member of the family, is sitting in the middle of the picture smoking a cigarette. The background is the black land of northeast China with silver clothing, and the foreground is the red lanterns that Chinese people have to hang on holidays.
The red lantern that symbolizes happiness and reunion forms a huge contrast with the lonely Wang Jixiang, which seems to reveal the complexity and entanglement in this big family relationship.
It is reported that in the film, except for the "third uncle" Wang Jixiang, who is played by actor Liu Lu, the rest of the scenes are completed by the real director family. The experimental audio-visual style of the film breaks the boundary of drama and reality, and brings the audience a new immersive viewing experience.

Life without a script was eventually recorded as a film, but the tension beyond design was released.

Yu Wang and a soldier stand guard at the Batong Zhuokang sentry site.
In this place where the annual average temperature is more than ten degrees below zero, a row of simple barracks stands on the mountain pass. Not far from the barracks, a national flag is fluttering in the wind. The soldiers stand guard in the wind every day, and at the same time, they need to patrol at higher altitudes regularly.
The soldiers need to use both hands and feet to climb the steep slope of the steep rock.
It was late July, when the flowers and plants in the low altitude areas were blooming, and in Balong Zhuokang, only the ravine behind the barracks had relatively dense green.
Gao Peng, a soldier who has been stationed at the outpost for six years, pointed to the ravine and said that this is their back garden. Only in July and August can we see the grass grow slowly every year, and soon it turns yellow and is covered with snow.
patrol on foot may take about 9 hours.
Under the harsh plateau environment, the soldiers stationed here are accompanied by snow-capped mountains and glaciers all the year round, and they have to regularly patrol the higher mountain passes.
A few days ago, the patrol team composed of 8 soldiers, led by the instructor Liang Yixin, once again embarked on the patrol road.
Each soldier carries a weight of about 30 kilograms and goes to the target point early in the morning.
On the way, a soldier high, and his comrades gave emergency rescue.
In addition to patrol missions, the soldiers at Batong Zhuokang outpost have to carry out tactical and physical training every day.
As time goes by, the altitude, the oxygen content is getting lower and lower, and the physical strength is constantly overdrawn. These factors test the will of the patrol members.
They gritted their teeth and insisted that they cross several landslide points and several dangerous beaches one after another.
At about 16:00, it was lunch time for the patrol members. They took out their own dry food and sat on the spot at an altitude of more than 5,700 meters, accompanied by sleet, and supplemented their physical strength with food.
The soldiers at the Batong Zhuokang sentry point conducted tactical and physical training.
During the break, they will play cards together, and the loser will do push-ups, both for entertainment and physical fitness.
After a short rest in the cold wind, they climbed to the target point of the patrol, took out the national flag on the mountain pass and solemnly swore.
Behind them are the snow-capped mountains, and in front of them are dozens of kilometers of no man's land. They are the safest guardians of the country.
Beijing consumption season restarts-Xinhuanet
In accordance with the principle of "comprehensive restart, key planning, orderly promotion and strict organization", Beijing has restarted various activities in the Beijing consumption season.
On July 26, 1, 500,000 government and enterprise consumption coupons were issued, including 1 million offline food and shopping vouchers and 500,000 smart product coupons, which can be obtained by consumers in Jingdong APP.
Liu Meiying, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Commerce, introduced at the media briefing held on the 25th that the consumption season after the restart will further reduce the allocation of enterprises on the basis of maintaining the current preferential subsidies for coupons and card bags.
Starting from early August, the current 1:1 allocation of funds from the government and enterprises will be adjusted to 2:1. For example, the original consumer can enjoy a discount of 120 yuan after receiving a card package to the store for consumption. Among them, the government subsidy is 60 yuan and the enterprise profit is 60 yuan. After the adjustment, the government subsidy is 80 yuan and the enterprise profit is 40 yuan.
During the consumption season, the three major operators will subsidize traffic and terminals around 5G consumption to further promote Beijing's new 5G infrastructure and new 5G consumption.
Chen Maobo pointed out that Hong Kong's economy has been hit by the new outbreak of the epidemic, calling on all sectors to tide over the difficulties
China News Agency, Hong Kong, July 26. Chen Maobo, financial secretary of the Hong Kong SAR government, said on the 26th that Hong Kong is facing the impact of a new wave of COVID-19, and business contacts and economic activities that had seen signs of recovery have also been hit.

He said that the recent high number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 pneumonia in Hong Kong and the severe situation has affected people's livelihood and the economy.
When the epidemic is repeated, the most important thing is to strictly prevent imported cases and deal with and interrupt the virus transmission chain as quickly as possible; When the epidemic is under control, economic activities should be resumed in a timely manner.
He pointed out that in the face of the impact of the new wave of the epidemic, business contacts and economic activities that had seen signs of recovery were also hit.
For the business community, in addition to the spirit of contract, social responsibility is equally important, especially those groups that have received large government subsidies under the Employment Protection Scheme.
He mentioned that the economic situation in Hong Kong in the second quarter of this year was still very grim, but the contraction seemed to slow down slightly.
In terms of exports, he believes that the external situation in Hong Kong is still grim.
Chen Maobo said that the development of Hong Kong in the past few decades shows that every crisis hides new opportunities and every difficulty hides the key to future development.
The largest earthquake in Taiwan this year occurred in the eastern waters of Taiwan
China News Agency, Taipei, July 26. An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.1 on the Richter scale occurred at 20:52 on the 26 th, with a maximum magnitude of 4. The earthquake was felt in Taiwan, which is the largest earthquake in Taiwan this year.
According to Taiwan media reports such as the Central News Agency, China Times electronic newspaper and ETtoday news cloud, the Taiwan Meteorological Department predicted that the epicenter of the earthquake was 86.5 kilometers southeast of the government of Yilan County, that is, the eastern waters of Taiwan, with a focal depth of 53 kilometers.
China earthquake network determined that the earthquake was 5.5.
The maximum magnitude in all parts of Taiwan is: Hualian County magnitude 4, Yilan County, Taitung County, Nantou County and Yunlin County magnitude 3, and other counties and cities have measures of magnitude 1 to 2.
Taiwan meteorological department pointed out that the earthquake is the largest earthquake in Taiwan this year. It is a subduction zone type earthquake at the junction of plates. Its epicenter has often occurred in the past and has been relatively active since this year.
In the coming week, it is still not ruled out that there will be aftershocks of magnitude 4 or above.
Marinichev said that the change in value is affected by the devaluation of ruble and epidemic.
He said, "The cost of services is increasing.
Because of the epidemic, people began to spend more time on the Internet."
Marinichev does not rule out that Internet prices will rise seriously this year. He believes that operators can provide customers with higher speed and more services to offset people's dissatisfaction with the price increases.
"Chinese Doctor" to pay tribute to anti-epidemic hero-Xinhuanet
Recently, with the respect of Chinese filmmakers for fighting the epidemic heroes, Yu Dong, chairman of Bona Film Group, and Liu Weiqiang (left) had a discussion with Academician Zhong Nanshan in Guangzhou on the shooting and production of the anti-epidemic film "Chinese Doctor".
Bona Film hopes to pay tribute to all the medical and epidemic prevention workers who are fighting in the front line of epidemic prevention and control through "Chinese Doctor"!
In 2021, the film will be released nationwide as a tribute to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China.
At present, Bona film is under the arrangement and deployment of the Central Propaganda Department and the National Film Bureau, and with the support of the Guangdong Film Bureau and the Hubei Film Bureau, the original crew of the film "The Captain of China" is preparing to make the film "Chinese Doctor". This is a film that reflects the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee and the people of the whole country are United as one to fight against the COVID-19 epidemic.
Focusing on the front line of fighting the epidemic in Wuhan, the film will take Wuhan medical staff and medical teams from various provinces and cities in Hubei as the background of the characters, from the perspective of human nature, using unique narrative and powerful camera language to show the touching stories of Chinese medical staff full of dedication and sacrifice in the front line of fighting the epidemic.
It is understood that the first time on the day of the unblocking of Wuhan, Bona company overcame many difficulties and sent a shooting team to go deep into the front line of the epidemic, with hundreds of medical workers face to face and collect information, so far it has interviewed Academician Zhong Nanshan, the first person from Guangzhou to help Wuhan, the medical team of Guangdong to help Hubei, as well as Wuhan Jinyintan hospital, Wuhan Union hospital, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan Central Hospital and so on. A large number of precious first-hand video materials.
Academician Zhong Nanshan also raised expectations and hopes for the filming of the film at this symposium: "I am looking forward to it. I hope that you will not only visit some experts who have made a lot of publicity but also interview more medical staff who are working hard on the front line. They are the majority."
He said that he had seen "Me and My motherland" and "Captain of China" before and thought that the way to tell the story of the big pattern from the perspective of ordinary people is very good.
"Now some foreign friends still have some misunderstandings about China."
When talking about the spread of the film, Academician Zhong Nanshan said that at present, some people abroad like to label the virus as politicized. He hopes that the film can impress the audience from the perspective of human nature: "In addition to being shown in China, this film is best to be shown abroad. It is necessary to impress the audience with the true humanistic spirit in a way that domestic and foreign audiences can understand."
Academician Zhong Nanshan also deeply recalled the film "man to middle age" in the 1980 s."After so many years, I was most impressed by the film after the reform and opening up. At that time, my foreign doctors and friends all went to cry. If "Chinese Doctor" can play such a role, it will be great."
Academician Zhong Nanshan said that if "Chinese Doctor" can resonate with foreign audiences, it will be very successful.
During the discussion and exchange, Academician Zhong Nanshan also shared his opinions and suggestions on the current international epidemic prevention and control."I believe that people are always smarter than viruses."
Academician Zhong Nanshan said that although the virus is difficult to predict, human beings have passed through all kinds of difficulties and dangers since the original society, and now the modern society has developed medical technology and social management measures. In addition, medical staff and even ordinary people all over the world have a basic understanding of scientific response to COVID-19, and people will no longer be as passive as before."Next, we should pay attention to two aspects of work, one is to study how to strengthen cooperation around the world, and the other is to pay attention to soothing people".

Cultural travel "red fruits " gather in Shaoshan
Hunan daily · new Hunan client reporter Jiang Rui correspondent Xiao Yan
On July 25, the 2020 Hunan Red Tourism Culture Festival opened in Shaoshan.
As one of the main activities, the first Xiangtan Red Cultural Industry Expo was held in Shaoshan global tourism consultation and distribution center.
The red cultural and creative products in the exhibition area and local products in the old revolutionary base areas are full of products, attracting tourists from all over the world to buy them.
"This Red Expo is not only a display of the achievements of the national red cultural industry, but also an important platform for exhibitors and enterprises to exchange experiences and explore development paths."
According to the relevant person in charge of the Executive Committee of the first Xiangtan Red Expo, the theme of this Red Expo is "promoting red culture and Booculture and tourism warming up". The total exhibition area is nearly 3,000 square meters, and there are atmosphere building area, scenic area exhibition area and red cultural tourism online shopping experience area.
137 enterprises and units from Jiaxing of Zhejiang, Zunyi of Guizhou, and Yan'an of Shaanxi, as well as Changsha, Zhuzhou, Yuanyang and Chenzhou in our province were invited to participate in the exhibition. A total of 768 kinds of exhibits were exhibited, including red cultural relics, handicrafts, food specialties, tourist routes, red training courses and red cultural and creative products.
The exhibition area will last until July 29.
As the host of the Red Expo, Xiangtan exhibition area is full of bright spots.
According to the person in charge of the exhibition area, Xiangtan exhibition area is divided into two parts: red industry and red cultural industry.
In the red industrial exhibition area, 31 exhibits from 6 enterprises such as Valin Xianggang, Valin Cable, and Xiangdian Power are exhibited. In the red cultural industry development exhibition area, nearly 200 products from 27 units such as red series books, red series food, and red series cultural and creative products.
In the Yan'an exhibition area, many tourists are attracted by the handicrafts and paper-cut works of handicrafts.
Ma Dongpo, director of Yan'an Cultural and Tourism Bureau, introduced that the exhibition carefully selected the excellent red cultural and creative products of Yan'an in the past two years, among which 16 products are the outstanding works of 2019 national red cultural and creative products.
At the same time, they invited the inheritors of the national intangible cultural heritage protection projects "Ansai paper-cut", "Northern Shaanxi folk song" and the provincial intangible cultural heritage project Yanchuan budui painting to focus on promoting Yan'an folk characteristic products, and take this opportunity to communicate with other exhibition area units and enterprises to promote cross-regional cooperation.
There are more than 30,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Japan
According to statistics, there were 239 new confirmed cases in Tokyo on the 26 th, with more than 200 new cases in a single day for six consecutive days, with a total of 11214 cases.
In addition, there were 141 new confirmed cases in Osaka Prefecture, 90 new cases in Fukuoka Prefecture and 80 new cases in Aichi Prefecture.
In the first half of the year, telecommunication network fraud crime rose by 70%
Beijing, July 26 According to the website of the Supreme Procuratorate of the Communist Party of China, in the first half of this year, procuratorial organs across the country prosecuted 58,101 people for fraud, up 35% year on year.
Especially among the crimes against the prevention and control of the epidemic, the number of fraud crimes prosecuted by the procuratorial organs accounts for 43.4% of the total number of crimes against the prevention and control of the epidemic.
The Supreme People's Procuratorate has carried out targeted guidance. Among the ten batches of typical cases involving epidemic prevention and control that have been released so far, there are nine cases involving fraud.
Judging from the cases handling by the procuratorial organs in the first half of the year, there are many kinds of crimes involving fraud in the first half of the year, ranging from the national macro policies to the common people, including epidemic fraud, "medical care" fraud, "health care products" fraud, "enrollment agent" fraud, "routine loan" fraud, fraud of obtaining state subsidies, national assets unfreezing fraud, etc., continue to "innovate the old and bring forth the new and the economic and social development is seriously affected in the fields of education, medical care, employment, pension, social security, land acquisition and demolition, precise poverty alleviation, financial credit and other fields, which not only causes economic losses to the victims, but also seriously affects the economic and social development.
In particular, some telecommunication network frauds break through the restrictions of national boundaries, regions and personnel, and have the characteristics of stakeholders, cross-border, remote, electronic payment, etc. There are many unspecific victims and great harm.
For example, some set up special companies, rent high-end office buildings, set up multiple departments or posts, use legal network platforms for publicity and recruitment, train and assess recruiters, use enterprise operation mode management, and wear "legal coat", which is more confusing.
It is the bounden duty of procuratorial organs to punish and prevent crimes according to law and issue early warning to the public and relevant departments in a timely manner.
In handling judicial cases, procuratorial organs conscientiously perform their duties, not only insisting on maintaining a high pressure on fraud crimes, but also refining various law enforcement measures, and promoting social governance by making and issuing procuratorial suggestions.
The procuratorial organs strictly control the facts, evidence, procedures and application of law in approving and prosecuting fraud cases, and take the facts as the basis and the law as the criterion, so as to ensure that the facts are not in vain.
Especially for telecommunications network fraud crimes, we should pay attention to the core role of electronic data in fact determination, and strive to build the evidence chain of mutual verification among electronic data, verbal evidence and documentary evidence.
For example, the Yinzhou District Procuratorate of Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province dealt with a fraud case involving the epidemic, and the procuratorial organs intervened in advance at the first time. It took only five days from the occurrence of the case to the completion of the case, which reflected the attitude and determination of handling the case quickly and strictly and maintaining the overall social stability.
In the process of examining arrest and prosecution of cases, we should pay attention to the prosecution of missing crimes in cases, correct 733 missing arrests by public security organs, and correct 1,113 missing accomplices by public security organs.
In the first half of the year, procuratorial organs across the country issued 298 procuratorial suggestions on fraud crimes, promoting joint efforts to prevent fraud and promote in-depth governance.
For example, in view of the loopholes found in the supervision of telecommunications networks by telecommunication enterprises, banks and intermediary organizations in the handling of cases, the Guangzhou Procuratorate and Dongguan Procuratorate of Guangdong Province put forward procuratorial suggestions in time, urging relevant units to strengthen supervision, improve mechanisms and promote the construction of long-term system.
The fourth is to do a good job in recovering stolen goods and losses.
The procuratorial organs of all localities seize the important links such as intervening in investigation, guiding the collection of evidence, examining and prosecuting, and urge the investigation organs to actively recover the stolen money, cooperate with the relevant departments to do a good job in recovering the stolen money, and strive to minimize the economic losses caused by fraud crimes to the people.
For example, the Beijing municipal procuratorate of Lin Moumou routine loan case involving 22 sets of real estate waiting to be sealed up. In the case that the real estate may be dealt with in advance by other cases, the property is the first to be issued to the relevant court in a timely manner. It is suggested that the court should suspend the implementation of the property involved in the case and deal with it uniformly after the facts of the crime are found out, so as to make the best efforts to recover the property involved and recover the loss of the victim.
Prosecutors remind everyone that they should be very vigilant against fraud crimes, do not expect "pie in the sky", and do not believe that it is cheap, and keep their "money bag".
Yina Town, Weining County, Guizhou Province
2020-07-2611:42:58 Source: China Economic Net Author: Zhu Yanjing Editor: Zhu Yanjing
In the scorching heat, the reporter of Economic Daily-China Economic Net walked into Zhonghai Village, Yina Town, Weining County, Guizhou Province.
Under the scorching sun, Li Yuanzhong, a villager, was weeding in the base. Although his face was red, he hummed a few songs from time to time.
Weining County, where Yina Town is located in Weining County, due to its low latitude, high altitude, sufficient light and large temperature difference between day and night, high sugar content and good texture, has a certain popularity in the surrounding areas. However, because of its small size and many spots, it has not been able to sell at a good price and form an industrial scale.
Yina Town used to be a poverty-stricken town with a poverty rate of 25.8% 10 years ago. The local poverty rate was as high as 25.8% 10 years ago.
It is urgent to change the traditional planting habits, adjust the industrial structure and increase the income of farmers.
After many visits, Chen Chao, secretary of the party committee of Yina Town, and a group of people in the town thought that the industrial development could no longer follow the old road.
To this end, Yina Town introduced leading enterprises to grow apples in a modern way.
Hou Jianwen, deputy general manager of Weining Chaoyue Agriculture Co., Ltd., came to Yina Town from Shaanxi Province in 2015 for investigation. He saw the local planting conditions at a glance and began to plant apple trees locally in 2016.
At first, the village mobilized Li Yuanzhong to transfer the land to plant apple trees, and Li Yuanzhong and his wife made a mistake in their hearts: "I have planted apples for so many years, and I have not seen anyone in the village who planted apples and made a fortune."
"All the apples are dwarf apples, which will not make the apple trees grow too high."
What Li Yuanzhong did not expect was that a new method was adopted to plant apples this time. Irrigation pipes were laid under each apple tree, and water and fertilizer were poured to the roots of the trees together. When the fruit is harvested in autumn, the tractor drove directly into the orchard and could pick the fruit.
At present, the apple base has gradually entered a high-yield period, and the market is just as Hou Jianwen expected. Apple is not worried about selling, and is deeply loved by consumers in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and other cities.
The growing apple industry has brought new changes to Li Yuanzhong's life. Although he is still farming, he has a new source of income.
Li Yuanzhong's family has more than 9 mu of land transferred to the apple base. Every year, in addition to the guaranteed land transfer fee every year, there are profit dividends after hanging the fruit. The couple usually work in the base."one person can get 80 yuan a day and have work all year round".
Li Yuanzhong told reporters that last year, the profit bonus was more than 2800 yuan, plus the land transfer fee and the couple's working income, the income of the family was more than 80,000 yuan."There is no worry about food and clothing, and a well-off life is already over."
"At present, it has achieved initial results. The annual output value of 1 mu of apples is more than 15,000 yuan, which is about 10 times that of corn."
Chen Chao told reporters that the whole town of Yina has planted 20,000 mu of apples. In Zhonghai village alone, there are 6,000 mu, covering 4,056 households and 172,000 people, including 656 households and 2952 people who are poor in the file and set up a card. The annual salary is more than 6 million yuan, which really realizes that the base is built at home and there is no need to go out to work.
Li Yuanzhong, who has more and more money, also began to realize his "wish".
During the Lunar New Year this year, Li Yuanzhong bought an off-road vehicle. Now he drives to work every day."I still have more than ten acres of land at home. When the Apple base is expanded in the next step, all of them will be transferred to them, and the income will be even more."

Membrane separation technology helps crack the "greenhouse effect"
Membrane separation technology helps crack the "greenhouse effect"
Schematic diagram of preparation technology of new mixed matrix membrane
Our reporter Shang Rui reports: A few days ago, the atmospheric environment and bioenergy team of Tianjin University has made great progress in "carbon dioxide capture by membrane separation" and successfully developed a new mixed matrix membrane preparation technology, greatly improving the carbon dioxide capture performance of membrane materials.
Correlation results have been published as the cover article of the international journal Greenhouse gas: Science and technology.
The "greenhouse effect" is a major environmental problem that haunts human development, and carbon dioxide emission is the culprit of the "greenhouse effect".
How to efficiently capture and use carbon dioxide emitted by human beings is the focus of scientists.
"Membrane separation" is a new carbon dioxide capture technology, which separates carbon dioxide gas with the help of membrane materials, and has the characteristics of high efficiency, energy saving and simple operation.
How to make the membrane material "take a deep breath" and improve the efficiency of gas separation is the bottleneck difficulty of carbon dioxide capture by membrane separation method.
The scientific research team of Tianjin University innovated ideas and explored the influence of different solvents on membrane gas separation performance through repeated experiments.
The experimental results show that using N-methylpyrrolidone as the preparation solvent, the distribution of carbon nanotubes in the membrane material is more uniform and "more permeable", which effectively improves the gas separation efficiency and rate of the membrane material.
The carbon dioxide separation performance of the mixed matrix membrane prepared by this new technology is close to the theoretical separation upper limit of this kind of membrane material.
"The new technology provides a new idea to capture carbon dioxide by membrane separation."
Li Run, a member of the atmospheric environment and bioenergy team of Tianjin University, said: "We hope that this technology can provide strong support for future coal-fired power plants and chemical enterprises to deal with flue gas and play a major role in controlling greenhouse gas emissions and other fields."
Before volunteering to fill in the report

understand what is professional grade difference before volunteering to fill in
Every year, when filling in the college entrance examination, there are students or parents who do not understand the terms involved in the voluntary reporting, which affects the voluntary application.
This year, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing University of Science and Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing Forestry University and Beijing University of Chemical Technology jointly issued the enrollment policy in 2020 to cancel the professional grade difference.
What is the meaning of professional grade difference and what is its significance in voluntary reporting?
There are three ways of professional distribution rules
Experts remind that before filling in the application for volunteer, you must read the "enrollment regulations" of your favorite school and understand the admission rules of colleges and universities, including the proportion of file transfer and the rules of major allocation and so on.
Professional distribution rules refer to the three main ways of professional admission: professional priority, score priority and professional grade difference.
The specific method used by colleges and universities will be specified in the enrollment regulations.
However, the admission principle of some colleges and universities is to give priority to the total score, and there is no difference between majors.
That is to say, the candidates in the admission range will be queued according to the total score. When the score does not reach the first professional volunteer admission score line, it will see whether they have reached the second professional volunteer admission score line, and so on until the admission to the last professional volunteer. There is no grade difference between the professional volunteers.
The so-called "professional grade difference" means that when colleges and universities arrange candidates for their majors, they determine the admission majors of volunteer candidates of different majors according to one or several scores published in the enrollment regulations. This score value is "professional grade difference".
That is to say, the difference between the scores of the first professional volunteer and the non-first professional volunteer of the colleges and universities, and the grade difference scores between the professional volunteers, such as 3 points, 2 points, 1 point and so on.
For example.
Suppose the student Xiao Ming applied for college A and scored 560 points. His professional volunteers are: computer, international trade, automation, mechanical engineering and e-commerce. The professional admission of university A adopts the method of professional grade difference, which is divided into 2 points, 1 point, 1 point and 0 point.
If Xiaoming's first major meets the professional admission requirements and the major has a planned balance, Xiaoming will be admitted to the "computer" major; If the computer is not admitted, his score will be subtracted by 2 points. According to the score of 558 points and the first major volunteers to apply for "international trade" candidates to determine whether they meet the professional admission conditions; If it is still not satisfied, the score will be subtracted by 1 point (namely 557 points) for the third professional volunteer "automatic" admission; If it is still not satisfied, the score will be subtracted by 1 point (556 points) for the admission of the fourth major. If the subsequent major still cannot meet its professional wishes, the score will not be reduced, and so on.
Different universities have different professional grades
With the popularity of parallel volunteer, many colleges and universities have cancelled the professional level difference, but some colleges and universities still retain this method this year. According to the "enrollment regulations" published by various colleges and universities, more than 20 universities have set up professional grade difference this year.
For example, Sichuan Agricultural University, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Heilongjiang University of traditional Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Jiangxi Normal University, Chengdu Medical College, Northeast Dianli University, Jimei University, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing University of Technology, Ningxia University, Shandong University of Technology, China Civil Aviation Flight Academy, etc.
In these universities, each university has a different professional level.
Some colleges and universities have a grade difference in each major, such as Ningxia University. The candidates who have been submitted to the university will be admitted according to the order in which the candidates fill in the professional volunteers.
However, some universities have set different professional grades between different majors.
For example, in Jimei University, the total score of professional volunteer grade difference is 4 points, that is, the grade difference between the first professional volunteer and other professional volunteers is 3 points, and there is no grade difference between other professional volunteers, which is regarded as parallel volunteer, and the professional grade difference between other professional volunteers and adjusted professional volunteers is 1 point.
When filling in their volunteers, candidates and parents must carefully read the admission policy of the school reported to see if there is a professional grade difference and what is the form of the grade difference. While fully considering the scores, they should also reasonably analyze the school and major to be selected. If the colleges and universities adopts the grade difference method for admission in the enrollment regulations, candidates should pay attention to the gradient between the majors when choosing the major, so as to improve the admission rate.

The first Atlantic hurricane of this year landed in Texas, which was hit hard by the epidemic
The U.S. National Hurricane Center announced in the morning that Hurricane Hannah has a speed of 145 kilometers per hour, which is expected to cause heavy rainfall in southern Texas and northeastern Mexico until next Monday, which will lead to rapid flooding.
At present, with the gradual advancement to land, the custom has weakened. Although there are power outages in some areas, there is no statistics report of casualties.
Some local officials in Texas are preparing for a tornado that is likely to appear along the coast.
President Trump said on Twitter that the office is closely monitoring Hurricane Hannah and Hurricane Douglas in Hawaii, and called on people to listen to the emergency management information of the local government to protect family and property.
At the same time, the COVID-19 epidemic in Texas is worsening sharply, with the number of infected people soaring, with more than 390,000 confirmed infections and more than 5,000 deaths.
When the hurricane strikes, the government will face the double problems of sheltering the homeless and preventing the epidemic from worsening again.
