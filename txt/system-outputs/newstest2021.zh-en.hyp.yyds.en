Talents are the key to rural revitalization.
Where to find talents?
Outstanding returning migrant workers are an indispensable new force.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 26 (Xinhua) Title: Turning outstanding returning migrant workers into a new force for rural revitalization
Zhang Xiong, 34, lives in Orchard Village, Meishan City, Sichuan Province. In 2010, he quit his job in Beijing with a monthly salary of tens of thousands and returned home to start a business.
After several years of hard work, the annual income of the grape-growing family farm he runs now exceeds one million yuan, and he has become a well-known leader in getting rich. He has also been selected into the "two committees" of the village.
In recent years, inspired by a series of policies to support agriculture and benefit agriculture, such as national poverty alleviation and rural revitalization, more and more outstanding migrant workers like Zhang Xiong have chosen to return home to start their own businesses, activating a pool of spring water in the countryside.
Sichuan, a province with a large population and a large labor export in western China, has implemented the "Outstanding Migrant Workers Return Training Project" according to the situation. In 2019 alone, more than 8,000 village party branch secretaries, 61,000 village reserve forces and more than 20,000 party members have been generated from the outstanding migrant workers, providing a strong guarantee for winning the battle against poverty and implementing the rural revitalization strategy.
Well-off is not well-off, the key depends on the villagers.
Since the reform and opening up, a large number of young and middle-aged laborers in rural China have gone out to work to increase their income, and some have set up their own enterprises through hard work.
However, objectively, it also leads to the "hollowing out" of rural areas to varying degrees, especially the weakening of rural grass-roots organizations. The village party branch secretaries and party members all show the characteristics of "one old and one low," that is, aging, low academic qualifications, weak village party organization leaders, and outstanding problems.
If rural talents and other factors have been flowing to the city in one direction, and the countryside has been in a state of "blood loss" and "anemia" for a long time, revitalization is empty talk.
Attract those migrant workers who are capable, conscious and interested in serving their hometown, guide them to return home to start businesses and become rich leaders, train them to become party members and rural cadres on the basis of merit, and enrich the ranks of grass-roots cadres. This is the fundamental solution to the problem that the ranks of rural party members and grass-roots party organizations are not connected with each other.
Excellent migrant workers should be brought back, and they should be kept and done well.
In recent years, Sichuan has started with paying close attention to the party building of migrant workers. On the basis of strict selection criteria, it has established institutional mechanisms such as directional introduction, service guarantee, training, selection and use of outstanding migrant workers, so that they can improve their abilities, have security in their work, have hope in their lives, really take root in the countryside, and have a sense of accomplishment in starting a business.
This year is the end of the decisive battle against poverty. Talents are the key factor in the connection between poverty alleviation and rural revitalization.
Party committees and governments at all levels should attach great importance to the group of outstanding returning migrant workers, and through comprehensive measures, turn them into a task force and a new force that can stay, fight and cannot be taken away, so as to provide strong organizational guarantee and talent support for rural poverty alleviation, well-off development and revitalization.
This year's college graduates are very special because of the epidemic. On the evening of July 11, the bilibili summer graduation song will bring a special live online performance for the graduates. Musicians such as Lao Wolf, Pu Shu, Li Yuchun and Mao Yi sent songs and blessings to the fresh graduates.
SealWu Wu Yifan, a well-known up master, also brought a "Wild Grass," a rap song adapted from Lu Xun's prose poems of the same name, which is very popular among young people.
Due to the epidemic situation, many graduates failed to experience the ritual sense of picking ears and awarding degree certificates on the spot, so they transferred the ritual sense to the online.
Data show that the 2.5-hour concert has a peak popularity of more than 35 million.
"Follow your heart, seize the opportunity, regardless of the consequences, sometimes there will be unexpected gains."
Although it is a graduation song party, many songs also move non-fresh graduates.
"I really want to cry when I look at the whole scene. Everyone's youth is full of beauty and regret, but it is worth remembering and going on bravely."
Beijing's natural ecology continues to improve, attracting more than 500 species of wildlife cities to "settle down" -Chinanews.com

The natural ecology of the capital continues to improve, attracting wildlife cities to "settle down"
There are more than 500 species of wild animals in Beijing
(Reporter Wang Bin) A reporter from Beijing Youth Daily learned from the Municipal Bureau of Landscaping and Greening that in recent years, with the continuous improvement of the capital's natural ecological environment, the species and number of wild animals have also continued to increase.
At present, the number of terrestrial vertebrate wild animals inhabiting Beijing has increased to more than 500 species, including national first-class protected animals such as brown pheasant and black stork, as well as national second-class protected animals such as impala, swan, gray crane and mandarin duck.
Whether it is planted into urban forests everywhere in the Second Ring Road or embedded in small and micro wetlands between buildings, it not only brings the wild interest of nature to the citizens of the capital, but also attracts wild animals to "settle" in the city.
In midsummer, Songshan National Nature Reserve, located in the Yanshan Mountains in the northwest of Yanqing District, is full of vitality.
A raccoon dog was playing leisurely by the mountain stream, while two badgers were fighting with each other.
Looking back, a wild boar couldn't help scratching his body and was rubbing against the bark. Hu Qiaoli, director of the Songshan National Nature Reserve Management Office, said that by the end of 2019, there were 178 species of wild animals living in this green sea with a total area of more than 6,200 hectares, including the national first-class protected animal golden eagle and the national second-class protected animal spoon chicken and impala. Nearly one third of the wild animal species in the city can be found here.
"In Songshan, wild animals are the real 'masters', and our staff can only be regarded as the 'bodyguards' of others at best."
Hu Qiaoli said that in order to understand the situation of wildlife in the reserve on the spot, more than 30 professional patrol members patrol along 16 carefully formulated protection routes every day, and there will be a "big circle" every month, spending a whole day almost all over the reserve.
"During inspections, we should not only check and record biodiversity, but also check and install artificial bird nests, rescue injured wild animals, install field infrared cameras, and so on."
More than 200 infrared cameras have been installed in Songshan National Nature Reserve to record the living conditions of wild animals in the forest.
Hu Qiaoli introduced that with the continuous enrichment of biodiversity in the reserve in recent years, more and more wild animals appear in the camera, leopard cats, raccoon dogs and pig badgers have become "resident guests," and the "appearance rate" of impala, a national second-class protected animal, is also getting higher and higher.
Zhang Zhiming, director of the Wildlife and Wetland Protection Division of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Landscaping and Greening, said that the number of terrestrial vertebrate wild animals in Beijing has increased from 461 in 1994 to more than 500 now, and the species and number of wild animals in Beijing have continued to increase in recent years.
Wild animals are becoming more and more common in cities, which is closely related to the continuous upgrading of greening in capital cities in recent years.
In particular, the new round of afforestation and greening construction of one million mu that began in 2018 proposes to reshape the urban ecological environment, enhance the ecological function of woodland and green space, and highlight the concept of "near nature."
The planning strives to achieve interconnection and interaction with the surrounding green space, so as to facilitate wild animals to "visit relatives and friends," and the trees planted are also honey and food plants that animals love.
Black land "grows" agricultural modernization-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 26. Title: Black land "grows" agricultural modernization
In midsummer, two spraying planes passed by the 10,000-mu high-yield demonstration field in the second operation station of the fifth management area of Friendship Farm, forming two white lines. The characters "the first field in the world" planted with black rice seedlings in the green fields were particularly eye-catching.
Kong Lingqiang, the head of the operation station, said that this kind of plane can spray drugs on more than 6,000 mu of cultivated land a day, and its efficiency is about 8 times that of unmanned aerial vehicles and hundreds of times that of manual labor.
This farm is located in Youyi County, Heilongjiang Province, China's largest grain-producing province. From the sound of rice cutting in the past to the sound of rumbling now, traditional Chinese farming and farms have transformed in this black soil belt.
In addition to airplanes, satellites are also used in modern agricultural production at Friendship Farm.
Kong Lingqiang introduced that on the one hand, they use satellite remote sensing technology to achieve precise fertilization, reduce agricultural investment and reduce pollution; on the other hand, satellite navigation technology can improve the standardized operation level of agricultural machinery in the field.
In the process of rice production this year, the farm expanded the operating area of satellite navigation unmanned transplanting technology from 3,000 mu last year to 30,000 mu.
This technology makes seedling planting more uniform, maximizes the utilization of sunlight and cultivated land resources, and saves labor costs of 16 yuan per mu.
Farms try new technologies such as informatization and intelligence in agricultural production, forming the largest agricultural machinery group in China from the ground to the sky.
According to statistics, at present, the total number of farm machinery is 49,000 units (pieces), and the comprehensive mechanization rate in the field is 99.8%.
Agricultural machinery operations achieve 100% GPS satellite navigation, 100% precision sowing in dry fields, and 100% high-power locomotive operations in dry fields.
"Green agriculture, smart agriculture and digital agriculture are the exploration direction of agricultural modernization."
Liu Hualian, director of Friendship Farm, said.
The key to agricultural modernization lies in scientific and technological progress.
In recent years, Heilongjiang Agricultural Reclamation, represented by farms, has played a leading role in demonstrating and leading the "aircraft carrier" of modern agriculture, and has initially established a modern agricultural industrial system dominated by large-scale planting, standardized production and industrialized management.
In the suburb of Youyi County, there is an agricultural machinery Expo Park covering an area of 350,000 square meters.
More than 140 sets (pieces) of agricultural machinery introduced and used by Heilongjiang Reclamation over the years are on display here.
These agricultural machinery and farms have witnessed the development of China's agricultural modernization.
Give up a small family for everyone-Anhui Hefei Jiangkou River Lianwei Mass Transfer Direct Attack-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, July 26 (Xinhua) Title: Give up small family for everyone-Anhui Hefei Jiangkou River Lianwei Mass Transfer Direct Attack
Xinhua News Agency reporters Chen Shangying, Wang Liwu and Liu Xia Village
At 4 o'clock in the afternoon on July 25, Fu Kunbao, wearing mud-covered rubber shoes, went from the front room to the back room, and his wife Zhou Yan was busy packing things back and forth.
"I received a call from the village cadre to transfer, and I was still weeding in the field."
Fu Kunbao said that he transferred more than 60 mu of land and planted rice, and now he is growing well. "I took medicine yesterday, and I haven't cleaned up my tools."
Fu Kunbao pointed to the pesticide sprayer placed in the corner. "No one wants to be flooded at home, let's give up a small home for everyone."
In response to the continuous high water level pressure and possible heavy rainfall in Chaohu Lake, Hefei City, Anhui Province is preparing to open the Jiangkou River Lianwei, where Fu Kunbao's family is located, for flood diversion and storage on the 26th.
Jiangkou River Lianwei is located in Feixi County, close to Chaohu levee.
There are thousands of villagers involved in Yandian Township and Sanhe Town who need to be transferred.
As of 16: 00 on the 25th, the water level of Chaohu Lake, the fifth largest freshwater lake in China, remained at a high level of 13.2 meters, exceeding the guaranteed water level by 0.7 meters.
Fu Kunbao's kitchen is clean, with a pot of pumpkin head vegetables on the table, eggs and some gravy in the fridge.
"I didn't expect to move. The water in Jiangkou River looks good at present."
Zhou Yan said that the home is a bungalow, and some large objects have not yet been decided where to put them.
"Pack up your valuables first. Large items such as refrigerators and televisions can be temporarily placed in high-lying neighbors or relatives."
Wang Liwen, a village cadre, gave Fu Kunbao advice.
Wang Liwen was responsible for the transfer and resettlement of 13 villagers, and notified each household to confirm each person's resettlement plan.
The nearest settlement to Fu Kunbao's home is Su Primary School in Yandian Township, about 2 kilometers away.
In addition to the big items, Fu Kunbao and his wife also have a headache of more than 1000 jin of grain and some newly bought furniture.
"The food is ready to be dragged to relatives' homes, and the furniture can't be moved."
After a discussion, the couple put a stool under the newly bought bed and raised the bed by about half a meter.
At 6 p.m., Fu Kunbao began to transport things to relatives' homes by tricycle, and Zhou Yan continued to clean up at home.
At 11 o'clock in the evening, the couple watched it back and forth at home, turned on the switch, and prepared to go to the resettlement site.
"I hope the water will return soon."
Fu Kunbao said.
At 9: 30 a.m. on July 26, the reporter saw at the scene of Jiangkou River Lianwei that the local area had made various preparations before flood diversion.
Zhang Jiklin Xiaozhai formed a team to support muscular teenagers-Xinhuanet
The sports youth hot-blooded competitive show "sports youth" officially landed on Hunan Satellite TV on July 11.
Zhang Jike, the sports leader, and Lin Xiaozhai, the sports assistant, cross the border on the same stage. Lin Dan and Fu Yuanhui commented on their respective styles, and the hard core of the "giant" -like power pulling device came on stage, which made the program "burning."
In the first episode, 11 sports teenagers appeared on the power track, and their appearance surprised the audience. At the same time, the "strong conflict," "strong confrontation" and "strong heart" on the competition stage also attracted attention.
Among them, the "strong conflict" comes from Qiao Wenyi, a super A sports student. Before the race, he openly provoked Xu Zhibin, who is known as a "beautiful man" on the track, choking that Xu Zhibin's appearance conditions should go to sing and dance programs, and even released the cruel words of "Don't cry your make-up if you lose."
Some remarks made the teenagers and sports leaders on the field take a breath.
The "strong confrontation" is more like a fairy fight. Sun Jianqi, known as the "Great Demon King," met the equally powerful Zhang Xindong and staged a strong confrontation.
Their identities are also unexpected. Sun Jianqi is an actor who loves fitness, and Zhang Xindong is a retired special operations player and a three-time winner of the Warrior Medal.
At the beginning of the competition, the two teenagers tried their best to pull out the small pole quickly, and the lasting confrontation on the big pole made the audience sweat for them.
Under the tense competition situation, Zhang Jike, as one of the sports leaders of "Sports Bar Youth," also watched the game carefully.
In the comment session, he was also very careful, patiently encouraging the teenagers who lost the game and helping every mistake in the process of resuming the game.
Lin Xiaozhai, a sports assistant, is a fancy assist. She makes no secret of her appreciation for the teenagers who are online.
When learning about the overloaded daily training of sports teenagers, they are even more admired.
Lin Dan and Fu Yuanhui, who are also sports leaders, have their own styles. One is a calm "prophet" and the other is a "wild girl" who dispels tension with a smile.
In addition, Ji Kejingyi and Liu Ye, as sports assistants, have also created many hilarious topics around sports teenagers.
Church fire in Nantes, France: parish volunteers admit to arson
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) According to foreign media reports, on July 18, the famous St. Peter's and St. Paul's Cathedral in Nantes, France, was seriously damaged in a fire, and the organ was completely destroyed.
On the 26th local time, the Nantes prosecutor announced that a parish volunteer in charge of security work in the cathedral had been charged with "arson and destruction."
He has admitted that he started the fire in the church.
According to the report, local prosecutor Senas said that the 39-year-old parish volunteer from Rwanda admitted that he set fire to three places in the cathedral at night.
The person's lawyer said that the arsonist now regrets doing such a thing.
This person entered France through asylum a few years ago, was sheltered in the parish where the fire occurred, and was taken in in the church.
The prosecution pointed out that recently, he tried to renew his visa and was in dialogue with the police station.
However, the church said it still could not believe that this usually very kind, smiling but not very talkative believer would destroy the church he loved so much.
On the day of the fire on July 18, the volunteer had already been questioned and investigated by the police because of the illogical problems in the narrative, but he was later released.
The picture shows firefighters rescuing at the scene.
On the evening of the 25th, as professional engineers in the laboratory of the Paris Central Police Department obtained new evidence, this person was arraigned again.
This time, the man admitted his arson.
According to reports, if convicted of intentional arson and destruction, the suspect could face 10 years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros.
According to the report, the fire caused serious losses to St. Pierre and St. Paul's Cathedral. The organ in the church was completely burned, and the stained glass window behind the organ was also seriously damaged.
Brunet, the chief architect of French historic buildings, believes that it is conservatively estimated that the restoration of Nantes Cathedral will take at least three years.
Comprehensive news: US unilateralism undermines relations between the two countries. International public opinion supports China's countermeasures against the United States-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26-Comprehensive Xinhua News Agency foreign reporters reported: On the morning of July 24, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the US Embassy in China that China had decided to revoke the establishment and operation license of the US Consulate General in Chengdu, and put forward specific requirements for the Consulate General to stop all business and activities.
International public opinion believes that the unilateral measures taken by the United States have caused serious troubles to Sino-US relations, and it is legitimate and necessary for China to respond to the unreasonable provocation of the United States and take countermeasures.
Andres Bolks, director of the China Studies Center of the Institute of International Studies of the University of Chile, said that the unilateral measures of the United States have destroyed the bridge of understanding between the Chinese and American peoples and caused a crisis in the relations between the two major powers.
China's notification to the United States to close its Consulate General in Chengdu is a counter-measure to the unilateral measures taken by the United States and is in line with diplomatic practice.
Patricio Giusto, a professor at the Catholic University of Argentina and director of the Arab-Chinese Research Center, believes that China's above decision is a legitimate and necessary countermeasure to the previous provocation of the United States, not against ordinary Americans.
The United States is trying to divert the attention of the American people by pressuring China to cover up its weak response to the new crown epidemic.
Bambang Suryono, chairman of the Asian Innovation Research Center, an Indonesian think tank, said that the provocative diplomatic posture adopted by the United States has caused serious troubles to Sino-US relations, which are facing severe challenges.
China's notification to the United States to close its Consulate General in Chengdu is a normal countermeasure and is in line with diplomatic practice. It not only reflects China's principled position of resolutely safeguarding its own interests, but also reflects the rationality, advantages and restraint of China's diplomacy.
Tanzanian current affairs commentator Francis Semwenza said that China's above decision is a legitimate and necessary response to the provocation of the United States.
Sino-US relations should return to normal, and the US side should take the initiative to improve its relations with China and stop interfering in China's internal affairs.
The United States should focus on how to achieve win-win results with China economically and politically, and how to benefit the two peoples and even the entire international community.
Ali Yusuf, executive director of the Sudan-based Federation of Arab-Chinese Friendship Associations, said that the countermeasures China was forced to take were a legitimate and necessary response to the unreasonable actions of the United States, in line with international law and the basic norms of international relations, as well as diplomatic practices.
Earlier, the US side's request to close the Chinese Consulate General in Houston seriously violated international law and the basic norms of international relations.
It is hoped that the US side will rescind its previous relevant decisions and create necessary conditions for bilateral relations to return to normal.
Singapore's Lianhe Zaobao published an editorial saying that the greater strategic intention of the United States is to contain China and prevent China from continuing to rise.
In the face of the pressing steps of the United States, although China is very reluctant to see Sino-US relations continue to deteriorate, it has to take countermeasures.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 26 (Reporter Mao Xin) The reporter learned from the Guangdong Maritime Police Bureau that recently, the bureau, in conjunction with Guangzhou Customs and public security departments, smashed a large smuggling gang of refined oil products, and preliminarily verified that the gang had smuggled about 120,000 tons of refined oil products since 2019, with a case value of about 800 million yuan and tax evasion of about 240 million yuan.
The Guangdong Maritime Police Bureau and the Customs Anti-smuggling Department have gradually found out the division of labor and organizational structure of the gang.
On July 8, the marine police, customs and public security departments carried out unified net collection operations in Guangzhou, Foshan and other places as well as in the Pearl River Estuary, and seized four ships suspected of smuggling on the spot, seized a total of 4,700 tons of refined oil products in the ships involved and oil depots, and frozen a number of capital accounts.
It is understood that a total of 8 ships and 2 helicopters were dispatched in this joint operation, which was divided into multiple action groups to work together to crack down on smuggling at sea and illegal operations on land, and all 35 major criminal suspects arrived at the case.
At present, the case is under further investigation.
The relevant person in charge of Guangdong Maritime Police Bureau said that in the future, it will continue to maintain a high-pressure situation, crack down on all kinds of illegal and criminal smuggling activities at sea, and maintain a good order in the sea area under its jurisdiction.
Hurricane "Hannah" makes landfall in the United States or causes river surge and flash floods-Zhongxin.com
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) -According to foreign media reports, Hurricane Hannah landed in Texas at 5: 00 p.m. local time on the 25th, which will bring strong winds and torrential rain, soaring rivers and possibly life-threatening flash floods to Texas.
The National Hurricane Center said that Hurricane Hannah is expected to carry heavy rain across parts of southern and northeastern Texas, which may cause some streams to soar and life-threatening flash floods.
According to the report, the area south of Corpus Christi to the mouth of the Rio Grande River is the most seriously affected by Hurricane Hannah, and a large-scale flash flood may break out in the Rio Grande Valley.
Texas Governor Abbott said on the 25th: "Any hurricane is a huge challenge."
Thirty-two counties in the state have declared a disaster emergency due to the hurricane.
Corpus Christi, a city with a population of more than 320,000, has closed libraries and museums, and residents are waiting.
Abbott also said that when Texas is being hit hard by COVID-19, the hurricane can't bring more casualties to Texas.
According to reports, precipitation in southern Texas is expected to reach 6 to 12 inches on the night of the 26th, and 3 to 5 inches of rainfall will also occur in northern Texas and coastal areas of Louisiana.
Due to global warming and other factors, "Hannah" formed earlier than the previous Atlantic hurricane season.
Under normal circumstances, the first hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean usually does not form until mid-August.
Poland to withdraw from European treaty to prevent violence against women
Poland will take steps next week to withdraw from the European Treaty on the Prevention of Violence against Women, the Polish Ministry of Justice said Saturday.
Poland's right-wing government cabinet said the treaty required schools to teach students about gender issues, trampling on the rights of students' parents.
Polish Justice Minister Joblo held a press conference and said that his Ministry of Justice will submit a request to the Ministry of Labor and Family on Monday to begin withdrawing from the treaty.
That treaty is also known as the Istanbul Convention.
Gioblo said, "the treaty contains some elements of meaning-form nature that we consider to be harmful."
Poland's ruling Law and Justice Party and its ruling coalition partners have a close alliance with the Roman Catholic Church and advocate a conservative social agenda.
Polish President Duda made hostility to gay rights one of the main issues during his successful re-election campaign this month.
On Friday, thousands of Poles, most of them women, protested against withdrawing from the Convention in Warsaw and other cities.
"The purpose of withdrawing from the treaty is to legalize domestic violence," Lempat, one of the organizers of the protest, said at a protest march in Warsaw.
Some protesters held banners that read "Law and Justice Party is a hell for women."
The Law and Justice Party has long complained about the Istanbul Convention.
Poland's previous centrist government ratified the convention in 2015.
The Law and Justice Party government said the treaty did not respect religion and required liberal social policies to be taught in schools.
However, up to now, the party has not decided to withdraw from the Convention.

Upgraded Russian helicopter gunship card-52M left the factory for the first time at the end of the year-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 25-According to the plan of the Russian Ministry of Defense, the upgraded version of the Russian armed helicopter (hereinafter referred to as Wuzhi) Ka-52, Ka-52M, will be transformed and shipped for the first time in December this year, and the model will be greatly improved in reconnaissance, communication and weapon performance.
According to a recent report in Russia's Izvestia newspaper, Wuzhika-52M is called "Super Alligator." Its development contract was signed by the Russian military and military units in April last year. At present, the first batch of two upgraded Wuzhika-52M is undergoing transformation and replacement at the Far East Helicopter Manufacturing Plant of Russia's "Progress" Aerospace Corporation, and its national testing and improvement work will be completed before October 2022.
According to Russian experts familiar with the above upgrade work, Wuzhika-52, the "predecessor" of "Super Alligator," was officially installed in November 2011. Some weaknesses were exposed in the use of this model, and this transformation and upgrade is just to "make up for shortcomings."
The report said that compared with the Ka-52, the Ka-52M will partially use new protective materials that will not increase weight, and its pilot cockpit will be reinforced and equipped with new equipment to resist missile attacks, thus increasing the survival probability of the battlefield; assemble more powerful generators to power more complex airborne electronic equipment; upgrade the photoelectric system to be able to detect and identify battlefield targets farther apart; The new light multi-purpose missile equipped with mainly attacking armored combat vehicles and reinforced concrete fortifications has a range of 20 kilometers, which is about double the range of similar missiles used by Russia's active military forces; its defense weapons and communication equipment will be used to the maximum extent with the Mi-28NM helicopter gunship that can attack air targets, thus making related maintenance simple and economical.
In addition, the Ka-52M will have more advanced electronic guidance systems, weapon aiming systems and navigation equipment.
Russian experts also said that it is worth paying attention to that the card-52M will be equipped with communication equipment to communicate with drones, so as to obtain real-time information transmitted by nearby drones in the air, such as displaying images taken by drones on the cockpit screen of the helicopter.
According to the plan, the pilot of the Ka-52M can directly control the UAV with which it cooperates, thus improving the pilot's mastery of the battlefield situation and the guidance of long-range missiles.
According to Russian media reports, Russian Deputy Defense Minister Krivoruchko said in December last year that the Russian Defense Ministry plans to purchase more than 110 Wuzhika-52M by 2027.

Xinhua News Agency, Shijiazhuang, July 26 (Reporter Wang Kun) The reporter learned from the Hebei Provincial Water Resources Department that since the beginning of this year, Hebei Province has made overall use of river diversion water and local reservoir water, and has successively implemented ecological water replenishment to 28 rivers such as Hutuo River, Tanghe River and Juma River and Baiyangdian River, accumulating 1.75 billion cubic meters of ecological water replenishment of rivers and lakes.
Hebei Province firmly grasped the favorable opportunity of increasing the flow of water in the middle line of the South-to-North Water Transfer Project, and implemented ecological water replenishment to Tanghe River, Shahe River, Zhulong River and other rivers by using river water diversion.
At the same time, nine large and medium-sized reservoirs such as Xidayang and Dongwushi and Baiyangdian have been used to replenish ecological water to Fuyang River, Qinglong River and other rivers, with a cumulative water surface area of more than 90 square kilometers.
In order to do a good job in ecological water replenishment, the Hebei Provincial Water Resources Department actively organized the investigation of hidden dangers of water replenishment rivers, rectification and reinforcement, and river cleaning, refined practical measures, and strengthened inspection, management and protection.
Through supervision and inspection and centralized unannounced visits, all kinds of problems were solved in time to ensure the safety and order of river water replenishment.
According to the relevant person in charge of Hebei Provincial Water Resources Department, the orderly implementation of ecological water replenishment of rivers and lakes has effectively restored the ecological environment of rivers and lakes in Hebei Province, promoted the replenishment and conservation of groundwater along the coast, greatly improved the living environment and economic development environment along the line, and is of great significance to the realization of the river and lake management and protection goal of "clear water, green banks, smooth rivers and beautiful scenery."
(Deutsche Welle Chinese website) In the past two weeks, the number of confirmed new crown cases in Spain has risen sharply, with thousands of new cases appearing in many days.
The British government temporarily decided on Saturday night (July 25) to remove Spain from the safe travel list from 0: 00 local time on the 26th, and people entering the UK from Spain must be quarantined for 14 days.
British tourists on holiday in Spain expressed surprise, worry and even anger when they heard of the decision, because the news came suddenly and caught people off guard.

The beaches in these areas are overcrowded and it is impossible to maintain social distance between people. The police once needed to take measures to reduce the number of beach tourists.
Tourism is an important pillar industry in Spain
Spain: It's safe here
In response to the British decision, the Spanish Foreign Ministry said on Sunday that the epidemic in the country was under control.
Spanish Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya stressed to the media: "Spain is safe, not only for Spaniards, but also for tourists."
The Spanish government will try to persuade the British government to exclude the Balearic Islands and Canary Islands from the quarantine measures.
The reason is that the infection rate in these two tourist resorts is much lower than that in the UK.
In order to prevent the spread of the epidemic, Catalonia, Spain, has also restarted the "foot ban."
Tourism is an important pillar industry in Spain, and Spain is one of the most popular resorts for British tourists.
The British decision is expected to greatly affect Spain's tourism industry.

Engine may stall FAA urgent order to check 2000 Boeing airliners-Xinhuanet
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an emergency airworthiness directive on the 24th, requiring an emergency inspection of about 2,000 Boeing 737NG and 737Classic passenger aircraft registered in the United States, because the corrosion of the air check valves of the above passenger aircraft may cause the engine to stop in the air.
The FAA said that so far, it has received four reports of engine parking of 737NG and 737Classic passenger planes in the air, so it has made an emergency inspection request. The inspection targets are passenger planes that have been parked continuously for 7 days or more and passenger planes that have flown less than 11 times so far after re-entering the flight.
The FAA warned that if the stage 5 check valves of all two engines of the airliner are corroded, they may get stuck in the open position, causing the airliner to lose power completely and unable to restart the engine.
The aviation regulator ordered that once the check valve is found to be corroded, the airline operator must replace this key component before the passenger plane is put into use again.
Boeing responded later that day that the COVID-19 outbreak had reduced travel demand, and many passenger planes had been sealed up or used less, and "check valves were more vulnerable to corrosion."
Boeing also said that it has advised airline operators to inspect the passenger aircraft involved in the order, and if problems are found, Boeing will provide assistance in overhauling and replacing check valves.
The Associated Press reported that passenger planes owned by major US airline operators usually fly several times a day, but after the outbreak of the new crown epidemic, a large number of passenger planes have been grounded; with the recent slow growth of passenger travel demand, some passenger planes have been put into operation again.
The FAA did not release the details of the four air parking reports.
Alaska Airlines disclosed one of the incidents later on the 24th.
The airline operator said in a statement that one of its passenger planes was en route from Seattle, Washington to Austin, Texas on July 15 when an engine suddenly stopped, and the passenger plane finally made an emergency landing at Austin Airport.
Alaska Airlines said it had replaced the engine of the passenger plane and had inspected the engines of six passenger planes in accordance with FAA instructions.
American Airlines, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines said on the 24th that their passenger planes did not have engine flameout associated with air check valves.
Four American Airlines aircraft will be inspected and 28 United Airlines aircraft will be inspected.
Delta Air Lines said it would inspect its 20 passenger planes, but did not say whether there had been engine flameout.
According to several media reports, the FAA's emergency airworthiness directive is another impact on Boeing.
A Boeing 737MAX passenger plane of Indonesian Lion Airlines and Ethiopian Airlines crashed in October 2018 and March 2019 respectively, killing 346 people in total.
This series of passenger planes were subsequently grounded worldwide, stopped production in January this year, and resumed production in May.
FAA Director Steve Dixon admitted in June that the FAA "made a mistake" in the supervision of Boeing on the 737MAX passenger plane.

Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, July 26. Zhang Jianzong, Chief Secretary for Administration of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, said on the 26th that the epidemic situation of new crown pneumonia in Hong Kong continues to be severe. If the epidemic situation deteriorates, the SAR Government will decisively take stricter control measures to further restrict the business of business premises and reduce the space for citizens to go out.

On the same day, Zhang Jianzong published a blog entitled "The situation is grim and fight against the epidemic."
He said that this wave of epidemic is the most severe in half a year, and the next two weeks will be crucial to prevent the virus from spreading further in the community.
In addition to the necessary measures taken by the SAR Government, self-discipline and cooperation among the public are also very important.
He called on citizens to stay at home as much as possible and reduce social contact and dining out.
Members of the public should cooperate with the compulsory measures of wearing masks to protect themselves and others, pay attention to personal and environmental hygiene and wash their hands frequently. They should also suspend unnecessary gatherings or dinners of relatives and friends and reduce them to markets.

The "Nutrition Agent" of the History of the Party and the History of New China
2020-07-26 17: 37: 29 Source: People's Forum Network Author: Zhu Yanjing Editor: Zhu Yanjing
Recently, when visiting the Siping Campaign Memorial Hall, General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed: "Let 1.4 billion people, more than 90 million party members, especially leading cadres at all levels, learn the history of the Communist Party of China and the history of New China well."
Studying the history of the Party and the history of New China conscientiously is a compulsory course for Party members and cadres not to forget their initiative and keep in mind their mission. They should draw rich nourishment from it, cultivate the feelings of their families and countries, and take the Long March of the new era.
A magnificent history of the Party and the history of New China records the hard struggle and glorious course of the Communist Party of China since its birth, and shows the belief and loyalty forged by the Communists with their lives and blood, and the original intention and mission that they will always stick to.
History is the best textbook. For party members and cadres, the history of the party and the history of New China are the brightest chapters in this textbook.
Every party member and cadre should constantly strengthen the historical thinking of taking history as a lesson and moving towards the future, base on the new journey and new mission, take the "baton" of the times, and take the long march of the present generation.
Cast the soul with history and stick to the original mission in studying the history of the Party and the history of New China.
Turning over the history of the Party and the history of New China, it is full of the eternal original mission and rock-solid belief of the Chinese Communists, which shows the simple feelings that the Communists will always be with the people.
To get a close understanding of the important events, important meetings and important figures in the history of the Party and New China is not only an intuitive spiritual shock and ideological baptism, but also a deep understanding of the connotation of the original belief and the weight of the mission.
For party members and cadres, if they want to continuously sharpen their initial mission and always maintain their advanced nature, they must find the origin and fulcrum of our initial intention from the history of the party and the history of New China, maintain a clear understanding and firm stand, stir up the strength to fight bravely for the country and the people, and ensure that the red rivers and mountains laid by the revolutionary ancestors with blood and life are handed down from generation to generation.
It is wise to study history and inherit the noble spirit in the study of party history and the history of New China.
Since the founding of the Communist Party of China, it has successively shaped a series of great spirits such as the Red Boat Spirit, Jinggangshan Spirit, Long March Spirit, Yan'an Spirit, Anti-Japanese War Spirit, Xibaipo Spirit, "Two Bombs and One Star" Spirit and Space Spirit.
These great spirits precipitated by history provide a strong spiritual incentive for our party to overcome various risks and challenges on the way forward. They are precious spiritual wealth that cannot be defeated, washed away or robbed.
The process of learning the history of the Party and China is a process of revisiting these spirits and shaping one's own spirit. We should consciously take the lofty spirit of the revolutionary ancestors as a mirror, stick to the spiritual home of the Communists, build a solid spiritual foundation for advancing the great cause and realizing the great dream, inherit and carry forward these spirits, and glow with the light of the new era.
Read history and introspect, and keep positive and eliminate evil in the study of party history and the history of New China.
For party members and cadres, there has never been any history that can bring more profound warning, enlightenment and reference than the history of the party and the history of New China.
In the history of the Party and the history of New China, we can not only see the great deeds of the older generation of revolutionaries who are determined to devote themselves to their beliefs and persevere in their struggle to achieve the set goals, but also see the profound lessons of some figures who have shaken their ideals and beliefs and walked to the opposite side of the revolution, which enlighten and warn us to never stagnate and never slacken off with firm determination and will, always maintain a full and tenacious fighting spirit, constantly purify the party spirit and cultivate self-discipline.
If you want to truly become a firm believer and faithful practitioner of the lofty ideal of communism, you need to brush off the ideological "dust" and strictly prevent "dirt" from dyeing your body. Party history and the history of New China should be the basis for every party member and cadre to examine and warn himself.
Knowing history is inspirational, and bravely shouldering the important tasks of the times in studying the history of the Party and the history of New China.
General Secretary Xi Jinping once pointed out: "Studying party history and national history is a compulsory course for adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics and pushing forward the various undertakings of the party and the country."
Looking back at history and asking about the original heart, in order to continue to be glorious and move towards the future.
Every party member and cadre should take the study of party history and the history of New China as a lifelong pursuit, constantly set the course of life in the study, bravely shoulder the historical mission, dare to take responsibility and take the initiative in their respective jobs.
Adhere to the reference and guidance of the advanced deeds of the older generation of revolutionaries, constantly polish the political nature of the Communists, maintain the struggle attitude of striving for every day and striving for every achievement, and the more difficult and dangerous the spirit of struggle, and write their own brilliant stroke in the vast journey of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
Pursuing the Poetic "Yellow River Dream" -Zhongxin.com
(China's Poverty Reduction Story) Pursuing the Poetic "Yellow River Dream"
China News Service, Yinchuan, July 26 (Yang Di) "Jiuqu Yellow River thousands of miles of sand, waves and winds from the end of the world."
The Yellow River, which aroused the pride of countless literati, gave birth to the beautiful and rich Ningxia Plain. Nowadays, Ningxia, which has the reputation of "blocking the south of the Yangtze River," is adhering to the concept of "ecological priority and green development" and pursuing the poetic "Yellow River Dream."
River clear water beautiful "blue wave dream"
"The Yellow River in the world is rich in Ningxia," and the Yellow River flows 397 kilometers through Ningxia, which is the "mother river" that nurtures one side.
However, with the rapid advancement of industrialization and urbanization, the development, utilization, management and protection of rivers and lakes are out of balance, and chaos such as excessive sewage discharge, reclamation of lakes and encroachment on water areas are highlighted, resulting in black and smelly water bodies, excessive water quality, dirty environment and ecological degradation.
Now, Ningxia is promoting the diverse restoration of water ecology and striving to return the Yellow River to its beautiful and clear waters.
Water control should start from the source.
In Yinchuan, Ningxia, the local government adopted the method of "standard raising + pollution control + strict management." All sewage in the industrial park was treated centrally, all urban sewage treatment plants were discharged according to Class A standard, and the black and smelly water bodies in the urban built-up areas were basically eliminated. The third batch of China's black and smelly water demonstration cities were successfully declared.
In addition, Ningxia fully implemented the river and lake chief system in 2017, and now it has achieved full coverage of the five-level river and lake chief responsibility system in districts, cities, counties and villages, and long river patrols have become the norm.
Gu Jincheng, 64, lives in a village by the Yellow River. He witnessed the changes of the Yellow River: "The water used to smell bad, but the smell disappeared after remediation."
Gu Jincheng said that the ecological environment is better and his life is more comfortable. Now he often goes for a walk along the Yellow River with his family to feel the clear water and blue sky.
Sha Luoxiangji's "Wetland Dream"
Birds, green trees, plank roads, clear water... The beautiful scenery of Fan Zhongyan's "Sha Luoxiangji" has become a reality in the Yellow River Wetland Park in Yinchuan, Ningxia.
The Yellow River flows through Ningxia, forming river wetlands, lake wetlands, marsh wetlands and other wetlands along the way, which plays an important role in promoting the rational utilization of water resources and water ecological balance, and has also become an important international bird migration channel.
Since 2009, relevant departments in Ningxia have invested about 3.45 billion yuan in wetland protection projects. At present, Yinchuan wetland covers an area of 19,200 hectares, with a wetland protection rate of 78.5%. There are nearly 200 natural lakes and marshes, with 5 national wetland parks, 1 national urban wetland park, 6 autonomous region-level wetland parks and 8 municipal parks.
Lu Jinhu, deputy director of Yinchuan Wetland Protection Center, told reporters that wetland protection has increased biodiversity, especially in birds. "The gull is an endangered bird, with only more than 20,000 in the world, of which more than 2,000 live in Yinchuan Wetland."
At the same time, Ningxia has demarcated a 500-meter red line for the wetland protection area on both sides of the Yinchuan section of the Yellow River according to law, stipulating that no unit or individual may carry out development, construction and business activities within the scope of protection except for public welfare projects.
Zhao Shaoyong, deputy director of Yinchuan Water Conservancy Service Center, said that through pollution source control, comprehensive improvement of river and lake ecology and terminal wetland construction, the water quality of nine main drainage ditches in Ningxia has reached Class A standard by 100%. "Now the water is clear, the fish are swimming, and the flowers are blooming."
The "Drinking Water Dream" of Benefit People's Livelihood
Yinchuan City in Ningxia once had an "embarrassing" title: the only city along the Yellow River that "guarded the Yellow River and lacked water to drink."
Since 2010, Yinchuan City has been facing the problem of persistent water shortage in the summer peak. The "pain of water shortage" in the past ten years has become a painful experience for many high-rise residents in summer. However, under the current situation that the major water sources are at the limit of over-exploitation and the urban underground has formed a large area of groundwater over-exploitation funnel area, water shortage has become a difficult problem perplexing Yinchuan City.
Thanks to the improvement of the water quality of the Yellow River, drinking purified Yellow River water has become a good way to solve the drinking water problem of local residents.
Ding Ming, deputy director of Yinchuan Water Affairs Bureau, said that in order to improve the living and production water demand of urban and rural residents in Yinchuan, Ningxia launched the water supply project on the western line of urban and rural areas in Yinchuan metropolitan area in due course, replacing the original underground water source with high-quality Yellow River water.
"On December 29, 2019, the water supply project officially provided water to the three districts of Yinchuan City. In 2020, residents of Minning Town and Helan County also drank the Yellow River."
Ding Ming said that the Yinchuan water conservancy department will consider the transformation of the integration of regional rural drinking water and urban water supply. "In the next step, we will integrate all the scattered water supply points in rural areas into the western water supply project. It is expected that the integrated urban and rural water supply in Yinchuan region will be basically realized by the end of this year."
Compaction responsibility departments strengthen flood control and disaster relief work-Zhongxin.com
Compaction responsible departments strengthen flood control and disaster relief work
CCTV News (News Broadcast): According to the news from the Ministry of Water Resources, at 12: 00 today (July 25), the super-warning water level in the section below Wangjiaba in the main stream of Huaihe River was 0.64 ~ 3.31 meters, and the super-warning water level in the section below Shashi in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the two lakes was 0.05 ~ 2.02 meters.
Taihu Lake has lasted for 28 days since it exceeded the warning water level on June 28.
At 12 o'clock today, the average water level of Taihu Lake was 4.67 meters, exceeding the guaranteed water level by 0.02 meters.
Today, after consultation and judgment, the National Defense General decided to continue to maintain the level II response of flood control in the Yangtze River and Huaihe River, requiring all localities to consolidate their responsibilities and further implement flood control and disaster relief work.
Today, the National Defense Office and the Emergency Management Department urgently dispatched professional drainage vehicles from Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Fujian to help Jiangxi solve local problems such as urban waterlogging caused by heavy rainfall.
For the first time, the United States launched a countervailing investigation against China with "undervalued RMB exchange rate"
In response to the recent announcement by the US Department of Commerce, it decided to launch an anti-dumping and countervailing investigation on tie-in (tie-in) products originating in China and an investigation on the "undervalued RMB exchange rate" project.
China's Ministry of Commerce pointed out that this is the first time that the United States has filed an investigation into the so-called "undervalued RMB exchange rate" project in a countervailing case, which China firmly opposes.
China's Ministry of Commerce issued a special press release on the evening of the 23rd, saying that China implements a managed floating exchange rate system based on market supply and demand, adjusted with reference to a basket of currencies, and the market plays a decisive role in the formation of the exchange rate.
The press release stressed that, on the whole, the RMB exchange rate is at a reasonable and balanced level and has not been underestimated.
Since 2005, the RMB has appreciated by more than 17% against the US dollar.
According to the data released by the Bank for International Settlements, from the beginning of 2005 to May 2020, the nominal effective exchange rate of the RMB appreciated by 38% and the real effective exchange rate by 49%, making it the strongest currency in the G20 economies and one of the currencies with the largest appreciation in the world.
The Ministry of Commerce pointed out that the exchange rate issue is beyond the competence of members to conduct countervailing investigations in accordance with WTO rules.
The United States amended its laws and regulations in February this year to conduct countervailing investigations on other countries' exchange rates. It has been suspected of violating WTO rules and has been opposed by many parties.
According to the press release, even according to US regulations, there are a large number of errors in the content of the applicant's complaint, which does not have the necessary countervailing elements such as financial assistance, benefit granting and specificity.
China urges the US to abide by existing international rules and stop conducting countervailing investigations on the so-called "undervalued RMB exchange rate."
Affected by the further rise in tensions between China and the United States, the offshore and onshore RMB exchange rates against the US dollar fell sharply in intraday trading on the 22nd, both falling below the 7.0 yuan mark against the US dollar.
Whether the US Department of Commerce's move is intended to force up the RMB is worth paying attention to.
The spot exchange rate of RMB against US dollar rose above 7.0 mark on the 23rd to close at 6.9961.
The central parity of the RMB against the US dollar, which is officially regulated, was lowered by 17 basis points to 6.9938 on the 24th.
With the gradual improvement of the epidemic situation, the film and television industry, which has been silent for nearly half a year, has gradually returned to normal.
A few days ago, the Organizing Committee of the 26th Shanghai TV Festival announced the shortlist of Magnolia Awards.
In terms of the best actor and actress, the powerful Mesozoic actors have an absolute advantage. Lei Jiayin, Chen Baoguo, Zhang Ruoyun, Sun Honglei and Huang Lei will compete for the best actor, while Hai Qing, Ma Yili, Qin Hailu, Sun Li and Yan Ni will compete for the best actress.
The results will be officially announced on August 7.
At present, starting from the topic of college entrance examination, the realistic educational TV series "Little Joy," which depicts "Chinese Family," has won a total of six nominations for "Best Chinese TV Series," "Best Director," "Best Screenwriter," "Best Actress" and "Best Supporting Actor / Actress."
The award of "Best Actor and Actor" has always been one of the focuses of attention from the outside world. This year's competition is also extremely fierce. The shortlisted actors and actresses are all powerful actors. Chen Baoguo, Huang Lei, Lei Jiayin, Sun Honglei and Zhang Ruoyun will compete for "Best Actor."
Chen Baoguo, Huang Lei and Sun Honglei are all Mesozoic actors with deep qualifications. Lei Jiayin, 37, is also a powerful actor. Zhang Ruoyun, 32, is the youngest finalist.
In 2016, 34-year-old Hu Ge won the Magnolia Award for Best Actor for "Langya List," becoming the youngest emperor in the award. If Zhang Ruoyun can beat several other predecessors this year, it will set a new record.
The competition for best actress was finally fixed in Hai Qing, Ma Yili, Qin Hailu, Sun Li and Yan Ni, the mainstay actresses in the film and television industry, and none of them were shortlisted.
It is worth mentioning that Sun Li was shortlisted for the role of "settling down." This is the sixth time she has been nominated for this award. In 2014 and 2016, she won "Best Actress" twice for "The True Story of Hot Mom" and "The Story of Miyue" respectively.

Venezuelan Foreign Minister accuses the United States of fabricating lies to attack China for no reason-Xinhuanet
Arreaza said that the US government has recently put constant pressure on China in politics, diplomacy, economy and public opinion, which is an unfounded attack on a sovereign country.
Arreaza forwarded the tweet posted by Chinese Ambassador to Venezuela Li Baorong on his personal account earlier in the day and made the above comments.
Li Baorong said in his tweet that China strongly condemns the US for forcibly entering the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, which seriously violates the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and the Sino-US Consular Treaty, and China will make a legitimate and necessary response to this.
Venezuelan Vice President Rodriguez, Vice Foreign Minister Carlos Long and other government officials, social celebrities and mainstream media journalists also forwarded Li Baorong's tweets, condemning the serious violation of international law by the United States.
On the 26th, the day before Philippine President Duterte delivered his fifth State of the Union address (SONA) during his term of office, more than 80,000 new crown pneumonia cases were confirmed in the Philippines, of which the number of confirmed cases by the staff of the Presidential Information Department (PCOO) and its directly affiliated institutions increased to 25.
To this end, PCOO has specially prepared a working group that has not contacted the confirmed staff to cooperate with President Duterte's press release of SONA.
PCOO Minister Martin Andanar said in an interview with DZBB radio on the 26th that he had prepared two plans for President Duterte to publish SONA.
According to plan A, Duterte will deliver SONA at the Philippine Congress (Batasang Pambansa) building in Quezon City on the afternoon of the 27th.
Because of the epidemic, only 50 seats were arranged for some government cabinet members and legislators, and a special video conference room was set up for other cabinet members and local government officials to watch.
All participants can enter the parliament building only after passing the rapid test on the same day.
Once one of the participants tested positive, Plan B was launched, that is, President Duterte delivered SONA at Maracanan Palace, the presidential palace, and fewer seats were arranged at the scene.
As usual, SONA will broadcast live to the Philippines in real time.
As of press time, the Philippine presidential palace has not confirmed whether Duterte's family will attend SONA.
Andanal said that President Duterte's SONA will focus on how the government will lead the Philippines to deal with the new crown pneumonia epidemic and restore social and economic life; it will also mention his promises when he took office, namely, anti-government corruption, fighting illegal drugs and poverty reduction.
Duterte will also explain other plans of the current government, including creating more jobs, revitalizing the economy, promoting education, and helping overseas Filipino workers suffering from the epidemic.
Yinchuan: Classified Policies Support Kindergarten to Stabilize Teachers-Xinhuanet

In view of this, Yinchuan City has taken a number of measures to support these kindergartens to stabilize their teachers, such as pre-allocating subsidy funds for inclusive private kindergartens, providing post stabilization subsidies for non-inclusive private kindergartens, and reducing rent for private kindergartens.
According to the relevant policies of Yinchuan City, during the epidemic period, if the organizers of inclusive private kindergartens (including kindergartens that have been transformed into inclusive kindergartens after the treatment of supporting kindergartens in urban districts) refer to the minimum wage standards of the three districts and pay not less than 1660 yuan per person per month for basic living expenses, the municipal finance will pre-allocate six months of subsidy funds according to the standard of 1000 yuan per student per year for inclusive private kindergartens to solve teachers' salaries and social insurance expenses.
For non-inclusive private kindergartens that also pay not less than 1660 yuan per person per month for basic living expenses, Yinchuan City will arrange six months of subsidy funds as stable post subsidy funds for preschool teachers according to the subsidy standard of 500 yuan per student per year.

The No.3 flood of the Yangtze River in 2020 formed the detailed and practical response measures of the Ministry of Water Resources-Zhongxin.com
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26 (Reporter Hu Lu) On the 26th, the No.3 flood of the Yangtze River in 2020 was formed.
When presiding over the meeting on the 26th, E Jingping, Minister of Water Resources, requested that the Three Gorges Reservoir be carefully dispatched, that the incoming water from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and Dongting Lake be considered as a whole, that staggered peak scheduling be implemented, that sufficient storage capacity be reserved to prepare for possible major floods, and that the flood control safety of the main stream of the middle and lower reaches and the important dikes of Dongting Lake be ensured.
It is predicted that in the next three days, there will be heavy rain in the eastern southwest, southern Jianghuai, northern and western Jiangnan, eastern and southern Hubei, and central Guangxi, among which there will be heavy rain in northern Hunan and southwestern Jiangsu; there will be moderate to heavy rain in central and western North China, among which there will be heavy rain in central Hebei.
The Ministry of Water Resources predicts that due to its influence, the inflow of the Three Gorges Reservoir in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River may reach about 60,000 cubic meters per second around the 28th, and the water level of the Lianhuatang River section and Dongting Lake in the middle reaches will rise again and exceed about 0.20 meters; The water level of the main stream in the middle reaches of Huaihe River generally slows down, and the water level of Hongze Lake continues to rise slowly; The Haihe River Daqing River system, Yongding River and other rivers will have a rising water process.
E Jingping proposed that the Huaihe River Basin should further increase flood discharge, reduce the water level of Hongze Lake as soon as possible, and prepare for the possible flood.
It is necessary to do a good job in dealing with torrential rains and floods in the Yishu Sishui system.
He said that the Taihu Lake Basin should continue to increase flood discharge, reduce the water level of Taihu Lake and its surrounding river network as soon as possible, and reduce the risk of high water level and typhoon in Taihu Lake.
In addition, he stressed that floods in northern regions such as Inner Mongolia and Hebei rise and fall sharply, and the warning time is short, which is easy to cause mountain torrents and mudslides, and it is difficult to defend; there are many small and medium-sized reservoirs and silt dams, which have hidden dangers.
58 apps that infringe on users' rights and interests have been exposed, involving more than 10 listed companies-Zhongxin.com
The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology reported that in accordance with laws and regulations such as the Network Security Law, Telecommunications Regulations, and Regulations on the Protection of Personal Information of Telecommunications and Internet Users, third-party testing agencies have recently been organized to inspect mobile phone application software and urge enterprises with problems to make rectification.
The problems existing in these 58 apps include private collection of personal information, collection of personal information beyond the scope, frequent application for permission, excessive request for permission, difficulty in account cancellation, private sharing to a third party, and denial of permission.
The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology requires that the rectification and implementation of 58 apps should be completed before July 30. If the rectification is not carried out within the time limit, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology will organize and carry out relevant disposal work in accordance with laws and regulations.
Zhongxin Jingwei reporters combed and found that behind the 58 apps reported, more than a dozen US, Hong Kong and A-share listed companies were involved.
For example, "Fangduo" is a product of Fangduo, a listed company in the United States. There are five major problems: collecting personal information privately, collecting personal information beyond the scope, sharing it with third parties privately, forcing users to use directional push function, and frequently applying for permission.
According to public information, Fangduoduo landed on NASDAQ in November 2019. It is "the first real estate intermediary company in China with SaaS (software service) model of industrial Internet," providing online solutions for many intermediary merchants.
In response to the problem pointed out in the circular that it is difficult to cancel the "Qunar.com" APP account, according to the Beijing News, Qunar.com responded that in order to prevent black products from using frequent registration and cancellation to seek benefits, Qunar.com has set an interval of one month for registration and cancellation on the basis of independent cancellation.
Considering the convenience of cancellation and account security, it has been changed to cancellation with immediate effect and is currently awaiting review.
An unnamed network security expert told Zhongxin Jingwei client that the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has issued three APP notifications of such violations of users' rights and interests this year.
Among them, the three problems of private collection of personal information, excessive request for permission, and difficulty in account cancellation are repeatedly "managed."
It can also be found from the notification that the invasion of privacy by APP has attracted more and more attention.
On July 24th, on the day of the notification of 58 apps infringing on users' rights and interests, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said that it had issued a notice a few days ago to deploy and carry out in-depth special rectification actions to promote apps infringing on users' rights and interests.
The special rectification will strengthen supervision and inspection in accordance with regulations, urge relevant enterprises to strengthen the protection of APP personal information, timely rectify and eliminate outstanding problems such as illegal collection, use of users' personal information and harassment of users, deception and misleading of users, and inadequate implementation of management responsibilities of application distribution platform, so as to purify APP application space.
Lewis family: John Lewis is a fighter who "fights for the weakest"
John Lewis, a US congressman and civil rights fighter, was remembered as a soldier who "fought for the weakest" at a memorial service held for him on Saturday (July 25).
Lewis's public memorial service has been held in Alabama since Saturday.
There were two memorial services on the first day.
At a public memorial service at the University of Troy in Alabama on Saturday, Lewis's five brothers and sisters and a nephew and grandson spoke of him as a loving, fearless, family-oriented man.
Henry "Grant" Lewis, Lewis's youngest brother, said at the meeting: "He devoted his life to helping others."
Samuel Lewis said his mother had warned John "don't make trouble, don't make trouble."
He added that John did not listen to his mother's warning. He said: "We all know that John is always in trouble, always in trouble, but that's because he insists on the right thing, which is a good trouble."
Lewis's brothers and sisters reminded people at the memorial service that John's most famous argument is to create "good trouble," that is, as long as it is for the sake of justice, it is not taboo to stir up trouble.
John applied to Troy University in Troy, Alabama, where he was born, but Troy University, which was all white at the time, rejected his application.
John Lewis, who preached the gospel to chickens on his farm as a child, eventually earned a degree in religion and philosophy from Fisk University.
Years later, the University of Troy awarded Lewis an honorary doctorate.
Senator Doug Jones of Alabama said the current protesters are "protesting peacefully and non-violently," just as Lewis did in the civil rights movement.
Jones said: "Even if President Trump knocked over a boat of people and described all the protesters as thugs, he was wrong.
The protesters are patriots who want the United States to move towards a more equal country. "
A six-day series of events in memory of Lewis will culminate in a funeral in Georgia this week.
On Saturday, Lewis's coffin was parked at a public memorial service at the University of Troy, and people came to pay tribute to the pioneer of the civil rights movement.
Later on Saturday, a private ceremony paid tribute to him in a chapel in Selma, Alabama, followed by a public memorial service.
On Sunday, Lewis's body will pass the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma.
In 1965, he and the demonstrators demanding black voting rights were severely beaten by Alabama police in front of this bridge, and the police also fired tear gas on the demonstrators.
Lewis was nearly killed.
This day will be known as "Bloody Sunday."
Lewis's body will be transported to Montgomery, the capital of Alabama.
Mayor Steven Reed encouraged people to line up on the sidewalk to complete the final journey with Lewis.
At the same time, officials require the public to wear masks and maintain social distance when participating in activities.
Alabama Governor Kay Ivey ordered flags to be flown at half-mast on Saturday and Sunday in memory of Lewis.
During the nearly one-week commemoration, Lewis's body will be placed in the Alabama State Capitol in Montgomery, the Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta, and the U.S. Capitol in Washington for public mourning.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced last week that people can come to the U.S. Capitol on Monday and Tuesday to pay tribute to Lewis.
Due to the coronavirus epidemic, a public event in memory of Lewis will be held outdoors.

Recently, during his inspection tour in Jilin Province, General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed that it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of the party, promote the extension of party organizations to the grass-roots level, improve the working system of grass-roots party organizations, and provide a strong guarantee for the governance of urban and rural communities.
Adhering to the guidance of party building and implementing the party's leadership in all fields and links of grass-roots governance is the directional and fundamental requirement for doing a good job in grass-roots governance.
To improve the level of grass-roots governance, we should adhere to the leadership of party building, and promote the transformation of the party's political advantages, organizational advantages and mass work advantages into governance advantages by strengthening political leadership, building battle fortresses, and gathering red forces, and transmit the party's strength and propositions to the "nerve endings" and the "last kilometer."
Pay attention to calcium supplementation and soul-building, and strengthen political guidance.
To strengthen the political guidance of grass-roots governance, we must implement the "calcium supplement and soul casting" project well.
It is necessary to thoroughly understand Xi Jinping's thought of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era as the primary task, to take "not forgetting the original intention and bearing in mind the mission" as the eternal topic of party building and the lifelong topic of party members and cadres, to strengthen the reading of the original text and understand the principles, and to continue to promote the party's innovative theory through special training, batch training, seminars and exchanges, and holding lecture halls, and promote party members and cadres to further enhance the "four senses," strengthen the "four self-confidence," achieve the "two maintenance," and better perform their duties.
Through the combination of online and offline learning methods, broaden the channels of learning and education, and guide grass-roots party organizations and party members and cadres to truly integrate learning and education into daily life.
Pay attention to practical training, in the process of resolving key and difficult problems in the field of grass-roots governance, solve the troubles and troubles that the masses are concerned about, and hone the party spirit and ability.
Grasp the promotion of norms and build a battle fortress.
Grass-roots party organizations are not only an important part of grass-roots governance system, but also an important carrier of governance ability.
To promote the standardization construction of grass-roots party organizations, we should start with grasping the working regulations of party branches, focus on the weakening and falsification of the leadership of party organizations, and strengthen the foundation, make up for shortcomings and promote development by establishing a linkage mechanism between the upper and lower levels, innovating the form of branch setting, normalizing and rectifying weakness and laxity, establishing and improving the decision-making and deliberation mechanism, and serving the masses mechanism.
In rural areas, we should strengthen the standardization construction of village-level party organizations, standardize organizational forms, learning activities and management mechanisms according to the standardization construction standards of party branches, and earnestly promote the detailed implementation of the system of "three meetings and one lesson" and thematic party day activities.
In cities, pay attention to street communities, explore innovative branch setting forms, focus on weak areas, "blocking points" and "pain points," and actively build urban party building alliances to achieve effective coverage of the party's work.
At the same time, we should establish and improve the system and mechanism of grass-roots governance, improve the decision-making and discussion mechanism led by grass-roots party organizations, discuss major issues together, handle practical matters together, decide important matters together, discuss urgent matters together, solve difficult matters together, and improve the mechanism for party members and cadres to contact and serve the masses, gather the hearts and minds of the people in serving the people, enhance the sense of gain, happiness, honor, and pride of party members and the masses, and make grass-roots governance more warm.
Play a pioneering role and gather red power.
Grass-roots party members and cadres are the cornerstone of grass-roots governance.
To improve the governance ability of grass-roots party members and cadres, we should pay attention to the demonstration and leading role of "red cells" in grass-roots governance, and gather red forces at the forefront of contacting and serving the masses.
It is necessary to take the improvement of governance ability as a compulsory course for grass-roots party members and cadres, continuously strengthen ideological refinement, professional training and practical training, carry forward the spirit of responsibility in their posts and in urgent, difficult and dangerous tasks, and lay a solid foundation and contribute to the modernization of the national governance system and governance ability.
It is necessary to widely carry out the activities of "community whistle blowing and party members reporting for duty" and participate in community construction, management and service by participating in theme party day activities, contacting people in difficulty, determining service items, claiming micro wishes, and putting forward reasonable suggestions, so that party members can play a role in community governance.
It is necessary to give full play to the role of unemployed party members in rural areas, and guide the majority of grassroots party members to actively participate in poverty alleviation, ecological construction, letters and visits to maintain stability, straw burning ban and other work by setting up vanguard posts for unemployed party members and setting up task forces for unemployed party members, so as to better integrate red forces and serve the people.
A solid foundation makes a strong building.
Grass-roots party organizations are the foundation of the ruling building.
Only by adhering to the focus on strengthening the relationship between the party and the masses, increasing the well-being of the people, and taking the leadership of party building as the fundamental way to promote the innovative development of grass-roots governance, can we build a solid foundation, so that grass-roots party organizations can pull out and stand up, grass-roots party members and cadres can catch up and rush up, and promote grass-roots governance to be "soul," orderly, powerful and effective.

Tibetan antelope in Hoh Xil enters migration season-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, July 25 (Reporter Wang Jinjin) The reporter learned from the Wudaoliang Protection Station of Hoh Xil Management Office in the Yangtze River Source Park of the Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration that monitoring showed that Tibetan antelopes who had migrated to the Zhuonai Lake area in the hinterland of Hoh Xil to give birth were gradually finishing giving birth and began to return to their original habitat with their cubs.
Monitoring images near Wudaoliang Protection Station show that on July 25, about 40 female Tibetan antelopes led three Tibetan antelope cubs through 3002 kilometers of Qinghai-Tibet Highway and Wudaoliang North Bridge on Qinghai-Tibet Railway. Tibetan antelopes have begun to move back.
According to expert analysis, in recent years, the number of Tibetan antelope cubs in the relocated sheep accounts for one quarter to one fifth of the total number of Tibetan antelope herds.
Lian Xinming, an associate researcher at the Northwest Plateau Institute of Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, said: "In the early stage of migration, Tibetan antelopes face a higher risk of predation, so the number of cubs in the sheep will be relatively small, and there may even be no cubs."
According to the statistics of Hoh Xil Management Office of Yangtze River Source Park of Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration, the number of Tibetan antelopes returning is generally increasing year by year. In 2019, the number of Tibetan antelopes returning was 4860, an increase of 338 over 2018.
Lian Xinming said: "It is expected that the migration of Tibetan antelopes this year will end in early September, and the number of Tibetan antelopes is still expected to continue to increase."
Tibetan antelope is a national first-class protected animal.
At the end of May every year, Tibetan antelopes from Sanjiangyuan in Qinghai, Qiangtang in Tibet and Aljinshan in Xinjiang go to Zhuonai Lake in the hinterland of Hoh Xil to give birth.
Wu Xiaomin, an expert on Tibetan antelope protection in China and a researcher at the Shaanxi Institute of Zoology (Northwest Institute of Endangered Animals), said: "The migration of Tibetan antelopes is a process in which female Tibetan antelopes return to their habitat one after another after giving birth. At first, the migration group leaving the litter site is relatively large, but then the Tibetan antelopes will return to their respective habitats along different paths according to different geographical populations."
In order to ensure the safe relocation of Tibetan antelope herds, the reporter learned that the Hoh Xil Management Office of Yangtze River Source Park of Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration has arranged staff to continuously carry out video monitoring and patrol in the main relocation areas.
If Tibetan antelopes are found trying to cross the road, the mountain patrol team will carry out temporary traffic control at the first time to let the sheep safely pass through the wildlife passage and ensure that they are as little disturbed by human beings as possible on the way back.
So, how to relieve the heat in daily life?
Experts suggest that when going out in summer, try to avoid the high temperature period, and it is best not to walk or work in the hot sun around noon, because the sunshine is the strongest during this period, and the possibility of heatstroke is higher.
If you have to go out at this time, you must do a good job of protection, such as wearing a sunshade, a sunshade hat, and sunglasses. If possible, you'd better apply sunscreen to prevent sunburn.
Clothes try to choose light-colored, breathable cotton, hemp, silk texture, wear less chemical fiber clothing, so as not to be able to dissipate heat in time when sweating a lot, causing heatstroke.
In hot and sultry weather, you should prepare enough water to drink in time. Don't wait for thirst to drink water, because once you feel thirsty, your body is already short of water. Drink 150 ml to 200 ml of water each time. Drink warm boiled water instead of ice water.
According to the temperature, ordinary people drink 1.5 to 2 liters of water a day, while high-temperature workers drink 3 to 5 liters of water a day.
When sweating more, you can appropriately supplement some salt water to make up for the salt lost by sweating.
In addition, the human body is prone to potassium deficiency in summer, which makes people feel tired and tired. Potassium-containing tea is an excellent summer drink.
In summer, eat more fruits and vegetables with high water content, such as lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, etc.; Fresh fruits, such as peaches, apricots, watermelons, melons, etc., with a water content of 80% to 90%, can be used to supplement water; Dairy products can not only replenish water, but also meet the nutritional needs of the body.
In addition, people working in high temperature environment should appropriately supplement drinks containing potassium, magnesium and other elements.
In summer, the days are long and the nights are short, the temperature is high, the metabolism of the human body is exuberant, the consumption is also large, and it is easy to feel tired.
Adequate sleep can relax all systems of the brain and body, which is not only conducive to work and study, but also a measure to prevent heatstroke.
Experts say that the best time to go to bed is from 22: 00 to 23: 00 and the best time to get up is from 5: 30 to 6: 30.
Be careful not to lie under the air conditioning outlet and electric fan when sleeping, so as not to suffer from air conditioning diseases and hot colds.
Experts suggest that people who are engaged in outdoor activities or high-temperature operations can take heatstroke prevention drugs such as ten drops of water, Rendan, Patchouli Zhengqi Water or Patchouli Zhengqi Pills with them, or place them in the nearest workplace and use them at any time to prevent heatstroke.
Graduate art exhibition moved into shopping mall public welfare exhibition-Xinhuanet
In the "cloud graduation" season of colleges and universities, a rare offline graduate art exhibition opened warmly last weekend.
However, it is neither in the art gallery nor on campus, but in the public space of Chaoyang Joy City, which is open to the public free of charge and will last until August 23.
The reporter learned that the 2020 Graduate Art Exhibition collected 50 works / groups of 57 young artists from the Central Academy of Fine Arts, Communication University of China and Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts. The exhibition space extended from the second floor to the sixth floor, and made full use of the light box in the building to display graphic works, thus maximizing the artistic atmosphere of the graduation season.
Under the epidemic situation, the significance of this exhibition is particularly special.
Ge Ping, head of Meichen in Chaoyang Yue City, said: "We choose to bring the graduation exhibition to the 'cloud' back to the offline space again. We also hope that more people will see young people's exploration of themselves and understanding of the world, and amplify the healing power of art for society and the soul."
She revealed that the works exhibited this time were collected from graduates of several major art colleges, and those suitable for commercial space were selected. The forms of the works ranged from traditional easel painting and sculpture to new media installations, interactive animation and VR panorama, with the highest volume and richness in years.
Among them, Li Yunxiao expressed his feelings in the epidemic through a mixture of mechanical and manual creative language in "The First Battle of 2020"; Liu Jiaying discussed the themes of "cryptocurrency," "credit creation" and "transaction" through his work "Sound Money" created by Ethereum blockchain; Zhang Jiaqi's "Cat Forest" and Qiu Daqiang's "Jiu" show animals that are often accompanied by human beings, from which we can see young artists' understanding of the relationship between human beings and animals; Zhu Zhongyu's work "Winter of Faith-Gift" is to remind growing young people, "When one day you have a successful career, don't forget your initiative, remember that simplicity and sincerity."
Among the few graduates who personally arranged the exhibition was Li Jingyin from the Sculpture Department of Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts.
"I came to Beijing on July 7. At that time, I was actually a little worried about the epidemic. I also did nucleic acid testing three days in advance. I came to the exhibition with alcohol cotton and test reports."
His work "Yesterday is a Mystery" has a complex structure and must be done by himself.
At the same time, he also undertakes the task of helping his classmates repair damaged works.
"The exhibition was arranged until 4: 30 in the morning, and then it was repaired. The time was very tight. I forgot to take a picture with the work, which was also a bit regrettable."
He hopes that when the epidemic situation is more stable, he and his classmates will come to Beijing to see his works exhibition.

Reward 50,000 yuan Hubei Enshi praised the "first person in early warning" of Shaziba landslide-Zhongxin.com
Hubei Daily News (Reporter Lin Jing) On July 26, Enshi City announced that it praised Chen Guangming, a geological disaster site monitor who had made important contributions to the early warning of Shaziba landslide, and sent him a bonus of 50,000 yuan.
At the same time, Party members and cadres in the city are called upon to learn from his spirit of conscientiousness, courage to take responsibility, initiative and dedication.
On July 21, a landslide occurred in Shaziba, Mazhe Village, Tunpu Township, Enshi City, which led to the formation of a barrier lake in the main stream of Qingjiang River. Chen Guangming, 58, was the first person to warn of the landslide.
On the afternoon of July 17, Chen Guangming learned that the walls of the villagers' homes were cracked and immediately went to the scene to check.
As soon as he walked five or six hundred meters from his home, he saw the village road split four or five centimeters, extending along the road to the cornfield, about 50 meters long.
Chen Guangming was alert and immediately sent the photos of highway cracking to the "contact group of geological disaster monitors" in the township.
After on-site inspection and judgment by the relevant person in charge of Tunpu Township Natural Planning Institute, the possibility of landslide was very high, and the decision to evacuate the masses was made immediately.
Chen Guangming's timely warning won 36 hours of precious time for the safe evacuation of 1,339 people from 315 households in the affected area.
No one was killed or injured in this major geological disaster.
Chen Guangming's conscientious and responsible professionalism was praised by the masses.
In the face of praise, he said: "There is no one to save, this is my responsibility."
New drugs developed by Australian universities are expected to be used to treat vascular blockage caused by new crowns-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Sydney, July 26 (Reporter Chen Yu) Researchers at Monash University in Australia are developing a new drug to help prevent heart disease and stroke, and hope that this drug can be used to treat blood vessel blockage caused by the new crown virus.
Researchers have found that an enzyme in platelets accelerates platelet clotting before a heart attack or stroke.
Therefore, they developed a drug that can temporarily inhibit platelet clotting, thus avoiding blood vessel blockage and preventing heart disease and stroke.
Researchers say the drug will only inhibit the clotting effect of platelets when there are signs of heart disease or stroke.
Since studies have shown that similar vascular blockage is one of the main causes of death in severely ill patients with new crown, researchers hope that this drug can be used in the treatment of such severely ill patients in the future.
At present, the drug has achieved good results in animal model experiments, and researchers are preparing for the next stage of human clinical trials.
The research results have been published in the American journal Science Translational Medicine.
He became the first spectator to enter the CBA league after allowing the audience to watch the match live.
On the same day, in the second stage (Laoshan Division) of the 2019-2020 Chinese Men's Basketball Professional League (CBA) rematch held in Qingdao, Shandong Province, medical staff, teachers and public security front personnel completed the relevant processes including nucleic acid testing through the official ticketing platform and then entered the field to watch the match between Shanghai Jiushi Team and Shandong West King Team.
During the watching period, spectators must wear masks all the way, take their seats according to the number, and keep their seats at a strict interval of one meter.
When exiting, the audience must keep the "one-meter line" social distance in an orderly manner in the order from back to front, first on both sides and then in the middle.
Xinjiang deeply cultivates "sunflower fields" and makes good use of clean energy-Zhongxin.com
2020-07-26 15: 43: 42 Source: China News Network Author: Chen Haifeng Editor: Chen Haifeng
China News Service, Hami, Xinjiang, July 26
More than 6,000 pentagonal heliostats, each 48 square meters, are neatly arranged in circles, such as a silver "sunflower field," which rotates with the sun and reflects sunlight to a heat absorption tower more than 200 meters high in the center to realize power generation.
The reporter saw this scene on the 25th at the Hami molten salt tower photothermal power plant of CLP Project in Dumaohu Town, Yiwu County, Hami City, Xinjiang.
"The so-called molten salt tower photothermal power generation is to reflect sunlight through the mirror to the heat absorption tower to form heat energy, and then convert the heat energy into electric energy through traditional power generation technology."
Zhang Yong, deputy general manager of CLP Hami Solar Thermal Power Generation Co., Ltd., said that its design principle is similar to that of solar cookers used in rural areas in northwest China, which should gather sunlight.
The power plant started construction in October 2017 and was connected to the grid at the end of last year. It covers an area of 6,600 mu and plans to install 14,500 heliostats.
"Compared with traditional solar power generation technology, its biggest advantage is that it can store the accumulated heat energy and generate electricity at night."
Zhang Yong said that the 13-hour heat storage system configured in the project can keep the generator set in continuous and stable operation without being affected by light changes; It can also quickly participate in power grid peak regulation according to the peak and valley demand of power grid load.
After the project is fully completed, it can achieve an annual power generation of 198 million kWh, save more than 60,000 tons of standard coal each year, reduce more than 60 tons of sulfur dioxide, more than 60 tons of nitrogen oxides, about 20 tons of soot and more than 150,000 tons of carbon dioxide, and provide a steady stream of clean energy for the local area.
In addition, there is another silver "sunflower field" in Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park in Hami City.
Hami Fuguang Solar Photovoltaic Power Station covers an area of more than 2,300 mu. The 714 power generation equipment that has been built also follows the sun, always keeping the sunlight at a 90-degree right angle to the surface of the concentrating plate.
"We adopt dual-axis tracking concentrating power generation technology. Through unified integrated control, all power generation equipment will adjust the angle according to the height of the sun to maintain power generation efficiency."
Duan Mengqi, the stationmaster of the power station, said that under good weather conditions, the power generation technology can improve the efficiency of traditional photovoltaic power generation by about 20%.
In the first half of this year, the power station has generated more than 7 million kWh of electricity, supplementing the local demand for electricity.
Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park is currently a photovoltaic industrial demonstration park with the largest single scale and the most complete types of photovoltaic components in Xinjiang, with 38 photovoltaic power generation projects and a total installed capacity of 820,000 kilowatts.
In the first half of this year, the power generation exceeded 110 million kWh, an increase of 6% over the same period in 2019.
Hami is one of the regions with the best solar energy resources in China.
The annual average total solar radiation is more than 6,200 megajoules per square meter, and the annual sunshine hours are about 3,200 hours.
In recent years, the city has vigorously developed the photovoltaic industry and planted "sunflower fields."
A solar power generation scale with an installed capacity of more than 2.5 million kilowatts has been built. In the first half of this year, the city's photovoltaic power generation exceeded 1.4 billion kWh, an increase of about 14% year on year.
At present, there are more than 330 grid-connected photovoltaic power stations in Xinjiang with an installed capacity of more than 10 million kilowatts.
It is estimated that photovoltaic power generation will reach 15 billion kWh this year, which can replace more than 6 million tons of standard coal.
Police report details of "female college students lost in Qinghai tourism" search and rescue work continues-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, July 26 (Reporter Wang Jinjin, Zhou Zhe) Recently, "a female college student lost contact after traveling to Golmud, Qinghai" attracted the attention of netizens.
The Public Security Bureau of Golmud City, Haixi Mongolian and Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province reported on the 26th that Huang Moumou, a student from a university in Nanjing, is still in a state of missing contact, and police in many places are going deep along the line of Huang Moumou's lost contact and actively carrying out search work.
On July 10, 2020, the Public Security Detachment of Golmud City Public Security Bureau in Haixi Prefecture received a notice from the superior that Huang Moumou, a student of a university in Nanjing, took the Z164 train from Nanjing to Golmud on July 5, and turned off his mobile phone and lost contact at the southwest area of Qingshui River at Sonandajie Protection Station in Qumalai County, Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province on July 9, asking for assistance in finding it.
According to the investigation of Golmud City Public Security Bureau, Huang entered Qinghai Province at 19: 54 on July 6 and arrived in Golmud City at 4: 00 on July 7.
At 8: 00 on the same day, Huang Moumou, a lost person, took a taxi from the Yellow River Hotel in Golmud City to the G109 National Highway, and arrived at the Sonandajie Protection Station in Hoh Xil at 12: 00. The taxi driver returned alone. Huang Moumou arrived at the Qingshui River area near the Sonandajie Protection Station at 15: 00 on the 7th and shut down in the area until 18: 00 on the 9th.
In further investigation, the police found that Huang had passed the Naijigou checkpoint at 17: 07 on July 13.
Naijigou checkpoint is a checkpoint set up by Naqu City, Tibet Autonomous Region at Nanshankou, Golmud City. Because there is no video surveillance at the checkpoint, it is impossible to determine the information of the person and the vehicle. The police can only drive along the way to search and coordinate with the checkpoints along Tibet. If Huang is found, immediately contact the Golmud Public Security Bureau.
According to the latest situation, at 1: 00 a.m. on July 26, Golmud Public Security Bureau organized rescue forces to carry rescue equipment to search for the unfrozen spring protection station and Sonandajie protection station along the Qinghai-Tibet Highway, and actively contacted Sichuan police, Tibet police and Nanjing police to work together. At present, the search and rescue work is still continuing.
The local police hope that netizens and all sectors of society will provide relevant clues to Golmud police and Nanjing Jiangning police in time, so as to find the missing person Huang Moumou as soon as possible.
At the same time, relevant experts suggest that tourists should be standardized, rational and civilized in outdoor activities, pay attention to roadside warning signs at any time, do not venture into no man's land, and report to the police in time in case of emergencies.
US media uncovered the truth that the US side unreasonably asked China to close its Consulate General in Houston-Chinanews.com

The US media uncovered the truth that the US side asked China to close its Consulate General in Houston for no reason
On the 24th, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the US Embassy in China that China had decided to revoke the license for the establishment and operation of the US Consulate General in Chengdu, and put forward specific requirements for the Consulate General to stop all business and activities, as a countermeasure to the US sudden request on the 21st that China close the Consulate General in Houston.
This behavior of the US government has attracted much attention, and its political motives have been questioned by foreign media and scholars.
Why do you ask China to close the Consulate General?
Many foreign media said that it was not clear why the United States chose the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, but for the purpose of this move, the foreign media said bluntly: for the general election.
CNN reported on the 23rd that the US request for China to close its Consulate General in Houston has caused people to question its political motives.
According to the article, the US government's disastrous response to the new crown epidemic has caused President Trump's poll support before the election to be relatively low.
White House officials said privately that the tough strategy against China was to save Trump's approval rating and to shift the responsibility for the failure of the White House's response to the epidemic.
The article holds that the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is a "politically driven and very cautious" target chosen by the United States, and the US government chose it "to create a tough attitude while avoiding the risk of major conflicts."
The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) also believes that when the US election season is approaching and the US economy is severely hit by the epidemic, Trump believes that "playing the 'China card' has a political advantage."
The current situation is "a spiral and tit-for-tat struggle," which is promoted by the US government from the perspective of domestic considerations to a certain extent, and will only worsen the tension between China and the United States.
CBS reported that Trump's re-election prospects were under pressure due to the outbreak, and he repeatedly blamed China for the epidemic.
Almost every day, the United States takes new actions against Trump's absurd argument that "China exploits the United States."
"The Consulate General of Houston is very important in establishing ties between the two countries."
The Associated Press commented that the United States asked China to close its consulate in Houston, exacerbating tensions between the world's two largest economies.
If the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is closed, in addition to diplomatic influence, Chinese citizens in the southern United States will face difficulties in obtaining consular services, as will American citizens seeking visas and other services.
A business group in Houston expressed regret over the US request for China to close its Consulate General in Houston, saying that the Consulate General has played an important role in establishing trade, investment and cultural ties between the two countries.
The Associated Press believes that this reflects the importance of China's economy.
According to the website of US Foreign Policy magazine, the US move "is part of a series of provocative measures, which will only worsen US-China relations."
Reuters quoted Jonathan Pollack, an expert on East Asia at the Brookings Institution, a US think tank, as saying that since the establishment of full diplomatic relations between the United States and China in 1979, he could not think of any move comparable to the US action against the Chinese Consulate General in Houston.
Hong Kong's South China Morning Post reported that the US move is unprecedented in more than 40 years of diplomatic relations between China and the United States.
Analysts believe that this move may cause lasting damage.
Established in 1979, the Chinese Consulate General in Houston is the first Chinese Consulate General in the United States.
At present, China has an embassy and five consulates general in the United States.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 26 (Reporter Lu Jinbo) Russian fleets held a military parade on the 26th to celebrate the Navy Day and commemorate the 324th anniversary of the founding of the Russian Navy.
On the same day, Russia's North Sea, Baltic Sea, Black Sea, Caspian Sea and Pacific Fleet held military parades in the waters where their respective bases are located, with 15,000 soldiers, 219 ships of various types and 71 military aircraft participating.
Russian President and Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces Putin attended the parade of the Baltic Fleet.
About 4,000 soldiers, 46 ships and more than 40 fighter planes took part in the local military parade.
Putin first inspected the ship formation in the waters of the Kronstadt naval base in the Baltic Sea.
After that, he took a speedboat to the waters of the Neva River in the center of St. Petersburg and went ashore to watch the military parade on the Neva River.
Putin said in a speech at the military parade that the modern technical level of Russian naval equipment has continued to improve in recent years, and the Russian navy will receive a total of about 40 new ships equipped with unique hypersonic strike systems in 2020.
In addition, Yevmenov, commander-in-chief of the Russian Navy, said in an interview with Red Star, the official newspaper of the Russian Ministry of Defense, that Russia's plan to build ships has been effectively implemented, and the number of new ships that the Russian Navy plans to receive in 2020 is relatively large in recent years.
In 1696, Tsar Peter the Great set out to form a sea fleet, which created the history of the Russian navy.
The last Sunday in July every year is the Russian Navy Day.
In response to the new changes in epidemic prevention and control work, since July 17, trade unions at all levels in Xinjiang have responded to the call of the Federation of Trade Unions of the Autonomous Region and actively participated in epidemic prevention and control work.
Tianshan North and South trade union cadres, workers and model workers went into street communities and residents to carry out activities such as delivering vegetables and medicines, disinfection and sterilization, and publicizing epidemic prevention knowledge, so as to serve the workers and demonstrate the "hard core power" of trade unions with practical actions.
Recently, the consolation group of Tianshan District Federation of Trade Unions in Urumqi sent a batch of urgently needed living materials for epidemic prevention and control to the staff of 12 isolation points.
After the outbreak of the epidemic, Tianshan District invested more than 1.05 million yuan in the first place, which was urgently allocated to 23 grass-roots trade unions directly under it.
After receiving the company's notice on epidemic prevention and control, Zhao Xiangguo, deputy secretary of the Party Committee and chairman of the trade union of China Construction Xinjiang Construction Co., Ltd. volunteered to stay on duty in the unit to escort the employees.
He sent cooking utensils, food and daily necessities to the dormitory and new employees, and organized personnel to send them daily necessities every two days.
"Starting from July 21, we will find out the cadres and workers who stick to the front line of the war 'epidemic', and adopt online orders and door-to-door delivery by merchants to supplement the purchase of epidemic prevention supplies and living materials for 704 front-line workers in Urumqi."
The person in charge of Xinjiang Transportation Trade Union told reporters that in the face of a sudden epidemic, they made every effort to ensure the prevention and control of the epidemic, steadily promote the development of transportation, and create a strong atmosphere for fighting the epidemic together.
At present, it is high temperature in summer, and trade unions at all levels pay close attention to front-line workers in key areas of epidemic prevention and control, and put "sending cool" care into practice.
On July 19, the Urumqi County Federation of Trade Unions launched a condolence activity of "sending coolness" to front-line workers in epidemic prevention and control. Police stations, card points and health systems throughout the county received drinks, fruits and other condolence items.
"Trade union cadres should further improve their political positions, strengthen their responsibilities, warm the hearts of people with care, and inspire their morale with actions.
It is necessary to give full play to the role of trade union organizations in rallying and uniting workers, do a good job in epidemic prevention and control services, actively safeguard the health rights and interests of workers, and send care to front-line workers. "
The relevant person in charge of the Autonomous Region Federation of Trade Unions said.

Spokesperson of the Embassy in the UK: The Chinese government is a staunch defender of cyber security-Chinanews.com
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) According to the website of the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom, on the 25th, a spokesman of the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom answered a reporter's question on the wrong remarks about cyber attacks.
The spokesman stressed that the Chinese government is a staunch defender of cyber security and has always resolutely opposed and cracked down on cyber attacks and cyber crimes in any form.
A reporter asked: According to the media, hacker organizations related to China have interfered with the network system of a British company, launched attacks on British and American technology companies with patent data, and invaded the government networks of EU countries.
The spokesman said that the Chinese government is a staunch defender of cyber security and has always resolutely opposed and cracked down on cyber attacks and cyber crimes in any form.
Cyberspace is virtual, difficult to trace, and diverse actors. When investigating and characterizing network events, sufficient evidence should be produced, and no groundless speculation should be made.
The spokesman said that a series of incidents such as "Prism Gate" in the past proved that the United States has been carrying out the world's largest cyber theft operation.
Maintaining peace and stability in cyberspace is in the common interest of all countries.
The spokesman pointed out that China's achievements in scientific and technological innovation were not stolen or robbed, but achieved through self-reliance and hard work.
In 2019, China submitted about 59,000 patent applications through the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), with an annual growth rate of 10.6%, making it the country with the largest number of international patent applications.
China has become a big country in innovation and intellectual property rights.
Data from Urumqi Central Sub-branch of the People's Bank of China show that in the first half of the year, new loans for agriculture-related and small and micro enterprises in Xinjiang exceeded the annual increase in 2019.
In the first half of this year, the Urumqi Central Sub-branch of the People's Bank of China used a variety of monetary policy tools to guide the banking industry to continuously increase loan investment, providing sufficient financial guarantee for epidemic prevention and control and resumption of work and production.
Most areas of free nucleic acid testing in Urumqi have basically completed secondary testing in high-risk areas-Zhongxin.com
Chinanews.com, Urumqi, July 26 (Reporter Sun Tingwen, Zhao Yamin) Zhang Wei, director of Urumqi Municipal Health Commission, said on the 26th when briefing on the latest epidemic situation and nucleic acid detection in Urumqi that at present, most areas of free nucleic acid detection in Urumqi have been basically completed.
The expert group of the State Council and experts from the autonomous region and Urumqi are further evaluating the development of the epidemic based on the results of nucleic acid detection and epidemiological investigation.
The Information Office of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region held a press conference on the 26th to report the epidemic situation and prevention and control in Xinjiang.
According to him, from 0: 00 to 24: 00 on July 25, there were 22 new confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia in Urumqi (including 5 cases of asymptomatic infection) and 38 new cases of asymptomatic infection.
As of 24: 00 on July 25, there were 135 confirmed cases and 147 asymptomatic infections in Urumqi.
On the 25th, the newly added asymptomatic infected persons were basically screened through the city's free nucleic acid testing and active screening.
Zhang Wei, director of Urumqi Municipal Health Commission, said on the 26th that free nucleic acid testing in Urumqi has been basically completed in most districts.
He also said that from the experience of other regions in China, there are many factors that affect the nucleic acid test results, such as the sensitivity of the test reagent, the infection time and detoxification time of the tested personnel, the cooperation of the tested personnel when taking samples (poor cooperation may lead to the samples not being taken in place), the testing environment, the operation proficiency of the inspectors, etc.
For various reasons, false negative results will also appear in nucleic acid testing.
The so-called false negative means that the tested person is indeed infected, but the nucleic acid test result is negative.
In addition, people who have had close contact with confirmed cases and suspected cases usually need two nucleic acid tests to be excluded.
For people who have been to high-risk areas in the epidemic, if fever and respiratory symptoms occur, one negative nucleic acid test may be false negative, so two nucleic acid tests are needed to rule out.
He said that in view of the above situation, for the sake of the health of the people in the whole city, starting from today, Urumqi will conduct secondary free nucleic acid testing in key areas such as Tianshan District and Shayibak District, and at the same time carry out "checking and making up for omissions."
It is reported that Tianshan District and Shayibak District are high-risk areas for the epidemic.

As the first international film and television festival held since the global epidemic continued to spread and China's epidemic prevention and control became normal, this year's Shanghai International Film Festival is of great significance.
On the basis of doing a good job in the normalization of epidemic prevention and control, holding the Shanghai International Film and Television Festival is not only a demonstration of confidence, but also a declaration of determination - our confidence and determination to overcome the epidemic will remain unchanged, our confidence and determination to run the people's festival well will remain unchanged, and our confidence and determination to build a global film and television creation center and launch the "Shanghai Culture" brand will remain unchanged.
Every year, the Shanghai International Film Festival, with the attitude of continuous innovation and progress, is a new start.
Therefore, it is necessary to take every step to serve the spiritual life of the people and the high-quality development of the film and television industry.
This year is even more so.
In order to cherish the hard-won epidemic prevention and control situation, the Shanghai International Film Festival, on the one hand, strictly abides by the epidemic prevention requirements and implements the epidemic prevention and control measures in detail; On the other hand, with the vision of gathering wisdom for Chinese film creation and meeting the needs of movie fans, it opens a multi-plate activity both online and offline.
On the first day of the opening ceremony, relevant epidemic prevention policies were strictly implemented in the relevant activities of the film festival, from offline viewing to industry forums.
Forum activities are controlled within 50 people, and the attendance rate is strictly controlled within 30%.
As the organizing committee of the film festival upholds, in any case, "putting people's life safety and health first" is the major premise.

White House epidemic expert Fauci: cautiously optimistic about the development of a vaccine in early 2021
Fauci made the above remarks at an online video conference hosted by the International Leadership Foundation on the 25th.
He reminded that it is not clear how the COVID-19 epidemic will develop in the autumn and winter, nor what the ultimate impact of the epidemic will be. "The only way to end all this is for each of us to choose to be part of the solution."
According to data from Johns Hopkins University in the United States, as of 21: 00 on the 25th, the number of confirmed cases in COVID-19 in the United States has reached 4.176 million, with 146,000 deaths.
Fauci said that some parts of the United States are struggling to fight the rebound of the epidemic.
Although the epidemic situation varies from place to place and needs to be dealt with according to local conditions, diversified anti-epidemic strategies do not mean that there is no close connection between regions.
An epidemic in one area will eventually affect other areas.
"Now is not the time for complacency," Fauci said. "Our work is not finished. We must step up our efforts and be vigilant against the uncertainty in the future."
He Dayi, a Chinese-American medical expert and founder of "cocktail therapy" for AIDS, pointed out at the meeting that the new crown epidemic in the United States has not yet reached its peak.
"Each of us must do our part to slow the spread of this virus."
He Dayi called on the public to use their own practical actions to buy time for scientists to step up the research and development of new crown treatment drugs and vaccines.
The International Leaders Foundation is a non-profit organization whose purpose is to promote international exchange activities in the United States and the Asia-Pacific region. It is committed to enhancing the status of Asian-Pacific Americans in the United States and cultivating international young leaders.
On the same day, U.S. Secretary of Transportation Zhao Xiaolan, U.S. Congressman Meng Zhaowen and Dong Jiling, founding president of the International Leaders Foundation, spoke at the meeting respectively.
They paid special tribute to the Asian-Pacific medical workers and volunteers who fought the epidemic on the front line, and called on the American public to continue to adhere to epidemic prevention guidelines such as "social distance" to curb the spread of the epidemic.

Brazilian study shows that hydroxychloroquine is ineffective in the treatment of mild and moderate new crown pneumonia-Zhongxin.com
Recently, a Brazilian study showed that hydroxychloroquine is ineffective for patients with mild to moderate new coronary pneumonia.
The study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

On the 25th, the 2020 Hunan Red Tourism Culture Festival and the first Xiangtan Red Culture Industry Expo opened in Shaoshan.
In recent years, the demand for red tourism has gradually increased.

It is all an effort to insert wisdom wings into red tourism, and it is expected that Hunan red tourism will become more and more popular.
Representatives of the US-China Trade Talks met in August
Hong Kong's South China Morning Post quoted an anonymous person familiar with the matter as saying on the 25th that Liu He, head of China's trade negotiation team and Vice Premier of the State Council, and Lai Haizhe, co-leader of the US team and trade representative, are expected to hold formal talks in August to assess the implementation of the first phase of the China-US trade agreement.
The report said that although China has significantly increased its purchases of US agricultural products in the past few months, due to the new crown virus epidemic and other factors, China's purchases are still some distance from the amount promised in the trade agreement.
Analysts say that the recent closure of each other's consulates by the United States and China, together with other disputes, may undermine any progress in trade between the two sides.
The first phase of the Sino-US trade agreement came into effect one month after it was signed on January 15. The agreement stipulates that the trade framework group composed of high-level officials from both sides should hold talks every six months.
According to people familiar with the matter, the meeting will be "an important turning point" for both sides to assess the progress of the agreement.
However, this person also said that if the tension between the United States and China leads to a low willingness to talk at this time, the two sides may agree that the conference call between Lai Haizhe and Liu He on May 8 has met the terms of the trade agreement for semi-annual talks.
Since the beginning of this year, Sino-US relations have deteriorated rapidly. Disputes between the two sides include a series of issues such as the origin of the new crown virus, trade, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, the South China Sea and ideology.
Although US President Trump boasted about his achievements in the first phase of the agreement at the beginning of the year, his attitude has changed recently.
He said at a White House press conference on the 23rd that although China has recently purchased a record amount of U.S. corn in a single day and bought a lot of soybeans, "this trade agreement is not as meaningful to me as it was when it was reached."
An anonymous Beijing government consultant also believes that due to poor US-China relations, a new round of trade negotiations is unlikely to take place, and "trade issues have lost weight in Sino-US relations."
However, he revealed that China's economic and trade related units still met on the 23rd to discuss a series of issues, including how to increase imports from the United States. "We have tried our best to buy, so any additional purchases will be difficult."
Peng Jiening, vice president of the US-China Trade National Committee, said that it was "more important than ever" to maintain the momentum of the first-stage agreement, and pointed out that China had made progress in further opening its financial market to US enterprises this year.
Analysts at Plenum, an independent research company, said: "It is better to talk than not to talk, although it may only be regarded as routine."
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26 (Reporter Wei Yukun) The reporter learned from the Emergency Management Department on the 26th that the State Defense Office and the Emergency Management Department, together with the State Grain and Material Reserve Bureau, once again urgently transported 1.35 million woven bags, 1.2 million square meters of woven cloth and 130,000 square meters of geotextiles to Anhui to support the flood fighting and rescue work.
According to the relevant person in charge of the emergency management department, at present, the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the Huaihe River Basin maintain high water level fluctuations, and the "No. 3 flood of the Yangtze River in 2020" formed in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River on the 26th, increasing risks in some areas.
The meteorological department predicts that there will be heavy rainfall in Chongqing, Guizhou and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in the next three days, and the flood control situation is still severe and complicated.
According to reports, since the beginning of the flood season, the Emergency Management Department has deployed national comprehensive fire and rescue teams to preset professional rescue forces in key flood control areas, participated in 10,364 flood fighting and rescue cases, dispatched more than 130,000 commanders and fighters, 17,778 fire engines and 11,887 boats, rescued 37,777 people trapped in distress, and evacuated and transferred more than 107,000 people trapped.
Hao Yusheng, chief representative of NASDAQ China: Now is the best time for Chinese companies to go to the United States for IPO-Economic Observation-Professional Financial News Website
Economic Observer Network reporter Zhang Bin because of the Luckin Coffee fraud incident, the US market has implemented stricter supervision on Chinese stocks, coupled with the long-term pressure on valuation, Chinese stocks listed in the US are under pressure. NetEase, JD.com and other Chinese stocks have recently started their journey back to Hong Kong for listing.
Recently, companies such as Shell and Ideal Automobile are enthusiastic about listing in the United States.
Under the epidemic situation and the crisis of Chinese stocks, is now the best time for Chinese enterprises to go public in the United States?
"As far as the recent IPO cases and the companies that will go public in the United States are concerned, the IPO in the United States has not been affected in essence. On the contrary, the market is very good now. Even now is the best time for Chinese companies to go to the United States for IPO in the past 10 years."
Hao Yusheng, chief representative of Nasdaq Stock Exchange in China, said at the "2020 Listed Company Leaders Summit China Stock Branch" hosted by Snowball.
In April this year, the US Securities Regulatory Commission (SEC) and the US Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) issued the Statement on Audit Quality and the Important Role of Regulatory Access to Audit and Other International Information-Discussion on the Current Challenges of Information Access for US Listed Companies with Large Businesses in China.
The statement said that although international cooperation and coordination have increased significantly in recent years, the problems of US regulators in obtaining information still exist, and the SEC and PCAOB still face legal and practical challenges; Corresponding to the document, the PCAOB website lists in detail the list of listed companies that have encountered audit obstacles and their audit institutions, and a large number of Chinese stock companies are listed.
In addition, in May this year, the U.S. Senate passed the Foreign Company Accountability Act, which puts forward additional information disclosure requirements for foreign companies to list in the United States.
In Hao Yusheng's view, the crisis in Chinese stocks has not affected investors' appetite.
"When this news first came out, it caused everyone's panic. Everyone was asking if they could go public in the United States in the future, but later we found that these problems were not a problem for investors. Investors may ask these questions during the recent IPO roadshow in the United States, or even become standardized questions, but this has not been regarded by investors as an important factor in whether or not to invest in a Chinese company.
It is suggested that everyone treat the current situation with a normal heart as far as possible.
Of course, this may seem to be the most serious situation in the past two years, but as far as investors' appetite is concerned, it has not been affected in any way.
So from now until the end of this year or before the US election, the upsurge of IPO in the United States will continue. "
On May 9 this year, Jinshan Cloud was officially listed on NASDAQ in the United States, becoming the first Chinese company to go to the United States for IPO after the epidemic.
"The listing of Jinshan Cloud gives great confidence to Chinese companies preparing for IPO."
Hao Yusheng said.
According to the data report on Chinese stocks in the first half of 2020 released by Snowball, in the first half of this year, a total of 20 Chinese companies went to the United States for IPOs, an increase of 17.6% over the same period last year; In terms of total initial fund-raising, 20 companies raised a total of 2.725 billion yuan, up more than 52.4% compared with the same period last year; In terms of industry distribution, the number of IPOs in the health care industry in the first half of this year was outstanding, up 100% over the same period last year.
According to Hao Yusheng, the Chinese companies that went to the United States for IPO in the first half of this year are of higher quality, and high-quality companies with excellent fundamentals and growth will be more favored by investors.
In the short, medium and long term, Hao Yusheng continues to be optimistic about the IPO of Ming Chinese companies in the United States.
"In the short term, the upsurge of IPO in the United States continues; in the medium term, Chinese companies have more choices, A shares, Hong Kong stocks, and US stocks. Everyone will consider the US election and Sino-US relations as market choices and time choices; in the long run, everything will return to normal, market fluctuations are cycles, both political and economic cycles, and will eventually return to the normal stage. The stock market has always moved forward with fluctuations."
Hao Yusheng also said, "There are many uncertain factors this year, but for high-quality companies, no matter whether the market is good or bad, as long as they are solid and have growth that investors can see, other factors are relatively secondary. Investors need to invest in excellent Chinese companies."

Commentator of People's Daily: Concentrate on running your own affairs well and create new advantages for future development-on learning and implementing General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech at the Entrepreneur Symposium-Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 25 People's Daily, July 26 commentator's article: Concentrate on running your own affairs and create new advantages for future development
At present, the global epidemic situation and the world economic situation are still severe and complex, and the challenges facing China's development are unprecedented.
Maintaining strategic determination, enhancing confidence in winning, and concentrating on doing our own thing well are the keys for us to cope with various risks and challenges.
At the recent entrepreneur symposium, General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed that under the current external environment of rising protectionism, sluggish world economy and shrinking global market, we must concentrate our efforts on doing our own thing well, give full play to the advantages of the domestic super-large-scale market, gradually form a new development pattern with the domestic big cycle as the main body and the domestic and international double cycles promoting each other, raise the modernization level of the industrial chain and supply chain, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation, speed up key core technology research, and create new advantages for future development.
He who observes the situation is wise, and he who controls the situation wins.
Under the external environment of the in-depth development of economic globalization, the market and resources have played an important role in China's rapid development.
Now, the world under the impact of the epidemic is undergoing profound changes, facing more unstable and uncertain factors, and economic globalization is facing headwinds and turning back waves.
A very important aspect is to take expanding and meeting domestic demand as the strategic basis for development, give full play to its own advantages, and add impetus to China's economic development by prospering the domestic economy and unblocking the domestic cycle.
We should deeply realize that building a complete domestic demand system is related to China's long-term development and long-term stability.
The CPC Central Committee has assessed the situation and clearly proposed to firmly implement the strategy of expanding domestic demand, which is the need to cope with the impact of the epidemic, to maintain the long-term sustained and healthy development of China's economy, and to meet the growing needs of the people for a better life.
The advantage of a large country's economy is that it can be recycled internally.
China has the most complete and largest industrial system in the world, strong production capacity and perfect supporting capacity. It has more than 100 million market players and more than 170 million talents with higher education or various professional skills. There is also a super-large domestic demand market formed by 1.4 billion people, including more than 400 million middle-income groups. It is in the stage of rapid development of new industrialization, informatization, urbanization and agricultural modernization, with great potential for investment demand.
Public ownership is the main body, multiple ownership economies develop together, distribution according to work is the main body, and multiple distribution methods coexist. Socialist basic economic systems such as socialist market economic system can not only stimulate the vitality of various market subjects, liberate and develop social productive forces, but also promote the organic unity of efficiency and fairness, and continuously realize common prosperity.
We should firmly grasp the strategic basis of expanding domestic demand, make production, distribution and circulation rely more on the domestic market to achieve a virtuous circle, clarify the strategic direction of supply-side structural reform, and promote the dynamic balance between total supply and total demand at a higher level.
It is necessary to speed up the construction of a complete domestic demand system, vigorously promote scientific and technological innovation and other aspects of innovation, accelerate the promotion of strategic emerging industries such as digital economy, intelligent manufacturing, life and health, and new materials, form more new growth points and growth poles, and gradually form a new development pattern with the domestic big cycle as the main body and the domestic and international double cycles promoting each other.
Opening up brings progress, while closure is bound to lag behind.
General Secretary Xi Jinping has repeatedly stressed that the door to China's opening will not be closed, but will only open wider and wider.
Taking the domestic cycle as the main body, it is by no means running behind closed doors, but by giving full play to the potential of domestic demand, making better connection between the domestic market and the international market, making better use of the international and domestic markets and resources, and achieving stronger and more sustainable development.
At the same time, there is no contradiction between expanding domestic demand and opening up. The smoother the domestic circulation, the more conducive it is to building a new pattern of opening up and forming new advantages in participating in international cooperation and competition.
Although protectionism is on the rise in the world, we should stand on the right side of history, persist in deepening reform, expanding opening up, strengthening open cooperation in the field of science and technology, promoting the construction of an open world economy, and promoting the construction of a community with a shared future for mankind.
The Chinese nation has experienced many tribulations in its history, but it has never been crushed. Instead, it has become more and more courageous, constantly growing up and rising from tribulations.

Yu'e Bao earnings decline "post-90s" but "retaliatory" to save money?
With the decline of Yu'e Bao's income, the "post-90s" not only did not escape Yu'e Bao, but began to "retaliate" to save money?
The "Yu'ebao Post-90s Savings Report" (2020 Edition) recently released by the China New Economic Research Institute and Alipay shows that in the first half of the year, the "post-90s" prefer to save money: the amount of money saved per capita increased by nearly 40% compared with 2019.
Interestingly, the "post-90s" are more likely to save from a small sum of money, with 60% of the average amount of money saved below 20 yuan...
Saving money with Yu'e Bao has also become the saving habit of the "post-90s."
Data show that of the 700 million Yu'e Bao users, 134 million are "post-90s."
There are 174 million "post-90s" in China, that is to say, about 3 out of every 4 "post-90s" in the country are saving money with Yu'e Bao.
At present, the 7-day annualized rate of return of money funds such as Yu'e Bao has fallen to about 1.5% from a level higher than 2% at the beginning of the year.
Even so, it did not affect the pace of saving money for the "post-90s."
Under the background of the promotion of Yu'e Bao's "saving effect," many young people who are used to using Yu'e Bao have also been directly transformed into "basic people."
According to Alipay data, as of July 13, the number of new "basic people" on Alipay has more than doubled year-on-year in the past month, and more and more young people have realized "advanced" financial management on Alipay.
Some analysts believe that the inflow of funds from Yu'e Bao into the stock market is also an important reason for the clear decline in the share of monetary funds in June.
The report also shows that "post-90s" girls are more likely to save more money, with an average of 20% higher than that of boys. Among the users who hold funds on Alipay platform, 60% are men, and women tend to choose more robust financial management methods than men.
After saving money, what are the plans of the post-90s generation?
Alipay data shows that the "post-90s" have the habit of saving money for their goals, with the largest number of users taking travel as their goal of saving money.
Affected by the epidemic, many "post-90s" save money to prepare for travel after the epidemic; the reopening of cinemas also provides a new way to switch from saving money to consumption.

A total of 13 people from the Information Department of the Philippine Presidential Office tested positive-Chinanews.com
(fighting new crown pneumonia) A total of 13 people from the Information Department of the Philippine Presidential Office tested positive
Chinanews.com, Manila, July 26 (Reporter Guan Xiangdong) The Information Department of the Philippine Presidential Office (PCOO) issued a notice on the 25th that Martin Andanal, the minister of the Ministry, was tested negative for COVID-19 on the 24th.
As of the afternoon of the same day, a total of 13 PCOO staff had tested positive. Of the previous three positive staff, one died and two were still receiving treatment.
Due to contact with an infected PCOO employee, Andanar and 49 PCOO employees were tested for new crown pneumonia on the 24th.
The report released on the 25th showed that 10 of the employees tested positive.
PCOO Deputy Minister of Administration and Legal Affairs Marvin Gatpayat said that the Ministry's new administrative office building in the presidential palace was originally scheduled to resume on the 27th when President Duterte delivered his fifth State of the Union address.
On the same day, Martin Andanal assured the public that PCOO continued to perform its duties to the Filipino people, ensuring that important information was provided to the public in a timely manner, and strengthening contact tracing and testing to avoid further spread of the new crown pneumonia virus among PCOO staff. He prayed for the rapid recovery of the staff who tested positive.

France increases military investment in space-Xinhuanet
French Defense Minister Florence Parly said on the 24th that France will add hundreds of millions of euros to its space defense budget to develop space military forces to prevent "unfriendly actions" that other countries may carry out in outer space.
Paley told Provence on the same day that between 2019 and 2025, the expenditure budget of French space military projects will increase from the previously proposed 3.6 billion euros (about 4.2 billion US dollars) to 4.3 billion euros (5 billion US dollars).
According to the French Military Planning Act 2019-2025 approved by the French Parliament in 2018, France is expected to update its existing observation satellites and communication satellites in the future, launch three electromagnetic interception satellites, and improve the modernization level of space surveillance radar.
French President Emmanuel Macron announced in July last year that a space military command and an "aviation and space force" would be set up within the French air force.
Paley said that she will officially announce the establishment of the space force when she visits a military academy in Salon, Provence.
Paley said that the space force belongs to the Air Force and will have 500 personnel by 2025.
She said: "In the past, people thought that space served the common interests of science, but this idea is gone forever. Today, space is a place where countries compete for global hegemony."
Paley reiterated Macron's previous statement that France has no intention of provoking an arms race.
"We are by no means engaged in an arms race. But it is my responsibility to be fully aware of the threats we may face."
Paley recalled the surveillance of a military satellite shared by France and Italy in 2017.
She said that what was "peeping" was a Russian satellite.
Russia denies this statement.
Paley said that France will "soon" have a small patrol satellite capable of detecting and targeting "the black hands behind those unfriendly actions."
French media believe that the reason why France seeks to establish a space force is that US President Donald Trump asked the US Department of Defense to draft a bill to establish a space force in February last year.
Trump signed the National Defense Authorization Act in December last year, approving the establishment of the Space Force, the sixth largest military service in the United States.
Some experts worry that these US measures have accelerated the pace of militarization of US space and may trigger a new round of space arms race.

The report says the shared accommodation market has picked up since March-Chinanews.com
(Reporter Yang Zhaokui) The "China Shared Accommodation Development Report 2020" (hereinafter referred to as the "Report") recently released by the Sharing Economy Research Center of the National Information Center shows that due to the impact of the epidemic, the transaction volume of China's shared accommodation market decreased by 72.1% year-on-year in the first five months of 2020.
However, the shared accommodation market began to pick up in March, and the market transaction volume, order volume and reception number gradually recovered.
The Report shows that the transaction volume of the shared accommodation market has declined sharply. On the one hand, due to the sharp decline in the demand for travel accommodation under the prevention and control of the epidemic, the order volume has decreased sharply. The total order volume in the first five months decreased by 65% year-on-year, and the number of receptions decreased by 63% year-on-year. On the other hand, the weak demand also led to a relatively obvious decline in overnight prices, with the average overnight price in the first five months falling by 16% year-on-year.
However, the market transaction volume in March, April and May increased by 78%, 199% and 35% respectively; the number of orders increased by 141%, 152% and 50% respectively; and the number of receptions increased by 81%, 112% and 28% respectively.
The Report points out that the development of the shared accommodation industry is promising for a long time, but there are still many uncertainties in the near future.
In this regard, Yu Fengxia, deputy director of the Sharing Economy Research Center of the National Information Center, told the Workers' Daily reporter that the development of shared accommodation needs stronger policy support. On the one hand, it is necessary to implement the policies already issued in the early stage, further strengthen policy publicity and focus on creating a better business environment; On the other hand, it is necessary to further strengthen policy guidance and support from stimulating consumer demand, enriching the supply of tourism accommodation services, innovating service methods and strengthening cooperation between the government and platform enterprises.

Xinhua News Agency, Xiamen, July 26 (Yang Fushan, Zhang Shushan, Xu Jingyi) The Department of Vascular Surgery of Shanghai Changhai Hospital, Naval Military Medical University, a famous vascular surgery center in China, signed a contract with the Department of Vascular Surgery of Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University on the 25th to jointly set up a cooperation center to promote exchanges and cooperation between the two sides in the field of vascular surgery, especially in the field of acute and severe aortic disease.
Zhongshan Hospital affiliated to Xiamen University said that after the vascular surgery of the two hospitals formally formed a cooperative unit, they will carry out remote consultation, formulate treatment plans with Changhai Hospital for real-time online consultation, select and send talents for further training, and jointly carry out surgical technical exchanges and teaching inspections every week. For complex cases, Changhai experts can be invited to the hospital for surgery according to the needs of patients, so that patients in southwest Fujian can enjoy the top medical resources in China without leaving the province.
The two hospitals will also work together to carry out innovative scientific research on surgery, popular science and early screening of aortic diseases, etc.
A special seminar on aorta sponsored by Beijing Health Promotion Association and hosted by Zhongshan Hospital affiliated to Xiamen University was held in Xiamen on the same day.
At the same time, the two well-known hospitals in Shanghai and Xiamen held a signing ceremony for the vascular surgery cooperation center and announced the formation of a cooperation unit to jointly improve the treatment level of vascular surgery-related diseases in southwest Fujian.
The Department of Vascular Surgery of Shanghai Changhai Hospital is the only Institute of Vascular Surgery in the army and the only clinical medical center of vascular system diseases in Shanghai. It is also the first national key discipline of vascular surgery. It has led the establishment of the Endovascular Professional Committee of the Chinese Medical Association and is a top team with deep accumulation in the industry.
Professor Huang Xiaojin, director of vascular surgery at Zhongshan Hospital affiliated to Xiamen University, was interviewed by the media.
The Department of Vascular Surgery of Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University is the first independent discipline of vascular surgery in Fujian Province. It has long been committed to the diagnosis and treatment of aortic and peripheral vascular diseases. In 2018, it was approved to build a provincial key clinical specialty.
In the treatment of aortic diseases, in addition to the treatment of dissecting aneurysms and aortic aneurysms, he has extensive experience in emergency ruptured aortic aneurysms.
"The vascular surgery of Zhongshan Hospital affiliated to Xiamen University is very outstanding in this region in terms of the history of development, the breadth, difficulty and complexity of the operation, so this time we set up a cooperation center. In addition to the aorta, we can also carry out all-round in-depth cooperation in medicine, teaching and scientific research in the diagnosis and treatment of lower limb arteries, carotid arteries and other diseases."
Professor Feng Rui, deputy director of vascular surgery at Shanghai Changhai Hospital, said.
Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University and Shanghai Changhai Hospital signed a contract to establish "Li Zhaoshen Famous Doctor Studio" in the Department of Gastroenterology in 2018.
Professor Huang Xiaojin, director of vascular surgery of the hospital, said in an interview with Chinanews.com that the vascular surgery of the hospital has also had a long history of exchanges with Changhai Hospital. This time, the two hospitals formally formed a cooperative unit, bringing the cooperation and exchanges between the two sides to a new level.
He said that the hospital will regularly invite Shanghai experts to Xiamen to carry out surgical technical exchanges, teaching visits, difficult case discussions, etc., and further carry out remote consultation. Currently, it plans to conduct remote consultation once a week; In addition, the department will also select and send personnel for further study and exchange to strengthen the training and development of subject talents.
Reporters learned at the meeting that vascular disease is the leading cause of death in China. As the main road of various organs of the human body, the aorta flows from the heart to the whole body and plays an important role.
The occurrence of aortic disease is often accompanied by high risk, high mortality and high difficulty of treatment. The thickest section of aorta is up to 4cm in diameter. Once hemangioma is formed, rupture occurs, or vascular intima rupture produces dissection, it will cause massive hemorrhage, which is very dangerous.
In recent years, with the change of people's lifestyle and the acceleration of the pace of life, China has become the world's largest country with hypertension, and aortic diseases have also increased. Nowadays, with the development of surgical technology and industrial materials, the treatment of aortic diseases has continued to develop in a minimally invasive, rapid and efficient direction.
Doctors can puncture from the thigh and place stents in the aorta to properly "change lanes" for blood flow, so as to avoid the impact on aneurysms or ruptured dissections and achieve good therapeutic results. Some operations even require local anesthesia.
This academic seminar invited more than ten domestic experts to discuss the new progress in the treatment of aortic diseases, and carried out cutting-edge technical training and difficult case discussion in the form of conference salon.
The reporter learned at the meeting that with the development of surgical technology and industrial materials, the treatment of aortic diseases is developing in a minimally invasive, rapid and efficient direction.

The reporter learned from the emergency management department on the 25th that it is expected that there will be heavy rainfall from Sichuan Basin to the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River by the 27th, and it is necessary to pay continuous attention to the impact on the flood situation of the Yangtze River and Huaihe River. Dikes in some areas of the Yangtze River and Huaihe River Basin are soaked in high water level for a long time, and the risk of landslides, collapses, piping and other dangerous situations is high.
After consultation and judgment, the National Defense General decided to continue to maintain the level II response of flood control in the Yangtze River and Huaihe River.
On the 25th, the Ministry of Water Resources stressed that the main stream of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River maintains a high water level, and the flood peak of the main stream of the Huaihe River passes through the Bengbu section of Anhui Province. The water level of Taihu Lake has been over-alerted for 28 days and over-guaranteed for 9 days. The current flood control situation is still grim, and the flood control work cannot be relaxed at all, so it is necessary to continue to do a solid job in various defense work.
At the same time, we will do a good job in preventing heavy rainfall in southwest and North China.
The Ministry of Water Resources maintains level II emergency response for flood and drought disaster prevention.
At the request of Jiangxi Provincial Defense Office, the State Defense Office and the Emergency Management Department urgently dispatched 20 sets of large-flow professional drainage vehicles from Shandong, Jiangsu and Zhejiang Fire and Rescue Corps and Fujian Longyan Qiaolong Emergency Equipment Co., Ltd. to help solve serious disasters such as urban waterlogging and farmland soaking caused by heavy rainfall in Jiangxi.
On the 25th, all the equipment had arrived at the front line of flood fighting and rescue in Jiangxi.

Recently, the Yangtze River and Huaihe River basins in China suffered from floods, and some of the affected people moved to flood control resettlement sites for temporary residence.
With the concentration of personnel in the resettlement sites, the temporary use of fire and electricity increases, and the risk of fire increases.
The Fire and Rescue Bureau of the Emergency Management Department issued a fire safety reminder for flood control resettlement sites on July 25, calling on management units to implement the main responsibility of fire safety, and the masses to strengthen safety precautions and jointly create a good fire safety environment.

This year is the 15th anniversary of the game "Journey" IP15, and the launch of the film of the same name is undoubtedly a tribute to the classic game.
At the same time as the announcement of the filing, the film "Journey" released the "National War" version of the filing poster and the "Live" pilot trailer.
The excellent picture quality presents a grand picture of the national war in the world, depicting the profound brotherhood of the two protagonists, Dong Yilong and Chu Soul.
"Journey" chooses the overhead era to build the story background.
In the fictional Central Plains, among the ten countries, the South Zhao State and the North Yan State live next to each other.
In order to defend against the increasingly powerful Beiyan, Nanzhao held a martial arts competition to select generals.
The news spread to the remote Qingyuan village. The villager Dong Yilong wanted to be the flag bearer of the family and compete on behalf of the Qingyuan village family, but the villagers questioned his qualifications. After some efforts, Yilong finally embarked on a journey with the warrior Chu Soul.
The total investment of the film is nearly 300 million yuan, and the proportion of special effects shots in the whole film is as high as 80%.
It is conceivable that special effects have become one of the biggest highlights of Journey.
The post-special effects production team is also quite well-established. MORE VFX, the special effects team that created Wandering Earth, is responsible for restoring the "journey" world with imaginative visual art and top technology.
Some of the classic game scenes, Phoenix, Qingyuan Village and Beast King Valley, will also appear in the movie, and game players should set off a wave of nostalgia.
In addition to the special effects team, behind-the-scenes production is also a group of people who have made great achievements in the industry.
Director Chen Desen has directed "October Siege" and "Purple Rain Storm." Producer Zheng Baorui has filmed "Kill the Wolf 2" and "Journey to the West's Monkey King three dozen white bones." The action scenes are in the charge of Dong Wei, the best action director of the Academy Awards and the Golden Horse Awards. Art director Mak Guoqiang is also the winner of the best finger of the two Academy Awards.

China News Service, Chongqing, July 26 (Reporter Han Lu) The reporter learned from China Railway Chengdu Bureau Group Co., Ltd. on the 26th that the small Three Gorges Tunnel of Zhengwan High-speed Railway with a total length of about 18.9 kilometers was completed on the same day.
It is understood that the Small Three Gorges Tunnel is not only the longest high-speed railway tunnel in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, but also the longest single-hole double-track high-speed railway tunnel with a design speed of 350 km / h among the projects currently under construction in China.
Zhengzhou-Wanzhou high-speed railway is located in Henan, Hubei and Chongqing provinces and cities, connecting Beijing-Guangzhou and Xulan high-speed railway in the north of Zhengzhou, and connecting Chongqing-Wanzhou high-speed railway in the south of Wanzhou. It is an important part of the "eight vertical and eight horizontal" high-speed railway network in China.
The Zhengwan High-speed Railway Small Three Gorges Tunnel was completed on the 26th.
The picture shows the scene.
Zhengzhou Wanzhou high-speed railway starts from Zhengzhou City, Henan Province, and passes southwest through Pingdingshan City, Nanyang City, Xiangyang City, Hubei Province to Wanzhou District, Chongqing City. The new line is about 818 kilometers long, with a design speed of 350 kilometers per hour, and about 184 kilometers in Chongqing.
Among them, the Zhengzhou-Xiangyang section has been opened for operation in advance on December 1, 2019, and the Chongqing section is stepping up construction.
The Small Three Gorges Tunnel, which runs through the whole line on the 26th, is a full-line control project of Zhengwan High-speed Railway. The project is located at the junction of Fengjie County and Wushan County in Chongqing, with a total length of about 18.9 kilometers and a maximum buried depth of 890 meters.
Construction of the tunnel began in February 2017 and was completed on July 26, 2020.
According to Wang Guojun, head of Zhengwan High-speed Railway Tunnel Design of China Railway Second Academy Engineering Group Co., Ltd., the survey and design party, the small Three Gorges Tunnel is located in very complex topographic and geological conditions, facing risks such as karst, sudden mud gushing and large deformation of soft rock. It is a Class I high-risk tunnel, and the design and construction of the tunnel are extremely difficult.
"During the construction of the project, we used geological survey method, geophysical exploration method and advanced drilling method to advance geological prediction, and adopted special design schemes for more than 30 karst caves of various types. For example, a bridge with a length of 24 meters was designed and built to span a large karst cave with a longitudinal length of more than 10 meters and a depth of more than 55 meters in the tunnel to avoid tunnel settlement." Wang Guojun said.
According to the introduction of the China Railway Tunnel Bureau, during the construction of the tunnel, the combination of dredging, guiding and blocking was adopted. Through the construction of horizontal tunnels, grouting and water blocking, the strengthening of tunnel structural support and the construction of sewage treatment station, the orderly progress of the project was ensured, and the damage of construction drainage to the water body of the Small Three Gorges Scenic Area was avoided. At the same time, the construction problems such as the large deformation of soft rock with a length of 7 kilometers and the construction problems such as the large deformation of soft rock with a daily maximum water inflow of 157,000 cubic meters were successfully overcome.
When the Zhengwan high-speed railway is completed and opened to traffic, it will become a new convenient and fast passenger transport main channel from southwest China to the Central Plains, North China and Northeast China. It is of great significance to improve the capacity and quality of the northeast railway channel in southwest China, improve the layout of the regional road network, speed up the development of tourism resources and urbanization along the line, promote regional coordinated development, and promote the implementation of the western development strategy.
Experts say it is unconstitutional to collect immigration data through the US census for the allocation of seats in the House of Representatives
Some civil rights organizations and several American cities and counties have sued the US federal government, saying that the Trump presidential palace's attempt to exclude undocumented immigrants from the US census is unworkable and unconstitutional.
The U.S. Census will determine the distribution of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.
"It's not going to work," Sarah Brannon, executive lawyer of the American Civil Rights and Freedom League, told VOA.
She went on to say that Trump's request to determine the citizenship of the people surveyed in the census is difficult to do and "not very reliable."
Another civil liberties group, Common Cause, filed a lawsuit Thursday challenging Trump's executive order.
Some cities in New Jersey and Georgia joined the lawsuit.
Arlington County, Virginia, joined the lawsuit Friday.
Garvey, chairman of Arlington County's management board, said, "The U.S. Constitution requires an accurate count of our population every 10 years. We must accurately count everyone living in Arlington County and cannot let this illegal attempt to scare away people and reduce the number of our immigrant communities succeed."
Other organizations and individuals praised President Trump's executive order.
Alabama Attorney General Marshall called the executive order a "victory" for the state.
He said, "When allocating seats in the House of Representatives and electoral college seats in each state, it must be based on the number of residents living in each state and the number of residents living legally."
The U.S. Supreme Court last year blocked the Trump administration from including citizenship in the 2020 census.
President Trump signed an executive order earlier this week instructing Commerce Secretary Ross, who oversees the U.S. Census Bureau, to submit data on undocumented people from the census so that the administration can exclude these undocumented people from the census figures of each state and determine whether each state increases, decreases or maintains seats in the House of Representatives.
The United States redistributes seats in the House of Representatives every 10 years according to demographic changes.
Heavy rain falls in 33 districts and counties of Chongqing, local flood control level IV emergency response-Zhongxin.com
Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, July 26 (Reporters Ke Gaoyang and Li Song) The reporter learned from the Chongqing Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters that Chongqing has ushered in a new round of heavy rainfall since July 25, with torrential rains in 33 districts and counties, and floods exceeding the warning water level in 4 small and medium-sized rivers. The local flood control level IV emergency response has been launched.
According to the monitoring of Chongqing Hydrological Monitoring Station, from 8: 00 on the 25th to 8: 00 on the 26th, most areas of Chongqing ushered in heavy rains, with 33 districts and counties such as Jiangjin, Luojiang and Wulong experiencing heavy rains, including 16 districts and counties such as Wanzhou, Yunyang and Nanchuan.
The maximum daily rainfall was 197.5 mm in Longshan Village, Jinshan Town, Nanchuan.
Affected by heavy rainfall, four small and medium-sized rivers in Jiangjin District, Youjiang River in Fuling District, Yingyang River in Kaizhou District and Tuantan River in Yunyang County have experienced over-warning water level floods, and the water level is still rising.
Heavy rainfall also led to landslides in Liujing Village, Tudi Township, Wulong District, resulting in the interruption of village road traffic. The landslide slipped into the tributary of Wujiang River along the Cang River, blocking the river to form a barrier lake. The local area has urgently organized the transfer of people downstream.
In response to the rainstorm, Chongqing Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters issued Class III early warning information for river floods at 13: 00 on the 26th, and launched Class IV emergency response for flood control, requiring relevant districts, counties and units to strengthen patrol duty, mobilize emergency rescue teams and materials in time, and evacuate and transfer people in threatened areas.
Move in response to the situation and promote the construction of industrial projects-Viewpoint headlines-Hunan Daily Network-Huasheng Online
In Hunan in midsummer, the heat wave hits the face.
However, the enthusiasm released by the on-site observation meeting to promote the construction of industrial projects in the whole province has overshadowed the hot summer in the dog days, and the clear orientation of "comparing strength with industry and discussing heroes with projects" is encouraging Sanxiang and Sishui.
The development of Hunan always depends on building projects and cultivating industries.
In the face of the extremely unusual first half of the year, under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, the whole province adhered to a game of chess, went all out to fight the two hard battles of epidemic prevention and flood control, and took industrial projects as the "first move" to implement the "six stability" and "six guarantees."
From a year-on-year decline of 1.9% in GDP in the first quarter to a year-on-year growth of 1.3% in the first half of the year, it is self-evident that the period is difficult and the effort is huge.
In this precious report card, the construction of industrial projects is the key support for Hunan to accelerate economic recovery and stable development.
The potential is smooth and irreversible.
The construction of industrial projects should be put into the overall situation. They should not only be good at accumulating, accumulating and seeking potential, but also be good at recognizing, seeking and adapting to changes.
Under the complex and severe background of the current international situation, in addition to painstaking efforts to attract investment, it is necessary to calm down and study the new characteristics of the current new situation, grasp the rules more scientifically and accurately, and better integrate into the new development pattern with the domestic big cycle as the main body and the domestic and international double cycles promoting each other.
Pay more attention to improving the basic industrial capacity.
In the first half of the year, not only did a large number of heavyweight investment projects in emerging industries break ground and sow hope in our province, but also enterprises in traditional advantageous industries accelerated their deployment in the digital, intelligent and green industrial transformation.
The Yiyang Aoshikang Third Science Park project transforms the existing production line, and the intelligent production line of high-end printed circuit boards takes the lead; The new factory area of Hunan Zhongyan Changde Cigarette Factory is committed to the process of intelligent transformation and construction of a modern factory, which is also a vivid portrayal of "old trees sprouting new shoots..." Focusing on the major national strategy and "two new and one heavy," efforts should be made to consolidate and upgrade advantageous industries, actively cultivate and develop emerging industries, and comprehensively increase scientific and technological innovation and localization substitution, so as to continuously consolidate the basic conditions and accumulate transformation momentum.
Pay more attention to cultivating and developing new economies, new formats and new models.
The sudden new crown epidemic has brought the popularity of the "cloud economy," stimulated the potential of the digital economy, and provided new opportunities for industrial transformation: in the first half of the year, the computer and office equipment manufacturing industry, electronic and communication equipment manufacturing industry in our province increased by 12.6%, the online retail sales of wholesale and retail enterprises above the quota increased by 32.2% year-on-year, and the online meal fee income of catering enterprises increased by 35.6% year-on-year.
It is the general trend to cultivate new opportunities in the crisis, open a new situation in the changing situation, actively promote digital industrialization and industrial digitization, and guide the integrated development of digital economy and real economy.
Pay more attention to optimizing and stabilizing the industrial chain supply chain.
Construction machinery is the main force of Hunan industry, but two-thirds of the supporting enterprises are outside the province, and there is still space and potential in the supporting chain.
To strengthen the thinking of the industrial chain and grasp the project, it is necessary not only to have the continuous accumulation of head enterprises and achieve technological breakthroughs in key links of the industrial chain; It is also necessary for all localities to devote themselves to cultivation, to stimulate the "chain" lock response by strengthening the chain to supplement the chain and extend the chain, to promote the coordinated layout of relevant supporting industries, and to speed up the construction of an independent, controllable, safe and reliable industrial chain supply chain.
To tide over difficulties and support enterprises, Hunan is still a hot and happy place with a good business environment and emerging market opportunities.
All parts of the province frequently make moves, make new moves, and make practical moves, thinking that the "burden reduction" of enterprise bail-out will lead to the "acceleration" of high-quality development; Shaoyang implements "shareholder-style" service, which does not shirk responsibility for enterprises, does not discount policies, and does not solve problems overnight... In the process of recovering the losses caused by the epidemic, all kinds of "do everything possible" to identify short-board pain points and achieve vivid stories of turning crises into opportunities.
Focusing on studying, cultivating and developing industries and optimizing the business environment will surely win the favor of more investors.
The wind and waves are still ahead, but the state of riding the wind and waves has become the norm for the whole province to focus on the construction of industrial projects and promote high-quality development.
During this critical period, we must learn and implement the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's series of important instructions, effectively deal with external uncertainties with the certainty of our own work, persevere in promoting the construction of industrial projects, and share enthusiasm and sweat to ensure the successful conclusion of the 13th Five-Year Plan and building a well-off society in an all-round way.

The overall stability of employment and prices shows that the economy has "temperature" -Zhongxin.com

The overall stability of employment and prices shows that the economy has "temperature"
Economic Daily · China Economic Net reporter Lin Huocan
In the first half of this year, in the face of the impact of the new crown pneumonia epidemic, China made overall efforts to promote epidemic prevention and control and economic and social development. The situation of epidemic prevention and control continued to improve, and the steady economic recovery was obvious. The employment and price performance closely related to people's livelihood were generally stable, and the Chinese economy handed over a report card of economic operation with temperature.
In the first two months of this year, the surveyed unemployment rate increased.
Especially in February, the production and operation activities of many enterprises were basically in a state of shutdown, the employment demand of enterprises decreased, recruitment was delayed or cancelled, and the unemployment rate surveyed in cities and towns increased.
With the gradual improvement of the epidemic prevention and control situation, the production and living order of the whole society has been continuously restored.
The CPC Central Committee adheres to the general tone of seeking progress while maintaining stability, further strengthens the hedging of macro policies, comprehensively strengthens the employment priority policy, and actively promotes the work of assisting enterprises to stabilize posts and expand employment.
China has increased policies to hedge and stabilize jobs, played a combination of "relief, relief, and compensation" policies, reduced and exempted the contributions of three social insurance units in stages, allowed to postpone the payment of social insurance premiums, expanded the benefits of the policy of stable post return of unemployment insurance for small and medium-sized enterprises and replacing training with workers, and provided absorption subsidies and internship subsidies for enterprises to absorb the employment of key groups.
With the implementation of various policies to stabilize employment, the employment demand of enterprises has steadily rebounded, the employment situation has gradually improved, and the surveyed unemployment rate in cities and towns has gradually decreased. In June, the surveyed unemployment rate was 5.7%.
Zhang Yi, director of the Department of Population and Employment Statistics of the National Bureau of Statistics, said that in the second quarter, various employment policies continued to take effect, and the labor force that withdrew due to the impact of the epidemic returned one after another. The urban labor participation rate in June increased by about 10 percentage points compared with February, which was close to the level of the same period last year.
Data show that the total urban employment in June increased by more than 19% compared with February, and most industries reached the pre-epidemic level; The average weekly working hours of employees in enterprises reached 46.8 hours, 6.6 hours higher than in February and 0.1 hours higher than in January.
Prices are also related to thousands of households.
In January this year, CPI rose by 5.4% year-on-year, setting a new high for many years.
In February, although the year-on-year increase of CPI fell slightly, it was still in the "5 range."
The year-on-year increase of CPI is at a high level, which is not only driven by consumer demand before the Spring Festival, but also by the wrong month of the Spring Festival and a low year-on-year base.
However, the impact of the new crown pneumonia epidemic on prices is particularly obvious.
Affected by the prevention and control of the epidemic, logistics delays, untimely material supply and increased material transportation costs occurred all over the country in January and February. In addition, some citizens hoarded and snapped up, and the prices of some daily necessities increased significantly.
In order to cope with the disturbance brought by epidemic prevention and control to the price situation, relevant departments have brought important living materials into the scope of emergency transportation guarantee to ensure smooth transportation of materials.
Under the action of a series of policy measures, the market supply of vegetables and fruits has been strongly guaranteed.
In response to the rapid rise in pork prices at the beginning of this year, after the central government issued the policy of ensuring supply and stabilizing prices, all regions and departments quickly implemented it, and the supply of pork reserves was significantly improved, pig production capacity was restored in an orderly manner, and the production and marketing order was gradually normal.
Since March, pork prices have continued to decline, and the year-on-year increase in food prices fell back to 10.6% in May; In June, pork prices rose slightly month-on-month due to factors such as the slowdown in pig production, the decrease in import volume and the rebound in group consumption demand.
The seasonal changes of fresh vegetable prices are obvious, with an average increase of 3.4% in the first half of the year.
Affected by the high base of comparison in the same period last year, the price of fresh fruit continued to decline year on year, with an average decline of 13.3% in the first half of the year.
The basic livelihood of the people has been effectively guaranteed, and the overall economic and social situation has remained stable and orderly.
With the gradual recovery of transportation and logistics, all localities have increased their efforts to ensure supply, and the market supply and demand situation has improved.
Since March, CPI has declined for four consecutive months, and the year-on-year increase has also dropped from 4.3% in March to 2.5% in June, and the overall price level has returned to stability.
In the second half of the year, China's prices will continue to maintain a moderate level, and the overall inflationary pressure is not great. However, it is still necessary to promote the restoration of production and living order on the premise of normalizing epidemic prevention and control.
Effectively respond to natural disasters such as floods and droughts in major agricultural production areas such as grain, fruits and vegetables, strengthen market supervision, and resolutely crack down on hoarding, price gouging and other behaviors that disrupt market order.

New book reveals: Prince Harry thinks his brother is "snobbish and arrogant"
The British "Times" and "Sunday Times" serialized a new book called "Finding Freedom," which depicts the royal life of Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle.
However, Reuters reported that Harry and Megan had distanced themselves from the book, saying that they had not accepted the author's interview or provided any content.
The Sunday Times reported that the new book quoted sources as saying that when Harry and Megan were dating before marriage, Prince William wanted to confirm whether Megan, who was a Hollywood actress, had ulterior motives for Harry.
According to sources, William said to Harry at that time: "Don't feel the need to rush (marry Megan).
You can try to take the time to get to know this girl. "
The report said that when Harry heard William describe Megan as "this girl," he felt arrogant and snobbish from his brother's tone, and he also thought he no longer needed other people to take care of him.
Harry and Megan announced in January this year that they plan to live a more independent life and will support themselves.
After they officially stepped down as senior members of the royal family in March, they are currently living in Los Angeles with their son Archie to pursue a new career.
Harry and Megan got married in May 2018.
At that time, the marriage was regarded as injecting Hollywood's glamour and new era atmosphere into the British royal family, and the two became one of the most watched celebrity couples in the world.

"Flower Sea Live Room" by Qinghai Lake: "Sweet" Brings Goods to Help Farmers Increase Income-Chinanews.com

BEIJING, Hainan, Qinghai, July 26 (Xinhua) Title: "Flower Sea Live Room" by Qinghai Lake: "Sweet" Brings Goods to Help Farmers Increase Income
Author Hu Guilong Pan Yujie
"In midsummer, Qinghai Lake is full of golden flowers and thousands of bees flying. Here, the altitude is higher, the temperature difference between day and night is large, and the air pollution is less. The strong light breeds the most tenacious and generous bee colony, creating Qinghai royal jelly with high activity, high protein, rich nutritional value, low sugar and low fat characteristics."
On the 26th, Zhang Jianxun, deputy director of the Industry and Information Administration of Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, said.
On the same day, the live broadcast of bee products was held on the banks of Qinghai Lake. The China Bee Products Association, representatives of entrepreneurs, bee farmers and other parties gathered to jointly promote Qinghai characteristic bee products. A total of nearly 10,000 bottles of Qinghai Plateau royal jelly were sold online and offline, with a total amount of nearly 3.8 million yuan.
The picture shows bee farmers showing bee products on the spot.
It is reported that this live delivery activity uses Beijing Houdeli Bee Industry Chain Store Network, Express Hand, Taobao and other well-known domestic bee product retail enterprises, live broadcast, and e-commerce platforms to promote the exchange and cooperation of "enterprises + beekeepers + growers," and continues to issue "Qinghai Plateau Spring Pulp Consumption Vouchers" to consumers through online and offline channels. It is estimated that the total profit of enterprises for the whole year will be nearly 5.28 million yuan.
In this regard, Wu Na, president of Beijing Houdeli Bee Industry Co., Ltd. thinks it is "very worthwhile": "This move can expand the popularity of Qinghai bee products, attract more consumers to understand and like bee products without adding pure nature, and drive bee farmers to increase their income."
At present, the company has signed production cooperation strategic agreements with Qinghai Cloud Bee Industry Co., Ltd. and Qinghai Huabao Bee Industry Co., Ltd., hoping to jointly promote the rapid development of Qinghai's local bee industry.
The picture shows the sea of rape flowers by Qinghai Lake.
This spring, due to the need to set up road checkpoints for epidemic prevention and control, beekeepers' journey of "chasing flowers and honey" was blocked. Many bees died due to missing the flowering period and lack of food, and beekeepers' income was seriously affected.
"All the year round, beekeepers travel long distances with the flowering period, moving all the way north from Yunnan and Sichuan to the northwest. They live in the open air and have no fixed place to live. It is very hard.
As enterprises, we have a responsibility to help them. "
Wu Na said.
"Little bees are 'environmental scouts' and bees can't survive in heavily polluted areas." Zhao Xiaochuan, executive vice president of China Bee Products Association, said that bee pollination is an important link in the ecological chain and plays an irreplaceable role in protecting plant diversity and improving the ecological environment.
At the same time, bee pollination can increase the yield and quality of crops, especially in areas with wide planting and poor management conditions, pollination is of greater significance.
Research data show that pollination can increase rape yield by about 15% -30%.
The picture shows Zhao Xiaochuan (right), executive vice president of China Bee Products Association, promoting Qinghai bee products.
"The economic, ecological and social benefits created by bee pollination are far greater than the value of bee products themselves. The bee industry has great potential in human health, crop production, vegetation reproduction and ecological protection, but people have always known little about it."
Zhao Xiaochuan said.
Nowadays, the number of beekeepers is getting smaller and smaller. In addition to beekeepers who travel all the year round, there are still many poor households with mobility difficulties who choose to invest in cooperatives with beehives.
"The state has financial support. We contact technical personnel to help guide. Bee farmers lack understanding and judgment of the market environment. To open up sales, they also need the help and coordination of the government, enterprises and industry associations."
Zhao Xiaochuan said.
"I hope everyone will pay more attention to and help beekeeping groups in the future," Wu Na said. "Our bee products are also screened and controlled in strict accordance with national standards to ensure quality and protect consumer rights while helping beekeepers."

The memorial ceremony for the heroes was held in a solemn atmosphere. Representatives offered incense to the heroes one after another to remember their great achievements and the special solidarity between the elderly.
Minister Counsellor Zheng Shixin said in his speech that this is an opportunity for the old Vietnamese and Lao people to jointly remember the revolutionary heroes of the two countries and express their gratitude to the heroes who sacrificed for the independence and freedom of the two countries. At the same time, it is also a good opportunity for the two peoples to recall that the two countries work side by side to fight against the common enemy, strive for national independence, national reunification, jointly build national development and consolidate bilateral relations.
Seventy-four years ago, on January 23, 1946, 28 soldiers of the Lao Vietnam Combat Alliance died bravely while attacking the Phonehe stronghold.

The statement did not mention the cause of the drone crash.
Israeli media reported that the drone may have malfunctioned and crashed.
According to reports, Israeli Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Ganz said during a visit to northern Israel that afternoon that Israel would continue to take actions against Syria and Lebanon in order to ensure its security interests.
Israel has long regarded Hezbollah in Lebanon as a major security threat and accused Iran of sending weapons to Hezbollah in Lebanon through the Syrian land corridor. The situation near the Israeli-Lebanese border is tense from time to time.

Liu Yunlong, the old face of spy war drama, plays a stuttering hero-Xinhuanet
Produced by Liu Yunlong, directed by Yin Fei and starring Liu Yunlong, Su Qing, Liang Guanhua and Li Liqun, the large-scale spy war drama "Winning" landed on Guangdong Satellite TV's "Vitality Theater" at 7: 30 p.m. on July 16.
The play tells the story of Tang Fei (Liu Yunlong), an underground member of the Communist Party of China lurking in the Japanese puppet police station, who joined Soviet agents to assassinate the leader of Japanese agents and smash the Japanese army's shocking plot.
"Winning" is adapted from historical facts, and the material is taken from the dusty Soviet military archives for many years.
During the defense of Moscow, the elite of the Soviet Red Army in the Far East advanced westward to assist. At this time, the "northward faction" of the Japanese Kwantung Army thought there was an opportunity and wanted to send troops.
In order to solve the danger of the enemy, the intelligence personnel of the Communist Party of China and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union jointly implemented the "Mudanula" plan.
According to this historical background, Deng Yuan, a well-known screenwriter, has been polished several times, making the plot twists and turns.
Liu Yunlong served as both producer and actor in "Winning" this time.
In the play, Tang Fei, who he plays, is the Chief of the Criminal Section of Linhe Police Department. He is a stuttering policeman who is quite happy and even a little ruffian. His real identity is an underground member of the Communist Party of China.
Cai Meng, the heroine who plays opposite him, is the section chief of Linhe Security Bureau, which is deeply appreciated by Japanese boss Fukuhara. There is a delicate and ambiguous relationship between him and Tang Fei.
Su Qing has tried many different types of roles in recent years, from Lu Ruowen in "Those Years We Are Young" to Er Qing in "Yanxi Strategy," all of which have impressed the audience and been recognized for their acting skills.
This time, Su Qing and Liu Yunlong are partners for the first time. The setting of stuttering sheriff and charming policewoman is quite interesting and innovative.
In addition to the two protagonists, there are many powerful actors such as Liang Guanhua, Li Liqun, Qian Bo, Lei Han and Shen Junyi in Winning, and the old play Bone Racing is also one of the highlights of the play.
It is understood that the production of "odds" is also very sophisticated, with the crew shooting nearly 2,000 kilometers across Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Liaoning provinces.
In order to restore the bizarre urban features during the Japanese occupation period in Northeast China, the art and props team of the crew rushed to work day and night, carefully polishing every detail of the scene construction and props, making the scenes in the play exquisite and rich in historical texture.

According to the statistics of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, since 2017, the number of people infected with cholera in Yemen has exceeded 1 million, and the death toll has exceeded 2,000.
Yemeni medical institutions are worried that the continued flooding will lead to the spread of cholera epidemic again.
"Jedi Attack" is released, fights in the ring and dreams of life-Xinhuanet
Directed by young director Gao Zhuangzhuang and starring Liao William, Dong Yu, Yang Xinyi and Wang Yibo, the online film "Jedi Attack" was officially released in iQiyi.
The film tells the story of down-and-out boxer Venus returning to the ring and fighting for dignity, showing a passionate journey of dreaming.
The film "Jedi Attack" takes Thailand as the main plot and takes "Muay Thai" as the starting point for Venus, the down-and-out boxing champion, to pursue his dream. The whole story is based on the adaptation of traditional Chinese cultural values. Whether Venus made up her mind to fight fake boxing for her master in the early stage or revived her efforts to fight for dignity with the support of friends and lovers in the later stage, it shows men's pursuit and great love for family and dreams in traditional Chinese culture.
Combining the classic Hollywood sports movie story mode and the strong combination of professional teams from China and Thailand, "Jedi Attack" not only presents an international effect, but also will impress different types of audiences.
At the same time, "Jedi Attack" shows a large number of Muay Thai fighting and training plots, scenes of intensity and blood.
In the film, game designer Zhang Xiaoliang, played by Dong Yu, helps Venus, played by William Liao, return to the ring and win the crown through fighting games, combining novel and interesting high-tech with hot-blooded competitive competitions, and also shows the brotherhood between Zhang Xiaoliang and Venus, which seems to be "different" but actually has the same goal.
In addition, the long-flowing love between Venus and Jingjing is also very touching. Jingjing's silent support for Venus and Venus' firm commitment to Jingjing let the audience see the "iron man tenderness" of Venus and added a lot of human touch to the down-and-out champion.

Greenland Opens a New Round of Mixed Reform Shanghai State-owned Assets Plans to Transfer 17.5% Shares-Economic Observation Network-Professional Financial News Website
Economic Observer Network reporter Rao Xianjun on July 26, Greenland Holdings (600606.SH) issued the "Prompt Notice on State-owned Shareholders' Intention to Transfer Part of the Company's Shares and Resume Trading by Public Solicitation of Transferees."
According to the announcement, in order to further deepen the reform of state-owned assets and state-owned enterprises, optimize the structural adjustment of state-owned assets layout, and improve the equity structure of Greenland, Shanghai Real Estate (Group) Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Shanghai Real Estate") and Shanghai Urban Investment (Group) Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Shanghai Urban Investment") intend to transfer part of the shares held by the company through public solicitation of transferees, and the total proportion of shares to be transferred shall not exceed 17.5% of the total share capital of Greenland.
The price of the shares to be transferred this time shall not be lower than the higher of the following two: the arithmetic average of the daily weighted average price of the 30 trading days before the indicative announcement date (July 27, 2020); the audited net asset value per share of the company in the most recent fiscal year.
At present, there is still no final conclusion on the new strategic investors of Greenland. According to the public announcement information, it is estimated that the new strategic investors need to pay about 14 billion yuan to win the 17.5% equity transferred in the mixed reform of Greenland.
It is worth noting that after the completion of this share transfer, Greenland is still expected to have no controlling shareholders and actual controllers, but the control structure may change greatly.
Since its establishment, Greenland Holdings has carried out many institutional reforms: from 1992 to 1997, it operated in accordance with market-oriented rules under the purely state-owned system; From 1997 to 2013, it established and continuously improved the shareholding system of state-owned holding and employee shareholding; From 2013 to 2015, strategic investors were introduced to form a mixed ownership system of cross-shareholding and mutual integration of state-owned and non-public capital; Since 2015, it has been listed as a public company.
Greenland's current mixed reform plan is similar to that of Gree. In December 2019, Zhuhai Mingjun, led by Gaobao Capital, took over 15% of Gree Electric Appliances (000651.SZ) with 41.662 billion yuan, and Gree Group retired as a minority shareholder. After completing the mixed reform, Gree Electric Appliances implemented modern enterprise management methods such as executive incentive plan and no real controller structure.
Shanghai Real Estate and Shanghai Chengtou are state-owned enterprise groups wholly owned by Shanghai State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission. Zhang Yuliang, chairman and president of Greenland Holdings, said that Greenland's move is an important measure for Shanghai to promote the comprehensive reform of state-owned enterprises and accelerate the reform of state-owned enterprises in the new stage in accordance with the requirements of the CPC Central Committee, which fully demonstrates the new reform idea of adapting to local conditions and tailoring clothes. By introducing new excellent strategic shareholders to listed companies, enterprises are supported to further improve the degree of marketization, enhance the freedom of operation and management, and accelerate the full release of reform vitality.

It is understood that in September last year, Lanxi City and Shanghai Railway International Tourism (Group) Co., Ltd. signed a strategic cooperation agreement on the project of "Traveling Lanxi by High-speed Railway," planning to run 12 high-speed railway tourism trains from Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Shanghai and Anhui to Lanxi within one year.

White House advisers "bite back" states to return to work too early-Chinanews.com
White House advisers "bite back" states to return to work too early
On July 23, local time, the number of confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia in the United States exceeded 4 million, accounting for 30% of the global cases.
Over the past few months, US President Trump has repeatedly asked all states across the country to return to work and school. It was not until recently that he changed his attitude and took the initiative to wear masks in public. His advisers even "bite back" and said that some state governments returned to work too early.
On the 22nd, White House presidential adviser Kellyanne Conway said at a press conference that some state governments did not comply with the standards for returning to work and restarted places such as bars too early.
Conway also mentioned that the previous statement that the president has "absolute power" to decide the resumption of work in each state is a false rumor.
"The president is a federalist. He believes that each state has autonomy."
She defended Trump.
However, the "rumor" in Conway's mouth was personally spoken by Trump at the White House epidemic briefing on April 13.
This self-slapping operation was ridiculed by netizens as "rewriting history."
Kelly Ann Conway wants to rewrite history. She's a liar.
Trump called Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer a dictator because she followed medical guidelines and insisted on stopping work.
Trump wants to push for a return to work so he can hold a rally.
This is not the first time Kelly Ann Conway has caused controversy.
On April 15, Conway blurted out in an interview with Fox News: "This is COVID-19, not COVID-1, friends!"
She seems to understand "19" as a version number, which was ridiculed by netizens: read the newspaper without common sense!
Is it reasonable for a 3-year-old child to sue the school after being compensated for being smashed in the playground of the university?
2020-07-26 05: 01: 11 Source: Legal Daily Author: Wang Sishuo Editor: Wang Sishuo
The playground was smashed, and the child was compensated before suing the school
- our correspondent Zhao Yifan
Three-year-old Xiaowen was playing in the playground of a university when he was accidentally hit in the head by Chen Mou of the softball team while pitching.
After Chen made compensation, Xiaowen's father, Mr. Wen, as Xiaowen's legal representative, sued the school to the court, demanding an apology from the school where the playground occurred, and paying a total of 20,000 yuan for medical expenses and mental damage.
Recently, after hearing the case, the Haidian District People's Court of Beijing held that the school had set up a protective net on the playground at the time of the incident, which had fulfilled its appropriate security obligations, and Chen had made compensation, so the judgment rejected the plaintiff's claim.
Mr. Wen claimed that during the summer vacation of 2019, he took Xiaowen to play on the school playground while the softball team was training on the playground.
In order to avoid the risks, Xiaowen, Mr. Wen and many other children and parents moved in the safe area designated by the softball team.
But then Chen Mou, a softball team member, got rid of the ball while pitching, causing the softball to fly over the protective net to the above-mentioned safe area and hit Xiaowen in the back of the head.
Mr. Wen immediately took Xiaowen to the hospital for treatment and was diagnosed with head trauma.
Mr. Wen believes that the facilities of the school stadium do not meet the relevant safety regulations and do not effectively manage the team and related facilities.
The school's fault led to the above-mentioned events, which caused Xiaowen to suffer great physical and mental pain, and also brought great pain to his family, for which the school should bear legal responsibility.
In response, the school argued that the school had set up a protective net on the playground, posted management regulations and training notices, told that entering the playground must keep a safe distance from the training ground and reminded people to pay attention to their own safety. The plaintiff could not prove that the school "failed to fulfill its security obligations," so he did not agree to compensation.
After hearing the case, the court held that the site of the incident was open to the public free of charge by the university involved in the case. Although the school has a security obligation for the management of the playground, this security obligation only needs to meet the general duty of care.
At the time of the incident, the school set up a protective net in the playground, which has fulfilled its appropriate security obligations, and Chen Mou also compensated Xiaowen for medical expenses, transportation expenses and other losses of more than 2,000 yuan according to the compensation agreement reached before. Both parties agreed to settle the dispute at one time.
Afterwards, Xiaowen's parents once again claimed compensation from the school, which was unfounded in law. The court ruled that all the plaintiff's claims were rejected.
After the verdict was pronounced, neither party appealed, and the verdict has now entered into force.
According to Article 37 of China's Tort Liability Law, schools, as managers of public places, have the obligation of security; In the case that the third party's behavior causes damage to others, the third party shall bear tort liability, while the public place manager who fails to fulfill the obligation of security shall bear corresponding supplementary liability.
The judge said that as the manager of a public place, he is most likely to understand the actual situation of the whole place and foresee the possible dangers and damage, so he is most likely to take necessary measures to prevent the occurrence of losses or reduce the degree of damage, and the cost of avoiding and reducing damage is the lowest, so the law stipulates that he shall bear the corresponding guarantee obligations for engaging in social activities.
In this case, for unspecified people entering the playground open to the public free of charge, the school's security obligation should be compatible with its social activities. Specifically, it should mainly take basic security measures and have the obligation to inform hidden dangers.
In judicial practice, it is not appropriate to impose excessive security obligations on managers of public places.
If the school has set up a protective net and fulfilled its obligation to inform, it can be concluded that the school is not at fault and should not bear legal responsibility.
In addition, for third-party infringement, even if the managers of schools and other public places fail to fulfill their security obligations, their liability is also a supplement to damages. According to the newly promulgated Civil Code, managers can also recover compensation from the third party after assuming supplementary liability.
Therefore, in such accidents, the victims should not expand the scope of claims after they have received compensation from the direct infringer.
Under the normalization of epidemic prevention and control, people's enthusiasm for sports and fitness is high.
With the gradual liberalization of inter-provincial tourism business, the tourism market is about to usher in a recovery.
Fujian Province resumed inter-provincial tourism business from July 21. In the first weekend after opening up, Xiamen, as a popular tourist destination, ushered in a peak passenger flow.
As a popular tourist destination city, many tourists arrive in Xiamen on weekends.
Xiamen Railway Station is expected to send 3.7 million passengers during the summer vacation, while the airport passenger flow is mainly students, tourists and visiting relatives.
The tourism market is gradually picking up. In July, Xiamen Airport operated 440 flights a day, and domestic flights have recovered to 80% of the pre-epidemic level.
Airlines have encrypted the air express lines from Xiamen to Shanghai, Beijing, Kunming, Xi'an and other major cities to seize the recovered tourism market.
At present, many travel agencies in Xiamen have successively launched a number of summer domestic inter-provincial tour products, and the team itinerary is mainly outdoor scenic spots.
In view of the summer passenger transport peak at railway stations and airports, relevant units have sent more manpower to guide people in areas where people are easy to gather, such as check-in counters and security check channels. Fujian has also optimized and upgraded the "Bamin Health Code," realizing the sharing and mutual recognition of health data with 31 provinces, and promoting the orderly recovery of the tourism market.
Can Andy Lau and Liu Qingyun "dismantle" a new spark-Xinhuanet
"Bomb Disposal Expert 2" recently announced that it will be released on December 24, becoming the first film to be scheduled for the New Year.
The second part is still directed by Qiu Litao, supervised and starring Andy Lau, and unfolds with a brand-new story.
It is reported that the addition of the "nuclear bomb" element in the second part has also made the challenges faced by bomb disposal experts more difficult. Several glimpses in the preview have already made people's hearts hang on the line. The mushroom cloud of the big explosion and the airport engulfed by fire are quite shocking.
Three years ago, "Bomb Disposal Expert," produced by the original team, won the May 1st box office championship of that year, and won seven nominations at the Hong Kong Film Awards. Qiu Litao × Andy Lau also became the gold medal partner in the eyes of the audience.
This time, "bomb disposal expert 2" also makes people look forward to whether this pair of ace combination can spark new sparks.
"Bomb disposal expert 2" tells a brand-new story: former bomb disposal expert Pan Chengfeng (Andy Lau) fainted at the scene of the explosion and was listed as a suspect by the police.
In order to find the truth, he had to ask his good friend Dong Zhuowen (Liu Qingyun), who is also a bomb disposal expert, for help.
Pang Ling (Ni Ni), a female inspector eager to solve the case and Pan Chengfeng's ex-girlfriend, was also involved.
He is still a bomb disposal expert, but he can feel the complexity of Andy Lau's new role from the preview of the file: he broke a leg, put on a prosthetic limb, and was chased by Liu Qingyun, who is also a bomb disposal expert, while being directed by his ex-girlfriend Ni Ni.
What is the relationship between the three people, what did Andy Lau do in the Fragrant Island Hotel, what kind of cases he was involved in, and what twists and turns he experienced in his career as a bomb disposal expert? All kinds of mysteries make people curious.
It is understood that the highlight of the film is the field shooting of Hong Kong's world landmark buildings, coupled with the top special effects production team, which brings shocking and realistic visual impact.

Chongqing, July 26 (Reporter Liu Xian) Chongqing Development and Reform Commission announced on the 26th that the city has so far returned 4,404 fishermen, accounting for 42.54% of all fishermen involved.
Li Daiguo, 53, said in an interview with Chinanews.com that his grandparents were fishing in Longxi River. Since he was 11 years old, he has been fishing with his father, rocking a boat, walking along Longxi River, going up to Liangping, Chongqing, and going down to longevity. Every time he leaves home, it is ten and a half months, and he depends on fishing to support his family.
However, since 1997, with the gradual influx of rural population into the town, there are more and more residents in Gaoanchang town, resulting in more and more serious environmental pollution.
Paper mills, chemical plants and farms have been built along the Longxi River, which also pollutes the river.
By 2007 and 2008, Longxi River had become a stinking ditch.
"The scales of the fish caught are all black, and the inside is also black after being cut open."
Li Daiguo said that fishing is becoming more and more difficult after the river is polluted.
The local government began to make great efforts to control the pollution of Longxi River, including cleaning and drifting, patrolling the river, management and protection of aquatic resources, etc.
Li Daiguo also retired from fishermen and became a member of the river patrol team to manage and protect aquatic resources.
From January 1, 2020, Chongqing Aquatic Biological Reserve and related waters in the main urban area have implemented a comprehensive ban on fishing.
According to the data of Chongqing Development and Reform Commission, so far, Chongqing has withdrawn 3,403 fishing vessels and signed 4,643 fishing vessels, accounting for 63.3% and 86.3% of the total three-year tasks respectively.
4404 fishermen have been retired, accounting for 42.54% of all fishermen involved.
Of the 4,404 people who have retired, 4,267 have achieved employment, accounting for 96.89% of the fishermen who have retired.
Old-age insurance covers 2,691 people, accounting for 61.10% of the retired fishermen.
In the next step, Chongqing will carry out various special rectification actions in depth, accelerate the clean-up and rectification of shoreline utilization projects in the main stream of the Yangtze River, complete a new round of census of sewage outlets entering the Yangtze River and carry out corresponding rectification actions, basically complete the "three phosphorus" (referring to phosphate ore, phosphorus chemical industry and phosphogypsum reservoir) rectification task, small hydropower clean-up and rectification work, promote the special action of afforestation and greening on both sides of the Yangtze River, strengthen the construction of green mines, consolidate the special rectification achievements of illegal docks and illegal sand mining in the main stream of the Yangtze River, and further promote the ban on fishing and returning to the Yangtze River Basin.
Israel strengthens repeated prevention and control of the epidemic

Israel strengthens repeated prevention and control of the epidemic
At the beginning of the new crown pneumonia outbreak, Israel's prevention and control measures have achieved remarkable results.
However, with the gradual lifting of the ban on prevention and control measures, the number of confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia in Israel has increased significantly recently, and the Israeli government has repeatedly taken emergency measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic.
On February 28, the first case of new crown pneumonia was confirmed in Israel, so it quickly took measures to close all entry and exit ports, suspend non-essential industries, change schools to online teaching, restrict public transportation and non-essential social activities, block cities with serious epidemics, and jointly maintain prevention and control measures.
This series of measures quickly achieved positive results. By mid-May, the number of new confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Israel in a single day had dropped to single digits.
With the epidemic under control, Israel's prevention and control measures have been fully unsealed. Since June, the number of new confirmed cases of novel coronavirus pneumonia has gradually rebounded.
Especially after entering July, the spread of the epidemic has been accelerating.
In recent days, there have been more than 1,500 new cases in Israel every day for eight days, and as of July 25, there were 916 new cases on that day.
As of July 25, Israel had 59,745 confirmed cases and 448 deaths.
In the face of the rapid rebound of the epidemic, the Israeli government has repeatedly taken emergency measures to strengthen the prevention and control of the epidemic.
On July 6, after the number of confirmed cases exceeded 30,000, the Israeli government closed gyms, swimming pools, bars, nightclubs and other public entertainment places, and introduced a policy of restricting public transport, stipulating that the maximum number of passengers per bus should not exceed 20.
On the 17th, the Israeli government announced a series of new restrictive measures, including the implementation of "city closure" on weekends, stipulating that "city closure" should be implemented from 17: 00 every Friday to 5: 00 every Sunday.
During this period, people can go out, but shops, shopping centers, barber shops, beauty salons, libraries, zoos, museums, exhibition halls, swimming pools and tourist attractions will be closed, while basic service places such as supermarkets and pharmacies will remain open.
At the same time, on all dates and time periods, gatherings of more than 10 people are prohibited, gyms, studios and other places will be closed, restaurants and cafes are prohibited from eating in restaurants, and only take-out services are allowed.
At the same time, the Israeli people did not pay enough attention to the seriousness of the epidemic and failed to form a joint force with the government in fighting the epidemic.
After repeated outbreaks in Israel, many people took to the streets to protest and march because the government's prevention and control measures affected their own economic interests.
On July 11, tens of thousands of people held a demonstration in Tel Aviv, arguing that the anti-epidemic policy affected the economy.
On the evening of the 21st, thousands of protesters gathered in front of Prime Minister Netanyahu's residence in Jerusalem to protest against Prime Minister Netanyahu's promulgation of prevention and control measures such as banning restaurants and cafes without giving corresponding compensation.
In addition, many people do not abide by the regulations of wearing masks and keeping a safe social distance of two meters during outdoor activities. In order to avoid being fined by the police for not wearing masks, many people only wear masks on their chins or wrists.
During the recurrence of the epidemic, the school was the hardest hit area for the spread of the new crown virus. According to a reporter's recent visit to the kindergarten, it was found that the teachers and students of the kindergarten did not wear masks as required by the government, nor did they keep a safe social distance of two meters from each other, laying hidden dangers for a large number of teachers and students to be infected with the virus.
Professor Elie Waxman, a member of the expert advisory panel of the National Security Council of Israel to combat the epidemic, believes that Israel is moving towards a "dangerous situation," pointing out that the epidemic prevention and control measures currently taken by Israel are not enough, and all leisure and recreational places and summer schools should be closed to control the further spread of the epidemic.
Waxman said that Israel lacks an overall plan to fight the epidemic, and the parliament and government departments should abandon their respective interests as soon as possible, reach an agreement on fighting the epidemic, and formulate clear steps including relevant restrictive measures in different departments.
Tel Aviv, July 25, by our reporter in Tel Aviv, Wang Jiong
Wu Fengfang, a farmer in Guyuan, Ningxia, couldn't beat his wife Dai Tianfu. They drove from their home 20 miles away to Liangyun Cultural Compound.
Despite the inconvenience of legs and feet in the past two years, Dai Tianfu, 77, is still counting on "coming here every now and then to have a trick addiction."
This is a humble courtyard in Yuanzhou District of Guyuan City. Unlike ordinary farmhouses, melodious Qin opera is often heard in the courtyard, as well as wonderful shadow plays, embroidery works, traditional Qin opera, eyebrow Hu opera and so on.
The owner of the compound is Liang Yun, who used to be a carpenter.
More than 10 years ago, he began to plan the construction of a cultural compound.
With the Liangyun Cultural Compound, the cultural life of the villagers has become rich and colorful.
Before the reporter entered the Liangyun cultural compound, the tune of Qin Opera had already spread.
Bai Lixiang, a villager from a neighboring village, is singing excerpts from Qin Opera for the villagers.
She has loved Qin opera since she was a child, and now she is well known in the local area. As long as she has free time, she will come to the cultural compound to perform for the villagers.
Recently, Bai Lixiang also played a live webcast.
Bai Lixiang said: "It is a very happy thing to have a stage for more people to see their performances."
On the stage, the singers looked at each other and the players played one tune at a time. Although they were amateurs, their enthusiasm did not diminish at all.
Just like the rustic style of the farmyard, outside the Qin Opera, the "grassroots" art and intangible cultural heritage in the Liangyun Cultural Courtyard come to us.
The compound also has a collection of more than 300 agricultural utensils of different ages, traditional and hand-made tiles, paper cuts, embroidery, shadow puppets and other objects.
Liang Yun led the reporter into the exhibition hall in the courtyard, which showed his collection of old objects, such as old wine pots, three strings, spinning wheels, etc.
Why does an ordinary farmer build a cultural compound?
"Shadow play is my family craft. I have been learning this craft since I was 15 years old."
Established in 2012, Liangyun Cultural Courtyard has become the first rural "intangible cultural heritage exhibition hall" in Ningxia. It is also a demonstration compound for the protection of intangible cultural heritage in Guyuan City.
In addition to Liangyun Cultural Compound, more than 120 cultural compounds and 79 folk performance groups have emerged in Yuanzhou District of Guyuan City. Among them, there are more than 50 cultural compounds of a certain scale, such as Shenjiahe Cultural Compound, Wang Yonghong Cultural Compound and Yanglang Cultural Compound, covering all towns and streets in Yuanzhou District, with more than 5,000 participants.
These grassroots artists are active in the fields, enriching the cultural life of the masses and meeting their spiritual needs.
"As life gets better and better, traditional culture can't just be left behind."
"Liu's spy war drama" returns again "odds" to see Liu Yunlong Li Liqun's opponent "racing drama" -Xinhuanet
The 40-episode spy war drama "odds" will land on Beijing Satellite TV from July 16.
"Winning" is based on real historical facts and is based on the Soviet military archives that have been sealed for many years and first published.
Actor Liu Yunlong, who is well known to the audience for his "spy drama," broke through his image in the play and challenged a "stuttering agent" who is quite happy.
In recent years, the popularity of dramas such as "Pretender," "Mask" and "Kite" has proved that spy war dramas have exuberant vitality.
Different from previous spy war works, "Winning" looks at the world and extends the background of the story to the Far East battlefield of the Soviet Union.
Taking the final stage of the Anti-Japanese War in 1944 as the background, it tells the story of Tang Fei (Liu Yunlong), a secret intelligence worker of the Communist Party of China, who, under the leadership of the secretary of the Linhe Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese underground party and the director of the Far East Intelligence Agency of the Soviet Union, carried out the "Mudanula" strategic action of the Far East Intelligence Agency of the Soviet Union.
In many spy dramas, the hero, as a senior spy, is a perfect image of handsome, high IQ and maturity.
However, in Liu Yunlong's view, such people are not suitable to be spies. "Spies should be the kind of people who can't be found in the pile of people. If they appear on the stage, they are the kind of handsome image. I wish everyone would pay attention to you. Can they still lurk? There is a line in" Kite, "'If you don't come to catch me, I forget that I am a Kuomintang', and spies are going to be elitist."
So in "odds," Liu Yunlong ingeniously designed his hero Tang Fei as a "stuttering agent" with a sense of joy.
The other camp in "odds" is supported by Japanese Fukuhara, played by Liang Guanhua, and Fang Shibao, director of the police department, played by Li Liqun.
The two powerful actors, one south and one north, have added many highlights to the whole play.
Director Yin Fei used the word "drama" to describe the opposite play between Li Liqun and Liu Yunlong in the play. "It is definitely drama. The two of them have a special tacit understanding. The tacit understanding between them has a great impact on me. Many times their plays are 'hanging now'. For example, we only wrote half a page long. I don't stop when shooting, so they can continue to play."
The masters do not rob each other of the play, and the director does not stir up the play. When the actors are in the role and ensure their character status, they can not only shape the role from the perspective of the characters, but also bring more viewing possibilities to the audience. Yin Fei said that such a play is brilliant enough.
In the play, you can also see many familiar faces in "Liu's spy drama." The famous and majestic "Mountain City F4" in "Kite" also gathered three people in "Winning."
Hou Yu and Liu Mingyang, who played Song Xiaoan and Zhao Jianzhi, once again played Tang Fei's right-hand man.
Director Yin Fei said, "There is no inferiority in these two people. They just drifted with the tide in that era and environment."
Liu Yunlong also offered, "We should have a human touch. This human touch means that there must be good and bad people around me. Bad people are enemies, but we should also develop them and our team should also grow."
The ending of the two people in the play was also carefully designed by Liu Yunlong, who believed that he would give the audience a satisfactory answer.

At 15: 50 on July 24, Arong Banner Public Security Bureau 110 received a report that six junior high school students were drowning.
After receiving the police, the local police rushed to the scene and rescued two students on the spot. Then the local emergency bureau, water conservancy bureau and other units rushed to the scene one after another to participate in the rescue.

Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, July 25. Xu Zhengyu, Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, said that Hong Kong's financial market remained active and operated in an orderly manner.
He expressed optimism about Hong Kong's financial stability and economy.
Xu Zhengyu said at an online seminar jointly organized by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Toronto and the Hong Kong-Canada Chamber of Commerce (Canadian Federation) on the 24th (Toronto time) that Hong Kong is experiencing a difficult situation due to the "storm of legislative amendments" and the new crown pneumonia epidemic.
The exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar is stable and biased towards the strong exchange guarantee level.
There is no obvious sign of capital outflow from the banking system. On the contrary, more than $11 billion has flowed in since June.
The total amount of bank deposits has also continued to increase in the past few months. There has been a series of public offering fund-raising activities in the stock market, and market transactions have repeatedly increased.
Xu Zhengyu said that the new crown pneumonia epidemic has brought pressure to the global economy and financial markets, but Hong Kong's basic advantages remain unchanged.
Hong Kong's many advantages, including geography, rule of law, high-speed communication, free flow of information and capital, and simple and low tax system, have made Hong Kong a leading international financial center.
Xu Zhengyu pointed out that the SAR Government has set aside HK $6 billion in the "Epidemic Prevention and Anti-epidemic Fund" to create about 30,000 time-limited jobs in the public and private sectors in the next two years, covering people with different skills and academic qualifications.
To support the development of financial technology, the SAR Government has also launched the "Thousand Talents Plan" to subsidize local financial technology companies, start-ups and other enterprises with financial technology-related businesses, so as to create 1,000 new jobs, employ local talents and enrich Hong Kong's financial technology talent pool.
Looking ahead, Xu Zhengyu expressed optimism about Hong Kong's financial stability and economy.
He encouraged Canadian companies to make good use of Hong Kong's advantages and its position as an international financial center, an international asset and wealth management center and a global offshore RMB business hub to develop and invest in Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and nearby areas.
The Lancet published an article praising China's anti-epidemic efforts and encouraging countries to learn from their experiences-Chinanews.com
The Lancet magazine published an article on the 25th, saying that China, as a country with a population of 1.4 billion and a scale similar to that of Europe or the United States, has effectively controlled the new crown epidemic at this stage, and there has been no large-scale spread, which has largely controlled the domestic epidemic.
The article said that in the past ten years, China has invested a lot in domestic research and public health construction, which makes China's preparation for the new crown much better than that for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).
The author said that when SARS broke out in 2002, China was not prepared enough at first, especially the pathogen could not be identified.
When Covid-19 was discovered in December 2019, Chinese scientists were soon able to identify the type of virus and shared genome sequencing data with the international community on January 11, 2020.
By the end of January, doctors from mainland China and Hong Kong had clarified the clinical characteristics of the virus and warned the world of the threat of Covid-19 through research papers published in The Lancet.
China has also been at the forefront of vaccine research. Under the state of emergency declared by the state, such research has been carried out very quickly and strictly through close domestic cooperation. In May and July, the results of the progress made in the early trials of the new crown vaccine developed by China were published in The Lancet respectively.
China's experience shows that it is very important to invest in the national health and research system and effectively improve laboratory capacity.
This is the basis for the country to respond quickly and effectively to health emergencies and global health security.
Other countries, especially low-income and middle-income countries, are worth learning from.
In addition, China's experience has proved that on the basis of strong research, there must be a strong high-level decisive reliance on scientific basis to make correct decisions, so that the new crown epidemic can be effectively controlled.
The article emphasizes that the government and its leaders must respect science, understand the value of science, and act on it in the most beneficial way to society.
At the beginning of the outbreak, China's National Health and Construction Commission sent three groups of infectious disease experts to Wuhan to investigate the risk and spread of Covid-19. Their suggestions provided the basis for Wuhan's decision to "close the city" on January 23; When experts put forward the necessity and urgency of building a square cabin hospital, the government quickly made a decision and implemented it quickly; At the same time, the extensive participation of the community and the masses also made the epidemic quickly and effectively controlled.
Finally, the article emphasizes that in response to global health emergencies, countries need to strengthen global cooperation and joint response.

Dapeng director "Good Luck" shortlisted for Golden Goblet Award-Xinhuanet
On July 18, the 23rd Shanghai International Film Festival announced the official list of films selected for the Golden Goblet Award.
Dapeng director's first realistic film "good luck" was successfully shortlisted for the Golden Goblet Award of this film festival, and the film officially released its first poster.
Poster side for photos
The film "Good Luck" is the first realistic work directed by Dapeng, and it is also his second bond with the Golden Goblet Award.
The film tells the story of a comedy director who returned to his hometown in the northeast countryside on a whim, hoping to make a literary film for his family during the New Year, but encountered a series of accidents.
The family members gathered for filming finished the final party.
In the movie poster released today, Wang Jixiang, a member of this family, sits in the middle of the picture smoking a cigarette. The background is the black land in northeast China dressed in silver, and the foreground is the red lantern that Chinese people must hang on holidays.
The red lantern, which symbolizes happiness and reunion, forms a huge contrast with the lonely Wang Jixiang, which seems to reveal the complexity and entanglement in the relationship of this big family.
It is reported that in the film, except for the daughter of "third uncle" Wang Jixiang, who is played by actor Liu Lu, the rest of the scenes are completed by the real director's family. The experimental audio-visual style of the film breaks the boundary between drama and reality and brings the audience a brand-new immersive viewing experience.
According to director Dapeng, the creation of "good luck" originated from "an act of God." A series of sudden changes in the family during the shooting forced the original shooting plan to change accordingly. Life without script was finally recorded as a movie, but it released the tension beyond design.
How does director Dapeng face this "providence" and how can he continue to meet the changes brought about by this providence?
There is no doubt that "good luck" is full of experiments. The lineup of almost all people and innovative audio-visual style turn the life in front of the camera into a movie. Under the package of real images, the audience will also find the shadow of themselves and their families from the family presented in the film. With the end of the family gathering in the film, a series of thoughts will be aroused.
NEWS.GOV.MO: Novel Coronavirus Infection Response Coordination Center Enquiry Hotline Statistics (July 25 08H00-July 26 08H00)
From 08H00 on July 25, 2020 to 08H00 on July 26, 2020, the enquiry hotline of the Novel Coronavirus Infection Response Coordination Center received 292 telephone enquiries.
291 enquiries about the epidemic situation have been immediately transferred to representatives of relevant departments for follow-up. The situation is as follows:
271 cases from the Health Bureau (involving: inquiries about isolation; inquiries about nucleic acid testing; inquiries about two places; health codes; others.)
17 cases from the Public Security Police Department (involving: inquiring about immigration measures; inquiring about the entry and exit measures of vehicles with license plates in Guangdong and Macao; inquiring about Zhuhai government affairs hotline; inquiring about the stay of documents.)
Tourism Bureau 1 case (involving: inquiring about isolated hotels.)
One case from the Education and Youth Bureau (involving: inquiring about the methods of Macao students returning to study in the UK.)
Maritime and Water Affairs Bureau 1 case (involving: asking whether Hong Kong fishing vessels need to declare to the Maritime and Water Affairs Bureau and nucleic acid testing related matters when entering Hong Kong.)
At the Banong Zhuokang sentry post, platoon leader Yu Wang and a soldier stood guard on duty.
In this place where the annual average temperature is more than ten degrees below zero, a row of simple barracks stands at the mountain pass. A national flag flutters in the wind not far from the barracks. The soldiers stand guard in the wind every day and need to patrol at higher altitudes regularly.
The soldiers need to use both hands and feet to climb the steep slope of the rubble.
It was late July, when flowers and plants flourished in low-altitude areas, while in Banong Zhuokang, only the gully behind the barracks had relatively dense green.
Gao Peng, a soldier who has been stationed at the outpost for six years, pointed to the ravine and said that this is their back garden. Only in July and August every year can the grass grow slowly. Soon after, it all turns yellow and is covered with snow.
Patrol on foot may take about 9 hours.
Under the harsh plateau environment, the soldiers stationed here are accompanied by snowy mountains and glaciers all the year round, and they also regularly patrol the mountain passes at higher altitudes.
A few days ago, a patrol composed of eight soldiers, led by instructor Liang Yixin, once again embarked on the patrol road.
Each soldier carried a weight of about 30 jin and headed for the target point early in the morning.
On the way, a soldier fought against Gao, and his comrades gave emergency rescue.
In addition to patrol tasks, the soldiers at the Banong Zhuokang sentry post have to carry out tactical and physical training every day.
As time goes by, the altitude is rising, the oxygen content is getting lower and lower, and the physical strength is constantly overdrawn. These factors test the will of the patrol members.
They gritted their teeth and persisted, crossing several landslides and dangerous beaches one after another.
At about 16 o'clock, it was lunch time for the patrol members. They took out their own dry food and sat on the spot at an altitude of more than 5,700 meters, accompanied by sleet, to supplement their physical strength with food.
The soldiers at the Banong Zhuokang sentry post carried out tactical and physical training.
During the break, they will play cards together, and the loser will do push-ups, which can not only entertain but also exercise physical fitness.
After a short rest in the cold wind, they climbed to the target point of the patrol, took out the national flag on the mountain pass and solemnly swore.
Behind them are snow-capped mountains, and in front of them are dozens of kilometers of no man's land. They are the safest guardians of the country.
Beijing consumption season restarts-Xinhuanet
Beijing restarted the activities of the Beijing consumption season in accordance with the principle of "comprehensive restart, key planning, orderly promotion and strict organization."
On July 26, 1.5 million government and enterprise consumption coupons were issued, including 1 million offline catering and shopping coupons and 500,000 smart product coupons, which can be collected by consumers in JD.com APP.
Liu Meiying, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Commerce, said at a media briefing held on the 25th that the restarted consumption season will further reduce the allocation of capital by enterprises on the basis of maintaining the existing preferential subsidies for coupons, cards and packages.
Since the beginning of August, the current 1: 1 allocation of government and enterprise contributions has been adjusted to 2: 1. For example, if consumers receive a card package for consumption in the store, they can enjoy a discount of 120 yuan, of which the government subsidizes 60 yuan and the enterprise gives 60 yuan; after the adjustment, the government subsidizes 80 yuan and the enterprise gives 40 yuan.
During the consumption season, the three major operators will subsidize traffic and terminals around 5G consumption, further promoting Beijing's new 5G infrastructure and new 5G consumption.
Chen Maobo pointed out that Hong Kong's economy has been hit by another outbreak of the epidemic, calling on all sectors to share the difficulties
China News Service, Hong Kong, July 26-Chen Maobo, Financial Secretary of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, said on the 26th that Hong Kong is facing a new wave of new crown pneumonia epidemic, and business contacts and economic activities that had shown signs of recovery have also been hit.
The SAR Government once again calls on all small landlords to reduce rent and tide over the difficulties with retailers, restaurants and small and medium-sized enterprises.
Chen Maobo published an article entitled "The Rugged Road to Recovery" on the Internet on the same day.
He said that the recent high number of confirmed cases of new crown pneumonia in Hong Kong and the grim situation have affected the people's livelihood and troubled the economy.
When the epidemic is repeated, the first thing is to strictly prevent imported cases, and deal with and interrupt the virus transmission chain as quickly as possible; When the epidemic is under control, economic activities should be resumed in a timely manner.
He pointed out that in the face of the impact of the new wave of epidemic, business contacts and economic activities that had shown signs of recovery had also been hit.
For the business sector, in addition to the spirit of contract, social responsibility is equally important, especially those groups that have received large government subsidies under the Employment Protection Scheme.
He mentioned that Hong Kong's economic situation in the second quarter of this year was still very grim, but the contraction seemed to slow down slightly.
In terms of exports, he believes that the external situation of Hong Kong is still grim.
Chen Maobo said that Hong Kong's development in the past few decades shows that every crisis hides new opportunities and every difficulty hides the key to future development.

Taiwan's meteorological department pointed out that the earthquake is the largest in Taiwan this year and belongs to the subduction zone type earthquake at the junction of plates. Its epicenter has often occurred in the past and has been relatively active since this year.
In the next week, it is still not ruled out that there will be aftershocks of magnitude 4 or above.
Marinichev said that the change in value is affected by the devaluation of the ruble and the epidemic.
"The cost of services is increasing," he said.
Because of the epidemic, people began to spend more time on the Internet. "
Marinichev does not rule out that Internet prices will rise seriously this year, and believes that operators can provide customers with higher speed and more services to offset people's dissatisfaction with price increases.
"Chinese Doctor" prepares to pay tribute to anti-epidemic heroes-Xinhuanet
Recently, with the respect of Chinese filmmakers for the heroes fighting the epidemic, Yu Dong, chairman of Bona Film Group, and Liu Weiqiang, director (left), held a discussion and exchange with Academician Zhong Nanshan in Guangzhou on the filming and production of the anti-epidemic film "Chinese Doctor."
Bona Pictures hopes to pay tribute to all medical and epidemic prevention workers fighting in the front line of epidemic prevention and control through Chinese Doctors!
In 2021, the film will be released nationwide as a tribute film to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China.
At present, Bona Film is organizing the original crew of the film "Chinese Captain" to prepare the film "Chinese Doctor" under the arrangement and deployment of the Central Propaganda Department and the National Film Bureau, and with the support of the Guangdong Film Bureau and the Hubei Film Bureau. This is a film that reflects the unity of the people of the whole country to fight the new crown pneumonia epidemic under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee.
The film focuses on the front line of anti-epidemic in Wuhan. It will take Wuhan medical staff and medical teams from various provinces and cities to assist Hubei as the background. From the perspective of human nature, it will use unique narrative and powerful lens language to show the touching story of Chinese medical staff full of dedication and sacrifice on the front line of anti-epidemic.
It is understood that as soon as Wuhan was unsealed, Boehner overcame many difficulties and sent a shooting team to go deep into the front line of the epidemic to exchange understanding and collect information with hundreds of medical workers face to face. At present, it has interviewed white angels at the forefront of the anti-epidemic front, including Academician Zhong Nanshan himself, Guangzhou's first aid to Wuhan, Guangdong's aid to Hubei medical team, as well as Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan Union Hospital, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University and Wuhan Central Hospital. A large number of precious first-hand video materials have been taken.
Academician Zhong Nanshan also raised expectations and hopes for the filming of the film in this symposium: "I am looking forward to it. I hope you will not only visit some experts who have made more public appearances, but also interview more medical staff who are working hard in the front line. They are the majority."
He said that he had seen "Me and My Motherland" and "Chinese Captain" before and thought it was a good way to tell the story of the big pattern from the perspective of ordinary people.
"Now some foreign friends still have some misunderstandings about China."
When talking about the spread of the film, Academician Zhong Nanshan said that at present, some people abroad like to label the virus as politicized. He hopes that the film can impress the audience from the perspective of human nature: "In addition to being shown in China, it is best to show this film abroad. It is necessary to impress the audience with the true humanistic spirit in a way that both domestic and foreign audiences can understand."
Academician Zhong Nanshan also fondly recalled the film "Man to Middle Age" in the 1980s. "After so many years, what impressed me most about the film after the reform and opening up was" Man to Middle Age. "At that time, my foreign doctor friends all cried. If" Chinese Doctor "can play such a role, it would be great."
Academician Zhong Nanshan said that if "Chinese Doctor" can resonate with foreign audiences, it will be very successful.
During the discussion and exchange, Academician Zhong Nanshan also shared his opinions and suggestions on the current international epidemic prevention and control, "I believe that people are always smarter than viruses."
Academician Zhong Nanshan said that although the virus is difficult to predict, since the primitive society, human beings have survived thousands of difficulties and dangers. Nowadays, modern society has developed medical technology and social management measures. In addition, medical staff and even ordinary people all over the world have a basic understanding of scientific response to the new crown pneumonia epidemic. People will no longer be as passive as before. "Next, we should pay attention to two aspects of work, one is to study how the world can strengthen cooperation, and the other is to pay attention to soothing people's hearts."

Culture and Tourism "Red Fruit" Gathers in Shaoshan-Xiangtan First Red Expo-Today's Highlights-Hunan Daily Network-Huasheng Online
Hunan Daily New Hunan Client Reporter Jiang Rui Correspondent Xiao Yan
Jiaxing Red Boat Mould, Shaoshan Mao Zedong Bronze Statue, Yan'an Budui Flower Crafts, Xiangxi Yongshun Bacon... On July 25, 2020 Hunan Red Tourism Culture Festival opened in Shaoshan.
As one of the main activities, the first Xiangtan Red Cultural Industry Expo was held in Shaoshan Global Tourism Consulting and Distribution Center.
The red cultural and creative products in the exhibition area and local products in the old revolutionary base areas are dazzling, attracting tourists from all over the world to buy them.
"This Red Expo is not only a display of the achievements of the national red cultural industry, but also an important platform for exhibitors and enterprises to exchange experiences and explore development paths."
According to the relevant person in charge of the Executive Committee of the first Xiangtan Red Expo, the theme of this Red Expo is "Promoting Red Culture and Boosting Cultural Tourism," with a total exhibition area of nearly 3,000 square meters, with an atmosphere creation area, a scenic area display and exhibition area and an online shopping experience area for red cultural tourism online games.
137 enterprises and units from 8 provinces and cities including Jiaxing, Zhejiang, Zunyi, Guizhou and Yan'an, Shaanxi, as well as Changsha, Zhuzhou, Yueyang and Chenzhou in our province, were invited to participate in the exhibition, with 768 kinds of exhibits on display, including red cultural relics, handicrafts, food specialties, tourism routes, red training courses, red cultural and creative products, etc.
The exhibition area will be open until July 29.
As the host of the Red Expo, Xiangtan exhibition area has many bright spots.
According to the person in charge of the exhibition area, Xiangtan exhibition area is divided into two parts: red industry and red cultural industry development.
The red industrial exhibition area displays 31 exhibits from 6 enterprises, including Valin Xianggang, Valin Cable and Xiangdian Power, and the red cultural industry development exhibition area displays nearly 200 products from 27 units, including red series books, red series foods and red series cultural and creative products.

More than 30,000 confirmed cases in COVID-19 in Japan-Xinhuanet
According to statistics, there were 239 new confirmed cases in Tokyo on the 26th, and more than 200 new cases were added in a single day for 6 consecutive days, with a total of 11,214 cases.
In addition, there were 141 new confirmed cases in Osaka Prefecture, 90 new cases in Fukuoka Prefecture and 80 new cases in Aichi Prefecture.
Telecom network fraud crimes rose by 70% in the first half of the year
BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) According to the website of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, in the first half of this year, procuratorial organs across the country prosecuted 58,101 people for fraud, up 35% year on year.
In particular, among the crimes impeding epidemic prevention and control, fraud crimes occur frequently, and the number of fraud crimes prosecuted by procuratorial organs accounts for 43.4% of the total number of crimes impeding epidemic prevention and control.
The Supreme People's Procuratorate has carried out targeted guidance. Among the ten batches of typical cases involving epidemic prevention and control that have been released so far, there are 9 cases involving fraud.
Judging from the handling of cases by procuratorial organs in the first half of the year, there are many names involved in fraud crimes, ranging from national macro policies to people's food, clothing, housing and transportation, including epidemic fraud, "medical care" fraud, "health care products" fraud, "enrollment agency" fraud, "routine loan" fraud, fraud of obtaining state subsidies, fraud of unfreezing national assets, etc., constantly "innovating," covering education, medical care, employment, pension, social security, land requisition and demolition, precise poverty alleviation, financial credit and other fields, which not only cause economic losses to the victims, but also seriously affect economic and social development.
In particular, some telecommunication network frauds break through the restrictions of national boundaries, regions and personnel, and have the characteristics of stakeholder, cross-border, remote, electronic payment and so on. There are many unspecified victims and great harm.
For example, some set up special companies, rent high-end office buildings, set up multiple departments or posts, use legal network platforms to publicize and recruit, train and assess recruiters, adopt enterprise operation mode management, and wear "legal cloak," which is more confusing.
It is the unshirkable responsibility of procuratorial organs to punish and prevent crimes according to law and issue early warning to the public and relevant departments in a timely manner.
In judicial cases, procuratorial organs conscientiously perform their duties, not only insisting on maintaining a high-pressure situation against fraud crimes, but also refining various law enforcement measures in a targeted manner, and promoting social governance by issuing procuratorial suggestions.
The procuratorial organs strictly control the facts, evidence, procedure and application of the law in the arrest and prosecution of fraud cases, taking the facts as the basis and the law as the criterion, so as to be impartial.
Especially for the crime of telecommunication network fraud, we should pay attention to the central role of electronic data in fact determination, and strive to build an evidence chain of mutual confirmation between electronic data, verbal evidence and documentary evidence.
For example, in a certain epidemic-related fraud case handled by the Yinzhou District Procuratorate of Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province, the procuratorial organ intervened in advance at the first time, and it took only five days from the occurrence of the case to the completion of the case, which reflects the attitude and determination to handle it quickly and strictly and maintain the stability of the overall social situation.
In the process of examining arrest and prosecution, attention was paid to the prosecution of missing offenders in cases, correcting 733 missing arrests by public security organs and 1113 missing examination and prosecution of accomplices by public security organs.
In the first half of the year, procuratorial organs across the country issued 298 procuratorial suggestions against fraud crimes, promoting joint efforts to prevent fraud crimes and promote in-depth governance.
For example, in view of the loopholes found in the supervision of telecommunications networks by communication enterprises, banks and intermediary organizations, the Guangzhou Procuratorate and Dongguan Procuratorate of Guangdong Province put forward procuratorial suggestions in time, urging relevant units to strengthen supervision, improve mechanisms, and promote the construction of long-term system.
The fourth is to do a good job in recovering stolen goods and losses.
Local procuratorial organs seize important links such as intervening in investigation, guiding evidence collection, examining and prosecuting, urging investigative organs to actively recover stolen money, cooperating with relevant departments to do a good job in recovering stolen goods and losses, and striving to minimize the economic losses caused by fraud crimes to the people.
For example, the Beijing Municipal Procuratorate handled the Lin Moumou routine loan case, which involved 22 properties waiting to be sealed up. Under the circumstances that the property may be disposed of in advance by other cases, it was the first to issue a "letter of suspension of execution" and send it to the relevant court in a timely manner. It is suggested that the previous seizure court suspend the execution of the property involved, and deal with it uniformly after the criminal facts are found out, so as to make the best efforts to recover the property involved and recover the losses of the victims.
The prosecutor reminded everyone to be very vigilant against fraud crimes, not to expect "pie in the sky," not to be credulous because it is cheap, and to keep their "money bag."
Yina Town, Weining County, Guizhou Province: Shorter Apple Trees and Wider Road to Poverty Alleviation-Zhongxin.com
2020-07-26 11: 42: 58 Source: China Economic Net Author: Zhu Yanjing Editor: Zhu Yanjing
In the scorching heat, a reporter from Economic Daily-China Economic Net walked into Zhonghai Village, Yina Town, Weining County, Guizhou Province.
Under the scorching sun, Li Yuanzhong, a villager, was weeding in the base. Although his face was red with the sun, he hummed a few songs from time to time.
Weining County, where Yina Town is located, has a certain popularity in the surrounding areas because of its low latitude, high altitude, sufficient light and large temperature difference between day and night. However, because of its small size and many spots, it has not been able to sell at a good price and form an industrial scale.
Yina Town used to be a poor township that "packed the valley with potato to spend the spring and autumn." Ten years ago, the incidence of local poverty was as high as 25.8%.
In the critical period of getting rid of poverty and entering a decisive battle, it is urgent to change traditional planting habits, adjust industrial structure and increase farmers' income.
After many visits, Chen Chao, secretary of the Party Committee of Yina Town, and a group of people in the town believed that industrial development could no longer follow the old path.
To this end, Yina Town introduced leading enterprises to grow apples in a modern way.
Hou Jianwen, deputy general manager of Weining Chaoyue Agriculture Co., Ltd., came to Yina Town from Shaanxi in 2015 for research. He saw the local planting conditions at a glance and began to plant apple trees locally in 2016.
At first, the village mobilized Li Yuanzhong to transfer the land to plant apple trees. Li Yuanzhong and his wife murmured in their hearts: "After planting apples for so many years, they didn't see anyone in the village who planted apples and made a fortune."
"The apples planted are dwarf apples, which will not make the apple trees grow too tall."
To Li Yuanzhong's surprise, a new method was adopted for apple planting this time. Irrigation pipes were laid under each apple tree, and water and fertilizer were poured into the roots. When the fruit was harvested in autumn, the tractor drove directly into the orchard and could pick the fruit standing up.
At present, the Apple base has gradually entered a high-yield period, and the market is just as Hou Jianwen expected. Apple is not worried about selling and is deeply loved by consumers in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and other cities.
The growing apple industry has brought new changes to Li Yuanzhong's life. Although he is still farming, he has a new source of income.
Li Yuanzhong's family has more than 9 mu of land transferred to the Apple Base. Every year, in addition to the guaranteed land transfer fee, there is a profit dividend after hanging the fruit. The couple usually work in the base. "One person can get 80 yuan a day and have work all the year round."
Li Yuanzhong told reporters that last year's profit dividend was more than 2,800 yuan, plus the land transfer fee and the couple's work income, and the family's income was more than 80,000 yuan. "There is no need to worry about food and clothing, and a well-off life has already passed."
"At present, initial results have been achieved. The annual output value of 1 mu of apples exceeds 15,000 yuan, which is about 10 times that of corn."
Chen Chao told reporters that 20,000 mu of apples have been planted in the whole town of Yina, 6,000 mu in Zhonghai Village alone, covering 4,056 households and 17,200 people, including 656 households and 2,952 poor households with filing cards. The annual salary is more than 6 million yuan, which really realizes that the base is built at home and there is no need to go out to work.
Li Yuanzhong, whose pockets are bulging day by day, also began to realize his "wish."
During the Lunar New Year this year, Li Yuanzhong bought an off-road vehicle and now drives to and from work every day. "There are still more than ten acres of land at home. When the next step is to expand the scale of the Apple base, all of it will be transferred to them, and the income will be even more."

Membrane separation technology helps crack the "greenhouse effect" -Zhongxin.com
Membrane separation technology helps crack the "greenhouse effect"
Schematic diagram of preparation technology of new mixed matrix membrane
Our reporter Shang Rui reported: A few days ago, the atmospheric environment and bioenergy team of Tianjin University made significant progress in "carbon dioxide capture by membrane separation" and successfully developed a new mixed matrix membrane preparation technology to greatly improve the carbon dioxide capture performance of membrane materials.
Relevant results have been published as the cover article of the international journal Greenhouse Gases: Science and Technology.
The "greenhouse effect" is a major environmental problem perplexing human development, and carbon dioxide emission is the culprit of the "greenhouse effect."
How to efficiently capture and utilize carbon dioxide emitted by human beings is the focus of scientists' attention.
"Membrane separation method" is a new carbon dioxide capture technology. It separates carbon dioxide gas with the help of membrane materials and has the characteristics of high efficiency, energy saving and simple operation.
How to make the membrane material "breathe deeply" and improve the efficiency of gas separation is the bottleneck and difficulty of capturing carbon dioxide by membrane separation method.
The scientific research team of Tianjin University innovated ideas and explored the influence of different solvents on membrane gas separation performance through repeated experiments.
The experimental results show that with N-methylpyrrolidone as the preparation solvent, the distribution of carbon nanotubes in the membrane material is more uniform and "more breathable," which effectively improves the gas separation efficiency and rate of the membrane material.
The carbon dioxide separation performance of the mixed matrix membrane prepared by this new technology is close to the theoretical separation upper limit of this kind of membrane material.
"The new technology provides a new idea for capturing carbon dioxide by membrane separation."
Li Run, a member of the atmospheric environment and bioenergy team of Tianjin University, said: "We hope that this technology can provide strong support for future coal-fired power plants and chemical enterprises to deal with flue gas, and play an important role in controlling greenhouse gas emissions and other fields."
Understand what is the professional grade difference before volunteering to fill in the report-Zhongxin.com

Understand what is the professional grade difference before volunteering to fill in the report
Every year, there are students or parents who do not understand the terms involved in the voluntary filling, which affects the voluntary filling.
This year, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing University of Science and Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing Forestry University and Beijing University of Chemical Technology jointly issued the 2020 enrollment policy to cancel the professional grade difference.
What is the meaning of professional grade difference and what is the significance in voluntary filing?
There are three ways of professional allocation rules
Experts remind that before filling in the volunteer form, you must carefully read the "Enrollment Regulations" of your favorite school and understand the admission rules of colleges and universities, including the ratio of file transfer and the rules of professional distribution.
Professional allocation rules refer to three ways of professional admission: professional priority, score priority and professional grade difference after the transfer of colleges and universities.
The specific method used by colleges and universities will be specified in the Admissions Charter.
However, there are also some colleges and universities whose admission principle is to give priority to the total score, and there is no grade difference between majors.
That is to say, candidates within the admission range will be queued up according to the total score. When the score does not reach the first professional voluntary admission score line, it will be seen whether it has reached the second professional voluntary admission score line, and so on until the last professional volunteer is admitted. There is no grade difference between the professional volunteers.
The so-called "professional grade difference" means that when colleges and universities arrange candidates' majors, they determine the admission majors of volunteer candidates of different majors according to one or several score values published in the enrollment regulations. This score value is the "professional grade difference."
That is, the score difference between the first professional volunteer and the non-first professional volunteer in colleges and universities, and the grade difference scores between the professional volunteers, such as 3 points, 2 points, 1 point, etc.
For example.
Suppose student Xiaoming applied for college A and scored 560 points. His professional wishes are: computer, international trade, automation, mechanical engineering, and e-commerce. The professional admission of college A adopts the method of professional grade difference, which is divided into 2 points, 1 point, 1 point, and 0 point.
In the professional allocation, if Xiaoming's first professional volunteer meets the professional admission requirements and the major has a planned balance, then Xiaoming is admitted to the "computer" major; If the computer is not admitted, his score will be subtracted by 2 points, and the score of 558 points will be sorted with the candidates who volunteer to apply for "international trade" in the first major to determine whether they meet the professional admission conditions; If it is still not satisfied, the score will be subtracted by 1 point (that is, 557 points) for the "automatic" admission of the third professional volunteer; If it is still not satisfied, the score will be subtracted by 1 point (that is, 556 points) for admission to the fourth major. If the follow-up major still cannot meet its professional wishes, the score will not be reduced, and so on.
Different universities have different professional grade differences
With the popularization of parallel volunteering, many colleges and universities have cancelled the professional grade difference, but some colleges and universities still retain this method this year. According to the "enrollment regulations" published by various universities, more than 20 universities have set up professional grade difference this year.
For example, Sichuan Agricultural University, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Heilongjiang University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Jiangxi Normal University, Chengdu Medical College, Northeast Electric Power University, Jimei University, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing University of Technology, Ningxia University, Shandong University of Technology, China Civil Aviation Flight College, etc.
In these colleges and universities, each university has different professional grades.
Some colleges and universities have a grade difference in each major, such as Ningxia University. Candidates whose files have been submitted to the university will be admitted according to the order in which candidates fill in their professional volunteers by 1 point in turn.
Some universities have set up different professional grades between different majors.
For example, Jimei University, the total score of professional volunteer difference is 4 points, that is, the difference between the first professional volunteer and other professional volunteers is 3 points, there is no difference between other professional volunteers, which is regarded as parallel volunteer, and the difference between other professional volunteers and transfer professional volunteers is 1 point.
When filling in the volunteer form, candidates and parents must carefully read the admission policy of the reported school to see if there is a professional grade difference and what is the form of the grade difference. While fully considering the score, they should also reasonably analyze the school and major to be selected. If the college clearly adopts the grade difference method for admission in the enrollment charter, candidates should pay attention to the gradient between the majors when choosing a major to improve the admission probability.

Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, July 25-Qiu Tenghua, Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, said on the 25th that all APEC member economies should act in concert to fight the epidemic and promote economic recovery, and should avoid establishing unnecessary trade barriers in accordance with the rights and obligations stipulated by the World Trade Organization.
Qiu Tenghua made the above remarks when participating in the video conference of trade ministers fighting the new crown pneumonia epidemic held by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) on the 25th.
During the meeting, the participating ministers exchanged views on the substantive solutions that APEC can take to deal with the impact of the new crown pneumonia epidemic and promote economic recovery in the region.
Qiu Tenghua said that the public health and economic crisis triggered by the epidemic has had an unprecedented and far-reaching impact on society and economy.
"We are in a double battle. We must overcome the epidemic before we can recover the economy.
We should have a clear goal. The virus is our common enemy. Only through cooperation can we win. Otherwise, we will only fail. "
Qiu Tenghua said that a series of trade restrictions triggered by the new crown pneumonia epidemic did not help control the epidemic.
Trade is the key solution to the current problem and should not be regarded as the problem.
He condemned all discriminatory and divisive policy measures and urged all economies to keep their borders open at this critical juncture, maintain the smooth operation of the supply chain, and avoid establishing trade barriers or adopting irrational trade policies.

Chengdu people gather to watch the US consulate police stop people from "looking too happy"
In response to the US closure of the Chinese Consulate General in Houston, China announced the closure of the US Consulate General in Chengdu on Friday.
On Saturday, the badge of the US consulate was removed, and on Sunday, a dark glass car left the consulate amid boos from passers-by.
On Sunday, many Chengdu people gathered in front of the US consulate to take pictures, and those who had not been here also came to take a look driven by curiosity about current events.
Agence France-Presse reporters from Chengdu Station also went to the vicinity of the US Consulate in Chengdu to observe it. The news came back that there was an endless stream of angry people, and many parents took their children for a walk to watch the consulate, take pictures of buildings, or take selfies.
The consulate was surrounded by guards, and the police "corrected" people's behavior from time to time. They did not seem to allow any out-of-line behavior: a woman was stopped when she was just about to sing a red song, and a guard confiscated a banner.
However, residents of a nearby residential building successfully pulled up a giant Chinese flag on their balcony and shouted slogans in support of China.
The US Consulate in Chengdu opened in 1985 and covers all consular-related affairs of the United States in southwestern China, especially the Tibet Autonomous Region.
A reporter from Agence France-Presse Chengdu Station said that the Chinese government's response to the United States was relatively restrained: many Chinese people asked the government to close the US consulate in Hong Kong online, but the official only said that "closing the US consulate in Chengdu is a necessary and legal response to the unreasonable behavior of the United States."
At present, in addition to Chengdu, the United States also has consulates in Guangdong, Shanghai, Shenyang, Wuhan and Hong Kong.
Large-scale financial media action "going to the village live to see poverty alleviation" -Today's news-Hunan Daily Network-Huasheng Online
Hunan Daily, New Hunan Client, July 25 (Reporter) On July 25, the large-scale financial media action "Going to the Village Live to See Poverty Alleviation" sponsored by the Financial and Economic Program Center of the Central Radio and Television General Station started from Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province. Two caravans carrying 5G new media mobile cloud production and broadcasting system slowly drove out of the scene under the eyes of the guests at the scene.
General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out that "2020 is a landmark year. We will build a well-off society in an all-round way and achieve the first centenary goal. 2020 is also the year of decisive victory in the decisive battle against poverty."
The large-scale financial media action "Going to the Village Live to Watch Poverty Alleviation" is an important measure taken by the Financial Program Center of the Central Radio and Television General Station to coordinate with this major theme and do a good job in poverty alleviation propaganda.
The action will go into poverty alleviation villages in more than 20 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the Central Government, dig out fresh poverty alleviation stories, directly attack the great changes in the appearance of villages, and show how villagers break through the predicament of survival and development and move towards the road of getting rich.
The operation will last for more than three months.
The reporter started from Xuzhou and divided into two roads, all the way to the southwest line, passing through Anhui, Hubei, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangxi, Guizhou, Sichuan, Chongqing, Yunnan, Tibet and other places; The other way to the northwest line, passing through Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Hebei and other places, the journey exceeds 10,000 kilometers.
In the form of reporting, "going to the village live to see poverty alleviation" is boldly integrated.
The economic development of the villages visited by the caravan will be broadcast through CCTV Financial Channel, CCTV Economic Voice, China Traffic Radio and CCTV Financial New Media.
Among them, the live TV broadcast will be mainly completed in the noon news program "World Finance" of CCTV Financial Channel (premiere time: 12: 00-13: 00 from Monday to Sunday), and the golden news column "Economic Information Network" of CCTV Financial Channel will set up a poverty alleviation report column (premiere time: 20: 30-21: 30 from Monday to Sunday).
At the same time, the caravan will broadcast live for up to one hour on the CCTV financial client of each village. The audience can watch the live broadcast and participate in the lottery by downloading the CCTV financial APP.
In terms of technology application and studio design, "Going to the Village Live to Watch Poverty Alleviation" has the courage to make a breakthrough and pioneered the "Outfield New Media Caravan."
The car is equipped with 5G new media mobile cloud production and broadcasting system, and uses 5G + 4K / 8K + AI technology to realize the organic combination of online and offline, large screen and small screen, and television broadcasting.
Equipped with Sanxun broadcasting area, the broadcasting area is converted from a container, 12 meters long, 2.55 meters wide and 3.98 meters high. The box adopts hydraulic automatic expansion structure, which can turn up to 120 degrees.
The studio area can also be expanded automatically, and the external expansion platform, with an area of more than 50 square meters, can meet the scene requirements of most programs.
At present, Dongchuan District of Kunming City is already hot in summer, and what is hotter than the weather is the poverty alleviation workshop next to the relocation site.
"Now, as soon as you leave your home, you can enter the factory and make money and take care of your family, thanks to the free vocational skills training organized by the trade union," said Lv Ling, an employee of Kunming Aisford Electronic Technology Company.
Walking into the poverty alleviation workshop of electronic components processing in Tongdu Street, Dongchuan District, a busy picture came into view.
Lv Ling, who is in her 40s, is a single mother. She takes care of her children alone and takes care of her elderly parents.
When she was in the most difficult time, Dongchuan District Federation of Trade Unions helped to come up with ideas and find ways to "send help in the snow" after running.
Since 2018, Lv Ling has enjoyed assistance policies such as housing, schooling, social security and employment, as well as assistance funds issued by trade unions at all levels.
This year, her child has successfully graduated and employed, and she herself has a job and income after participating in skills training, and got out of trouble at the end of April.
It is reported that the special skills training project organized by Dongchuan District is part of the skills training work of Yunnan Federation of Trade Unions.
Based on the characteristics of the difficult workers in the relocation sites for poverty alleviation and resettlement in the district, the district general manager made an in-depth investigation to understand the training needs and determine the types of training jobs. In the near future, it plans to train 450 electricians, welders, pastry chefs, etc.
Recently, Li Yi, an employee of the Agricultural Bank of Yunnan Menglian County Branch, wrote a sincere thank-you letter to the County Federation of Trade Unions.
In her letter, she sincerely thanked the trade union for giving her a golden autumn grant from August 2013 to January 2017 to help her complete her studies.
In 2004, Li Yi's father died in a car accident, and her mother was included in the files of employees in difficulty. Since then, she has been enjoying the care of the filing and card establishment policy.
With the help of the local trade union, Li Yi successfully completed her studies.
Since 2016, 3,809 households have been lifted out of difficulties through institutional guarantee and precise assistance.
The successful relief of Lv Ling's family and Li Yi is a microcosm of Yunnan trade unions' efforts to promote the relief of workers in difficulty.
According to Duan Kaiyuan, a staff member of the Legal and Rights Protection Department of the Yunnan Federation of Trade Unions, the provincial general has strengthened the dynamic management of the files of employees in difficulty, promoted the normalization of filing work, and timely incorporated the difficult employees who meet the filing conditions into the assistance system; broaden the application channels for employees in difficulty, and use WeChat to open an online filing service platform for employees in difficulty, so as to facilitate employees in difficulty to declare on their own initiative in a timely manner.
During the epidemic period, it was difficult to go out to work. In order to help the employees with difficulties in filing relieve the pressure of life, Yunnan Province has arranged more than 13 million yuan to send warm funds. According to the standard of 2,000 yuan per household for the employees with difficulties in filing at the national level and 1,500 yuan per household for the employees with difficulties in filing at the provincial level, more than 6,000 households with difficulties in filing at the national level and more than 1,000 households with difficulties at the provincial level have implemented special sending warm condolence activities.
At the same time, the provincial general manager connects with various Internet recruitment platforms such as human and social departments and Zhilian recruitment, pushes recruitment information to employees in difficulty, and provides employment consulting, employment guidance and other services.
