        <seg id="2">Markaðsherferðin Looks Like You Need Iceland þykir hafa farið vel af stað og hróp og köll úti í náttúrunni eru farin að toga í fólk vítt og breitt um heiminn.</seg>
        <seg id="3">„Þið eigið kollgátuna, ég þarfnast Íslands,“ segir kona nokkur úti í hinum stóra heimi í athugasemdum við auglýsingu úr markaðsherferðinni Looks Like You Need Iceland á efnisveitunni YouTube.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Annar áhorfandi kveðst munu varðveita Ísland í hjarta sér um alla eilífð og ung kona segist beinlínis verða að komast sem fyrst til Íslands enda sé unnusti hennar búsettur þar.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Til allrar óhamingju er hún hins vegar í Bandaríkjunum og gerir því ráð fyrir að þurfa að bíða í einhverja mánuði enn.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Enn einn áhorfandi spyr hvort gönguleiðin til Íslands sé fær, því engar séu flugvélarnar.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Ekki fylgir sögunni hvort hann kemur úr öðru tímabelti.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Egill Þórðarson hjá auglýsingastofunni Peel, sem kom að gerð auglýsinganna ásamt alþjóðlegu auglýsingastofunni M&amp;C Saatchi, segir viðtökur hafa verið vonum framar.</seg>
        <seg id="9">„Ég kom að mörgum Inspired By Iceland-herferðum sem gengið hafa mjög vel en þessi nýja herferð er þegar farin að slá met.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Í grunninn snýst þetta um að búa til PR-gildi, það er að fá erlenda fjölmiðla til að fjalla um herferðina, og það hefur gengið ótrúlega vel.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Á tiltölulega skömmum tíma höfum við fengið umfjöllun í um sjö hundruð fjölmiðlum um allan heim sem samtals ná til ríflega tveggja milljarða manna.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Verðmæti þeirrar umfjöllunar er verðlagt á 1,8 milljarða króna.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Það er ekki amalegt.“</seg>
        <seg id="14">Aðalmarkaðurinn alla jafna er Bandaríkin og hefur herferðin gengið mjög vel þar enda þótt Bandaríkjamenn séu ekki á leið til landsins í bráð.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Að sögn Egils hafa þekkt markaðssvæði eins og Danmörk, Bretland og Þýskaland einnig tekið vel við sér, eins Rússland, sem komi þægilega á óvart.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Þá hafi komið viðbrögð frá framandi svæðum, svo sem Indlandi, sem ekki var lagt sérstaklega upp með.</seg>
        <seg id="17">„Þessar auglýsingar hafa ferðast víðar en við bjuggumst við,“ segir Egill en þess má geta að yfir fjórar milljónir manna hafa horft á efnið á YouTube.</seg>
        <seg id="18">„Við hefðum ekki getað óskað eftir betri byrjun.“</seg>
        <seg id="19">Myndirnar hér á opnunni tók Árni Sæberg, ljósmyndari Morgunblaðins, við tökur á auglýsingum sem bera yfirskriftina „Let It Out“ um miðjan síðasta mánuð.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Tökurnar fóru fram vítt og breitt, svo sem á Skólavörðustígnum í Reykjavík, í Reynisfjöru, við Skógarfoss, á Sólheimajökli og í helli við Hjörleifshöfða.</seg>
        <seg id="21">Leikstjórar voru Samúel Bjarki Pétursson og Gunnar Páll Ólafsson hjá Skoti productions og tökumaður Óttar Guðnason.</seg>
        <seg id="22">Í hlutverkum í téðum tökum voru hin íslenska Anna Jia og Murphy Cardenas, sem er frá Kúbu og Ungverjalandi.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Tugir Íslendinga komu að gerð auglýsinganna en á sama tíma og upptökur fóru fram á Suðurlandi var annar hópur á Vesturlandi og Vestfjörðum.</seg>
        <seg id="24">Að sögn Egils er „Let It Out“ aðeins fyrsti liður í Looks Like You Need Iceland-herferðinni en stefnt er að vetrarherferð í samstarfi við M&amp;C Saatchi.</seg>
        <seg id="25">„Þetta er bara fyrsti fasinn í þessari vinnu fyrir Íslandsstofu,“ segir Egill og bætir við að samstarfið við M&amp;C Saatchi hafi gengið afskaplega vel.</seg>
        <seg id="26">„Það er frábært að vinna með þeim.</seg>
        <seg id="27">Í svona verkefnum skiptir miklu máli að hafa erlenda samstarfsaðila með þekkingu á þeim mörkuðum sem við erum að tala við.“</seg>

        <seg id="2">The marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland is considered to have gone off to a good start, and screaming and yelling in nature is beginning to pull in people all over the world.</seg>
        <seg id="3">"You're right, I need Iceland," says a woman somewhere in the world in the comments for an advertisement from the Looks Like You Need Iceland marketing campaign on YouTube.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Another viewer says they will keep Iceland in their heart for all eternity, and a young woman says she literally has to get to Iceland as soon as possible as her fiancé resides there.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Unfortunately, she's in the United States so she expects to have to wait for another few months.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Yet another viewer asks whether the walking route to Iceland is clear, because there are no aeroplanes.</seg>
        <seg id="7">It is left unsaid whether this person is from another time zone.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Egill Þórðarson at the advertising agency Peel, who was involved in making the advertisements along with the international advertising agency M&amp;C Saatchi, says that the response has exceeded all expectations.</seg>
        <seg id="9">"I was involved in many Inspired by Iceland campaigns that have been very successful but this new campaign is already breaking records.</seg>
        <seg id="10">This basically revolves around creating PR value, that is to get foreign media to cover the campaign, and that has been incredibly successful.</seg>
        <seg id="11">In a relatively short time, we have received coverage in about 700 media outlets all over the world, with a combined audience of over two billion.</seg>
        <seg id="12">The value of this coverage is estimated at ISK 1.8 billion.</seg>
        <seg id="13">That's not too bad."</seg>
        <seg id="14">The main market is usually the United States, and the campaign has been very successful there, although Americans are not coming to the country anytime soon.</seg>
        <seg id="15">According to Egill, well-known market areas like Denmark, the UK and Germany have also been responsive, as well as Russia, which is a pleasant surprise.</seg>
        <seg id="16">There has also been a response from remote areas, such as India, which was not a particular objective.</seg>
        <seg id="17">"These advertisements have travelled further than we expected," says Egill, and it may be pointed out that over four million people have watched the content on YouTube.</seg>
        <seg id="18">"We couldn't have wished for a better start."</seg>
        <seg id="19">The photographs in this spread were taken by Árni Sæberg, photographer for Morgunblaðið, during the shooting of the "Let It Out" advertisements in the middle of last month.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Shooting took place in various locations, including on Skólavörðustígur in Reykjavik, at Reynisfjara, Skógarfoss waterfall, on Sólheimajökull glacier and in a cave by Hjörleifshöfði.</seg>
        <seg id="21">Samúel Bjarki Pétursson and Gunnar Páll Ólafsson at Skoti productions directed and Óttar Guðnason was the cameraman.</seg>
        <seg id="22">Actors in these shoots were Anna Jia from Iceland and Murphy Cardenas, who is from Cuba and Hungary.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Tens of Icelanders were involved in making the advertisements, and while shooting was taking place in South Iceland, another crew was working in West Iceland and the Westfjords.</seg>
        <seg id="24">According to Egill, "Let It Out" is only the first part of the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign, with a winter campaign being planned in collaboration with M&amp;C Saatchi.</seg>
        <seg id="25">"This is only the first phase in this work for Promote Iceland," says Egill, adding that the collaboration with M&amp;C Saatchi has gone extremely well.</seg>
        <seg id="26">"It's great working with them.</seg>
        <seg id="27">It's very important in projects like this to have foreign partners who are knowledgable about the markets we're addressing."</seg>

        <seg id="23">Dozens of Icelanders came to make the ads, but at the same time as the recording took place in South Iceland, another group was in West Iceland and the West Fjords.</seg>

        <seg id="2">According to a theory that has caught on online, there is a curse on the television series Glee, with actress Naya Rivera's recent drowning death in California making her the third lead actor in the series to die long before their time.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Glee is a popular series about song, dance and joy.</seg>
        <seg id="4">The series revolved around a so-called glee club for high school teenagers, their loves and their destinies.</seg>
        <seg id="5">It was not always easy to be in the glee club, but through song and dance, the characters in the series seemed to overcome all circumstances that arose in their lives.</seg>
        <seg id="6">But off the set, great tragedies have befallen the cast and crew of the series, to the extent that theories have began circulating about there being a curse on the series.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Naya Marie Rivera played the role of no-nonsense cheerleader Santana Lopez in the series.</seg>
        <seg id="8">After the conclusion of the series, Rivera married actor Ryan Dorsey and had with him her first and only child, Josey.</seg>
        <seg id="9">In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and they were subsequently divorced.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Dorsey refused to press charges, however, and the domestic violence case was dropped.</seg>
        <seg id="11">On 8 July of this year, Rivera was reported missing after her four-year old son was found drifting alone in a boat on Lake Piru in California.</seg>
        <seg id="12">The boy was found sleeping in a life jacket aboard the boat, and he was able to tell police authorities that he and his mother had dived into the water and River had then put him back in the boat but never returned there herself.</seg>
        <seg id="13">An extensive search for Rivera was launched.</seg>
        <seg id="14">The day after the search began, the chief of police in the area reported that the search was conducted according to the assumption that Rivera had drowned.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Five days later, Rivera was found and officially declared dead.</seg>
        <seg id="16">It is believed that she got caught up in a heavy current in the water and used her last remaining strength to save her son.</seg>
        <seg id="17">The cause of death was recorded as accidental drowning.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Cory Allan Michael Monteith played the role of Finn Hudson in the series, the American football player with the voice of angel who played a major role in Glee's success.</seg>
        <seg id="19">But outside the series, Moneith faced personal demons.</seg>
        <seg id="20">He had had addiction problems since the age of 13 and found it difficult to escape from them.</seg>
        <seg id="21">In 2013, his co-workers on the series had had enough and staged an intervention to encourage him to seek help.</seg>
        <seg id="22">Moneith subsequently entered rehab and everything seemed to be heading in the right direction.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Only two months after completing his rehab programme, Moneith was found dead in a hotel room after a night out partying with his friends.</seg>
        <seg id="24">The cause of death turned out to be a fatal mixture of drugs and alcohol.</seg>
        <seg id="25">The death was not believed to be intentional.</seg>
        <seg id="26">Moneith had been through rehab and his tolerance for intoxicants had become so low that a dose that he could easily tolerate before now proved to be fatal.</seg>
        <seg id="27">He was only 31 years old when he passed away.</seg>
        <seg id="28">His death was a great shock to his co-workers, but at the instigation of his co-star Lea Michele, the decision was made to continue shooting the series, with an entire episode dedicated to the memory of Moneith and his character, Finn.</seg>
        <seg id="29">In the series, Mark Wayne Salling played the role of Noah „Puck“ Puckerman, who played American football, like Finn, and had little respect for his fellow students in the glee club, that is until he worked up the courage to admit that he liked singing and dancing.</seg>
        <seg id="30">Two years later, Salling was arrested at his Los Angeles home, suspected of possessing child pornography.</seg>
        <seg id="31">A search of his home revealed enormous quantities of child pornography and the matter soon became public knowledge.</seg>
        <seg id="32">It was obvious that Salling was done.</seg>
        <seg id="33">He was subsequently charged and convicted for his violations.</seg>
        <seg id="34">He was facing four to seven years of prison time, as well as being placed on a register of sex offenders and having to seek treatment for paedophilia.</seg>
        <seg id="35">Before the judge had passed a sentence, Salling, who was out on bail, was found dead near his home.</seg>
        <seg id="36">The cause of death was suicide.</seg>
        <seg id="37">Cast members were not the only ones to die untimely deaths.</seg>
        <seg id="38">Jim Fuller was an assistant director on the series.</seg>
        <seg id="39">He died unexpectedly in his sleep, only 41 years of age.</seg>
        <seg id="40">A woman named Nancy Motes also worked on the series.</seg>
        <seg id="41">She was the younger sister of superstar Julia Roberts and did not speak fondly of her sister, accusing Roberts of being highly controlling and behaving disrespectfully.</seg>
        <seg id="42">Motes, who battled serious depression, took her own life in 2014.</seg>
        <seg id="43">She left a note to her fiancé where she accused her mother and sister of being among the ones responsible for her situation.</seg>
        <seg id="44">“I leave nothing to my mother and so-called siblings except the memory that they were the cause of my worst depression.”</seg>
        <seg id="45">Lea Michel was the star of the series.</seg>
        <seg id="46">She has recently been accused of bullying her co-stars, being aggressive on set and displaying excessive diva-like behaviour.</seg>
        <seg id="47">Jesse Luken had a guest role on the series in 2012.</seg>
        <seg id="48">In 2019, he was arrested and charged with drunk driving, which was considered a huge scandal.</seg>
        <seg id="49">Actress Heather Morris had a major role in the series.</seg>
        <seg id="50">In 2010, unscrupulous computer hackers obtained nude photographs of her and published them online.</seg>
        <seg id="51">Actors Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner both had roles in the series and had an off-screen affair.</seg>
        <seg id="52">Benoist later revealed that Jenner had been abusive towards her during their relationship.</seg>

        <seg id="2">A theory has taken hold on the Internet that the Glee cast is cursed, after actress Naya Rivera drowned in California, becoming the third cast member to die prematurely.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Glee is a popular show about singing, dancing and having fun.</seg>
        <seg id="4">The series was about a high school cheerleading squad, their loves and their fates.</seg>
        <seg id="5">It wasn't always easy being in the glee club, but through song and dance, the show's characters seemed to be able to overcome any situation that arose in their lives.</seg>
        <seg id="6">But off-set, major disasters have befallen the show's cast and crew, so much so that theories have arisen that the show is cursed.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Naya Marie Rivera played Santana Lopez on the show, a cheerleader who didn't call everyone grandma.</seg>
        <seg id="8">After the series ended, Rivera married actor Ryan Dorsey, with whom she had her first and only child, Josey.</seg>
        <seg id="9">In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and they divorced.</seg>
        <seg id="10">However, Dorsey refused to press charges and the domestic violence case was dropped.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Rivera was reported missing on July 8 after her 4-year-old son was found drifting alone in a boat on Lake Piru in California.</seg>
        <seg id="12">The boy was found asleep in a life jacket on the boat and was able to tell authorities that he and his mother had gone swimming and that Rivera had put him back on the boat but never returned.</seg>
        <seg id="13">A massive search was launched for Rivera.</seg>
        <seg id="14">A day after the search began, the local sheriff's office said it believed Rivera had drowned.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Five days later, Rivera was found and officially declared dead.</seg>
        <seg id="16">It is believed that she was caught in a strong current in the water and used her last claim to save her son.</seg>
        <seg id="17">The cause of death was listed as accidental drowning.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Cory Allan Michael Monteith played Finn Hudson on the show, the American football player with the angelic voice who was instrumental in bringing the Glee Club to prominence.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Outside of the show, however, Moneith struggled with personal demons.</seg>
        <seg id="20">He had struggled with addiction since the age of 13 and found it difficult to escape.</seg>

        <seg id="22">Moneith then went to rehab and things seemed to be looking up.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Just two months after completing his treatment, Moneith was found dead in a hotel room after a night out with friends.</seg>
        <seg id="24">Banamein turned out to be a deadly combination of drugs and alcohol.</seg>
        <seg id="25">It was not believed to be a deliberate act.</seg>

        <seg id="27">He was only 31 years old when he died.</seg>
        <seg id="28">His death weighed heavily on his co-stars, but at the behest of his co-star Lea Michele, it was decided to continue filming the show, dedicating an entire episode to the memory of Moneith and his character Finn.</seg>
        <seg id="29">Mark Wayne Salling played the role of Noah "Puck" Puckerman in the series, Puck was an American football player, like Finn, and had little respect for his fellow students in the glee club, until he gained the courage to admit that he liked to sing and dance.</seg>
        <seg id="30">Two years later, Salling was arrested at his home in Los Angeles on suspicion of possessing child pornography.</seg>
        <seg id="31">During a search of his home, an enormous amount of child pornography was found and the case was soon made public.</seg>

        <seg id="3">Strandveiðar eru mjög þægilegt sumarstarf þegar maður er í námi.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Ef vel fiskast er hægt að hafa góðar tekjur og mér finnst frábært að geta sleppt því að taka námslán.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Tekjurnar duga mér líka vel inn í veturinn,“ segir Axel Örn Guðmundsson, 25 ára sálfræðinemi, sem stundar strandveiðar í sumar eins og undanfarin sumur.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Axel var nýlagstur að bryggju á Tálknafirði þegar blaðamaður náði tali af honum seint að kveldi í upphafi vikunnar.“</seg>
        <seg id="7">„Veturinn sem ég var í tíunda bekk tók ég skipstjórnarréttindi fyrir báta sem eru undir tólf metra langir og ég keypti bátinn minn sumarið eftir að ég kláraði grunnskólann.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Ég hef stundað strandveiðar á mínum báti öll sumur síðan.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Ég keypti bátinn notaðan af kunningja mínum, Hartmanni Jónssyni, og ég lét bátinn heita nafninu hans.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Hartmann var orðinn fullorðinn þegar ég keypti bátinn og hættur að vera til sjós og hann var mjög sáttur þegar hann sá að báturinn bar nafn hans.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Hartmann lést nokkrum árum eftir að ég tók við bátnum,“ segir Axel og bætir við að hann hafi keypt bátinn á þrjár milljónir.</seg>
        <seg id="12">„Ég gerði samning við Hartmann um að borga helminginn, eina og hálfa milljón, í upphafi sumars en hinn helminginn í lok sumars þegar ég væri búinn að veiða.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Ég átti því bátinn skuldlausan í lok þessa fyrsta sumars míns á honum.“</seg>
        <seg id="14">En hvernig gat strákur átt eina og hálfa milljón til að borga út í báti þegar hann hafði nýlokið grunnskóla?</seg>
        <seg id="15">„Ég var búinn að leggja fyrir og safna mér pening, ég hafði verið að vinna með pabba til sjós þegar ég var strákur, ég var öll sumur að veiða með honum og fékk minn hlut.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Ég setti líka fermingarpeningana mína í bátasjóðinn minn.“</seg>
        <seg id="17">Axel er fæddur á Ísafirði, þaðan sem allt hans móðurfólk er, en hann hefur búið í Kópavogi frá því hann var strákur.</seg>
        <seg id="18">„Ég má veiða hér á vestursvæðinu af því að ég er með lögheimili hjá ömmu minni á Ísafirði.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Ég lærði á þessi svæði hér fyrir vestan af róðrum með pabba.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Ég færi mig á milli fjarða eftir því hvernig mér líður, því þetta veiðisvæði nær yfir alla Vestfirðina.</seg>
        <seg id="21">Þó að mér finnist best að vera fyrir vestan hef ég líka veitt í kringum Snæfellsnesið og víðar.</seg>
        <seg id="22">Ég hef líka veitt fyrir sunnan en þá helst grásleppu,“ segir Axel, sem rær alltaf einn eldsnemma að morgni og segist stundum tala við mávana og syngja fyrir himininn, í einverunni tímunum saman úti á ballarhafi.</seg>
        <seg id="23">„Netsambandið úti á hafi er gott, svo ég get hringt, hlustað á hlaðvarpsþætti og tónlist.</seg>
        <seg id="24">Mér finnst ekkert mál að vera einn á báti.</seg>
        <seg id="25">Auðvitað reyni ég að forðast að lenda í háska, en vissulega hefur einstaka sinnum eitthvað verið að veðri, en aldrei mikil hætta,“ segir Axel, sem er heppinn með það að hann er aldrei sjóveikur.</seg>
        <seg id="26">Hann segir lengd vinnudagsins fara eftir því hvernig veiðarnar gangi hverju sinni.</seg>
        <seg id="27">„Í strandveiðinni er ég aldrei meira en 14 tíma á veiðum í einu, en ég hef líka verið að veiða í öðrum kerfum, til dæmis í leigukvótanum, en þá hef ég verið samfellt í einn og hálfan sólarhring í beit úti á sjó að veiða.“</seg>
        <seg id="28">Fyrirkomulagið í strandveiðum segir hann vera þannig að hann megi veiða 770 kíló á dag, sem honum finnst hamlandi.</seg>
        <seg id="29">„Aðrar hömlur eru þær að ég má ekki veiða föstudaga, laugardaga og sunnudaga, og ég má aðeins veiða tólf daga í mánuði, þessa fjóra mánuði sem strandveiðar standa yfir, í maí, júní, júlí og ágúst.</seg>
        <seg id="30">Að mínu mati ættu sjómenn að velja sína veiðidaga eftir veðri og engu öðru.</seg>
        <seg id="31">Þessi óþarfa pressa er á menn að róa í stað þess að hafa 48 daga yfir allt sumarið og geta valið eftir sínu höfði.</seg>
        <seg id="32">Svo mætti svæðisskiptingin fara líka mín vegna og sjávarpláss sem eru vel staðsett við fiskimið ættu að fá að njóta þess,“ segir Axel, sem dregur mestmegnis þorsk úr söltum sjó á strandveiðum sínum, en líka aðeins ufsa og einstaka aðrar tegundir fljóta með.</seg>
        <seg id="33">Axel vinnur yfir vetrartímann með háskólanáminu á leikskólanum Núpi í Kópavogi.</seg>
        <seg id="34">„Ég held við séum ekki margir sjómenn sem störfum á leikskólum landsins,“ segir Axel stoltur og bætir við að hann hafi aðeins ætlað að vinna tímabundið á leikskólanum.</seg>
        <seg id="35">„Ég festist þar af því að mér finnst þetta æðislegt starf.</seg>
        <seg id="36">Ég vona að sálfræðinámið nýtist mér á leikskólastiginu í framtíðinni,“ segir Axel, sem einnig er langt kominn með nám í viðskiptafræði.</seg>

        <seg id="6">Axel had just docked in the Tálknafjörður harbour when this reporter met up with him late one evening at the start of the week.</seg>
        <seg id="7">"During my 10th grade winter, I got a licence to skipper boats under 12 metres in length, and I bought my boat in the summer after I finished elementary school.</seg>
        <seg id="8">I have been inshore fishing on my boat every summer since then.</seg>
        <seg id="9">I bought a used boat from my acquaintance, Hartmann Jónsson, and named the boat after him.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Hartmann was getting on in years and had retired from fishing by the time I bought his boat, and he was very pleased when he saw that the boat bore his name.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Hartmann died a few years after I took over the boat," says Axel, adding that he bought the boat for three million.</seg>
        <seg id="12">"I made an agreement with Hartmann to pay half, one and a half million, at the beginning of summer and the other half at the end of summer, when I was done fishing.</seg>
        <seg id="13">So I owned the boat, debt-free, at the end of my first summer on it."</seg>
        <seg id="14">But how could a boy own one and a half million to use as a down payment on a boat when he had just finished elementary school?</seg>
        <seg id="15">"I had saved and raised money, I went out to sea with my dad when I was a boy, I spent all summers fishing with him and got my share.</seg>
        <seg id="16">I also put the money from my confirmation into my boat fund."</seg>
        <seg id="17">Axel was born in Ísafjörður, the home of all his maternal relatives, but has lived in Kópavogur since he was a boy.</seg>
        <seg id="18">"I'm allowed to fish here in the western area because my domicile is with my grandmother in Ísafjörður.</seg>
        <seg id="19">I learned about these spots out here in the west from going fishing with my dad.</seg>
        <seg id="20">I move from fjord to fjord according to how I feel, because this fishing zone extends across the entire Westfjords.</seg>
        <seg id="21">Although I think it's best to be out west, I have also fished around Snæfellsnes and in other places.</seg>
        <seg id="22">I have also gone fishing down south, but then it's mainly lumpfish," says Axel, who always sails out alone in the very early hours of the morning and says that he'll sometimes talk to the seagulls and sing to the sky in his hours of solitude in the middle of the ocean.</seg>
        <seg id="23">"There's good internet connection out at sea so I can make calls and listen to podcasts and music.</seg>
        <seg id="24">I don't find it difficult at all to be alone on the boat.</seg>
        <seg id="25">Of course I try to avoid danger, but there have certainly been instances of something going wrong with the weather, although never any great risk," says Axel, who is lucky in that he is never seasick.</seg>
        <seg id="26">He says that the length of the working day depends on how the fishing goes each time.</seg>
        <seg id="27">"In inshore fishing, I never spend more than 14 hours fishing at a time, but I have also been fishing according to other systems, the hired quota system, for instance, where I have been out at sea fishing for one and a half days without interruption.</seg>
        <seg id="28">He says that according to the inshore fishing arrangement, he's allowed to catch 770 kilos per day, which he feels is restrictive.</seg>
        <seg id="29">"Other restrictions are not being allowed to fish on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, and I'm only allowed to fish for twelve days a month for the four months of inshore fishing, May, June, July and August.</seg>
        <seg id="30">I believe that sailors should pick their fishing days according to the weather and nothing else.</seg>
        <seg id="31">There is this unnecessary pressure to go out fishing instead of having 48 days over the whole summer and being able to pick them as you please.</seg>
        <seg id="32">I also wouldn't mind if the division into zones would stop, in which case the fishing villages that are ideally located close to fishing grounds should be allowed to reap the benefits," says Axel, whose main catch in his inshore fishing is cod, along with some saithe and the occasional other species.</seg>
        <seg id="33">During the winter, Axel works at the preschool Núpur in Kópavogur alongside his university studies.</seg>
        <seg id="34">"I don't think there's many of us sailors working in the country's preschools," says Axel with pride, adding that he only intended to work temporarily at the preschool.</seg>
        <seg id="35">"I got stuck there because I think it's a wonderful job.</seg>
        <seg id="36">I hope that the psychology studies will be useful for me at the preschool level," says Axel, who is also well on his way in his business administration studies.</seg>

        <seg id="3">Coastal fishing is a very comfortable summer job when you're studying.</seg>
        <seg id="4">If you fish well, you can have a good income and I think it's great to not be able to take student loans.</seg>
        <seg id="5">The income will also do me well into winter,” says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, a 25-year-old psychology student, who is fishing for the summer as recently as summer.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Axel was the latest to dock at Tálknafjörður when a reporter caught up with him late in the evening at the beginning of the week.”</seg>
        <seg id="7">“The winter I was in tenth grade, I took ship’s license for boats that are under twelve meters long, and I bought my boat the summer after I finished elementary school.</seg>
        <seg id="8">I've been coast fishing in my boat all summer since.</seg>
        <seg id="9">I bought the boat used by an acquaintance of mine, Hartmann Jónsson, and I let the boat be called his name.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Hartmann had grown up when I bought the boat and stopped being to sea, and he was very happy when he saw that the boat bore his name.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Hartmann died a few years after I took the boat,” Axel says, adding that he bought the boat at three million.</seg>
        <seg id="12">“I made a deal with Hartmann to pay half, one and a half million, at the beginning of the summer, and the other half at the end of the summer when I would have fished.</seg>
        <seg id="13">So I had the boat without debt at the end of that first summer of my life on it.”</seg>
        <seg id="14">But how could a boy have one and a half million to pay out in a boat when he had just finished primary school?</seg>
        <seg id="15">“I had parked and collected some money, I had been working with my dad to sea when I was a boy, I was all summers fishing with him and got my share.</seg>
        <seg id="16">I also put my loading money in my boat fund.”</seg>
        <seg id="17">Axel is born in Ísafjörður, where all his mother’s people are from, but he has lived in Kópavogur since he was a boy.</seg>
        <seg id="18">“I may hunt here in the western area because I am domiciled with my grandmother in Ísafjörður.</seg>
        <seg id="19">I learned these areas west of here from rowing with my dad.</seg>
        <seg id="20">I move between distances depending on how I feel, because this fishing area covers all of the Westfjords.</seg>
        <seg id="21">Although I think it’s best to be west, I’ve also fished around Snæfellsnes and beyond.</seg>
        <seg id="22">I’ve also fished down south, but then I prefer greyhounds,” says Axel, who always mulls one early morning fire and says he sometimes speaks to the seagulls and sings for the sky, in the solitude for hours out on the balmy sea.</seg>
        <seg id="23">“The internet at sea is good, so I can call, listen to podcasts and music.</seg>
        <seg id="24">I don't think it's a big deal to be on your own.</seg>
        <seg id="25">Of course I try to avoid getting into danger, but certainly occasionally something has been wrong with the weather, but never a great danger,” says Axel, who is lucky that he is never seasick.</seg>
        <seg id="26">He says the length of the workday depends on how the hunt goes each time.</seg>
        <seg id="27">“In the coastal fishing I’m never more than 14 hours fishing at once, but I’ve also been fishing in other systems, for example in the rental quota, in which case I’ve been continuously for a day and a half grazing out at sea fishing.”</seg>
        <seg id="28">The coastal fishing regime says it is such that it can catch 770 kilos a day, which it finds restrictive.</seg>
        <seg id="29">“Other restrictions are that I am not allowed to fish Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, and I am only allowed to fish twelve days a month, the four months of coastal fishing, in May, June, July and August.</seg>
        <seg id="30">In my opinion, sailors should choose their fishing days depending on the weather and nothing else.</seg>
        <seg id="31">This unnecessary pressure is on men to calm down instead of having 48 days throughout the summer and be able to pick their own way.</seg>
        <seg id="32">So the regional division could go my way, too, and sea lakes that are well situated at fishing grounds should be allowed to enjoy it,” says Axel, who draws most of the cod from the salty seas of his coastal fisheries, but also only pollock and the occasional other species float.</seg>
        <seg id="33">Axel works during the winter time with the university at the nursery school Núpi in Kópavogur.</seg>
        <seg id="34">“I don’t think we are many sailors working in the country’s kindergartens,” Axel says proudly, adding that he only intended to work temporarily at the kindergarten.</seg>
        <seg id="35">“I got stuck there because I think it’s an awesome job.</seg>
        <seg id="36">I hope that my psychology studies will be of use to me at the kindergarten level in the future,” says Axel, who is also at an advanced stage of business studies.</seg>

        <seg id="1">40% of COVID-19 fatalities had type 2 diabetes</seg>
        <seg id="2">Devon Brumfield could hear through the phone how difficult it was for her father to catch his breath.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Her father had diabetes so she urged him to seek medical care.</seg>
        <seg id="4">The next day he was dead.</seg>
        <seg id="5">His death was traced to acute respiratory distress from coronavirus infection.</seg>
        <seg id="6">His death certificate noted diabetes as an underlying condition and Brumfield, who also has diabetes, is terrified of meeting the same fate.</seg>
        <seg id="7">According to Reuters, Brumfield's fear is not unfounded.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Figures from a new study commissioned by the US government show that nearly 40% of those who have died had type 2 diabetes as an underlying condition.</seg>
        <seg id="9">When looking at those who had not reached the age of 65, the proportion increases to half.</seg>
        <seg id="10">The study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) extended to over 10,000 people in 15 states who died from the coronavirus during the period between February and May.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Jonathan Wortham, an epidemiologist with the CDC, said that the findings were striking, not least for those who have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and their loved ones.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Was a slow-moving pandemic Reuters commissioned a survey where the answers from the 12 states that responded indicate a similar rate.</seg>
        <seg id="13">10 states, including California, Arizona and Columbia, have not yet began reporting underlying conditions.</seg>
        <seg id="14">"Diabetes was already a slow-moving pandemic.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Now COVID-19 has crashed through like a powerful wave," said Elbert Huang, director of the University of Chicago's Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy, to Reuters.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Diabetes is more common among Blacks and Latinos, who have also suffered more from the coronavirus.</seg>
        <seg id="17">One of the best defences for those who have type 2 diabetes is to keep the disease under control with exercise, a healthy diet and the assistance of healthcare workers.</seg>
        <seg id="18">However, the coronavirus pandemic has made it difficult for many to maintain a routine.</seg>
        <seg id="19">The high price of insulin has also forced some people to keep showing up for work, thereby risking virus exposure.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Reuters points out that US authorities should have been aware of the high risk that the virus may pose to type 2 diabetes patients.</seg>
        <seg id="21">During the SARS coronavirus outbreak of 2003, more than 20% of fatalities had the disease, and in the swine flu pandemic of 2009, this group faced triple the risk of hospitalisation.</seg>
        <seg id="22">And when MERS emerged in 2012, one study showed that 60% of those who died or were admitted to intensive care units had diabetes.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Charles S. Dela Cruz, researcher at Yale University says that because the effects of the COVID-19 virus last longer, the pandemic may unearth a number of previously unknown complications.</seg>
        <seg id="24">"My fear is we will see a tsunami of problems once this is over," said Andrew Boulton, president of the International Diabetes Federation.</seg>
        <seg id="25">Doctors have warned that the coronavirus may indirectly lead to a spike in diabetes-related complications, including kidney disease and dialysis.</seg>
        <seg id="26">New studies also indicate that the coronavirus may lead to an increase in cases of diabetes.</seg>
        <seg id="27">According to Reuters, scientists are striving to understand the connections between the coronavirus and type 2 diabetes.</seg>
        <seg id="28">The virus targets the heart, lung and kidneys, organs already weakened in many diabetes patients.</seg>
        <seg id="29">High glucose and lipid counts in diabetes patients can also trigger a so-called "cytokine storm," when the immune system overreacts, attacking the body.</seg>
        <seg id="30">Furthermore, damaged endothelial cells can lead to inflammation, which in turn may cause a lethal blood clot.</seg>
        <seg id="31">"It's all one big puzzle," says Dela Cruz.</seg>

        <seg id="7">Reuters News Department says Brumfield's fears are not unfounded.</seg>

        <seg id="10">An investigation by the US Disease Prevention Service (CDC) involved more than 10,000 people in 15 states who died of the coronavirus between February and May.</seg>

        <seg id="17">One of the best preventive measures for those with diabetes 2 is to contain the condition through exercise, a healthy diet and the assistance of health care professionals.</seg>
        <seg id="18">However, the coronavirus pandemic has made it difficult for many to maintain routine.</seg>
        <seg id="19">In addition, the high price of insulin has forced some to continue attending work, thereby risking being exposed to the virus.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Reuters points out that US authorities may have been aware of the dangers that the virus may pose to those with diabetes 2.</seg>
        <seg id="21">As the SARS coronavirus passed in 2003, more than 20% of them had the disease, and during the swine flu pandemic in 2009, this group was at three times higher risk of having to be hospitalized.</seg>
        <seg id="22">When MERS was observed in 2012, one study showed that 60% of those who died or were admitted to intensive care had diabetes.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Charles S. Dela Cruz scientist at Yale University says that because the effects of the COVID-19 virus could last longer, the pandemic has uncovered a number of unprecedented complications.</seg>
        <seg id="24">"I fear that we will see a tidal wave of problems when this is over," says Andrew Bolton, chairman of the International Diabetes Association.</seg>
        <seg id="25">Doctors have warned that the coronavirus pandemic may indirectly lead to an increase in complications related to diabetes, including kidney disease and renal dialysis.</seg>
        <seg id="26">Likewise, new studies suggest that the coronavirus may lead to an increase in the number of diabetic cases.</seg>
        <seg id="27">Reuters says scientists are trying to understand the link between the coronavirus and diabetes 2.</seg>
        <seg id="28">The virus attacks the heart, lungs and kidneys, organs that are already sick in many people with diabetes.</seg>
        <seg id="29">In this case, a high rate of glucose and lipide in diabetics can produce a true "cell messaging storm," as it is called when the immune system responds too aggressively and attacks the body.</seg>

        <seg id="1">"We were offered champagne, then they left the room"</seg>
        <seg id="2">Husband and wife Atli Bollason and Ásrún Magnúsdóttir agreed to an unusual request from artist Ragnar Kjartansson: to have sex in front of a camera for an exhibition that the artist was mounting in Paris.</seg>
        <seg id="3">"We loved each other so this was not complicated."</seg>
        <seg id="4">Atli Bollason never forgets meeting his wife and mother of his children, Ásrún Magnúsdóttir, for the first time.</seg>
        <seg id="5">"I became very infatuated with her.</seg>
        <seg id="6">There was her charisma, of course, but I also thought she was just incredibly cute.</seg>
        <seg id="7">And I still think so," he says.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Ásrún also remembers this, as her husband regularly reminisces about their first encounter.</seg>
        <seg id="9">"I'm always hearing this story.</seg>
        <seg id="10">The last time was just this weekend," says Ásrún, who was also attracted to her husband when they first met.</seg>
        <seg id="11">"I felt, and still feel, that there's so much excitement around Atli, which I like.</seg>
        <seg id="12">There's a lot going on and much happening and I was charmed by that."</seg>
        <seg id="13">Atli says that in their relationship, the couple have focused on going their own way.</seg>
        <seg id="14">"We don't tread the well-worn paths.</seg>
        <seg id="15">We avoid the routines that we can detect around us."</seg>
        <seg id="16">That may be why they simply welcomed artist Kjartan Ragnarsson's request, despite it being unusual, to put it mildly.</seg>
        <seg id="17">"Our mutual friend, Kristín Anna, contacted us to ask whether we could join her, Raggi and Ragnar's wife, Ingibjörg, for desserts at Snaps."</seg>
        <seg id="18">They accepted the invitation, met the trio at Snaps and had dessert wine and one dessert each.</seg>
        <seg id="19">They listened to Ragnar, who talked them through his plans for the art exhibition that he intended to mount at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris that autumn.</seg>
        <seg id="20">"He had a multi-channel video installation called Scenes from Western Culture.</seg>
        <seg id="21">He described it in a simple manner."</seg>
        <seg id="22">According to Ásrún, he described the piece as banal and decadent scenes from the everyday life of Westerners.</seg>
        <seg id="23">"He had sketches of all the scenes that he intended to shoot and the last thing he told us about was the thing that he wanted to know whether we would be interested in taking part in."</seg>
        <seg id="24">The scene that Ragnar asked the couple to take part in was supposed to show a middle-class couple making love in a minimalistic room.</seg>
        <seg id="25">"It's intercourse with a beginning and end," says Atli.</seg>
        <seg id="26">The couple didn't know Ragnar well, although they were aware of him and he of them, "but they were familiar with us and felt that we were right for this.</seg>
        <seg id="27">They mentioned that they didn't want to advertise for people.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Maybe they thought that they wouldn't get the right people but rather people who receive sexual gratification from performing for others."</seg>
        <seg id="29">They said goodbye to Ragnar and agreed to think about the matter, but that didn't take long.</seg>
        <seg id="30">"As we walked out of Snaps we said: Aren't we up for this?</seg>
        <seg id="31">It was just like that.</seg>
        <seg id="32">I trust Ragnar as an artist, as well as his whole team," says Ásrún and Atli concurs.</seg>
        <seg id="33">"This is about the love and intimacy"</seg>
        <seg id="34">The scene was filmed in a fancy apartment at Mýrargata.</seg>
        <seg id="35">The crew was very small: a cameraman, Ragnar and a sound technician, and the couple.</seg>
        <seg id="36">When the recording had been turned on, everyone except Atli and Ásrún left the room to wait in a car outside.</seg>
        <seg id="37">"We hadn't decided anything about what we were going to be like.</seg>
        <seg id="38">We received some minor instructions, but we tried to forget the time and place.</seg>
        <seg id="39">To be unaware of what we were doing and for whom.</seg>
        <seg id="40">There was no acting, we just loved each other so it wasn't complicated," says Ásrún.</seg>
        <seg id="41">But was it romantic?</seg>
        <seg id="42">"Yes, it was a little romantic," says Atli, and Ásrún agrees.</seg>
        <seg id="43">„We were offered champagne before they left the room.</seg>
        <seg id="44">It was a little like being on vacation at a fancy hotel in Paris."</seg>
        <seg id="45">The crew was pleased with the couple's performance in the piece, and it moved them.</seg>
        <seg id="46">"Tommi the cameraman cried when he watched it, he thought it was so beautiful," says Atli.</seg>
        <seg id="47">"It's as much about the love and intimacy as about the intercourse itself," says Ásrún.</seg>
        <seg id="48">The couple's parents have seen the piece, and Atli says that his mother heard her son's voice at the Reykjavik Art Museum and then realised that he was part of the piece.</seg>
        <seg id="49">"Then she turned around and began to examine it," says Atli.</seg>
        <seg id="50">"Mom and dad saw it in Paris.</seg>
        <seg id="51">We hadn't told anyone about this, but then dad just sends me a message and says: It was fun to run into the little family in the Palais de Tokyo," Ásrún recalls.</seg>
        <seg id="52">And did taking part in the project deepen the relationship between Ásrún and Atli?</seg>
        <seg id="53">We're still together, anyway, so maybe it deepened something.</seg>
        <seg id="54">At least it deepened the relationship with my in-laws," says Ásrún with a laugh.</seg>
        <seg id="55">As for Ásrún, she saw the piece in Copenhagen with her colleague.</seg>
        <seg id="56">"I found it a little difficult to be with someone other than you," she says, turning to her husband.</seg>
        <seg id="57">"But it was fun to see it because it's just one scene in a much bigger piece and it's very impressive when you see it along with the other pieces.</seg>
        <seg id="58">I was able to detach myself a little from it, and I was just proud.</seg>
        <seg id="59">And there was the little bean in my belly," says Ásrún, who was pregnant with the couple's second child when the scene was shot.</seg>
        <seg id="60">"It was just beautiful."</seg>

        <seg id="31">It was just like that.</seg>
        <seg id="32">I trust Ragnar as an artist and his whole team, "says Ásrún and Atli.</seg>
        <seg id="33">"It's about love and intimacy"</seg>
        <seg id="34">The scene was filmed in a finer apartment on Mýrargata.</seg>
        <seg id="35">There was a very small film team; a cameraman, Ragnar and a soundman and the couple.</seg>
        <seg id="36">After a recording had been turned on, everyone left the room to wait in the car except Atli and Ásrún.</seg>
        <seg id="37">"We hadn't decided how to be.</seg>
        <seg id="38">We had some little instructions, but we tried to forget about time and place.</seg>
        <seg id="39">Being unaware of what we were doing and for whom.</seg>
        <seg id="40">Nothing was played, we just loved each other, so it wasn't complicated, "says Ásrún.</seg>
        <seg id="41">But was that romantic?</seg>
        <seg id="42">"Yes, it was a little romantic," says Atli, and Ásrún agrees with that.</seg>
        <seg id="43">"We were offered champagne before they left the room.</seg>
        <seg id="44">It was a little like being on vacation in a nice hotel in Paris. "</seg>
        <seg id="45">The team was delighted with the couple's performance in the piece that moved them.</seg>
        <seg id="46">"When Tommi the cameraman looked at it, he cried, he thought it was so beautiful," says Atli.</seg>
        <seg id="47">"It's as much about love and intimacy as the sexual intercourse itself," says Ásrún.</seg>
        <seg id="48">The couple's parents have seen the work and Atli says that his mother heard the voice in the son at the Reykjavík Art Museum and realised that he was part of the work.</seg>
        <seg id="49">"Then she turned around and began to think about it," says Atli.</seg>
        <seg id="50">"Mom and Dad saw this in Paris.</seg>
        <seg id="51">We hadn't told anyone that way, but then my dad just sent me a message saying: Nice to come across the little family in Palais de Tokyo, "Ásrún recalls.</seg>
        <seg id="52">And I wonder if the participant in the work has deepened the relationship between Ásrún and Atli.</seg>
        <seg id="53">"At least we're still together, so maybe it deepened something.</seg>
        <seg id="54">At least this deepened my relationship with my father-in-law, "says Ásrún, laughing.</seg>
        <seg id="55">Ásrún herself saw the work in Copenhagen with her colleague.</seg>
        <seg id="56">"I found it a little difficult not to be with you but with someone else," she says, turning to her husband.</seg>
        <seg id="57">"But it was nice to see this because it's only one scene in a much bigger piece, and when you saw it with the other pieces, it's really cool.</seg>
        <seg id="58">I could tear myself away from this a little bit and I was just proud.</seg>
        <seg id="59">And there was the little bean in my stomach, "says Ásrún, who was pregnant with one of the couple's children when the scene was filmed.</seg>

        <seg id="1">"We were invited champagne, so they left the room"</seg>
        <seg id="2">The couple Ásrún Magnúsdóttir and Atli Bollason received the unusual bonus from artist Ragnari Kjartansson to have sex in front of a camera for a work that the artist was setting up in Paris.</seg>
        <seg id="3">"We loved each other so this was not complicated."</seg>
        <seg id="4">Atli Bollason never forgets when he met his wife and mother, Ásrúna Magnúsdóttir, for the first time.</seg>
        <seg id="5">"I became very fascinated by her.</seg>
        <seg id="6">It was naturally just the radiation, but so I thought it was also quite inexpensively sweet.</seg>
        <seg id="7">And it still seems," he says.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Asrún remembers this too, as the husband recalls the first meeting regularly.</seg>
        <seg id="9">"I am always hearing this story.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Last just this weekend," she says, who also attracted the husband at first encounter.</seg>
        <seg id="11">"I felt and feel so much excitement around Atla, which I like.</seg>
        <seg id="12">There are many things going on and a lot going on and I was fascinated by it."</seg>
        <seg id="13">Atli says the couple have focused on it in their relationship to go their own ways.</seg>
        <seg id="14">"We do not tie our bagging the same knots as fellow travelers.</seg>
        <seg id="15">We avoid the rutins we distinguish around us."</seg>
        <seg id="16">It is possible that they took the errand from Ragnari Kjartansson artist just celebrating, although it was mildly said unusual.</seg>
        <seg id="17">"Christine Anna our common friend contacts us and asks if we can come to eat desert with him, Ragga and Ingibjörg Ragnar's wife, on Snaps."</seg>
        <seg id="18">They then offered, met the three-eye at Snaps, and got themselves a desert wine and their respective desserts.</seg>
        <seg id="19">They listened to Ragnar who led them through their plans at a visual art exhibition he thought to set up in Palais de Tokyo, Paris in the fall.</seg>
        <seg id="20">"He had a multi-channel video work called Scenes from western culture.</seg>
        <seg id="21">He described it in a simple way."</seg>
        <seg id="22">Asrún says he described the work as a banal and dekadent senum from the everyday life of the West.</seg>
        <seg id="23">"He had sketches of all the scenes he was going to shoot and last he told us about what he wanted to know if we were interested in joining."</seg>
        <seg id="24">The scene that Ragnar asked the couple to join was supposed to show a young middle class pair to love in a minimalist room.</seg>
        <seg id="25">"These are intercourse with the beginning and end," says Atli.</seg>
        <seg id="26">The couple did not know Ragnar much though they knew of him and him of them "but they knew us and felt we fit in this.</seg>
        <seg id="27">They had a word that they did not want to advertise people.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Perhaps they thought they would not get the right people but people who would get sexual frustration from performera for others."</seg>
        <seg id="29">They called Ragnar and agreed to think about the matter, but it did not take long.</seg>
        <seg id="30">"When we ran out of Snaps, we said, Are we not just ready for this?</seg>
        <seg id="31">It was just that.</seg>
        <seg id="32">I trust Ragnari as an artist and his entire team," says Ásrún and Atli.</seg>
        <seg id="33">"This is about love and closeness"</seg>
        <seg id="34">The scene was taken up in a finer apartment on Mýrargata.</seg>
        <seg id="35">There was a very rare film team; filmmaker, Ragnar and sounder and the pair.</seg>

        <seg id="38">We got some little instructions but we tried to forget the moment and place.</seg>

        <seg id="47">"This is as much about love as the closest and self-intercourse," says Ásrún.</seg>
        <seg id="48">The couple's parents have seen the work, and Atli says that his mom heard the voice in the son at Reykjavík Art Museum and then realized that he was part of the work.</seg>
        <seg id="49">"Then she turns around and starts puzzling in this," says Atli.</seg>
        <seg id="50">"Mom and Dad saw this in Paris.</seg>
        <seg id="51">We hadn't told anyone that way, but then just my dad sends me a message saying, "Fun to come across the little family in Palais de Tokyo," Ásrún recalls.</seg>

        <seg id="59">And there was the little bean in my stomach," says Ásrún, who was pregnant by another child of the couple when the scene was filmed.</seg>

        <seg id="4">Atli Bollason never forgets when he met his wife and mother of his child, Ásrún Magnúsdóttir, for the first time.</seg>
        <seg id="5">“I became very fascinated with her.</seg>
        <seg id="6">It was just the natural emission, but then I also thought it was completely unlistenable.</seg>
        <seg id="7">And still feel," he says.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Ásrún remembers this, too, as the husband recalls the first meeting regularly.</seg>
        <seg id="9">“I’m always hearing this story.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Last only this weekend,' she says, who was also attracted to her husband on first impression.</seg>
        <seg id="11">“I felt and feel so excited around Atli, who I fancy.</seg>
        <seg id="12">There is a lot going on and a lot happening and I was impressed by it.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Atli says the two have stressed in their relationship to go their separate ways.</seg>
        <seg id="14">“We don’t tie our balms the same knots as fellow passengers.</seg>
        <seg id="15">We avoid routines that we detect around us.”</seg>
        <seg id="16">That’s possibly why they took the business away from artist Ragnar Kjartansson just celebrating, although that would be the least unusual.</seg>
        <seg id="17">“Our mutual friend Kristin Anna contacts us and asks if we can come to eat desert with her, Ragga and Ragnar’s wife Ingibjörg, at Snaps.”</seg>
        <seg id="18">They accepted the offer, met the threesome at Snaps and had desert wine and their respective desserts.</seg>
        <seg id="19">They listened to Ragnar, who led them through his plans at an art exhibition he was planning to put up at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris in the fall.</seg>
        <seg id="20">“He had a multi-channel video project called Scenes from western culture.</seg>
        <seg id="21">He described it simply.”</seg>
        <seg id="22">Ásrún says he described the work as banal and decadent scenes from everyday Western life.</seg>
        <seg id="23">“He had sketches of all the scenes he was going to shoot and last time he told us what he wanted to know if we were interested in participating.”</seg>
        <seg id="24">The send-up Ragnar asked the couple to join was supposed to show a young middle-class couple making love in a minimalist room.</seg>
        <seg id="25">“It’s intercourse with beginnings and ends,” Atli says.</seg>
        <seg id="26">The pair didn’t know Ragnar much, although they knew about him and he knew about them “but they knew us and thought we fit this.</seg>
        <seg id="27">They had a word that they didn't want to advertise for people.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Maybe they thought they wouldn’t get the right people, but people who would get sexual frowns from performing for others.”</seg>
        <seg id="29">They said goodbye to Ragnar and agreed to think about it, but it didn’t take long.</seg>
        <seg id="30">“When we walked out of Snaps, we said, ‘Aren’t we just up for this?</seg>
        <seg id="31">It was just like that.</seg>
        <seg id="32">I trust Ragnar as an artist and his whole team,” Ásrún and Atli state.</seg>
        <seg id="33">“It’s about love and intimacy”</seg>
        <seg id="34">Senan was taken up in a nice apartment on the Marsh Road.</seg>
        <seg id="35">There was a very sophisticated film team; cameraman, Ragnar and sound guy and the couple.</seg>
        <seg id="36">After a recording was turned on, everyone left the room to wait in the car except Atli and Ásrún.</seg>
        <seg id="37">“We hadn’t decided anything how we should be.</seg>
        <seg id="38">We had some small instructions, but we tried to forget a time and a place.</seg>
        <seg id="39">To be unaware of what we were doing and for whom.</seg>
        <seg id="40">There was no play, we just loved each other so it wasn’t complicated,” Ásrún says.</seg>
        <seg id="41">But was it romantic?</seg>
        <seg id="42">“Yes, it was a little romantic,” Atli says, and Ásrún agrees.</seg>
        <seg id="43">“We were offered champagne before they left the room.</seg>
        <seg id="44">It was a bit like being on holiday in a nice hotel in Paris.”</seg>
        <seg id="45">The team was pleased with the pair's performance on the job that moved them.</seg>
        <seg id="46">“When Tom the cameraman watched it, he cried, he thought it was so beautiful,” Atli says.</seg>
        <seg id="47">“It’s as much about love and intimacy as the actual intercourse,” Ásrún says.</seg>
        <seg id="48">The couple’s parents have seen the work and tell Atli that his mom heard the voice in the son at the Reykjavík Art Museum and then realized he was part of the work.</seg>
        <seg id="49">“Then she turns around and starts to ponder this,” Atli says.</seg>
        <seg id="50">“My mom and dad saw this in Paris.</seg>
        <seg id="51">We hadn’t told anyone this way, but then just Dad sends me a message and says, “Nice to run into the little family in Palais de Tokyo,” Ásrún recalls.</seg>
        <seg id="52">And I wonder if the participation in the work has deepened the relationship between Ásrún and Atli.</seg>
        <seg id="53">“At least we’re still together so maybe it deepened something.</seg>
        <seg id="54">At least this deepened my relationship with my in-law family,” Ásrún says, laughing.</seg>
        <seg id="55">Ásrún herself saw the work in Copenhagen with her colleague.</seg>
        <seg id="56">“I found it a little hard not to be with you but with someone else,” she says, turning to her husband.</seg>
        <seg id="57">“But it was nice to see this because it’s just one session in a much bigger job, and when you saw it with the other acts, it’s very cool.</seg>
        <seg id="58">I could tear myself away from it a little bit and I was just proud.</seg>
        <seg id="59">And there was the little bean in my stomach,” says Ásrún, who was pregnant with the couple’s second child when the session was recorded.</seg>
        <seg id="60">“It was just beautiful.”</seg>

        <seg id="8">Sextán mánuðir liðu þar til eftirmaður Van Voorst kom til starfa, í september 2010.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Það má að einhverju leyti rekja til þess að Robert S. Connan hafði verið skipaður sem sendiherra en hætti svo við.</seg>

        <seg id="1">No ambassador for five years since 2009</seg>
        <seg id="2">The US ambassador to Iceland, Jeffrey Gunter Ross, is the focus of media attention following CBS's report this morning that he requested an armed bodyguard because he feared for his life.</seg>
        <seg id="3">It has not been an easy task for the US President to appoint an ambassador to this country, however.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Since Carol Van Voorst left the office of US ambassador in late April 2009, Iceland has been without an ambassador for a total of 62 months, or over five years.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Van Voorst left office under peculiar circumstances, with Kastljós reporting in 2009 that she was supposed to receive the Order of the Falcon.</seg>
        <seg id="6">While on her way to a farewell meeting with the President of Iceland, she received a telephone call from the President's office to tell her that she wouldn't be awarded the honour.</seg>
        <seg id="7">After leaving Iceland, she taught international communications at the Army War College.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Sixteen months passed until Van Voorst's successor arrived in September 2010.</seg>
        <seg id="9">This may be have been due in part to Robert S. Connan being previously appointed ambassador but then changing his mind.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Finally, Loius Ariega, who had worked in the foreign service for decades, took on the job.</seg>
        <seg id="11">He stepped down in the autumn of 2013 to assume the office of ambassador to Guatemala.</seg>
        <seg id="12">There was subsequently another ambassador-less period.</seg>
        <seg id="13">In January 2015, the United States Senate approved the appointment of Robert Barber, who arrived shortly thereafter, by which time there had been no ambassador for 13 months.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Barber was politically appointed rather than a diplomat, having worked as a lawyer and contributed to Barack Obama's election fund.</seg>
        <seg id="15">He stepped down as soon as Donald Trump assumed the office of President on 20 January 2017, as is the custom with politically appointed ambassadors.</seg>
        <seg id="16">The Trump administration took unusually long to appoint both ambassadors and high-ranking officials in Washington.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Two years passed until the United States Senate summoned Jeffrey Ross Gunter to question him thoroughly before confirming his appointment as ambassador to Iceland.</seg>
        <seg id="18">In his Senate hearing, he said that he had never been to Iceland but had frequently been to Western Europe, as his late wife had been of Dutch descent.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Gunter is a political appointee who was previously a dermatologist in California and has been active in the organisation of Jews in the Republican Party, the Republican Jewish Coalition.</seg>
        <seg id="20">The organisation was founded by casino owner Sheldon Adelson, who is a fervent supporter of Donald Trump.</seg>
        <seg id="21">Gunter arrived to assume office in Iceland in May 2019, by which time there had been no ambassador in the country since early 2017, for two years and four months, which is a record length of time in this country.</seg>
        <seg id="22">The reason is both the long time it took for the Trump administration to appoint people to key offices and the great delays in the work of the Senate in recent years, including in the confirmation of ambassadors.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Since 2009, Iceland has therefore been without an ambassador for a total of over five years.</seg>
        <seg id="24">This has not prevented construction projects by the embassy, which recently opened new headquarters at Engjateigur.</seg>
        <seg id="25">The construction is believed to have cost about ISK 6.5 billion, with enormously thick security walls surrounding the building and bulletproof glass in all windows.</seg>
        <seg id="26">This does not seem to be enough to give the current ambassador a sense of security, however, as he is said to fear for his life and has requested an armed body guard.</seg>

        <seg id="16">It took the Trump administration an extraordinary period of time to appoint both ambassadors and high-ranking government officials in Washington.</seg>
        <seg id="17">It took two years for the United States Congress to summon Jeffrey Ross Gunter to ask him questions and confirm him after that as Ambassador to Iceland.</seg>
        <seg id="18">In his parliamentary testimony, he said he had never been to Iceland but often to Western Europe, but his deceased wife had been broken from Dutch rock.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Gunter is politically appointed, was formerly a dermatologist in California and has been a prominent member of the Republican Jewish Coalition.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Casino owner Sheldon Adelson founded that organization, but Adelson is an enthusiastic supporter of Donald Trump.</seg>
        <seg id="21">Gunter came to work in Iceland in May 2019, when no ambassador had been in the country since early 2017, for two years and four months, which is the longest example in Iceland.</seg>

        <seg id="9">Að minnsta kosti ekki virt það fyrir sér.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Verkið hefur hingað til verið nokkuð falið, beint fyrir framan það voru bílastæði sem voru alltaf umsetin.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Fólk lagði þar, læsti bílnum í snarhasti og stökk svo af stað að sinna erindum sínum í miðborginni.</seg>
        <seg id="12">„Lífleg og fjölbreytileg almenningsrými“ og „aðlaðandi borgarbragur“ eru leiðarljós við endurgerð Tryggvagötunnar sem nú stendur yfir.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Markmiðið er að fegra svæðið og leyfa mósaíkverki Gerðar Helgadóttur á Tollhúsinu að njóta sýn betur.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Framan við verkið verður torg og þar sem svæðið liggur vel við sólu er það talið henta vel sem dvalarsvæði fyrir vegfarendur.</seg>

        <seg id="16">Á svæðinu verða einnig litlir „þokuúðarar“, nokkurs konar vatnsskúlptúrar, sem bjóða upp á leik og veita svæðinu ákveðna dulúð.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Með þessum hætti er endurbótunum lýst af Reykjavíkurborg sem stendur að framkvæmdum ásamt Veitum.</seg>

        <seg id="19">Margar þeirra eru komnar til ára sinna, en skólplögnin og kaldavatnslögnin eru frá árinu 1925 og hafa því þjónað íbúum og fyrirtækjum í miðbænum í tæpa öld.</seg>

        <seg id="22">Í fróðleik um Tollhúsið á vef tollstjórans segir að húsið hafi verið tekið í notkun árið 1971 en arkitekt þess var Gísli Halldórsson.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Vegna þess að hafnarskemma náði í gegnum húsið myndaðist þar 250 fermetra gluggalaus veggflötur út að götu.</seg>
        <seg id="24">Byggingarnefnd og arkitekt voru sammála um að slíkur flötur myndi hafa slæm áhrif á heildargötumyndina, ef ekki væru gerðar sérstakar ráðstafanir til að prýða útlit hússins.</seg>
        <seg id="25">Aðilar urðu því sammála um að reikna með því að láta setja þarna upp varanlegt listaverk.</seg>

        <seg id="28">Afráðið var að hafa fyrst samband við hana áður en ákveðið yrði hvort efnt yrði til samkeppni um verkið.</seg>
        <seg id="29">Oft hafði verið rætt um að verkið þyrfti að spegla lífið við höfnina, enda hafði höfnin verið lífæð Reykjavíkur síðan hún var gerð.</seg>
        <seg id="30">Þegar rætt var við listakonuna varð hún að trax hugfangin af slíku verki.</seg>
        <seg id="31">Varð að samkomulagi að hún fengi teikningar og aðra aðstoð áður en hún færi aftur af landi brott, þar sem hún myndi vinna við tillögurnar erlendis.</seg>
        <seg id="32">Gerður fékk þann tíma sem hún ákvað sjálf að þyrfti, og þegar hún sneri aftur heim lagði hún nokkrar tillögur fram til umræðu.</seg>

        <seg id="34">Jafnframt var óskað eftir að gera heildarsamning við hana og hið fræga listaverkafyrirtæki í Þýskalandi, Bræðurna Oidtmann, en Gerður hafði lengi starfað með þeim að uppsetningu frægra listaverka víða um Evrópu.</seg>
        <seg id="35">Samningar tókust og Gerður vann listaverkið undir uppsetningu á verkstæði þeirra bræðra, sem sáu síðan um uppsetningu á Tollhúsið.</seg>

        <seg id="1">Gerður's mosaic will finally come into its own</seg>
        <seg id="2">There is a big and deep hole in front of the Customs House in Reykjavik.</seg>
        <seg id="3">In it are men with orange helmets.</seg>
        <seg id="4">There is also a big excavator there.</seg>
        <seg id="5">And other smaller machines.</seg>
        <seg id="6">The road is closed for traffic.</seg>
        <seg id="7">But the pavement is clear and many people now stop there to observe artwork made from millions of mosaic tiles  — like they have never seen it before.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Perhaps they never have seen it before.</seg>
        <seg id="9">At least not observed it.</seg>
        <seg id="10">The mural has been relatively hidden until now, right in front of it were parking spaces that were in constant demand.</seg>
        <seg id="11">People parked there, quickly locked their car and then rushed to perform their errands in the city centre.</seg>
        <seg id="12">"Lively and diverse public spaces" and "an attractive urban environment" are the guiding themes in the renovation of Tryggvagata that is currently underway.</seg>
        <seg id="13">The aim is to beautify the area and make Gerður Helgadóttir's mosaic on the Customs House more prominent.</seg>
        <seg id="14">There will be a square in front of the mural, and the site is considered well suited as a leisure area for pedestrians due to its advantageous sunlight position.</seg>
        <seg id="15">The mural will be illuminated, enabling a better appreciation of the material on this 142 square metre surface.</seg>
        <seg id="16">The site will also have small "fog sprinklers", a kind of water sculptures that provide an opportunity for play and lend the place a certain mystical air.</seg>
        <seg id="17">This is how the renovations are described by the City of Reykjavik, which is responsible for the project, along with Veitur.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Cold water, hot water and electrical utilities will be renewed.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Many of these are getting on in age, with the sewage and cold water pipelines dating from the year 1925, thus having served residents and businesses in the city centre for close to a century.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Cars will again be able to drive on the road when it will be reopened following the end of the construction project.</seg>
        <seg id="21">It will be a one-way street, however, which will also create a more tranquil and accessible space for pedestrians.</seg>
        <seg id="22">According to the information on the Customs House on the Directorate of Custom's website, the building, by architect Gísli Halldórsson, was taken into use in 1971.</seg>
        <seg id="23">As a dock warehouse extended through the building, there was a 250 square metre windowless wall surface facing the street.</seg>
        <seg id="24">The building committee and architect agreed that such a surface would have a negative effect on the overall look of the street if special measures were not made to decorate the building.</seg>
        <seg id="25">The parties therefore agreed to assume that permanent artwork would be installed there.</seg>
        <seg id="26">Gerður Helgadóttir had a great reputation as an artist during this period, according to the summary.</seg>
        <seg id="27">She had been heavily involved in making mosaics in Germany and other places.</seg>
        <seg id="28">A decision was made to contact her first, before deciding whether a competition for the project would be held.</seg>
        <seg id="29">It had often been noted that the artwork would have to reflect life at the harbour, as the harbour had been Reykjavik's lifeline ever since it was built.</seg>
        <seg id="30">When the artist was contacted, she was immediately captivated by the task.</seg>
        <seg id="31">It was agreed that she would receive drawings and other assistance before leaving the country again to work on the proposals abroad.</seg>
        <seg id="32">Gerður was given the time that she herself decided she needed and upon her return home, she submitted several proposals for discussion.</seg>
        <seg id="33">It was agreed without delay to ask her to carry out the task.</seg>
        <seg id="34">A request was also made to make a comprehensive agreement with her and the famous German art company Oidtmann Brothers, Gerður's long-time collaborators in installing renowned works of art all over Europe.</seg>
        <seg id="35">An agreement was reached, and Gerður prepared the mural for installation at the workshop of the brothers, who then oversaw the installation on the Customs House.</seg>
        <seg id="36">All the work was exceptionally well carried out, both by Gerður Helgadóttir and the Oidtmann Brothers, says the summary.</seg>
        <seg id="37">The mural has been able to withstand the harsh Icelandic climate ever since.</seg>
        <seg id="38">It took Gerður about two years to complete her mural, which was prepared and installed in the years 1972 and 1973.</seg>
        <seg id="39">The artist died two years after completing her Customs House mural, only 47-years old.</seg>

        <seg id="15">The artwork will be illuminated and will now enjoy the material better than before on these 142 square meters.</seg>
        <seg id="16">There will also be small "fog sprayers," a kind of water sculpture, that offer play and provide the area with a certain mystery.</seg>
        <seg id="17">In this way, the improvements are described by the city of Reykjavik, which is currently under construction with Veitum.</seg>
        <seg id="18">The pipes of the water supply, heating and electricity supply will be renewed.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Many of them have come to their own, but the school pipes and cold water pipes date back to 1925 and have therefore served residents and businesses in the city center for almost a century.</seg>
        <seg id="20">When the street is reopened after construction, cars can drive around it again.</seg>
        <seg id="21">However, it becomes a one-way street and at the same time creates quieter and more accessible spaces for pedestrians.</seg>
        <seg id="22">According to information about the Customs House on the website of the customs officer, the house was inaugurated in 1971, the architect of which was Gísli Halldórsson.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Because harbour damage reached through the house, a windowless wall area of 250 square meters was formed there to the street.</seg>
        <seg id="24">The building committee and the architect agreed that such a surface would have a bad effect on the overall street image if special measures were not taken to adorn the appearance of the house.</seg>
        <seg id="25">The parties therefore agreed to expect a permanent work of art to be installed there.</seg>
        <seg id="26">During this time, there was a lot of talk about artist Gerður Helgadóttir, says in the summary.</seg>
        <seg id="27">She had worked extensively on mosaic art in Germany and elsewhere.</seg>
        <seg id="28">It was decided to contact her first before deciding whether to hold a competition for the work.</seg>
        <seg id="29">It had often been said that the work had to reflect life at the harbor, as the harbor had been the life of Reykjavík since it was built.</seg>
        <seg id="30">When she talked to the artist, she became aware of such a work.</seg>
        <seg id="31">It had to be agreed that she would receive drawings and other assistance before leaving the country again, where she would work on the proposals abroad.</seg>
        <seg id="32">Gerður received the time she herself decided it would take, and when she returned home she submitted several proposals for discussion.</seg>
        <seg id="33">It was agreed without delay to ask her to do the work.</seg>
        <seg id="34">At the same time, it was requested to conclude a comprehensive contract with her and the famous art company in Germany, the Brothers Oidtmann, but Gerður had long worked with them on the installation of famous works of art across Europe.</seg>
        <seg id="35">Contracts were successful and Gerður worked the artwork under the installation of the workshop of the brothers, who were then in charge of the installation of the Customs House.</seg>
        <seg id="36">The whole work was carried out exceptionally well, both on the part of Gerður Helgadóttir and the Oidtmann brothers, the summary says.</seg>
        <seg id="37">It has since withstood the unpleasant Icelandic weather.</seg>
        <seg id="38">It took Gerði about two years to do the work, which was done and installed in 1972 and 1973.</seg>
        <seg id="39">The artist died two years after the Customs House was completed, at the age of 47.</seg>

        <seg id="2">The State Internal Revenue Board has rejected a claim from the Director of Tax Investigations demanding that a man be fined for underreporting capital income from sales of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.</seg>
        <seg id="3">The Board concludes that the Director of Tax Investigations has not provided clear arguments for the necessity of fining the man.</seg>
        <seg id="4">According to the Board's ruling, the Director of Tax Investigations believed that the man had filed materially false tax statements for the income years of 2016 and 2017.</seg>
        <seg id="5">He was said to have underreported financial income from sales of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin amounting to ISK 27 million, either intentionally or due to gross negligence.</seg>
        <seg id="6">The man should consequently be fined for his conduct.</seg>
        <seg id="7">The man rejected this in a letter to the Board.</seg>
        <seg id="8">He did, however, admit to selling cryptocurrency for ISK 27 million in 2016.</seg>
        <seg id="9">He said that he acquired this cryptocurrency through mining in the years 2009 and 2010, at a time when this could be done both easily and inexpensively with an ordinary home computer.</seg>
        <seg id="10">He also pointed out that when he sold the cryptocurrency, the administration of taxes for such sales was highly ambiguous and unpredictable.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Members of the general public could hardly have been expected to be aware of such arrangements in their tax statement.</seg>
        <seg id="12">He said that he did not intend to avoid paying taxes on his harvesting and that he had reported his asset in the statement as a deposit in a currency account.</seg>
        <seg id="13">He had asked both experts and the Directorate of Internal Revenue about the arrangement for this but to no avail.</seg>
        <seg id="14">He furthermore believed that the fact that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland, and had only lived here for a few years when he began mining for Bitcoin, must be taken into account.</seg>
        <seg id="15">That meant that he was in a worse position than others to familiarise himself with complex rules on which the tax authorities had not formed a clear opinion.</seg>
        <seg id="16">The man therefore considered it appropriate for his taxes for these two income years to be reassessed and a surcharge applied, but that no other penalties should be imposed.</seg>
        <seg id="17">He reiterated that he worked in Iceland and had paid taxes in this country since 2012.</seg>

        <seg id="2">Í rúmt ár hefur Bjartmar Leósson átt sér áhugamál ólíkt flestum öðrum.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Hann þefar upp og bjargar týndum og stolnum reiðhjólum, rafhjólum og vespum.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Hefur Bjartmar áunnið sér nafnið „hjólahvíslarinn“ fyrir vikið.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Í gær varð svo uppi talsvert fjaðrafok þegar maður birti frásögn af samskiptum sínum við Bjartmar.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Vísaði DV þá í umræður á Facebook hóp Vesturbæinga þar sem fram kom að Bjartmar hafi tekið manninn á tal á Austurvelli og sagt vespuna mögulega vera stolna.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Var ekki annað hægt að lesa úr upphaflegu skrifum rafskutlumannsins en að Bjartmar hafi þjófkennt hann.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Þeim texta hefur nú verið breytt á Facebook og fyrirsögn upphaflegu fréttar DV uppfærð í samræmi við það.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Bjartmar segir upphaflegar fréttir af málinu alls ekki lýsandi fyrir það sem raunverulega gekk á í gær á Austurvelli.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Bjartmar sagðist hafa fengið upplýsingar frá fórnarlambi rafskutlustuldar um að þetta væru sannarlega sín rafskutla.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Þær upplýsingar fékk meintur eigandi frá öðrum, en upplýsingarnar reyndust rangar segir Bjartmar.</seg>
        <seg id="12">„Ég sá til gaursins og ég kannaðist við skutluna, enda með upplýsingar um að þarna væri rafskutla sem hafði verið saknað mjög lengi og leitað hafi verið að.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Ég hikaði vissulega fyrst, en þegar ég sá hann búa sig undir að aka af stað á skutlunni ákveð ég að kýla á að ræða við manninn.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Eigandinn var viss í sinni sök og ákvað ég því að eiga samtal við manninn.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Almennt fer ég mjög fínt í svona mál, en áður en ég náði að klára það sem ég hafði að segja hafði maðurinn tekið af mér orðið.“</seg>
        <seg id="16">Bjartmar segir að maðurinn á rafskutlunni hafi undir eins boðið honum að sýna honum kvittunina fyrir hjólinu og hafi sjálfur kallað til lögreglu.</seg>
        <seg id="17">„Já, flott,“ sagði Bjartmar, „fáum þetta bara á hreint.“</seg>
        <seg id="18">Svo fór að eigandi rafskutlunnar sannaði eignarhald á rafskutlunni sinni og ók af stað.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Síðar sagði réttur eigandi rafskutlunnar frá sögu sinni á Facebook, líkt og greindi frá í fyrri frétt.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Á þessu rúmu ári sem Bjartmar hefur lagt stund á þessa iðkun sína segist hann geta talið skiptin sem hann lenti upp á kant við fólk á fingrum annarar handar.</seg>
        <seg id="21">„Ég hef átt í friðsamlegum samskiptum við erfiðustu menn Reykjavíkur,“ sagði Bjartmar og bendir á að reiðhjólaþjófar séu langoftast minnstu bræður og systur samfélagsins, fíklar, geðfatlað fólk og annað fólk sem einhverra hluta vegna er á götunni.</seg>
        <seg id="22">„Fíknin er harður húsbóndi og einhvernveginn þarf að fjármagna næsta skammt, því miður er þjófnaður á svona lausafjármunum auðveld leið að því markmiði,“ segir Bjartmar.</seg>
        <seg id="23">„Samskipti mín við þetta fólk eru í raun svo góð að ég er komin með margt af því góða fólki með mér í lið.</seg>
        <seg id="24">Dæmi eru um að fólk hafi farið í meðferð og tekið sig á og leitað svo til mín og aðstoðað mig við það sem ég er að gera,“ segir hann.</seg>
        <seg id="25">Almennt séu samskipti Bjartmars við reiðhjólafólk á kurteisislegum nótum.</seg>
        <seg id="26">Sumir vita af honum og hvað hann er að gera og bjóðast friðsællega til þess að sýna honum kvittanir, stellnúmer hjóla og svo framvegis.</seg>
        <seg id="27">Reiðhjólaþjófnaður sé stórt vandamál sem lítið hefur verið fjallað um.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Ennfremur segir Bjartmar að lögreglan sé meira að segja farin að benda fólki á að tala við hann útaf stolnum reiðhjólum.</seg>
        <seg id="29">Bjartmar er ósáttur við fyrri fréttaflutning DV og segist ekki vera eitthverskonar sjálfskipuð lögregla í persónulegri leit að réttvísinni.</seg>
        <seg id="30">Aðspurður hvort hann sé nú samt ekki kominn á hálan ís með athæfi sínu, og hvort þetta sé ekki fyrst og fremst hlutverk lögreglu, segir Bjartmar svo vissulega vera.</seg>
        <seg id="31">„Auðvitað á löggan að gera þetta, en staðreynd málsins er að löggan er hreinlega ekki að sinna þessu.</seg>
        <seg id="32">Ég hef til að mynda horft upp á lögreglumenn keyra í burtu frá stórri hrúgu af stolnum hjólum.</seg>
        <seg id="33">Hún er hreint út sagt grútmáttlaus í þessum málum.“</seg>
        <seg id="34">„Þegar löggan er ekki að gera neitt í þessu, og þetta er bara fyrir framan nefið á þér, og reynslan hefur sýnt að ég get náð árangri í þessum málaflokki, þá afhverju ekki?“ spyr Bjartmar.</seg>
        <seg id="35">Hann segist hafa náð svo miklum árangri í að hafa uppi á stolnum hjólum, að stundum rekist hann á sína „skjólstæðinga“ á götunni að þá hafi þeir bara rétt Bjartmari hjólin sem þeir höfðu áður náð sér í.</seg>
        <seg id="36">Þau skipti sem Bjartmar hefur kallað eftir aðstoð lögreglu hefur komið fyrir að hún hreinlega mæti ekki.</seg>
        <seg id="37">„Þetta er bara ekki að virka með lögregluna, og það er ekki mér að kenna og það er ekki eigendum reiðhjólanna að kenna,“ sagði Bjartmar og þykir það leitt að fórnarlömb reiðhjólaþjófnaða þurfi að líða fyrir tómlæti lögreglu í þessum málaflokki.</seg>
        <seg id="38">Um árangur Bjartmars er ekki deilt.</seg>
        <seg id="39">Víða má finna sögur af fólki þakka Bjartmari fyrir að hafa náð eigum sínum til þeirra aftur.</seg>
        <seg id="40">Sjálfur segir Bjartmar löngu vera búinn að týna tölunni á fjölda reiðhjóla sem hann hefur skilað, en upphæðirnir hlaupi sjálfsagt á milljónum, ef ekki milljónatugum.</seg>
        <seg id="41">Vega þar rafmagnsvespur, rafhjól og rafmagnsskutlur þungt, en rafhjól getur kostað upp undir hálfa milljón.</seg>

        <seg id="10">Bjartmar said that he received information from the victim of an electric scooter theft that this was certainly his electric scooter.</seg>
        <seg id="11">This was information that the alleged owner received from someone else, but this information turned out to be wrong, says Bjartmar.</seg>
        <seg id="12">"I saw the guy and the scooter was familiar to me, as I had information that this was an electric scooter that had been missing and searched for for a very long time.</seg>
        <seg id="13">I was certainly hesitant at first, but when I saw him prepare to drive away on the scooter, I decided to take the plunge and talk to the man.</seg>
        <seg id="14">The owner was certain in his belief so I decided to have a conversation with the man.</seg>
        <seg id="15">I'm generally very subtle in such matters, but before I could finish what I had to say, the man had interrupted me."</seg>
        <seg id="16">Bjartmar says that the man on the electric scooter immediately offered to show him the receipt for the scooter and called the police himself.</seg>
        <seg id="17">"Yes, great," said Bjartmar, "let's just get this sorted."</seg>
        <seg id="18">The owner of the electric scooter eventually proved his ownership and rode away.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Later, the actual owner of the electric scooter told his story on Facebook, as was detailed in the previous report.</seg>
        <seg id="20">In the more than a year that Bjartmar has been doing this, he says he can count on the fingers of one hand the times he got into altercations with people.</seg>
        <seg id="21">"I have had peaceful interactions with Reykjavik's most difficult men," said Bjartmar and points out that in the vast majority of cases, bicycle thieves are society's most vulnerable brothers and sisters, addicts, people with mental disorders and people who are on the street for some reason.</seg>
        <seg id="22">"Addiction is a merciless taskmaster, the next fix must be funded somehow and unfortunately, stealing these kinds of movable properties is an easy way to reach that goal," says Bjartmar.</seg>
        <seg id="23">"In fact, my interactions with these people are actually so good that many of these good people are now on my side.</seg>
        <seg id="24">There are examples of people going to rehab and straightening themselves out and then coming to me to assist me in what I'm doing," he says.</seg>
        <seg id="25">He says that his interactions with cyclists are generally polite.</seg>
        <seg id="26">Some are aware of him and what he's doing and volunteer peacefully to show him receipts, bicycle frame numbers, etc.</seg>
        <seg id="27">Bicycle theft is a big problems that has been little reported, he says.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Bjartmar adds that the police is even beginning to advise people to talk to him about stolen bicycles.</seg>
        <seg id="29">Bjartmar is displeased with DV's previous reporting and says that he not some kind of vigilante on a personal quest for justice.</seg>
        <seg id="30">When asked whether he isn't going too far in his activities, and whether this is not first and foremost the role of the police, Bjartmar says that that is certainly the case.</seg>
        <seg id="31">"Of course the cops should do this, but the fact of the matter is that the cops are simply not tending to this.</seg>
        <seg id="32">I have seen policemen drive away from a large pile of stolen bicycles, for example.</seg>
        <seg id="33">They are completely useless in these matters, to tell you the truth."</seg>
        <seg id="34">"When the cops aren't doing anything about this, and it's just right in front of you and experience has shown that I can get results in these cases, then why not?" asks Bjartmar.</seg>
        <seg id="35">He says that he has been so successful in finding lost bicycles that sometimes when he has run into his "protégés" on the street, they have simply handed the bicycles that they had snatched over to Bjartmar.</seg>
        <seg id="36">In the instances when Bjartmar has requested assistance from the police, they have sometimes simply not shown up.</seg>
        <seg id="37">"It's just not working with the police, and it's not my fault and it's not the fault of the bicycle owners," said Bjartmar, who is sorry that victims of bicycle theft have to suffer the disinterest of police when it comes to this issue.</seg>
        <seg id="38">Bjartmar's success rate is undisputable.</seg>
        <seg id="39">Stories from people thanking Bjartmar for retrieving their properties are rampant.</seg>
        <seg id="40">Bjartmar himself says that he has long ago lost count of the bicycles that he has returned, but that the amounts are probably in the millions, if not the tens of millions.</seg>
        <seg id="41">That is largely due to electric scooters, e-bikes and mobility scooters, with electric bikes sometimes costing up to half a million.</seg>
        <seg id="42">Bjartmar works at a preschool during the day and at a group home every other weekend.</seg>
        <seg id="43">His search for bicycles is therefore unpaid work that he undertakes in his spare time.</seg>

        <seg id="21">"I have had peaceful relations with the hardest people in Reykjavík," said Bjartmar, pointing out that bicycle thieves are by far the smallest brothers and sisters in society, addicts, mentally ill people and other people who for some reason are on the street.</seg>
        <seg id="22">"Addiction is a hard master and somehow the next dose has to be financed, unfortunately theft of such liquidity is an easy path to the goal," says Bjartmar.</seg>

        <seg id="30">When asked if he is still not on thin ice with his actions, and if this is not primarily the role of the police, Bjartmar says that he certainly is.</seg>
        <seg id="31">"Of course the police should do this, but the fact is that the police are simply not doing this.</seg>
        <seg id="32">I have, for example, watched police officers drive away from a large pile of stolen bikes.</seg>

        <seg id="36">The time that Bjartmar has called for police assistance has come for her to simply not show up.</seg>
        <seg id="37">"It's just not working with the police, and it's not my fault and it's not the owners of the bikes," Bjartmar said," and it's sorry that the victims of bike thefts have to feel the emptiness of the police in this area.</seg>
        <seg id="38">The success of Bjartmars is not disputed.</seg>

        <seg id="2">For over a year, Bjartmar Leósson has had a hobby unlike most others.</seg>
        <seg id="3">He sniffs up and rescues lost and stolen bicycles, electric bikes and purses.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Has Bjartmar earned the name “the wheel whisperer” by now.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Yesterday, there was such a significant amount of suspense when you published a report of your dealings with Bjartmar.</seg>
        <seg id="6">DV then referenced discussions on Vesturbæingar Facebook group, stating that Bjartmar took the man to speak in Austurvöllur and said the purse was possibly stolen.</seg>
        <seg id="7">There was no other way to read from the original writings of the electrocutor but that Bjartmar tipped him off.</seg>
        <seg id="8">That text has now been changed on Facebook and the headline of the original DV news updated accordingly.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Bjartmar says the initial news of the case is not at all representative of what actually went on yesterday in Austurvöllur.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Bjartmar said he was informed by the victim of electrocution that these were indeed his electrodes.</seg>
        <seg id="11">That information was allegedly given to the owner by others, but the information turned out to be false says Bjartmar.</seg>
        <seg id="12">“I saw the guy and I recognized the shuttle, as there was information that there was an electrical shuttle that had been missing for a very long time and that was searched for.</seg>
        <seg id="13">I certainly hesitated first, but when I saw him preparing to drive off on the shuttle, I decide to punch talk with the man.</seg>
        <seg id="14">The owner was sure of it, so I decided to have a conversation with the man.</seg>
        <seg id="15">In general, I am very nice about this kind of thing, but before I could finish what I had to say, the man had taken off the word.”</seg>
        <seg id="16">Bjartmar says the man on the electric scooter immediately invited him to show him the receipt for the bike and called police himself.</seg>
        <seg id="17">“Yes, cool,” Bjartmar said, “let’s just get it straight.”</seg>
        <seg id="18">Then, the owner of the electric shuttle proved ownership of his shuttle and drove off.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Later, the rightful owner of the electrocution told his story on Facebook, as reported in an earlier story.</seg>
        <seg id="20">In this more than a year that Bjartmar has indulged in this practice, he says he can count the times he got up against people on the fingers of one hand.</seg>
        <seg id="21">“I have had peaceful relations with Reykjavík’s hardest men,” Bjartmar said, pointing out that bicycle thieves are by far the smallest brothers and sisters in society, addicts, people with mental disabilities and other people who for some reason are on the street.</seg>
        <seg id="22">“The addict is a hard master and somehow the next dose needs to be funded, unfortunately the theft of such loot is an easy way to accomplish that goal,” says Bjartmar.</seg>
        <seg id="23">“My relations with these people are really so good that I have brought many of the good people with me.</seg>
        <seg id="24">There are examples of people going to therapy and taking it on and then looking to me and helping me with what I'm doing," he says.</seg>
        <seg id="25">In general, Bjartmar’s interactions with bicycle people are on a courteous note.</seg>
        <seg id="26">Some people know about him and what he is doing and peacefully offer to show him receipts, ­numbers of bikes and so on.</seg>
        <seg id="27">Bicycle theft is a big problem that hasn't been addressed much.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Furthermore, Bjartmar says that the police are even beginning to point out people talking to him about stolen bicycles.</seg>
        <seg id="29">Bjartmar is unconvinced by DV’s earlier press and says he is not some sort of self-appointed police officer in a personal search for justice.</seg>
        <seg id="30">Asked whether he is now still not on the slippery slope with his act, and whether this is not primarily the role of police, Bjartmar certainly is.</seg>
        <seg id="31">“Of course the cops should do this, but the fact of the matter is that the cops are honestly not doing this.</seg>
        <seg id="32">I have, for example, watched police drive away from a large pile of stolen bikes.</seg>
        <seg id="33">She’s clean-shaven in these cases.”</seg>
        <seg id="34">“When the cops aren’t doing anything about this, and this is just in front of your nose, and experience has shown that I can succeed in this area, then why not?” asks Bjartmar.</seg>
        <seg id="35">He says he has had so much success tracking down stolen bikes, that sometimes he bumps into his “clients” on the street that they just handed the Brighter bikes they had previously caught.</seg>
        <seg id="36">The times that Bjartmar has called for police help have happened to be that she honestly doesn’t show up.</seg>
        <seg id="37">“It’s just not working with the police, and it’s not my fault, and it’s not the bike owners’ fault,” Bjartmar said, “and it’s sorry that victims of bicycle theft have to suffer from police indifference in this area.”</seg>
        <seg id="38">Bjartmar’s success is not shared.</seg>
        <seg id="39">You can find stories of people thanking Brighter for getting their belongings back to them.</seg>
        <seg id="40">Bjartmar himself says he has long lost count of the number of bicycles he has returned, but the sums probably run into millions, if not millions.</seg>
        <seg id="41">Weigh in on electric scooters, electric bikes and electric scooters heavily, while electric bikes can cost upwards of half a million.</seg>
        <seg id="42">Bright works day to day kindergarten and every other weekend he works in a community.</seg>

        <seg id="2">Árið 2019 var mikið afmælisár í sögu lífeyrissjóða á Íslandi.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Embættismenn höfðu að vísu fengið eftirlaun frá Danakonungi allar götur frá 19. öld, en árið 1919 var stofnaður lífeyrissjóður embættismanna sem varð að lokum að lífeyrissjóði allra opinberra starfsmanna.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Grundvöllurinn að núverandi lífeyrissjóðum almennra launamanna var síðan lagður með allsherjar kjarasamningum á vinnumarkaði árið 1969 þar sem kveðið var á um atvinnutengda lífeyrissjóði með skylduaðild og fullgildri sjóðsöfnun frá ársbyrjun 1970.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Árið 1974 voru svo sett lög á grundvelli þessara samninga og lífeyriskerfið hélt áfram að eflast eftir það.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Lífeyriskerfi launamanna var ekki eina róttæka breytingin sem verkalýðshreyfing 20. aldar knúði fram með kjarabaráttu sinni.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Atvinnuleysistryggingar höfðu fengist með svipuðum hætti í sögufrægum verkfallsátökum árið 1955, og einnig fengu samtökin smám saman framgengt kröfum sínum um veikindarétt og sjúkrasjóði, veruleg orlofsréttindi, styttingu vinnutímans, umbætur í húsnæðismálum og fleira slíkt sem miklu skipti.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Öll þessi réttindi kostuðu mikla og stranga baráttu en reyndust, eftir á að hyggja, miklu meiri og varanlegri kjarabót en fjölgun auranna í launaumslaginu, sem hvarf jafnharðan í hít verðbólgunnar sem einkenndi tímabilið eftir stríð og fram til 1990 eins og margir muna.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Aðdragandinn að stofnun almennra lífeyrissjóða árið 1969 var bæði langur og flókinn.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Þó að mönnum kæmi að lokum saman um að sjóðirnir yrðu í reynd eign sjóðsfélaga varð verkalýðshreyfingin að fallast á að stjórnir þeirra skyldu skipaðar fulltrúum atvinnurekenda og sjóðsfélaga til jafns.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Á næstu árum eftir stofnun sjóðanna kom krafan um meirihluta verkafólks í stjórn sjóðanna oft til umræðu í samtökum launþega en hún náði þó aldrei fram að ganga, og því sitjum við enn uppi með það óeðlilega fyrirkomulag að fulltrúar sjóðsfélaga eru ekki í meirihluta í stjórnum sjóðanna.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Í 36. grein laga nr. 129/1997 um skyldutryggingu lífeyrisréttinda og starfsemi lífeyrissjóða er fjallað um fjárfestingarstefnu sjóðanna.</seg>

        <seg id="1">Pension funds and long shadows</seg>
        <seg id="2">2019 was a major anniversary year in the history of Icelandic pension funds.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Public officials had in fact received a pension from the King of Denmark ever since the 19th century, but 1919 saw the founding of a pension fund for public officials, which eventually became a pension fund for all public-sector employees.</seg>
        <seg id="4">The foundations for the present-day pension funds for general wage earners were laid with the collective wage agreements on the labour market in 1969, which provided for fully funded mandatory occupational pension funds from the beginning of 1970.</seg>
        <seg id="5">In 1974, laws were established on the basis of these agreements, after which the pension fund system continued to strengthen.</seg>
        <seg id="6">A pension fund system for wage earners was not the only radical change that the 20th century labour movement enforced through its fight for improved employment conditions.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Unemployment insurance had been secured by similar means in the historic strike of 1955, and the movement gradually also achieved its demands for sickness rights and sickness funds, significant vacation rights, reduced working hours, improved housing and other such important matters.</seg>
        <seg id="8">All these rights were the result of a long and difficult struggle but proved, in retrospect, to be a much more significant and permanent improvement of employment terms than adding a few coins to the pay envelope, which were immediately lost to the inflation that characterised the post-war period until 1990, as many will remember.</seg>
        <seg id="9">The backstory to the founding of general pension funds in 1969 is both long and complex.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Although it was eventually agreed that the funds would in fact be owned by the fund members, the labour movement had to agree to the boards of the funds being composed of an equal number of representatives of employers and fund members.</seg>
        <seg id="11">In the years following the establishment of the funds, the demand for a majority of workers on the boards of the funds was often discussed in employees' organisations but never became an actuality, so we are still stuck with the unnatural arrangement of fund member representatives not being in the majority on the boards of the funds.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Article 36 of Act no. 129/1997 on Mandatory Pension Insurance and on the Activities of Pension Funds pertains to the investment policy of the funds.</seg>
        <seg id="13">According to Item 1, "a pension fund must be guided by the interests of fund members".</seg>
        <seg id="14">Item 5 furthermore reads: "A pension fund must establish ethical criteria for its investments."</seg>
        <seg id="15">The shareholder policy of the Pension Fund of Commerce includes the following provisions, following the aforementioned legal provisions:</seg>
        <seg id="16">The Pension Fund is a signatory of the UN Principles for Responsible Investment (UN PRI), as are many of the largest pension funds and institutional investors in North America and Europe.</seg>
        <seg id="17">These principles discuss how emphasis on social and environmental issues, together with good corporate governance, can improve returns on investment portfolios.</seg>
        <seg id="18">In this manner the interests of investors and the objectives of society in a broader perspective go hand in hand.</seg>
        <seg id="19">LV considers it important for companies, especially those publicly listed on an equity market, to adopt official policies on practising good corporate governance, remuneration, social responsibility and environment issues.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Gildi Pension Fund, which is among Iceland's biggest funds, has established a "policy on responsible investments" which includes provisions of a similar nature.</seg>
        <seg id="21">All this is recollected here as an introduction to the latest buzz word in Icelandic, "shadow direction".</seg>
        <seg id="22">As the word is a new one in the language, it has understandably not been fully defined, but it seems to me like the following definition is currently the "most popular pick": Shadow direction is when a trade union leader proclaims in the media that they will give the union's representatives on the board of a pension fund recommendations or instructions on what position to take on a particular matter.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Failure to follow the recommendation would result in dismissal from the board at the first opportunity.</seg>
        <seg id="24">However, this is not "shadow direction" if the leader does not take this to the media or talk about dismissal, as such communications between people are of course common in the financial world, like elsewhere.</seg>
        <seg id="25">I leave it to the reader to decide which method is more "shadowy".</seg>
        <seg id="26">At the time of writing, on the morning of Saturday, 25 July 2019, there are mainly two men who have tried to shape this definition.</seg>
        <seg id="27">They are Hörður Ægisson, reporter at Fréttablaðið, and Central Bank Governor Ásgeir Jónsson.</seg>
        <seg id="28">For both of them, the motive arose when Bogi Nils Bogason, CEO of Icelandair, had told of his intention to terminate the company's agreements with airline hostesses and flight attendants (dismiss them), and Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, Chairman of VR, recommended that the union's representatives on the board of the Pension Fund of Commerce refrained from supporting any purchase of the company's shares by the fund, or else they may be made to step down.</seg>
        <seg id="29">Some time later, Bogi Nils withdrew his decision and Ragnar Þór subsequently did the same with his recommendation, which was of course based on Bogi's decision.</seg>
        <seg id="30">Hörður and Ásgeir nevertheless saw reason to expound on the matter in Fréttablaðið's Friday edition, using big words on shadow direction, illegal acts and the urgent need for legal amendments.</seg>
        <seg id="31">This was truly a molehill that was to be made into a mountain, even though the molehill in question was conditional as well as being quickly removed.</seg>
        <seg id="32">Finally, let's consider the subject itself, as it is an important one.</seg>
        <seg id="33">Above, I noted the provisions of the Pension Fund Act that pertain to this issue.</seg>
        <seg id="34">They say that the boards of pension funds are obliged to protect the interests of fund members and have ethical investment criteria, and these provisions are further elaborated in the Articles of Association of both Gildi and the Pension Fund of Commerce, as I have noted.</seg>
        <seg id="35">On the other hand, pension fund are NOT supposed to only consider short-term profitability in their investments.</seg>
        <seg id="36">In fact, such a policy would be very dangerous, and one would not have to look long for such examples in the past, where big loans from banks and funds have gone to unethical speculators and environmental polluters, with terrible consequences.</seg>
        <seg id="37">The CEO of Icelandair was obviously on thin ice when he got the idea to wipe out an entire group of employees, thus significantly reducing the goodwill that the company has enjoyed in the Icelandic market and weakening its position towards investors.</seg>
        <seg id="38">Fortunately, he reconsidered and reversed this.</seg>
        <seg id="39">Time will tell whether that will be enough, when all is said and done, for pension fund investment in the company to be considered responsible towards the fund members.</seg>

        <seg id="22">As the word is new in the matter, there is no hope that it has been fully defined, but it seems to me that the following definition is now "most widely taken": Shadow management is when a union leader says in the media that he intends to send recommendations or instructions to members of the Pension Fund Board on how to take a position on a particular matter.</seg>

        <seg id="24">However, if the leader does not deal with this in the media and does not talk about dismissal, it is not "shadow management," as this kind of communication between people is of course common in the financial world, as elsewhere.</seg>
        <seg id="25">I leave the reader to reflect on which way he thinks is "more shady."</seg>
        <seg id="26">In particular, there are two people who have attempted to formulate this definition at the time of writing, on the morning of Saturday 25 July 2020.</seg>

        <seg id="1">Pension funds and long shadows</seg>
        <seg id="2">2019 was a milestone year in the history of pension funds in Iceland.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Although civil servants had been receiving pensions from the King of Denmark since the 19th century, in 1919 a civil servants' pension fund was established, which eventually became the pension fund for all civil servants.</seg>
        <seg id="4">The basis for the current pension funds of ordinary employees was then laid by the general collective agreements on the labour market in 1969, which provided for occupational pension funds with compulsory membership and full fund collection from the beginning of 1970.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Legislation based on these agreements was passed in 1974, and the pension system continued to grow thereafter.</seg>
        <seg id="6">The workers' pension system was not the only radical change brought about by the trade union movement in the 20th century.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Unemployment insurance had been won in a similar way in the historic strike battles of 1955, and the unions also gradually won their demands for sick leave and health funds, substantial holiday entitlements, shorter working hours, housing reform and much more.</seg>
        <seg id="8">All these rights cost a great and rigorous struggle, but proved, in retrospect, to be a much greater and more lasting improvement than the increase in the amount of money in the wage bill, which disappeared just as hard in the heat of the inflation that characterized the post-war period and up to 1990, as many people remember.</seg>
        <seg id="9">The lead-up to the establishment of public pension funds in 1969 was both long and complex.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Although it was eventually agreed that the funds would in fact become the property of the fund members, the trade union movement had to agree that their boards should be made up of representatives of employers and fund members alike.</seg>
        <seg id="11">In the years following the establishment of the funds, the requirement for a majority of workers on the board of the funds was often discussed in the employees' association, but it never came to pass, and so we are still stuck with the abnormal arrangement that representatives of the fund members are not in the majority on the boards of the funds.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Article 36 of Act No. 129/1997 on compulsory pension insurance and the operation of pension funds deals with the investment policy of the funds.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Point 1 states that "a pension fund shall be guided by the interests of its members."</seg>
        <seg id="14">Point 5 also states: "The pension fund shall set ethical standards for its investments."</seg>
        <seg id="15">The shareholders' policy of the Merchants' Pension Fund includes the following provisions, in addition to the aforementioned legal provisions:</seg>
        <seg id="16">The pension fund is a signatory to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UN PRI), along with many of the largest pension funds and institutional investors in the West and Europe.</seg>
        <seg id="17">The rules address how a focus on environmental and social issues, as well as good corporate governance, can help improve the investment performance of portfolios.</seg>
        <seg id="18">In this way, the interests of investors and the goals of society as a whole are aligned.</seg>
        <seg id="19">LV believes that it is important for companies, especially those listed on the stock market, to set a public policy on: good corporate governance, social responsibility and environmental issues.</seg>
        <seg id="20">The Gildi pension fund, one of the largest in the country, has adopted a "responsible investment policy" with similar provisions.</seg>
        <seg id="21">It's all recalled here as an introduction to Iceland's latest buzzword, "shadow management."</seg>
        <seg id="22">Since the word is new in the case, there is no hope that it has been fully defined, but it seems to me that the following definition is now "most accepted": Shadow management is when a union leader says in the media that he is going to send recommendations or instructions to the company's representatives on the board of the pension fund about how they should take a position on a particular issue.</seg>
        <seg id="23">If they do not comply, they will be removed from the board at the earliest convenience.</seg>
        <seg id="24">If the leader does not take this to the media and does not talk about dismissal, however, it is not "shadow management," since such communication between people is, of course, common in the financial world as elsewhere.</seg>
        <seg id="25">I leave it to the reader to ponder which path he finds "shadier."</seg>
        <seg id="26">There are two men in particular who have tried to shape that definition as of this writing, on the morning of Saturday, July 25, 2020.</seg>
        <seg id="27">They are Hörður Ægisson, a journalist at Fréttablaðið, and Ásgeir Jónsson, the Governor of the Central Bank.</seg>
        <seg id="28">The occasion for both arose after Bogi Nils Bogason, CEO of Icelandair, had announced his intention to terminate the company's contracts with flight attendants and flight attendants (dismiss them), and Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, chairman of the Reykjavik Merchants' Association, then sent out the recommendation to the company's representative on the board of the Merchants' Pension Fund not to support the fund's possible purchase of shares in the company, otherwise they might be dismissed.</seg>
        <seg id="29">Some time later, Bogi Nils withdrew his decision, and subsequently Ragnar Þór went the same way with his recommendation, which of course was based on Bogi's decision.</seg>
        <seg id="30">Nevertheless, Hörður and Ásgeir saw a reason to discuss the matter in the Friday edition of Fréttablaðið with big words about shadow management, lawbreaking and the need for changes in the law.</seg>
        <seg id="31">There, a small number of people really had to cast a heavy vote, even though the blessed thousands had been in attendance and were also quickly wiped out.</seg>
        <seg id="32">Since the subject is important, let's consider the subject itself at the end.</seg>
        <seg id="33">I have already mentioned the aspects of the law on pension funds that are relevant to this issue.</seg>
        <seg id="34">This means that fund managers must protect the interests of fund members and have ethical standards in investments, and these points are elaborated in more detail in the statutes of both Gildis and the Merchants' Pension Fund, as I mentioned.</seg>
        <seg id="35">However, pension funds should NOT look only at the short-term profitability of their investments.</seg>
        <seg id="36">This would be a very dangerous policy, and one does not have to look far for examples of this in the past, where large loans from banks and funds have gone to unscrupulous adventurers and environmentalists, with disastrous consequences.</seg>
        <seg id="37">The CEO of Icelandair was obviously on thin ice when he came up with the idea of wiping out an entire group of employees, thereby significantly reducing the goodwill that the company has enjoyed in the Icelandic market and weakening its position with investors.</seg>
        <seg id="38">Fortunately, he saw sense and withdrew it.</seg>
        <seg id="39">Time will tell whether this is enough for the pension funds' investment in the company to be considered responsible towards the fund members in the end.</seg>

        <seg id="6">The workers' pension system was not the only radical change that the 20th century labor movement brought about with its wage struggles.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Unemployment insurance had been similar in the history of the strike in 1955, and the organization gradually implemented its requirements for sickness and sickness funds, significant leave rights, reduced working hours, improvements in housing and more as a matter of urgency.</seg>
        <seg id="8">All these rights were a great and difficult struggle but, in retrospect, proved to be a much greater and more lasting benefit than the increase in the pay gap, which disappeared as hard as the inflation that characterised the period after the war and until 1990, as many remember.</seg>
        <seg id="9">The process of establishing a general pension fund in 1969 was long and complicated.</seg>
        <seg id="10">While people eventually agreed that the funds would be the property of fund members, the union movement had to agree that their boards should be composed of representatives of employers and fund members equally.</seg>

        <seg id="29">Some time later, Bogi Nils withdrew his decision and subsequently Ragnar Thor went the same way with his recommendations, which were, of course, aimed at Bogi's decision.</seg>
        <seg id="30">Nevertheless, Hörður and Ásgeir saw reason to talk about the case in the Friday newspaper Fréttablaðið with big words about shadow management, violation of the law and a rich need for changes to the law.</seg>
        <seg id="31">There was certainly a small thump to overturn a heavy load even though the blessed thump had been in a connection mode and was also quickly wiped out.</seg>
        <seg id="32">Since the issue is important, let's consider the substance itself in the end.</seg>
        <seg id="33">I previously discussed the issues of the Pension Funds Act relating to this matter.</seg>
        <seg id="34">This means that fund managers should protect the interests of fund members and have ethical investment criteria, and these issues are further elaborated in the statutes of both Gildis and Lífeyrissjóður merchants as I mentioned.</seg>
        <seg id="35">However, pension funds should NOT look only at short-term profitability considerations in their investments.</seg>
        <seg id="36">This would be a highly dangerous policy and need not look long for examples of this in the past, as large lending by banks and funds has flowed to unethical adventurers and environmental codes, with disastrous consequences.</seg>
        <seg id="37">The CEO of Icelandair was obviously on slippery ice when he thought of wiping out a whole group of employees, thus significantly reducing the benevolence the company has enjoyed in the Icelandic market and weakening its position towards investors.</seg>
        <seg id="38">Fortunately, he saw in and withdrew this.</seg>
        <seg id="39">Time reveals whether this is enough for the investment of pension funds in the company to be considered liable to members at the end of the day.</seg>

        <seg id="1">Pension funds and long shadows</seg>
        <seg id="2">The year 2019 was much the anniversary of a year in the history of the pension funds in the united states.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Officials had admittedly received a pension from the King of all the streets from the 19th. century, but in 1919 was constituted the pension fund officials who eventually became to the pension fund all public sector employees.</seg>
        <seg id="4">The basis of the existing pension funds of ordinary salaried employees was subsequently charged with the hosts collective bargaining in the labor market in 1969 which provides a work pension fund with compulsory membership and fullgildri sjóðsöfnun from the beginning of the 1970s.</seg>
        <seg id="5">In 1974 there were so put the law on the basis of these agreements and pension system continued to grow stronger after it.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Pension system salaried employees was not the only radical change verkalýðshreyfing 20. century knocked out by kjarabaráttu time.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Unemployment insurance had been obtained by similar means in the legendary verkfallsátökum in 1955, and also received the organization gradually they wanted their claims about veikindarétt and your sickness fund, a significant orlofsréttindi, shortening vinnutímans, reform in housing and more such as a great replacement.</seg>
        <seg id="8">All of these rights are cost intensive and strict struggle but proved, in retrospect, much greater, and more permanent kjarabót but propagation auranna in launaumslaginu, which disappeared jafnharðan in hít of inflation that characterized the period after the war and until the early 1990s, as many remember.</seg>
        <seg id="9">The creation of the general pension fund in 1969 was both long and complicated.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Although humans would finally together that the funds would be in practice the property sjóðsfélaga became verkalýðshreyfingin to consent to the boards of their duty of appointed representatives of the employers and sjóðsfélaga to par.</seg>
        <seg id="11">In the next few years after the establishment of the funds came the requirement for a majority of workers in the management of the funds often for discussion in the federation of workers, but she managed, however, never carried out to walk, and, therefore, do we sit still stuck with it, an abnormal arrangement of the representatives of the sjóðsfélaga are not in the majority on the boards of the funds.</seg>
        <seg id="12">In the 36. article of the law no. 129/1997 about the disability pension is covered by the investment strategy of the funds.</seg>
        <seg id="13">It says in 1. paragraph that "the pension fund shall have the interests of the members to the forefront.“</seg>
        <seg id="14">Also says in 5. paragraph: "the pension Fund should be set moral criteria in their investments.“</seg>
        <seg id="15">In hluthafastefnu the Pension fund verslunarmanna include the following provisions, in consequence of the previously mentioned legal provisions:</seg>
        <seg id="16">The pension fund is a party to the rules of the United Nations (UN PRI) for responsible investment, along with many of the largest pension funds and institutional investors vestanhafs and in Europe.</seg>
        <seg id="17">In the rules is about how the emphasis on environmental and social issues as well as the good governance of companies can contribute to the enhancement of fjárfestingarárangri verðbréfasafna.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Thus brought together in the interests of the investors and the goal of the society in a broader context.</seg>
        <seg id="19">LV believes it is important to organizations, especially those listed on the stock market, the posture of a public policy on: to introduce good governance remuneration of corporate social responsibility and environmental issues.</seg>
        <seg id="20">The pension fund Value, which is the largest funds in the country, has set a "strategy for responsible investment" and where are the provisions of a similar nature.</seg>
        <seg id="21">This is all brushed up here as an introduction to the latest tískuorði íslenskunnar, "skuggastjórnun".</seg>
        <seg id="22">Where the word is new in the case is not hope that it has been defined fully, but I think the following definition now be "the most captured": Skuggastjórnun is it already fought in the union says in the media that he is going to send the representatives of the company in the board of the pension fund recommendations or instructions on how they should take a position in a particular case.</seg>
        <seg id="23">If they are not following the recommendation they made to depart from the board at the earliest convenience.</seg>
        <seg id="24">If forystumaðurinn'm not going with this in the press and speaks not of termination, then it is not, however, "skuggastjórnun" the ends are sort of communication between people of course always in the financial world as elsewhere.</seg>
        <seg id="25">I'll leave the reader to contemplate either way, he feels "a more sinister.“</seg>
        <seg id="26">There are in particular two men who have tried to formulate this definition when this is written, the morning of Saturday the 25th. July 2020.</seg>
        <seg id="27">There are those Hordur Ægisson journalist on Fréttablaðið and Ásgeir Jónsson governor.</seg>
        <seg id="28">The occasion provided both became after Bogi Nils Bogason ceo of Icelandair had told of the intention to terminate the contracts of the company with the flight attendants and attendants (tell them up), and Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, chairman of the Verslunarmannafélags Reykjavik sent them out the recommendations to the representative of the company in the board of the Pension fund verslunarmanna that do not support the potential purchase of the fund shares in the company, or should they be made to depart.</seg>
        <seg id="29">Some time later, drew Bogi Nils its decision to back and subsequently went Ragnar Thor the same way with its recommendation that miðuðust of course with the decision of the Bow.</seg>
        <seg id="30">Nevertheless, they saw He and The reason for the world on the issue in föstudagsblaði news paper with large words about skuggastjórnun, felony and rich the need for changes in the law.</seg>
        <seg id="31">There was a small þúfa truly a wonder of the heavy hlassi although blessed of the mounds would have been in the subjunctive any more, either, and in addition be dried out swiftly.</seg>
        <seg id="32">Where the issue is important, let's note that the material itself in the end.</seg>
        <seg id="33">I traced it here before the items in the law on pension funds pertaining to this matter.</seg>
        <seg id="34">In those inherent to sjóðstjórnum should represent the interests of members and have ethical standards in the investment, and these points are elaborated in more detail in the articles of both Value and Pension fund verslunarmanna as I mentioned.</seg>
        <seg id="35">Pension funds have NOT, however, looking solely to the short-term arðsemissjónarmiða in their investments.</seg>
        <seg id="36">Such was precisely the treacherous policy and does not need to search long to examples of such in the past, where a large lending banks and funds have flowed to the immoral ævintýramanna and umhverfissóða, with disastrous consequences.</seg>
        <seg id="37">Ceo of Icelandair was obviously on the slippery ice when he got the idea to wipe out an entire group of employees, thereby reducing significantly from the goodwill that the company has enjoyed in the local market and weaken your position to investors.</seg>
        <seg id="38">Fortunately, he saw, and drew it back.</seg>

        <seg id="1">A whole apartment building rotting away in the best part of town</seg>
        <seg id="2">Romanian workers live for free at Dunhagi 18-20.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Meanwhile, the owners want a construction licence to make renovations, but their request has been stuck in the system for more than two years.</seg>
        <seg id="4">In one of Reykjavik's oldest, most established and most expensive neighbourhoods stands a stately three-storey apartment building.</seg>
        <seg id="5">The ground floor has approximately 600 square metres of commercial space.</seg>
        <seg id="6">The backside of the building has two doors to stairwells, each of which provides access to four rather grand apartments.</seg>
        <seg id="7">They range in size from 93 to 130 square metres, although most of them are over 100.</seg>
        <seg id="8">The building has a considerable history.</seg>
        <seg id="9">It was built in 1959 and former activities there include a video rental shop, shoemaker, milk shop, gunsmith, fishmonger and, most recently, University Printing.</seg>
        <seg id="10">The house has seen better days, to put it mildly.</seg>
        <seg id="11">The building is now subject to extensive damage, as can be seen in the accompanying photos.</seg>
        <seg id="12">The house is owned by D18 ehf.</seg>
        <seg id="13">According to the Company Register, D18 ehf.'s owners include Magnús Magnússon and Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Magnús was at the forefront of Borgun's group of owners and was the spokesman for the holding company Borgun.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Among the owners of the holding company Borgun is Stálskip ehf.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Stálskip ehf. is the investment company of Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir and her children.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Guðrún also owns a one-third share of D18 ehf.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Guðrún and her husband, Ágúst Guðmundur Sigurðsson, once operated the fishing enterprise Stálskip.</seg>
        <seg id="19">D18 ehf. bought the house in the summer of 2009 and little or no maintenance work has been done on it since then.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Neighbours say that since then, the condition of the building has deteriorated steadily, but mostly in recent years.</seg>
        <seg id="21">On a Facebook page for residents of the neighbourhood, one resident says that the house has "not been particularly lively in the last few years."</seg>
        <seg id="22">The fact that the owners have, for several years, sought to alter the building and the lot may play a part in this.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Other neighbours say that the building has not been in acceptable condition for a long time.</seg>
        <seg id="24">The time has long come to do something proper with this spot, and its unfortunate that there has been such a delay."</seg>
        <seg id="25">He also says that he is ticked off at the owners of the building for not having made the effort to complete this thing, to find some common ground with the neighbours of the building and stop this "legal back-and-forth".</seg>
        <seg id="26">"Just do it in consultation with the surrounding community so this can be done quickly and completed."</seg>
        <seg id="27">The "legal back-and-forth" that the neighbour refers to is the planning process for the lot, which has been ongoing since at least 2017.</seg>
        <seg id="28">That was when the owners of Dunhagi 18 and 20 sought permission to add a storey to the current apartment building and build, behind the building, a new elevator shaft and single-storey annex, as well as a basement.</seg>
        <seg id="29">The construction licence issued for this project was appealed to the Ruling Committee on the Environment and Natural Resources, which cancelled the licence as the construction project did not have a basis in the land use plan and the hearing notification procedure was not satisfactory.</seg>
        <seg id="30">The City of Reykjavik then commenced land-use planning work, which concluded with a notice in the Government Gazette in July of last year.</seg>
        <seg id="31">That plan was also appealed and the Commission invalidated it in March of 2020.</seg>
        <seg id="32">At this point, almost three years had passed from the original application for a construction licence, and the owners of the building were back on square one.</seg>
        <seg id="33">The building had deteriorated considerably during that time, and the neighbours were getting weary.</seg>
        <seg id="34">When DV asked the neighbours about the condition of the building and their response, the answers were varied.</seg>
        <seg id="35">Some could understand the intentions of the owners of the house, others not at all.</seg>
        <seg id="36">Some directed their anger towards city authorities, others did not.</seg>
        <seg id="37">Others were just angry. not necessarily with anyone in particular.</seg>
        <seg id="38">Then there were those who said that the parking spaces were a cause of contention, as neighbours have used the unused parking spaces at Dunhagi 18-20 for their own vehicles.</seg>
        <seg id="39">One complainant in the matter said that they were long tired of the administrative system:</seg>
        <seg id="40">"It's incredible that we would have to go through the process three times.</seg>
        <seg id="41">It's like the City of Reykjavik can't read."</seg>
        <seg id="42">Today, the house is empty, abandoned and neglected.</seg>
        <seg id="43">A testament to cumbersome city administration and the noble intentions of the owners and their many years of work, which is now back on square one.</seg>
        <seg id="44">This reporter was met with wide open doors and piles of garbage upon arrival at Dunhagi 18.</seg>
        <seg id="45">A Playstation console and a newish television lay surrounded by other waste on the floor — victims of Icelandic summer precipitation.</seg>
        <seg id="46">The doors to the old University Print office was open and there was quite a lot of cats there, judging from the smell of urine.</seg>
        <seg id="47">Someone has obviously made a spot for themselves in one of the corners, but no one can be seen.</seg>
        <seg id="48">There were stacks of sofas and beds and a few pallets of pages on geology, which were undoubtedly intended to become a book.</seg>
        <seg id="49">The stairwells of the apartment building were also open and there were signs of life in both of them.</seg>
        <seg id="50">The reporter was so lucky as to meet the residents of one.</seg>
        <seg id="51">They were Romanians who were boiling a potato dish for dinner and invited the journalist to step inside.</seg>
        <seg id="52">The Romanians work for the temporary agency Ztrongforce ehf.</seg>
        <seg id="53">They have been there for some time and according to DV's sources, the company has not paid anything for the housing except heat and electricity.</seg>
        <seg id="54">It is not considered acceptable to collect rent, due to the condition of the building.</seg>
        <seg id="55">Judging from the stacks of mail in the lobby, it is obvious that a number of foreign workers have lived there recently.</seg>
        <seg id="56">The operations of temporary agencies have not been unaffected by the Covid-19 situation, as the recession in tourism has resulted in a recession in the construction industry, and these two industries have been among the ones that have made the most use of the services of temporary agencies.</seg>
        <seg id="57">The residents of Dunhagi 18 nevertheless seemed to have plenty to do, and their work overalls and gloves were hanging to dry in the communal area after a long day of work in the rain.</seg>
        <seg id="58">It should be noted that despite the awful state of the building, the apartment shared by the boys seemed to be decently maintained.</seg>
        <seg id="59">When the journalist said goodbye to the Romanian boys, he became suddenly aware of the irony: In a prime spot in Reykjavik stands a 1,500 square metre property in disrepair.</seg>
        <seg id="60">The owners want to change and improve the building and the neighbours want the situation to improve but they disagree on the definition of "improvement".</seg>
        <seg id="61">Caught in between is the City's planning department, back on square one, the victim of endless means of appeals and complaints in the planning process and the Ruling Committee on the Environment and Natural Resources' sluggishness in providing a solution.</seg>
        <seg id="62">And the building is home to Romanian workers, who are perhaps exactly the ones who will go on to improve the situation, once the Icelanders stop squabbling.</seg>
        <seg id="63">The article was originally published in DV's weekend edition on 17 July.</seg>

        <seg id="4">In one of Reykjavík's oldest, stony and most expensive neighbourhoods stands a splendid apartment building on three floors.</seg>
        <seg id="5">On the ground floor of the building there is about 600 square meters of commercial space.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Behind the house are the doors of two stairway enclosures, each holding four pretty splendid apartments.</seg>
        <seg id="7">These are between 93-130 square metres, although most of them are over 100 square metres.</seg>
        <seg id="8">The house contains quite a bit of history.</seg>

        <seg id="21">On the Facebook page of neighborhood residents, one resident says that the house has "not been particularly lively in recent years."</seg>
        <seg id="22">It may play into the fact that owners have for several years sought to change the house and the plot.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Other neighbors say the house has long not been OK.</seg>
        <seg id="24">"It's long time to do something nice with this spot and I'm sorry it slowed down like this."</seg>
        <seg id="25">He also says that he is pissed at the owners of the house for not having driven himself to finish this, found some common ground with the neighbors of the house and stopped this "legal stopper."</seg>
        <seg id="26">"Do this just in consultation with the surrounding community so that you can hurry up and finish it."</seg>
        <seg id="27">"The "legal app" to which the resident refers is the planning process of the field that has been underway at least since 2017.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Then the owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 sought permission to build a floor on top of the existing apartment building and behind the house, a new elevator house and an extension on one floor as well as a basement.</seg>
        <seg id="29">The building permit granted for this project was appealed to the Environmental and Resource Appeals Committee and cancelled as the project did not support the division structure and the local presentation was not satisfactory.</seg>
        <seg id="30">The City of Reykjavik then launched a division planning work and completed it with a notice in the Official Journal in July last year.</seg>
        <seg id="31">That structure was also appealed against and cancelled by the committee in March 2020.</seg>
        <seg id="32">At this point, nearly three years had passed since the original application for a building permit and the owners of the building at the starting point.</seg>
        <seg id="33">At this time, the house had drowned down considerably and neighbors began to get tired.</seg>
        <seg id="34">When DV asked the house's neighbors about the situation and the reaction of neighbors, the answers were in various ways.</seg>

        <seg id="41">It's like the city of Reykjavik doesn't know how to read. "</seg>

        <seg id="43">A memorial to the late administration of the city and the noble plans of the owner and years of work of those who are now at the beginning.</seg>
        <seg id="44">When a reporter came to the courtyard at Dunhaga 18, he was faced with wide open doors and piles of garbage.</seg>
        <seg id="45">Playstation computer and recent television were lying among other debris on the ground - victims of Icelandic summer wetness.</seg>

        <seg id="4">In one of Reykjavík’s oldest, coveted and most expensive neighborhoods, a vegetarian villa stands on three floors.</seg>
        <seg id="5">The ground floor of the building has about 600 square meters of commercial space.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Behind the house there are doors of two stairway enclosures, each containing four fairly vegetative apartments.</seg>
        <seg id="7">They range from 93 to 130 square meters, though most over 100.</seg>
        <seg id="8">The house has a considerable history to store.</seg>
        <seg id="9">It was built in 1959 and has, among other things, hosted video rentals, the Shopping Office, the Milk Coalition, Jóa gunmaker, fish sales and most recently the University print.</seg>
        <seg id="10">The house has, so mild to say, remembered its fiddle more beautiful.</seg>
        <seg id="11">The house is now under severe damage, as can be seen in the attached pictures.</seg>
        <seg id="12">The owner of the house is D18 ehf.</seg>
        <seg id="13">The owners of D18 Ltd. are according to the company register among others Magnús Magnússon and Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Magnus went before the owners group of Borgun and was the chairman of the holding company Borgun.</seg>
        <seg id="15">In the group of owners of the holding company Borgun is Stálskip ehf.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Stálskip ehf. is an investment company of Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir and her children.</seg>

        <seg id="21">On the Facebook page of residents in the neighborhood, one resident says that the house has "not been particularly lively in the last few years".</seg>
        <seg id="22">It may play into that owners have for several years sought to change the house and plot.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Other neighbors say the house long has not been ok.</seg>
        <seg id="24">"It is long time to do something nice to this spot and boring that this has attracted such a thing."</seg>
        <seg id="25">He also says that he is pissed out in the owners of the house for not having driven himself into finishing this, finding some common surface with the neighbors of the house and stopping this "legal stand".</seg>

        <seg id="27">The ‘Law-based app is the organisational process of the field that has been running at least since 2017.</seg>
        <seg id="28">The owners of Dunhaga were then injured 18 and 20 after permission to build a hill on top of the current villa and behind the house, a new elevator house and a building on one floor as well as a basement.</seg>
        <seg id="29">The building permit granted for that implementation was appealed to the Environmental and Resources Committee and the committee repealed it as the implementation did not support the division and the local presentation was not satisfactory.</seg>
        <seg id="30">The city of Reykjavík started with a divisional work and ended it with an ad in the Official Journal in July last year.</seg>
        <seg id="31">That organisation was also appealed and the committee repealed it in March 2020.</seg>
        <seg id="32">At this point, nearly three years had passed since the initial application for building permits and the owners of the building at the starting field.</seg>
        <seg id="33">The house had at this time drank down considerably and neighbors taken to wearing.</seg>
        <seg id="34">When the DV asked the neighbors of the house out in the situation and the reaction of neighbors, the answers were in various ways.</seg>
        <seg id="35">Some had an understanding of the intentions of the owners of the house, others not at all.</seg>
        <seg id="36">Others directed the anger to the city, others not.</seg>

        <seg id="39">One complainant in the case said he was long-awaited by the administration:</seg>
        <seg id="40">"Let us have to go through the process in a three-way is quite amazing.</seg>
        <seg id="41">It is like the city of Reykjavík may not read."</seg>
        <seg id="42">Today the house stands empty, abandoned and is neglected.</seg>
        <seg id="43">A monument to the suspension of the city's administration and the noble intentions of the owner and many years of their work currently in the starting field.</seg>

        <seg id="55">Of the places of mail in the lobby of the house to judge, it is clear that there has been a lot of foreign workers in recent years.</seg>
        <seg id="56">The operation of staff rentals has not been part of the Covid-19 situation, as the contraction in tourism led to a recession in the construction sector, and these two business being the most efficient to take advantage of the service of staff rentals.</seg>

        <seg id="8">The house has a lot of history.</seg>
        <seg id="9">It was built in 1959 and has housed, among other things, a video rental store, a shoe store, a dairy store, a gunsmith, a fish store and, most recently, a university print shop.</seg>

        <seg id="22">This may have something to do with the fact that the owners have been looking to change the house and grounds for several years.</seg>

        <seg id="26">"Just do it in consultation with the community so we can hurry up and get it done."</seg>
        <seg id="27">The "legal button" to which the resident refers is the planning process for the field, which has been ongoing since at least 2017.</seg>
        <seg id="28">The owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 then applied for permission to build a floor on top of the existing apartment building and behind the building, a new lift building and an extension on one floor plus a basement.</seg>
        <seg id="29">The building permit granted for this project was appealed to the Committee on the Environment and Natural Resources, and the committee annulled it because the project was not based on a zoning plan and the zoning notice was not sufficient.</seg>

        <seg id="31">That plan was also challenged, and the commission repealed it in March 2020.</seg>
        <seg id="32">At this point, nearly three years had passed since the initial application for a building permit and the owners of the building were just getting started.</seg>
        <seg id="33">By this time the house had fallen into considerable disrepair and the neighbours were beginning to tire of it.</seg>

        <seg id="40">"For us to have to go through the process three times is just unbelievable.</seg>
        <seg id="41">It's as if the city of Reykjavik can't read."</seg>

        <seg id="3">In the meantime, owners are seeking building permits for improvements, but their business has been successful in the scheme for a third year.</seg>
        <seg id="4">In one of Reykjavík City’s oldest, busiest and most expensive neighbourhoods, a glorious condominium stands on three floors.</seg>
        <seg id="5">The ground floor of the building has about 600 square feet of commercial space.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Behind the house are the doors of two stairwells, each holding four somewhat weighted apartments.</seg>
        <seg id="7">They range from 93–130 square meters, though most exceed 100.</seg>
        <seg id="8">The house has a significant history.</seg>
        <seg id="9">It was built in 1959 and has housed, among other things, a video store, the Shoe Office, Dairy Milk Shop, Joe the Gunsmith, a fish seller, and most recently a University Print.</seg>
        <seg id="10">The house has, to put it mildly, remembered its elephant beauty.</seg>
        <seg id="11">The house is now severely damaged, as can be seen in the photos provided.</seg>
        <seg id="12">The owner of the building is D18 ehf.</seg>
        <seg id="13">The owners of D18 ehf. are according to company records amongst other Magnússon and Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Magnús headed the ownership group of Borgunar and was the head of the holding company Borgunar.</seg>
        <seg id="15">In the group of owners of the holding company Borgunar is Stálskip ehf.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Stálskip ehf. is the investment company of Gudrún Helga Lárusdóttir and her children.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Guðrún is also the owner of a third part of D18 ehf.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Guðrún and her husband, Ágúst Guðmundur Sigurðsson, once ran the operator Stálskip.</seg>
        <seg id="19">D18 ehf. bought the house in the summer of 2009, so little or nothing has been maintained since then.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Tell neighbours that the condition of the house has deteriorated constantly since, though most recently.</seg>
        <seg id="21">On a neighbourhood resident’s Facebook page, one resident says that the house has “not been particularly lively in the last year.”</seg>
        <seg id="22">It may play a part because owners have been seeking to modify the house and land for several years.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Other neighbors say the house hasn't been OK for a long time.</seg>
        <seg id="24">“It’s long overdue to do something decent with this spot and boring that it has dragged on like this.”</seg>
        <seg id="25">He also says that he is furious with the owners of the house for not getting driven to finish it, finding some common ground with the house’s neighbours and stopping this “legal gimmick”.</seg>
        <seg id="26">“Just do this in consultation with the surrounding community so it can be rushed and finished.”</seg>
        <seg id="27">The "legal app," the resident refers to, is the planning process for the plot that has been going on at least since 2017.</seg>
        <seg id="28">The then Dunhaga 18 and 20 owners sought permission to build a floor on top of the existing condominium and behind the house, a new elevator and one-story extension as well as a basement.</seg>
        <seg id="29">The building permit granted for that project was appealed to the Committee on the Environment and Natural Resources, and the committee cancelled it as the project did not have a subdivision support and local representation was not adequate.</seg>
        <seg id="30">The City of Reykjavík then started with divisional work and ended it with an announcement in the Official Journal last July.</seg>
        <seg id="31">That structure was also appealed and repealed by the committee in March 2020.</seg>
        <seg id="32">At this point, therefore, nearly three years had passed since the original application for a building permit and the building's owners at the beginning.</seg>
        <seg id="33">At this time the house had been knocked down considerably and neighbours began to tire.</seg>
        <seg id="34">When DV asked the house’s neighbors about the situation and neighbors’ reactions, the answers were in several ways.</seg>
        <seg id="35">Some had an understanding of the building's intended owners, others not at all.</seg>
        <seg id="36">Others directed their anger at the city, others did not.</seg>
        <seg id="37">Others were just angry, but nothing necessarily out of anyone.</seg>
        <seg id="38">Still others said the parking lot was thwarted, while neighbors have occupied Dunhaga’s unused parking lot 18–20 under their vehicles.</seg>
        <seg id="39">One complainant in the case said he grew tired of the administration:</seg>
        <seg id="40">“For us to have to go through the process on three occasions is absolutely incredible.</seg>
        <seg id="41">It’s as if the City of Reykjavík didn’t know how to read.”</seg>
        <seg id="42">Today the house stands empty, abandoned and is neglected.</seg>
        <seg id="43">A monument to the dizzying administration of the city and the noble intentions of the owner and their many years of work now at the beginning.</seg>
        <seg id="44">When a reporter arrived at Dunhaga 18, he was whipped open doors and piles of rubbish.</seg>
        <seg id="45">A Playstation computer and a recent TV lay amid other trash on Earth — victims of Icelandic summer soaking</seg>
        <seg id="46">It was open into the old office of University Printing, and there was a significant amount of cats of the smell of urine to judge.</seg>
        <seg id="47">It is clear that someone has nestled in one corner, but no one is visible.</seg>
        <seg id="48">Stacks of sofas and beds and a few pallets of geological pages, which were sure to become a book, were blacked out.</seg>
        <seg id="49">The residential stairwells were also open and alive in both.</seg>
        <seg id="50">A journalist was lucky enough to run into the residents of one of them.</seg>
        <seg id="51">Were there, Romanians boiled a potato dish for dinner and invited a reporter in.</seg>
        <seg id="52">The Romanians work for the temporary work agency Ztrongforce ehf.</seg>
        <seg id="53">They have been there for some time, and DV’s sources state that the company has paid nothing for the premises except for heat and electricity.</seg>
        <seg id="54">Due to the condition of the house, it is not considered presumptive to collect rent.</seg>
        <seg id="55">Judging by the stash of mail in the lobby of the building, it is clear that there have been some numbers of foreign workers living there last season.</seg>
        <seg id="56">The temporary agency business has not been affected by the Covid-19 situation, as the decline in tourism has led to a decline in the construction sector, and these two businesses have been the most effective in using temporary agency services.</seg>
        <seg id="57">Nonetheless, the Dunhaga 18 householders seemed to have plenty of work to do, and the work suits and mittens in the joint remained to dry after a long day's work in the rain.</seg>
        <seg id="58">It should be noted that despite the miserable state of the house, the apartment the boys shared seemed to be nicely maintained.</seg>
        <seg id="59">When a reporter said goodbye to the boys Romanian, the irony suddenly became clear to him: In the best place in Reykjavík, a 1,500 square metre property stands demolished.</seg>
        <seg id="60">Owners want to change the house for the better and neighbours want an improved condition but dispute the definition of 'improved'.</seg>
        <seg id="61">Between then sits the city's early planning sector, the victim of endless appeals and appeal possibilities in the planning process and the dizzying resolution of the Environment and Resources Review Board.</seg>
        <seg id="62">In the house, so do Romanian workers, perhaps the very ones who go to improve the situation, when the Icelanders stop fighting.</seg>

        <seg id="1">Cooking is a kind of meditation - see Elísa Viðars' menu</seg>
        <seg id="2">Elísa Viðarsdóttir is an elite footballer who plays with Valur.</seg>
        <seg id="3">She is also an MA student of nutritional science, a mother and working as a food scientist.</seg>
        <seg id="4">She needs plenty of energy for her day-to-day life and she usually gives herself time to cook good, healthy food.</seg>
        <seg id="5">"A normal day for me begins when I arrive at work at just over eight," says Elísa.</seg>
        <seg id="6">"After work, I go to the store so I can prepare dinner before picking up my girl from preschool at about three o'clock."</seg>
        <seg id="7">Elísa finds it very nourishing to pick her daughter up early from preschool.</seg>
        <seg id="8">"It's good to have some time with her before I go to practice in the afternoon.</seg>
        <seg id="9">After practice, it's good to come home and only have to heat up the food.</seg>
        <seg id="10">In the evenings, when our girl has gone to sleep, we like to watch one episode to clear the mind."</seg>
        <seg id="11">Elísa does not adhere to any particular diet.</seg>
        <seg id="12">She's about to complete her Master's thesis in nutritional science so she's well aware of what is suitable for her to eat in order to have enough energy to tend to her work, studies, family and practice schedule.</seg>
        <seg id="13">"It suits me to eat varied food that has a good combination of proteins, carbohydrates and fat.</seg>
        <seg id="14">But most important for me is to have a healthy relationship with food and not categorise food as being either bad or good, but rather as having much or little nutritional value.</seg>
        <seg id="15">The thing is that it's OK to eat everything, just not all at once and not all the time.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Elísa is very interested in cooking.</seg>
        <seg id="17">"I find that there is a kind of meditation in standing and cooking in the kitchen so I try to do it often.</seg>
        <seg id="18">I have to admit that I have confidence on my side in the kitchen and I sincerely believe that I'm an excellent cook."</seg>
        <seg id="19">Breakfast: Oats, chia seeds, hempseeds, a little lemon juice, soaked in almond milk overnight.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Then I top the meal off with what I have at each time.</seg>
        <seg id="21">Usually it's a banana and crispy muesli &amp; COFFEE.</seg>
        <seg id="22">I'm a great coffee enthusiast.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Between meals: It varies incredibly, but fruits or vegetables, rye flatbread, plain skyr with banana and muesli, bread with toppings, and then I could eat hummus with a spoon straight from the box if necessary.</seg>
        <seg id="24">Lunch: I often make all kinds of rich salads from what's in the refrigerator; quinoa or barley, falafel, rocket and oven-baked vegetables with a tasty dressing are some of the things I'm working with.</seg>
        <seg id="25">If the schedule becomes completely unravelled (which happens frequently), the egg boiler at work has quite often saved me, and then it's 2 pieces of bread with butter, cheese and boiled egg, and Bob's your uncle.</seg>
        <seg id="26">Between meals: I'll get something rich in carbohydrates before practice, bread with toppings, breakfast cereal or fruits.</seg>
        <seg id="27">Dinner: Fish is very often the choice in my household, or else some delicious vegetable dishes.</seg>

        <seg id="2">It is still not clear whether the dismissals of Icelandair airline hostesses, which are supposed to enter into effect at the end of this month, will be reversed.</seg>
        <seg id="3">The online voting on the Icelandic Cabin Crew Association's collective wage agreement on behalf of Icelandair airline hostesses will conclude at noon tomorrow.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Association president Guðlaug Líney Jóhannsdóttir says she is convinced that Icelandair will not make a decision on the dismissals until the results of the vote are known.</seg>

        <seg id="7">Of course, people are also anxious to know whether they will have a job next month."</seg>
        <seg id="8">The vote is on an agreement signed a week ago, in the early hours of 19 July.</seg>
        <seg id="9">It is expected to have an effective term until the end of September 2025, and it is based on an agreement previously rejected in a vote by the Cabin Crew Association.</seg>
        <seg id="10">On 17 July, the board and council of the Icelandic Cabin Crew Association decided to suspend all work at Icelandair and the decision was approved in a vote by the members.</seg>
        <seg id="11">This was never done, but the decision was made following Icelandair's decision to suspend negotiations with the Cabin Crew Association, dismiss all its airline hostesses and seek to negotiate with another trade union.</seg>
        <seg id="12">The company's pilots were also meant to take on temporary positions as security officers on board.</seg>
        <seg id="13">When asked how she thinks the vote will go, Guðlaug Líney says it's difficult to say.</seg>
        <seg id="14">"People are hurt after this attack by Icelandair where all the company's airline hostesses were dismissed and it was announced that they would conclude an agreement with another trade union.</seg>
        <seg id="15">It will now become clear whether this has an effect," she says.</seg>
        <seg id="16">940 airline hostesses were employed by Icelandair in late April when 900 of them, about 95%, were dismissed.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Their notice of termination varies. For the ones with the shortest work experience it is three months, so their notice period ends at the end of July/start of August.</seg>
        <seg id="18">About 90% of Icelandair's airline hostesses belong to this group.</seg>
        <seg id="19">What happens next if the agreement is not approved?</seg>
        <seg id="20">"Then we'll request further negotiations with our counterparty.</seg>
        <seg id="21">With this agreement, we are meeting Icelandair's demands.</seg>
        <seg id="22">If it is rejected, the airline hostesses obviously feel that this was a step too far."</seg>

        <seg id="3">This is not something that has been brewing in this country," says Már Kristjánsson, head doctor at Landspitali Hospital's communicable disease ward, about the news of a "new type of virus" being detected in this country.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Three domestic infections were diagnosed yesterday and two at the border.</seg>

        <seg id="7">Yesterday, an infection connected to an infection reported the day before yesterday was also diagnosed, and sequence analysis by deCODE Genetics showed a "new type of virus that has not been diagnosed here before."</seg>
        <seg id="8">Tracing in connection with that infection has been completed.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Már notes that this is not a new virus but the same virus that has spread across the world, i.e. the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.</seg>
        <seg id="10">It would be more accurate to talk about a new strain of that virus rather than a new type of virus.</seg>
        <seg id="11">When asked what this means and whether this could indicate anything about a new wave of the pandemic having begun, Már says that this is an isolated incident at the moment and it was possible that nothing more would come of it.</seg>
        <seg id="12">"However, if there are more domestic cases with no overseas connections and the same genotype as this particular strain, the conclusion could be made [about a second wave] but it is not timely at this point," Már explains.</seg>

        <seg id="2">In one hundred days, Americans will go to the polls to elect a President for the next four years.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Donald Trump seeks reelection but faces an uphill battle.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Joe Biden, the expected Democratic candidate, has a big nationwide lead on Trump if opinion polls are to be believed.</seg>
        <seg id="5">According to a recent survey by the AP news agency, a record number of Americans believe that the nation is headed in the wrong direction.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Trump's response to the novel coronavirus pandemic is also highly unpopular, in addition to which an increasing number of Americans believe that the President has handled the economy poorly.</seg>
        <seg id="7">More precisely, only two out of ten Americans say that the United States are heading in the right direction.</seg>
        <seg id="8">32 percent say that they support Trump's response to the pandemic, and 48 percent say that he has handled the economy well.</seg>
        <seg id="9">That proportion was 56 percent in March and 67 percent in January.</seg>
        <seg id="10">According to FiveThirtyEight's average, Biden's support is 49.9 percent nationwide while Trump's support is 41.9 percent.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Trump himself has attempted to shift the focus away from his response to the pandemic and onto Biden, promote the so-called culture gap and announce policies intended to revolve around law and order.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Meanwhile, the Biden campaign makes great efforts to keep the focus on Trump, believing that there's a great chance of victory if the elections will actually revolve around Trump's performance in office over the past four years.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Trump's unpopularity also seems likely to have a negative effect on Republican senators, and prominent Republicans fear that Democrats might even gain a majority in the US Senate, which has been considered highly unlikely until now.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Politico recently reported that if support for parties and candidate remained similar to what it is now, the Republican Party would suffer its biggest defeat in decades.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Suburbs had proved to be particularly bad for the party in the 2016 senate elections and the trend was likely to continue now.</seg>
        <seg id="16">In recent days, Trump has tried to scare suburbanites into supporting him, including by claiming that if elected President, Biden will destroy the suburbs of America and increase racial tensions.</seg>
        <seg id="17">One of Trump's measures was to repeal a regulation from Obama's time in the White House intended to increase diversity in the suburbs.</seg>
        <seg id="18">He also encouraged "housewives" in American suburbs to read an article by a former New York lieutenant governor who claimed that Biden would destroy American suburbs, which Trump agreed with.</seg>
        <seg id="19">"Biden will destroy your neighbourhoods and the American dream.</seg>
        <seg id="20">I will preserve it, and make it even better!" said the President.</seg>
        <seg id="21">Suburban residents are an ever-growing proportion of voters.</seg>
        <seg id="22">According to NPR, they make up about half of all voters in the United States.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Ever since the reelection of George W. Bush in 2004, the candidate who has received the majority of votes from this segment has become President.</seg>
        <seg id="24">The exception was in 2012, when Mitt Romney received the majority of votes from this segment but lost to Barack Obama.</seg>
        <seg id="25">Polls have shown that although Trump secured a narrow majority of suburban voters in 2016, his support among them has decreased significantly.</seg>
        <seg id="26">Although polls have varied, Biden has recently been measured as having a fifteen percent lead on Trump in the suburbs.</seg>

        <seg id="3">Donald Trump is seeking re-election, but he is steep to pursue.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Joe Biden, the Democratic Party's forthcoming candidate, has a huge advantage over Trump nationally, taking into account polls.</seg>
        <seg id="5">According to a new poll by the AP news agency, a record number of Americans believe that the nation is on the wrong track.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Trump's response to the pandemic of the new coronavirus is also very unpopular, and more Americans than before believe that the president has held the economy poorly.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Specifically, only two in ten Americans say the United States is on the right track.</seg>
        <seg id="8">32 percent say they support Trump's response to the epidemic and 48 percent say he has held well on economic matters.</seg>
        <seg id="9">In March, that rate was 56 percent and in January it was 67 percent.</seg>

        <seg id="12">However, Biden's candidacy puts great effort into keeping the attention on Trump and considers it highly likely to win the prize if the election is actually about how Trump has performed in the last four years.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Trump's unpopularity also seems to bring down Republican senators, fearing that Democrats could even gain a majority in the U.S. Senate, which has so far been very slow.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Politico recently said that the party and the candidate remain comparable, and that is now the Republican Party would have its greatest abuse in decades.</seg>
        <seg id="15">The suburbs proved to be particularly bad for the party in the 2016 parliamentary elections and it is now likely that this trend will continue.</seg>
        <seg id="16">In recent days, Trump has tried to intimidate suburban residents to follow, including by saying that if Biden becomes president, he will destroy suburbs of the United States and promote racial disputes.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Among other things, Trump has abrogated a regulation from Barack Obama's time in the White House intended to diversify suburbs.</seg>
        <seg id="18">He then urged "housewives" of suburbs in the United States to read an article by the former deputy governor of New York, claiming that Biden would destroy suburbs of the United States and agreeing to Trump.</seg>

        <seg id="7">Í þetta skipti skyldi Tókýóborg og Japan baða sig í athygli heimsins.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Leikarnir áttu að fara fram 24. júlí til 9. ágúst en hefur verið frestað um ár og hefjast þess í stað 23. júlí 2021 og lýkur þann 8. ágúst.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Ef ekki tekst að halda leikana þá, ef kórónuveiran verður enn of mikil ógn, verður hætt við leikana.</seg>

        <seg id="11">Ólympíuleikar eru engin venjuleg íþróttakeppni.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Ekkert er til sparað, sýningin á alltaf að vera stórkostleg og leitast í við að toppa síðustu leika.</seg>

        <seg id="14">Því stórfenglegri sem kynningin er — því meiri líkur á að hljóta hnossið.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Tókýó varði 150 milljónum dala í að reyna að fá að halda Ólympíuleikana 2016 eða sem nemur ríflega 20 milljörðum króna.</seg>

        <seg id="19">Skipuleggjendur í Japan hafa sagt að Ólympíuleikarnir í Tókýó, sem hefðu átt að vera í gangi þessa dagana en hefur verið frestað um eitt ár vegna kórónuveirunnar, myndu hafa kostað 12,6 milljarða dala.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Í skýrslu frá ríkisendurskoðanda í Japan sem út kom í lok síðasta árs kom þó fram að nær væri að kostnaðurinn væri tvöföld sú tala.</seg>
        <seg id="21">Líklega verður ekki hægt að leggja fyllilega mat á kostnaðinn við að fresta leikunum en áætlað hefur verið að það geti kostað á bilinu tvo til sex milljarða dala til viðbótar við upphaflegan kostnað.</seg>
        <seg id="22">Heildarkostnaður fyrir japönsku Ólympíunefndina og japanska skattgreiðendur gæti því hlaupið á bilinu 15 til 30 milljörðum dala.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Það eru svo háar tölur að allar skatttekjur íslenska ríkisins dygðu aðeins fyrir um tæplega hálfum Ólympíuleikum, miðað við lægsta mögulega kostnað.</seg>
        <seg id="24">Ólympíuleikar eru viðburður af þeirri stærðargráðu að þeir hafa gjarnan orðið umfjöllunarefni hagfræðinga, sem reyna að rýna í tölur og skoða ávinning og ábata af leikunum.</seg>

        <seg id="1">Will the Olympic flame be the light at the end of the tunnel?</seg>
        <seg id="2">When the final decision had been taken to postpone the Olympic Games, an event that only world wars had disrupted until then, the President of the International Olympic Committee said that the famous Olympic flame would be the "light at the end of the tunnel", presumably referring to the coronavirus pandemic through which the world is now jointly navigating.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Elite athletes have one more year to prepare themselves and Japanese authorities take on extra costs because of the postponement.</seg>
        <seg id="4">But all keep their chin up, as there is much at stake.</seg>
        <seg id="5">When it was announced that Tokyo, Japan, would be the site of this year's Olympics, the celebrations of the Japanese delegates were genuine.</seg>
        <seg id="6">They cried and laughed in turns, Tokyo having applied to host the 2016 games but losing out Rio, Brazil.</seg>
        <seg id="7">This time, Tokyo and Japan would revel in the global spotlight.</seg>
        <seg id="8">The Olympics were supposed to be held on 24 July to 9 August, but have now been postponed for a year so they will instead begin on 23 July 2021 and end on 8 August.</seg>
        <seg id="9">If the games cannot be held then, if the coronavirus will still be too much of a threat, the games will be cancelled.</seg>
        <seg id="10">But this is something that no one really wants to contemplate.</seg>
        <seg id="11">The Olympic Games are no ordinary sporting competition.</seg>
        <seg id="12">No expense is spared, the spectacle is always supposed to be dazzling and top the previous games.</seg>
        <seg id="13">The selection of a host city for the Olympics is based on how an evaluation commission rates the cities' presentations.</seg>
        <seg id="14">The more spectacular the presentation — the more likely it is to be awarded.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Tokyo spent USD 150 million on its bid to host the 2016 Olympics, or the equivalent of over ISK 20 billion.</seg>
        <seg id="16">In the second instance, in the application for the 2020 games, USD 75 million, about ISK 10 billion, was spent on the promotion.</seg>
        <seg id="17">In 2013, when it was decided that Toyko would be awarded this year's games, Japanese authorities had therefore already spent the equivalent of ISK 30 billion on the project.</seg>
        <seg id="18">But this amount is only a drop in the ocean compared to the cost of building an Olympic village and stadiums, and the general cost of strengthening the country's infrastructures in order to be able to manage such a tournament, preparing for it and holding the games themselves.</seg>
        <seg id="19">The Japanese organisers have said that the Tokyo Olympics, which were supposed to be taking place now but have been postponed for a year because of the coronavirus, would have cost USD 12.6 billion.</seg>
        <seg id="20">However, a report by the Japanese Board of Audit, published at the end of last year, revealed that the actual cost was closer to double that figure.</seg>
        <seg id="21">It's probably not possible to fully assess the cost of postponing the games but according to estimates, the cost may be from two to six billion dollars, in addition to the original cost.</seg>
        <seg id="22">The full cost for the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese tax payers could therefore range from 15 to 30 billion dollars.</seg>
        <seg id="23">These numbers are so high that all of the Icelandic State's tax income would only cover just under half the Olympics, assuming the lowest possible cost.</seg>
        <seg id="24">The Olympic Games are an event of such magnitude that they have often been the subject of economists who attempt to review the figures and study the benefits and gains from the games.</seg>
        <seg id="25">In short, quite a number of people seem to have concluded that the effects of the Olympics are anything but positive for the economy of the host cities.</seg>
        <seg id="26">There are some short-term effects, including a great short-term increase in jobs, but in the longer term, cites are often left with a trail of debts and enormous operating costs for little-used facilities.</seg>
        <seg id="27">Rio, Brazil, is left with significant debts from the 2016 games and has had trouble funding the maintenance of all the large sports facilities that were built for the games.</seg>
        <seg id="28">A study of the figures from the 2012 games in London has shown that only 10 percent of those who got a job related to the Olympic games in the city were unemployed before.</seg>
        <seg id="29">This means that new jobs weren't created except to a limited extent.</seg>
        <seg id="30">In general, cities have not been particularly economically successful in hosting the Olympics because of the onerous costs related to the structures built for the games.</seg>
        <seg id="31">On the other hand, many believe there to be a benefit in the increased traffic of tourists who want to visit the Olympic cities after the games, although this is highly uncertain when it comes to the 2021 games.</seg>
        <seg id="32">It is also unclear whether it's possible to receive the large number of spectators who usually attend the games.</seg>
        <seg id="33">Most important, however, is the honour accorded to the cities in being selected, which is difficult to assess in terms of money.</seg>
        <seg id="34">The fact is that despite the enormous costs, it could also be said that the joy created by the games is of such a nature that it's impossible to put a price tag on it.</seg>
        <seg id="35">But although the spectacle is often impressive and no expense is spared, money is of course not the only issue.</seg>
        <seg id="36">The sports stars are at the forefront.</seg>
        <seg id="37">For some elite athletes, postponing the games is an accidental blessing.</seg>
        <seg id="38">One of these is Australian pentathlon competitor and gold medallist at the last Olympics, Chloe Esposito, who is heavily pregnant and would have been absent this summer but is hoping to be in competitive shape for the 2021 games.</seg>
        <seg id="39">That is why she is one of the athletes who are rather pleased with the postponement, for understandable reasons.</seg>
        <seg id="40">For the athletes who intended to retire after this year's games, had they been held at the right time, the postponement of the games means, in some instances, that they will retire from competition before the games are held.</seg>
        <seg id="41">They simply do not trust their body to withstand another year of hard training.</seg>
        <seg id="42">Few athletes were as successful in securing their place in the hearts of spectators at the 2016 Olympics in Rio as the gymnastics star Simone Biles.</seg>
        <seg id="43">She came home with four gold medals around her neck and one bronze.</seg>
        <seg id="44">Biles has sat down for several interviews in her home country of the United States to discuss the Olympic Games.</seg>
        <seg id="45">She intends to go to the 2021 games but is not certain that she will still be at her peak at the games next year, when she will be 24 years old.</seg>
        <seg id="46">Although that is generally not considered old, it is rather much for a top-flight gymnast.</seg>
        <seg id="47">"This is a delicate subject" says Biles with a slight smile in an interview on the Olympic Committee's Instagram page when asked whether she intends to be as successful at the 2021 games as she was in Rio in 2016.</seg>
        <seg id="48">"I simply don't know whether I'll still be at the top after another whole year of training," says Biles.</seg>
        <seg id="49">She has previously said that her body will not stand the strain of gymnastic training much longer.</seg>
        <seg id="50">She is nevertheless training enthusiastically for the 2021 Olympics.</seg>
        <seg id="51">Biles admits that it was an uncomfortable feeling to have to stop training all of a sudden when the gymnasium was closed at the height of the pandemic.</seg>
        <seg id="52">Just as with everyone else, there were no exemptions for Biles while all sports facilities were closed for seven weeks.</seg>
        <seg id="53">All her Olympic gold medals could not buy her any priority access and like others, she had to find various ways to stay in shape.</seg>
        <seg id="54">The basic form is certainly a little better than for most people.</seg>
        <seg id="55">"We have a strict schedule now.</seg>
        <seg id="56">It was hard to begin training again when the gymnasium first opened again.</seg>
        <seg id="57">We began slowly but have reached full speed again and I will gradually add to the training as the year goes on.</seg>
        <seg id="58">Obviously, we don't know for sure how these games will be, or whether they will be held, but we can't do anything but train as if they will take place.</seg>
        <seg id="59">I have put in too much effort to leave the sport now," says Biles.</seg>
        <seg id="60">She, like others, has some doubts, or perhaps rather awareness of the possibility of the games not being held in 2021 either.</seg>
        <seg id="61">But trying to make predictions about this is hopeless.</seg>
        <seg id="62">No one can know what the status of the coronavirus pandemic will be in July 2021 and there is nothing to do but prepare for the Olympics assuming that they will be held in a year.</seg>
        <seg id="63">Perhaps the Olympic flame will be the light at the end of the Covid tunnel.</seg>

        <seg id="3">Achievements have another year to prepare and the cost of the delay is compensated for by Japan's authorities.</seg>
        <seg id="4">At least everyone holds their heads, as there's a lot at stake.</seg>
        <seg id="5">When it was announced that Tokyo, Japan, would be the venue for this year's Olympic Games, the cheers of the Japanese representatives were genuine.</seg>
        <seg id="6">They wept and laughed alternately, as Tokyo had applied to hold the 2016 Games, but bent that time lower for Rio, Brazil.</seg>
        <seg id="7">This time, Tokyo City and Japan should bathe in the attention of the world.</seg>
        <seg id="8">The Games were scheduled to take place from July 24 to August 9 but have been postponed for a year, starting instead on July 23, 2021 and ending on August 8.</seg>
        <seg id="9">If the Games cannot be held, if the coronavirus remains too much of a threat, the Games will be cancelled.</seg>
        <seg id="10">At least no one wants to completely think that thought through.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Olympics are no ordinary sports competition.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Nothing is saved, the show should always be magnificent and strive to top the last games.</seg>
        <seg id="13">The selection of a city for the Olympic Games is based on the selection committee's assessment of the cities' presentations.</seg>
        <seg id="14">The more magnificent the presentation is - the greater the likelihood of getting the knee.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Tokyo spent $150 million trying to host the 2016 Olympics, which amounts to more than ISK 20 billion.</seg>

        <seg id="18">But this amount is just a drop into the sea considering how much it costs to build Olympic villages, stadiums and generally to strengthen the country's infrastructure to handle tournaments like this, prepare them and host the Games themselves.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Organizers in Japan have said that the Tokyo Olympics, which should have been running these days but have been postponed by one year due to the coronavirus, would have cost 12.6 billion dollars.</seg>
        <seg id="20">However, a report from the Statutory Auditor in Japan published at the end of last year found that the cost was almost twice that figure.</seg>
        <seg id="21">The cost of postponing the games is likely not to be fully estimated, but it has been estimated that it can cost between $2 and $6 billion in addition to the original cost.</seg>
        <seg id="22">The total cost for the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could therefore run between $15 billion and $30 billion.</seg>
        <seg id="23">There are so high figures that all tax revenues from the Icelandic state would cover only almost half of the Olympic Games, based on the lowest possible costs.</seg>
        <seg id="24">Olympic Games are an event of such a magnitude that they have often become the subject of economists who try to review numbers and look at the benefits and benefits of the Games.</seg>
        <seg id="25">In the shortest possible case, quite a few people seem to have concluded that the impact of the Olympic Games is less than positive for the economy of the cities that hold them.</seg>
        <seg id="26">There are some short-term effects, for example, the number of jobs increases greatly in the short term, but in the long term cities are often left with debt deficits and tremendous operating costs of little-used infrastructure.</seg>
        <seg id="27">Rio, Brazil, has significant debts due to the 2016 Games and has had trouble costing the maintenance of all the large sports facilities built before the Games.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Figures have been reviewed after the London Games in 2012, where it has been found that only 10 percent of those who received employment related to the city's Olympics were unemployed before.</seg>
        <seg id="29">That means that there were no new jobs except to a small extent.</seg>
        <seg id="30">In general, cities have not particularly benefited financially from hosting the Olympics because of the surging costs associated with the structures built for the Games.</seg>
        <seg id="31">However, the benefits are often considered to be increased traffic for tourists who want to visit the Olympic cities following the Games, although there is great uncertainty about the 2021 Games.</seg>
        <seg id="32">It is also unclear whether it will be possible to accept all the number of spectators who usually attend the games.</seg>
        <seg id="33">The main thing, however, is the honor for the cities to be chosen, but it is difficult to value for money.</seg>
        <seg id="34">Because despite enormous costs, it can also be said that the nature of the joy that the games bring is not such that a price tag can be placed on it.</seg>
        <seg id="35">But although the exhibition is often magnificent and there is nowhere to save, of course, it's not just about money.</seg>
        <seg id="36">It's the sports heroes who are in the foreground.</seg>
        <seg id="37">For some successful people, postponing the games is accidentally just appealing.</seg>
        <seg id="38">In her article at the latter Olympic Games, Australian and gold medalist Chloe Esposito is pregnant, for example, and would have been far from having fun this summer, but sees hope of being in competition shape for the 2021 Games.</seg>
        <seg id="39">She is therefore among the athletes who are just rather happy with the postponement, for understandable reasons.</seg>
        <seg id="40">For those athletes who intended to leave after this year's Games, had they been held on time, the postponement of the Games in some cases means that they will cancel the competition before the Games take place.</seg>
        <seg id="41">Simply don't trust their bodies to go through another year of rigorous exercises.</seg>
        <seg id="42">Few athletes placed themselves as thoroughly in the hearts of the audience at the Rio Olympics 2016 as gymnastics star Simone Biles.</seg>
        <seg id="43">She brought home four gold around her neck and one bronze.</seg>
        <seg id="44">Biles has attended several interviews in his home country in the United States recently to discuss the Olympics.</seg>
        <seg id="45">She plans to attend the 2021 Games, although she is not necessarily confident that she will still be at the top of the Games next year, as she will then be 24 years old.</seg>
        <seg id="46">Although it is generally not considered a high age, it is higher for a leading gymnastician.</seg>
        <seg id="47">"This is a sensitive issue," says Biles, while smiling at one another in an interview posted on the Olympic Committee's Instagram page asked if she intended to go as far at the 2021 Games as she did in Rio 2016.</seg>
        <seg id="48">"I honestly don't know if I'll still be at the top after another year of practice," Biles says.</seg>
        <seg id="49">She has previously talked about her body not tolerating the stress of gymnastics training for much longer.</seg>
        <seg id="50">Nevertheless, she rehearses hard for the 2021 Olympics.</seg>
        <seg id="51">Biles admits that it was an uncomfortable feeling to have to stop rehearsing suddenly when the pandemic was high and the gymnastics hall was closed.</seg>
        <seg id="52">There were no exemptions for Biles rather than others while all sports facilities were closed for seven weeks.</seg>
        <seg id="53">All her Olympic gold couldn't buy any access over the others, she had to find various ways to stay in shape like others.</seg>
        <seg id="54">The basic form certainly a little better than in most people.</seg>
        <seg id="55">"We have a rigorous plan now.</seg>
        <seg id="56">It was difficult to start rehearsing first again after the gymnastics hall opened.</seg>
        <seg id="57">We started slowly but are fully crawling again and I will increase the exercises steadily as the year progresses.</seg>
        <seg id="58">Of course, we don't know exactly how these games will be or whether they will be held, but we still practice considering that they will be, can't help it.</seg>
        <seg id="59">I've worked too hard to leave the sport now, "says Biles.</seg>
        <seg id="60">With her, like others, there is doubt or perhaps rather awareness that there may be a situation where the matches will not be held at all in 2021 either.</seg>

        <seg id="1">Will the Olympic fire be the light at the end of the tunnel?</seg>
        <seg id="2">After a final decision had been taken to postpone the Olympic Games, events that only world wars have hailed until now, the president of the International Olympic Committee said that the famous Olympic fire would be "the light at the end of the tunnel," and referred there presumably to the pandemic of the coronavirus that the world now passes through together.</seg>
        <seg id="3">The achievements have a year in addition to prepare themselves and the authorities of Japan compensate for the costs of the delay.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Everyone, however, keeps heads end a lot at stake.</seg>
        <seg id="5">When it was announced that Tokyo in Japan would become the venue of the Olympics this year, the cheers of the Japanese representatives were genuine.</seg>
        <seg id="6">They cried and laughed alternately, as Tokyo had applied to keep the games 2016 but bent it to a lower hold for Rio in Brazil.</seg>
        <seg id="7">This time Tokyo City and Japan should bathe in the attention of the world.</seg>
        <seg id="8">The games were scheduled to take place on 24 July to 9 August, but have been postponed for a year and start instead of 23 July 2021 and end on 8 August.</seg>
        <seg id="9">If the games fail to be held then, if the coronavirus still becomes too much threat, the games will be stopped.</seg>
        <seg id="10">No one wants to think that thought to the end.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Olympics are no ordinary sports competition.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Nothing is saved, the show should always be magnificent and strive to top the last play.</seg>
        <seg id="13">The choice of city for Olympics is based on the evaluation of the selection committee on the promotions of the cities.</seg>
        <seg id="14">The more magnificent the presentation is - the greater the chance of getting snooped.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Tokyo spent $150 million trying to get hold of the 2016 Olympics or amounting to roughly $20 billion.</seg>
        <seg id="16">The second time, when applying for the 2020 Games, $75 million, about ten billion, was put into the presentation.</seg>
        <seg id="17">In 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo received the plays this year, the Japanese authorities had thus already spent an amount of 30 billion ISK to the project.</seg>
        <seg id="18">But that amount is, however, just a drop in the sea compared to what it costs to build Olympic villages, stadiums and generally to strengthen the country's infrastructure to recruit such tournaments, prepare it and keep the games themselves.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Organizers in Japan have said that the Tokyo Olympics, which should have been running these days but has been postponed by one year due to the coronavirus, would have cost $12.6 billion.</seg>
        <seg id="20">However, a report from a state auditor in Japan published at the end of last year stated that the cost was closer to double that figure.</seg>
        <seg id="21">The cost of suspending the games will likely not be fully estimated, but it has been estimated that it can cost between two and six billion dollars in addition to the initial cost.</seg>
        <seg id="22">The total cost for the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could therefore run between $15 and $30 billion.</seg>
        <seg id="23">There are so high numbers that all the tax revenues of the Icelandic state only settled for about nearly half the Olympics, based on the lowest possible cost.</seg>
        <seg id="24">Olympics are an event of the magnitude that they have often become a topic of the economists, who try to review the numbers and examine the benefits and benefits of the games.</seg>
        <seg id="25">In the shortest case, pretty many people seem to have concluded that the impact of the Olympics is less than so positive for the economy of the cities that hold them.</seg>
        <seg id="26">Short-term effects are some, for example, the number of jobs increases very much in the short term, but in the long term cities often sit up with debt halves and the threat-high operating costs of small used structures.</seg>
        <seg id="27">Rio in Brazil sits up with significant debts due to the 2016 games and has been having trouble costing maintenance on all the big sports facilities built for the games.</seg>
        <seg id="28">The figures have been recorded after the London 2012 Games, but it has been revealed that only 10 percent of those who received employment related to the Olympic Games in the city were unemployed before.</seg>
        <seg id="29">This means that there were no new jobs except to a small extent.</seg>
        <seg id="30">In general, cities have not come particularly well out of the financial holding of Olympics because of the slacking costs associated with the power plants built for the actors.</seg>
        <seg id="31">However, the benefits are often considered to consist of increased traffic of tourists who want to visit the Olympic cities following the Games, which, however, is a major uncertainty regarding the 2021 Games.</seg>
        <seg id="32">It is also uncertain whether all the number of viewers usually attending the games will be accepted.</seg>
        <seg id="33">The main issue is, however, the honor that the cities must be chosen, but it is difficult to value for money.</seg>
        <seg id="34">Therefore, despite the huge cost, it can also be said that the joy that the games bring is not of the nature that it can be placed on a price tag.</seg>
        <seg id="35">But although the exhibition is often magnificent and nowhere to be saved, this is of course not just about money.</seg>
        <seg id="36">There are the sports heroes that are in the foreground.</seg>
        <seg id="37">For some achievement people, it is surprisingly just welcome to postpone the games.</seg>
        <seg id="38">The Australian five-player and gold medalist in his article on the site of the Olympic Games, Chloe Esposito, is, for example, a cosmopolitan and would have been removed from good oldness this summer but does not expect to be in the competition form for the 2021 Games.</seg>
        <seg id="39">She is therefore among those athletes who are just rather happy with the postponement, for understandable reasons.</seg>
        <seg id="40">For those athletes who planned to retire after the games this year, they would have been held on time, meaning the postponement of the games in some cases that they cancel competition before the games take place.</seg>
        <seg id="41">Trust their body simply not in order to go through more years of rigorous exercises.</seg>
        <seg id="42">Few athletes were equally well placed in the hearts of the audience at the 2016 Olympics and the fiction star Simone Biles.</seg>
        <seg id="43">She came home with four gold around her neck and one bronze.</seg>
        <seg id="44">Biles has attended several interviews in his home country US lately to discuss the Olympics.</seg>
        <seg id="45">She plans to play 2021, but she is not necessarily sure she can still be on top of the games next year, as she will be 24 years old.</seg>
        <seg id="46">Although it is generally not considered a high age, it is higher for a fictional woman in the front row.</seg>
        <seg id="47">"This is a sensitive issue," says Biles, but smiles out in another interview published on the Olympic Committee's Instagram page asking if she intends to achieve as long as she did in Rio 2016.</seg>
        <seg id="48">"I honestly do not know if I will still be on top after a whole year in addition of exercises," says Biles.</seg>
        <seg id="49">She has previously spoken that her body does not tolerate the stress that follows gymnastic training much longer.</seg>
        <seg id="50">Nevertheless, she practices off the race for the Olympics 2021.</seg>
        <seg id="51">Biles admits that there has been an unpleasant feeling of having to stop suddenly exercising when the pandemic lasted as high as the gymnasium was closed.</seg>
        <seg id="52">There were no exemptions for Biles rather than others while all sports facilities were closed for seven weeks.</seg>
        <seg id="53">All her Olympics could not buy any access beyond the others, she had to find various ways to keep herself in shape like others.</seg>
        <seg id="54">The basic form certainly a little better than in most people.</seg>
        <seg id="55">"We have a rigid plan now.</seg>
        <seg id="56">It was difficult to start exercising first again after the gymnasium opened.</seg>
        <seg id="57">We started slowly but are on full slip again and I will increase the exercises steadily as the year goes on.</seg>
        <seg id="58">We of course do not know quite how these games will be or whether they will be held but we still practice considering that they will be, can not otherwise.</seg>
        <seg id="59">I have put too much on myself to leave the sport now," says Biles.</seg>
        <seg id="60">With it like more, doubts or perhaps rather conscious that the situation may arise that the games will not be held at all in 2021 either.</seg>
        <seg id="61">However, predicting it is hopeless.</seg>
        <seg id="62">No one can know how the situation of the coronavirus pandemic will be in July 2021 and nothing else to do than prepare for the Olympics considering they will be held that year.</seg>
        <seg id="63">Perhaps the Olympic fire will be the light at the end of the Covid corridors.</seg>

        <seg id="3">High achievers have an extra year to prepare, and Japanese authorities are absorbing the cost of the delay.</seg>

        <seg id="6">They alternately cried and laughed, as Tokyo had applied to host the 2016 Games but bowed out in favor of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.</seg>
        <seg id="7">This time, Tokyo and Japan were to bask in the world's attention.</seg>

        <seg id="9">If the Games cannot be held then, if the coronavirus still poses too great a threat, the Games will be cancelled.</seg>

        <seg id="12">No expense is spared, the show should always be spectacular and strive to top the last play.</seg>
        <seg id="13">The selection of a city for the Olympic Games is based on the selection committee's assessment of the cities' presentations.</seg>
        <seg id="14">The more spectacular the presentation - the higher the chance of winning.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Tokyo spent $150 million trying to win the right to host the 2016 Olympics.</seg>
        <seg id="16">The second time, when bidding for the 2020 Games, $75 million was put into the promotion.</seg>
        <seg id="17">In 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo would host the Games this year, the Japanese authorities had already spent 30 billion crowns on the project.</seg>

        <seg id="19">Organizers in Japan have said the Tokyo Olympics, which should have been underway by now but have been postponed for a year because of the coronavirus, would have cost $12.6 billion.</seg>

        <seg id="1">Will the Olympics be the light at the end of the tunnel?</seg>
        <seg id="2">After a final decision had been made to postpone the Olympics, an event that only world wars have streamlined until now, the president of the International Olympic Committee said that the famous Olympic flame would be “the light at the end of the tunnel,” referring presumably to a pandemic coronavirus that the world is now following through together.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Affluent people have another year to prepare, and authorities in Japan are adding to the cost of the delay.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Everyone keeps their heads down, though, with a lot at stake.</seg>
        <seg id="5">When it was announced that Tokyo, Japan, would be the venue for this year's Olympics, the celebrations of the Japanese representatives were genuine.</seg>
        <seg id="6">They wept and laughed in turn, as Tokyo had applied to hold the 2016 Games but bowed out of the time to Rio in Brazil.</seg>
        <seg id="7">This time, Tokyo City and Japan should bathe in the world's attention.</seg>
        <seg id="8">The games were due to take place from July 24 to August 9, but have been postponed for a year, starting instead on July 23, 2021 and ending on August 8.</seg>
        <seg id="9">If the Games cannot be held then, if the coronavirus still becomes too much of a threat, the Games will be cancelled.</seg>
        <seg id="10">No one quite wants to think that thought through, though.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Olympics are no ordinary sporting competition.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Nothing is saved, the show should always be amazing and seek to top the last few games.</seg>
        <seg id="13">The selection of a city for the Olympics is based on the selection committee's assessment of the cities' presentations.</seg>
        <seg id="14">The more spectacular the publicity — the more likely to get booed.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Tokyo spent $150 million trying to hold the 2016 Olympics, or roughly $20 billion.</seg>
        <seg id="16">The second time, when the 2020 Games were applied for, $75 million, about ten billion euros, was put into the presentation.</seg>
        <seg id="17">In 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo got the Games this year, Japanese authorities had thus already spent as much as ISK 30 billion on the project.</seg>
        <seg id="18">But at least that amount is just a drop in the ocean compared to how much it costs to build Olympic villages, stadiums and generally to strengthen the country's infrastructure to handle this kind of tournament, prepare it and hold the Games themselves.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Organizers in Japan have said the Tokyo Olympics, which should have been running these days but have been postponed for one year because of the coronavirus, would have cost $12.6 billion.</seg>
        <seg id="20">However, a report from Japan's auditor general released at the end of last year found that the cost was nearly double that figure.</seg>
        <seg id="21">It probably won't be possible to fully estimate the cost of postponing the games, but it has been estimated that it may cost between two and six billion dollars in addition to the original cost.</seg>
        <seg id="22">The total cost to the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could therefore run between $15 billion and $30 billion.</seg>
        <seg id="23">There are such large numbers that all of the Icelandic state’s tax revenues would only cover about half of the Olympics, given the lowest possible cost.</seg>
        <seg id="24">Olympics are an event of such magnitude that they have often become the subject of discussion by economists, who try to review numbers and examine the benefits and benefits of the Games.</seg>
        <seg id="25">In the shortest, it seems quite a lot of people have concluded that the impact of the Olympics is less than positive for the economy of the cities that hold them.</seg>
        <seg id="26">Short-term impacts are some, for example, jobs are growing very much in the short term, while longer-term cities tend to be stuck with debt tailwinds and the threatened running costs of little-used infrastructure.</seg>
        <seg id="27">Rio in Brazil is sitting on substantial debt for the 2016 Games and has been troubled by costly maintenance of all the major sports facilities built for the Games.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Figures have been analysed after the London 2012 Games, which have found that only 10 per cent of those who had jobs linked to the Olympics in the city were unemployed before.</seg>
        <seg id="29">This means that there were no new jobs except a small amount.</seg>
        <seg id="30">In general, cities have not been particularly well off financially holding Olympic Games because of the hefty costs associated with the structures built for the Games.</seg>
        <seg id="31">However, benefits are often thought to include an increase in tourist traffic who want to visit the Olympic cities following the Games, which is still highly uncertain regarding the 2021 Games.</seg>
        <seg id="32">It is also unclear whether the full number of spectators who usually attend the Games will be able to be accepted.</seg>
        <seg id="33">The central issue, though, is the honour afforded to the cities, which is hard to value for money.</seg>
        <seg id="34">Because despite the huge cost, you can also say that the joy the games bring is not the kind of thing that you can put on it a price tag.</seg>
        <seg id="35">But while the show tends to be grand and there's nowhere to save, of course it's not just about money.</seg>
        <seg id="36">It's the sporting heroes that are at the forefront.</seg>
        <seg id="37">For some accomplished people, inadvertently postponing the Games is just appealing.</seg>
        <seg id="38">For example, Australian five-time medallist and gold medallist in her pageant Olympics, Chloe Esposito, is casual and would have been away for the summer but is hoping to be in competitive shape for the 2021 Games.</seg>
        <seg id="39">So she's among the athletes who are just rather happy with the postponement, for understandable reasons.</seg>
        <seg id="40">For those athletes who planned to retire after this year's Games, had they been held on time, the postponement of the Games in some cases means they retire before the Games take place.</seg>
        <seg id="41">Simply don't trust your body in order to go through another year of rigorous exercise.</seg>
        <seg id="42">Few athletes established themselves as thoroughly in the hearts of spectators at the 2016 Rio Olympics as gymnastics star Simone Biles.</seg>
        <seg id="43">She came home with four golds around her neck and one bronze.</seg>
        <seg id="44">Biles has attended several interviews in his native United States in the past to discuss the Olympics.</seg>
        <seg id="45">She is planning for the 2021 Games, but she is not necessarily sure she will still be able to stay at the top of the Games next year, by which time she will be 24.</seg>
        <seg id="46">Although it is not generally considered advanced age, it is higher for a top-ranked gymnast.</seg>
        <seg id="47">"It's a sensitive issue," Biles says, while smiling at another in an interview posted on the Olympic Committee's Instagram page asked if she intends to reach as far in the 2021 Games as she did in Rio 2016.</seg>
        <seg id="48">“I honestly don’t know if I’ll still be at the top after another year of practice,” says Biles.</seg>
        <seg id="49">She has previously spoken about how her body can't stand the stress of gymnastics training for much longer.</seg>
        <seg id="50">Nevertheless, she is training hard for the 2021 Olympics.</seg>
        <seg id="51">Biles admits it was an uncomfortable feeling having to suddenly stop practicing when the pandemic stalled and the gym was closed.</seg>
        <seg id="52">There were no exemptions for Biles rather than others while all sports facilities were closed for seven weeks.</seg>
        <seg id="53">All her Olympics couldn't buy any access beyond the others, she had to find several ways to stay in shape like anyone else.</seg>
        <seg id="54">The basic form certainly is a little better than most people.</seg>

        <seg id="62">No one can know what the status of the coronavirus pandemic will be like in July 2021 and nothing else to do but prepare for the Olympics, considering they will be held a year.</seg>

        <seg id="40">For those athletes who planned to stop after the games in years, they would be held on time, it means the postponement of the games in some cases they quit the competition before the games will take place.</seg>
        <seg id="41">Trust their bodies simply do not have to go through years of rigorous exercises.</seg>
        <seg id="42">Few athletes came as thoroughly in the hearts of the audience at the Olympic games in Rio 2016 and fimleikastjarnan Simone Biles.</seg>
        <seg id="43">She came home with four gold around his neck and one bronze.</seg>
        <seg id="44">Biles has met in several interviews in his home country the united States recently to discuss the Olympics.</seg>
        <seg id="45">She intends on games 2021 than she is, though not necessarily sure that she will still be on the top of the games in the next year, the end will she then become 24 years old.</seg>
        <seg id="46">Although it is generally not considered a high age is the in a higher place for fimleikakonu in the front row.</seg>
        <seg id="47">"This is a sensitive issue," says Biles but smiles while out in the second in an interview which was published on the Instagram page of the olympic committee asked whether she seeks to achieve equidistant on the games 2021 and she did in Rio 2016.</seg>
        <seg id="48">"I just don't know if I'm still on top after an entire year in the addition of exercises," says Biles.</seg>
        <seg id="49">She has previously spoken about her body can't take the strain that accompanies fimleikaþjálfun much longer.</seg>
        <seg id="50">Nevertheless, practices, she of the warrior for the Olympics 2021.</seg>
        <seg id="51">Biles admits that it was an uncomfortable feeling to need to stop suddenly to exercise when heimsfaraldurinn stood as the highest and fimleikasalnum was closed.</seg>
        <seg id="52">No exceptions were for Biles rather than the other while all of the devices used for sports was closed for seven weeks.</seg>
        <seg id="53">All her olympic gold could not buy any access above the other, she had to find various ways to keep in shape like the others.</seg>
        <seg id="54">Grunnformið certainly a little bit better than most people.</seg>
        <seg id="55">"We have a firm plan now.</seg>
        <seg id="56">It was hard to start the first exercise again after fimleikasalurinn opened.</seg>
        <seg id="57">We started slowly but we are here on a full crawl again and I will increase the training steadily during the year.</seg>
        <seg id="58">Of course, we know not quite how these games will be or whether they will be held but we do still considering that they will be, can't another.</seg>
        <seg id="59">I am created to impose too much on me to leave the sport right now,“ says Biles.</seg>
        <seg id="60">With her like the others slumber efi or perhaps rather the consciousness of the post can come up to the games will be absolutely not host the 2021 either.</seg>
        <seg id="61">To predict it is, however, hopeless.</seg>
        <seg id="62">No one can know how the situation of a pandemic kórónuveirunnar will be in July 2021 and nothing else to do but to prepare for the olympic games considering that they will be held to a year.</seg>
        <seg id="63">Maybe it will be Ólympíueldurinn the light at the end of the Covid-tunnel.</seg>
