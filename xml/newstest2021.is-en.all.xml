        <seg id="2">Markaðsherferðin Looks Like You Need Iceland þykir hafa farið vel af stað og hróp og köll úti í náttúrunni eru farin að toga í fólk vítt og breitt um heiminn.</seg>
        <seg id="3">„Þið eigið kollgátuna, ég þarfnast Íslands,“ segir kona nokkur úti í hinum stóra heimi í athugasemdum við auglýsingu úr markaðsherferðinni Looks Like You Need Iceland á efnisveitunni YouTube.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Annar áhorfandi kveðst munu varðveita Ísland í hjarta sér um alla eilífð og ung kona segist beinlínis verða að komast sem fyrst til Íslands enda sé unnusti hennar búsettur þar.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Til allrar óhamingju er hún hins vegar í Bandaríkjunum og gerir því ráð fyrir að þurfa að bíða í einhverja mánuði enn.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Enn einn áhorfandi spyr hvort gönguleiðin til Íslands sé fær, því engar séu flugvélarnar.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Ekki fylgir sögunni hvort hann kemur úr öðru tímabelti.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Egill Þórðarson hjá auglýsingastofunni Peel, sem kom að gerð auglýsinganna ásamt alþjóðlegu auglýsingastofunni M&amp;C Saatchi, segir viðtökur hafa verið vonum framar.</seg>
        <seg id="9">„Ég kom að mörgum Inspired By Iceland-herferðum sem gengið hafa mjög vel en þessi nýja herferð er þegar farin að slá met.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Í grunninn snýst þetta um að búa til PR-gildi, það er að fá erlenda fjölmiðla til að fjalla um herferðina, og það hefur gengið ótrúlega vel.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Á tiltölulega skömmum tíma höfum við fengið umfjöllun í um sjö hundruð fjölmiðlum um allan heim sem samtals ná til ríflega tveggja milljarða manna.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Verðmæti þeirrar umfjöllunar er verðlagt á 1,8 milljarða króna.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Það er ekki amalegt.“</seg>
        <seg id="14">Aðalmarkaðurinn alla jafna er Bandaríkin og hefur herferðin gengið mjög vel þar enda þótt Bandaríkjamenn séu ekki á leið til landsins í bráð.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Að sögn Egils hafa þekkt markaðssvæði eins og Danmörk, Bretland og Þýskaland einnig tekið vel við sér, eins Rússland, sem komi þægilega á óvart.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Þá hafi komið viðbrögð frá framandi svæðum, svo sem Indlandi, sem ekki var lagt sérstaklega upp með.</seg>
        <seg id="17">„Þessar auglýsingar hafa ferðast víðar en við bjuggumst við,“ segir Egill en þess má geta að yfir fjórar milljónir manna hafa horft á efnið á YouTube.</seg>
        <seg id="18">„Við hefðum ekki getað óskað eftir betri byrjun.“</seg>
        <seg id="19">Myndirnar hér á opnunni tók Árni Sæberg, ljósmyndari Morgunblaðins, við tökur á auglýsingum sem bera yfirskriftina „Let It Out“ um miðjan síðasta mánuð.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Tökurnar fóru fram vítt og breitt, svo sem á Skólavörðustígnum í Reykjavík, í Reynisfjöru, við Skógarfoss, á Sólheimajökli og í helli við Hjörleifshöfða.</seg>
        <seg id="21">Leikstjórar voru Samúel Bjarki Pétursson og Gunnar Páll Ólafsson hjá Skoti productions og tökumaður Óttar Guðnason.</seg>
        <seg id="22">Í hlutverkum í téðum tökum voru hin íslenska Anna Jia og Murphy Cardenas, sem er frá Kúbu og Ungverjalandi.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Tugir Íslendinga komu að gerð auglýsinganna en á sama tíma og upptökur fóru fram á Suðurlandi var annar hópur á Vesturlandi og Vestfjörðum.</seg>
        <seg id="24">Að sögn Egils er „Let It Out“ aðeins fyrsti liður í Looks Like You Need Iceland-herferðinni en stefnt er að vetrarherferð í samstarfi við M&amp;C Saatchi.</seg>
        <seg id="25">„Þetta er bara fyrsti fasinn í þessari vinnu fyrir Íslandsstofu,“ segir Egill og bætir við að samstarfið við M&amp;C Saatchi hafi gengið afskaplega vel.</seg>
        <seg id="26">„Það er frábært að vinna með þeim.</seg>
        <seg id="27">Í svona verkefnum skiptir miklu máli að hafa erlenda samstarfsaðila með þekkingu á þeim mörkuðum sem við erum að tala við.“</seg>

        <seg id="2">The marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland is considered to have gone off to a good start, and screaming and yelling in nature is beginning to pull in people all over the world.</seg>
        <seg id="3">"You're right, I need Iceland," says a woman somewhere in the world in the comments for an advertisement from the Looks Like You Need Iceland marketing campaign on YouTube.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Another viewer says they will keep Iceland in their heart for all eternity, and a young woman says she literally has to get to Iceland as soon as possible as her fiancé resides there.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Unfortunately, she's in the United States so she expects to have to wait for another few months.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Yet another viewer asks whether the walking route to Iceland is clear, because there are no aeroplanes.</seg>
        <seg id="7">It is left unsaid whether this person is from another time zone.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Egill Þórðarson at the advertising agency Peel, who was involved in making the advertisements along with the international advertising agency M&amp;C Saatchi, says that the response has exceeded all expectations.</seg>
        <seg id="9">"I was involved in many Inspired by Iceland campaigns that have been very successful but this new campaign is already breaking records.</seg>
        <seg id="10">This basically revolves around creating PR value, that is to get foreign media to cover the campaign, and that has been incredibly successful.</seg>
        <seg id="11">In a relatively short time, we have received coverage in about 700 media outlets all over the world, with a combined audience of over two billion.</seg>
        <seg id="12">The value of this coverage is estimated at ISK 1.8 billion.</seg>
        <seg id="13">That's not too bad."</seg>
        <seg id="14">The main market is usually the United States, and the campaign has been very successful there, although Americans are not coming to the country anytime soon.</seg>
        <seg id="15">According to Egill, well-known market areas like Denmark, the UK and Germany have also been responsive, as well as Russia, which is a pleasant surprise.</seg>
        <seg id="16">There has also been a response from remote areas, such as India, which was not a particular objective.</seg>
        <seg id="17">"These advertisements have travelled further than we expected," says Egill, and it may be pointed out that over four million people have watched the content on YouTube.</seg>
        <seg id="18">"We couldn't have wished for a better start."</seg>
        <seg id="19">The photographs in this spread were taken by Árni Sæberg, photographer for Morgunblaðið, during the shooting of the "Let It Out" advertisements in the middle of last month.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Shooting took place in various locations, including on Skólavörðustígur in Reykjavik, at Reynisfjara, Skógarfoss waterfall, on Sólheimajökull glacier and in a cave by Hjörleifshöfði.</seg>
        <seg id="21">Samúel Bjarki Pétursson and Gunnar Páll Ólafsson at Skoti productions directed and Óttar Guðnason was the cameraman.</seg>
        <seg id="22">Actors in these shoots were Anna Jia from Iceland and Murphy Cardenas, who is from Cuba and Hungary.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Tens of Icelanders were involved in making the advertisements, and while shooting was taking place in South Iceland, another crew was working in West Iceland and the Westfjords.</seg>
        <seg id="24">According to Egill, "Let It Out" is only the first part of the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign, with a winter campaign being planned in collaboration with M&amp;C Saatchi.</seg>
        <seg id="25">"This is only the first phase in this work for Promote Iceland," says Egill, adding that the collaboration with M&amp;C Saatchi has gone extremely well.</seg>
        <seg id="26">"It's great working with them.</seg>
        <seg id="27">It's very important in projects like this to have foreign partners who are knowledgable about the markets we're addressing."</seg>

        <seg id="2">According to a theory that has caught on online, there is a curse on the television series Glee, with actress Naya Rivera's recent drowning death in California making her the third lead actor in the series to die long before their time.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Glee is a popular series about song, dance and joy.</seg>
        <seg id="4">The series revolved around a so-called glee club for high school teenagers, their loves and their destinies.</seg>
        <seg id="5">It was not always easy to be in the glee club, but through song and dance, the characters in the series seemed to overcome all circumstances that arose in their lives.</seg>
        <seg id="6">But off the set, great tragedies have befallen the cast and crew of the series, to the extent that theories have began circulating about there being a curse on the series.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Naya Marie Rivera played the role of no-nonsense cheerleader Santana Lopez in the series.</seg>
        <seg id="8">After the conclusion of the series, Rivera married actor Ryan Dorsey and had with him her first and only child, Josey.</seg>
        <seg id="9">In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and they were subsequently divorced.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Dorsey refused to press charges, however, and the domestic violence case was dropped.</seg>
        <seg id="11">On 8 July of this year, Rivera was reported missing after her four-year old son was found drifting alone in a boat on Lake Piru in California.</seg>
        <seg id="12">The boy was found sleeping in a life jacket aboard the boat, and he was able to tell police authorities that he and his mother had dived into the water and River had then put him back in the boat but never returned there herself.</seg>
        <seg id="13">An extensive search for Rivera was launched.</seg>
        <seg id="14">The day after the search began, the chief of police in the area reported that the search was conducted according to the assumption that Rivera had drowned.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Five days later, Rivera was found and officially declared dead.</seg>
        <seg id="16">It is believed that she got caught up in a heavy current in the water and used her last remaining strength to save her son.</seg>
        <seg id="17">The cause of death was recorded as accidental drowning.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Cory Allan Michael Monteith played the role of Finn Hudson in the series, the American football player with the voice of angel who played a major role in Glee's success.</seg>
        <seg id="19">But outside the series, Moneith faced personal demons.</seg>
        <seg id="20">He had had addiction problems since the age of 13 and found it difficult to escape from them.</seg>
        <seg id="21">In 2013, his co-workers on the series had had enough and staged an intervention to encourage him to seek help.</seg>
        <seg id="22">Moneith subsequently entered rehab and everything seemed to be heading in the right direction.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Only two months after completing his rehab programme, Moneith was found dead in a hotel room after a night out partying with his friends.</seg>
        <seg id="24">The cause of death turned out to be a fatal mixture of drugs and alcohol.</seg>
        <seg id="25">The death was not believed to be intentional.</seg>
        <seg id="26">Moneith had been through rehab and his tolerance for intoxicants had become so low that a dose that he could easily tolerate before now proved to be fatal.</seg>
        <seg id="27">He was only 31 years old when he passed away.</seg>
        <seg id="28">His death was a great shock to his co-workers, but at the instigation of his co-star Lea Michele, the decision was made to continue shooting the series, with an entire episode dedicated to the memory of Moneith and his character, Finn.</seg>
        <seg id="29">In the series, Mark Wayne Salling played the role of Noah „Puck“ Puckerman, who played American football, like Finn, and had little respect for his fellow students in the glee club, that is until he worked up the courage to admit that he liked singing and dancing.</seg>
        <seg id="30">Two years later, Salling was arrested at his Los Angeles home, suspected of possessing child pornography.</seg>
        <seg id="31">A search of his home revealed enormous quantities of child pornography and the matter soon became public knowledge.</seg>
        <seg id="32">It was obvious that Salling was done.</seg>
        <seg id="33">He was subsequently charged and convicted for his violations.</seg>
        <seg id="34">He was facing four to seven years of prison time, as well as being placed on a register of sex offenders and having to seek treatment for paedophilia.</seg>
        <seg id="35">Before the judge had passed a sentence, Salling, who was out on bail, was found dead near his home.</seg>
        <seg id="36">The cause of death was suicide.</seg>
        <seg id="37">Cast members were not the only ones to die untimely deaths.</seg>
        <seg id="38">Jim Fuller was an assistant director on the series.</seg>
        <seg id="39">He died unexpectedly in his sleep, only 41 years of age.</seg>
        <seg id="40">A woman named Nancy Motes also worked on the series.</seg>
        <seg id="41">She was the younger sister of superstar Julia Roberts and did not speak fondly of her sister, accusing Roberts of being highly controlling and behaving disrespectfully.</seg>
        <seg id="42">Motes, who battled serious depression, took her own life in 2014.</seg>
        <seg id="43">She left a note to her fiancé where she accused her mother and sister of being among the ones responsible for her situation.</seg>
        <seg id="44">“I leave nothing to my mother and so-called siblings except the memory that they were the cause of my worst depression.”</seg>
        <seg id="45">Lea Michel was the star of the series.</seg>
        <seg id="46">She has recently been accused of bullying her co-stars, being aggressive on set and displaying excessive diva-like behaviour.</seg>
        <seg id="47">Jesse Luken had a guest role on the series in 2012.</seg>
        <seg id="48">In 2019, he was arrested and charged with drunk driving, which was considered a huge scandal.</seg>
        <seg id="49">Actress Heather Morris had a major role in the series.</seg>
        <seg id="50">In 2010, unscrupulous computer hackers obtained nude photographs of her and published them online.</seg>
        <seg id="51">Actors Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner both had roles in the series and had an off-screen affair.</seg>
        <seg id="52">Benoist later revealed that Jenner had been abusive towards her during their relationship.</seg>

        <seg id="29">Mark Wayne Salling played the role of Noah "Puck" Puckerman in the series, Puck was an American football player, like Finn, and had little respect for his colleagues in the Joy Orchestra, or until he gained the courage to admit that he enjoyed singing and dancing.</seg>
        <seg id="30">Two years later, Salling was arrested at his home in Los Angeles suspected of child pornography custody.</seg>
        <seg id="31">An enormous amount of child pornography was found during a search at his house, and the case was soon heard in public.</seg>
        <seg id="32">It was clear that Salling was done.</seg>
        <seg id="33">He was subsequently charged and convicted of his offences.</seg>
        <seg id="34">He had four to seven years in prison as well as having to be on the sex offenders' register and seek treatment for childcare.</seg>
        <seg id="35">Before the judge had determined the punishment, Salling, who was then on bail, was found dead near his home.</seg>
        <seg id="36">The cause of death was suicide.</seg>
        <seg id="37">It wasn't just the actors of the series who fell off far in advance.</seg>
        <seg id="38">Jim Fuller was Assistant Director of the series.</seg>
        <seg id="39">He was urgently summoned to sleep in 2013, at the age of 41.</seg>
        <seg id="40">A woman named Nancy Motes also worked on the series.</seg>
        <seg id="41">She was the younger sister of superstar Julia Roberts and didn't bear her sister the beautiful story, but she accused Roberts of her great control and degrading behaviour.</seg>
        <seg id="42">Motes took her own life in 2014, but she struggled with severe depression.</seg>
        <seg id="43">She left a letter to her fiancé saying that her mother and sister were responsible, among other things, for how she was arranged.</seg>
        <seg id="44">"My mother and my so-called siblings get nothing after me except the memory that they were the ones who caused my worst depression."</seg>
        <seg id="45">Leah Michel was the star of the series.</seg>
        <seg id="46">She has recently been accused of bullying and aggressing her co-stars on set and having aggressive observatories.</seg>
        <seg id="47">Jesse Luken played a guest role on the series in 2012.</seg>
        <seg id="48">He was arrested and charged with drunk driving in 2019, which was considered a major scandal.</seg>
        <seg id="49">Actress Heather Morris played a major role in the series.</seg>
        <seg id="50">She suffered in 2010 from unorthodox hackers getting into nude photos of her and publishing them on the Internet.</seg>
        <seg id="51">Actors Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner both starred on the series and had an affair outside the series.</seg>
        <seg id="52">Benoist later reported that Jenner violated her in the relationship.</seg>

        <seg id="2">„Ég held við séum ekki margir sjómenn sem störfum á leikskólum landsins,“ segir Axel Örn Guðmundsson, sem stundar strandveiðar á sumrin en nemur sálfræði við Háskóla Íslands yfir vetrartímann.“</seg>
        <seg id="3">Strandveiðar eru mjög þægilegt sumarstarf þegar maður er í námi.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Ef vel fiskast er hægt að hafa góðar tekjur og mér finnst frábært að geta sleppt því að taka námslán.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Tekjurnar duga mér líka vel inn í veturinn,“ segir Axel Örn Guðmundsson, 25 ára sálfræðinemi, sem stundar strandveiðar í sumar eins og undanfarin sumur.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Axel var nýlagstur að bryggju á Tálknafirði þegar blaðamaður náði tali af honum seint að kveldi í upphafi vikunnar.“</seg>
        <seg id="7">„Veturinn sem ég var í tíunda bekk tók ég skipstjórnarréttindi fyrir báta sem eru undir tólf metra langir og ég keypti bátinn minn sumarið eftir að ég kláraði grunnskólann.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Ég hef stundað strandveiðar á mínum báti öll sumur síðan.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Ég keypti bátinn notaðan af kunningja mínum, Hartmanni Jónssyni, og ég lét bátinn heita nafninu hans.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Hartmann var orðinn fullorðinn þegar ég keypti bátinn og hættur að vera til sjós og hann var mjög sáttur þegar hann sá að báturinn bar nafn hans.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Hartmann lést nokkrum árum eftir að ég tók við bátnum,“ segir Axel og bætir við að hann hafi keypt bátinn á þrjár milljónir.</seg>
        <seg id="12">„Ég gerði samning við Hartmann um að borga helminginn, eina og hálfa milljón, í upphafi sumars en hinn helminginn í lok sumars þegar ég væri búinn að veiða.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Ég átti því bátinn skuldlausan í lok þessa fyrsta sumars míns á honum.“</seg>
        <seg id="14">En hvernig gat strákur átt eina og hálfa milljón til að borga út í báti þegar hann hafði nýlokið grunnskóla?</seg>
        <seg id="15">„Ég var búinn að leggja fyrir og safna mér pening, ég hafði verið að vinna með pabba til sjós þegar ég var strákur, ég var öll sumur að veiða með honum og fékk minn hlut.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Ég setti líka fermingarpeningana mína í bátasjóðinn minn.“</seg>
        <seg id="17">Axel er fæddur á Ísafirði, þaðan sem allt hans móðurfólk er, en hann hefur búið í Kópavogi frá því hann var strákur.</seg>
        <seg id="18">„Ég má veiða hér á vestursvæðinu af því að ég er með lögheimili hjá ömmu minni á Ísafirði.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Ég lærði á þessi svæði hér fyrir vestan af róðrum með pabba.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Ég færi mig á milli fjarða eftir því hvernig mér líður, því þetta veiðisvæði nær yfir alla Vestfirðina.</seg>
        <seg id="21">Þó að mér finnist best að vera fyrir vestan hef ég líka veitt í kringum Snæfellsnesið og víðar.</seg>
        <seg id="22">Ég hef líka veitt fyrir sunnan en þá helst grásleppu,“ segir Axel, sem rær alltaf einn eldsnemma að morgni og segist stundum tala við mávana og syngja fyrir himininn, í einverunni tímunum saman úti á ballarhafi.</seg>
        <seg id="23">„Netsambandið úti á hafi er gott, svo ég get hringt, hlustað á hlaðvarpsþætti og tónlist.</seg>
        <seg id="24">Mér finnst ekkert mál að vera einn á báti.</seg>
        <seg id="25">Auðvitað reyni ég að forðast að lenda í háska, en vissulega hefur einstaka sinnum eitthvað verið að veðri, en aldrei mikil hætta,“ segir Axel, sem er heppinn með það að hann er aldrei sjóveikur.</seg>
        <seg id="26">Hann segir lengd vinnudagsins fara eftir því hvernig veiðarnar gangi hverju sinni.</seg>
        <seg id="27">„Í strandveiðinni er ég aldrei meira en 14 tíma á veiðum í einu, en ég hef líka verið að veiða í öðrum kerfum, til dæmis í leigukvótanum, en þá hef ég verið samfellt í einn og hálfan sólarhring í beit úti á sjó að veiða.“</seg>
        <seg id="28">Fyrirkomulagið í strandveiðum segir hann vera þannig að hann megi veiða 770 kíló á dag, sem honum finnst hamlandi.</seg>
        <seg id="29">„Aðrar hömlur eru þær að ég má ekki veiða föstudaga, laugardaga og sunnudaga, og ég má aðeins veiða tólf daga í mánuði, þessa fjóra mánuði sem strandveiðar standa yfir, í maí, júní, júlí og ágúst.</seg>
        <seg id="30">Að mínu mati ættu sjómenn að velja sína veiðidaga eftir veðri og engu öðru.</seg>
        <seg id="31">Þessi óþarfa pressa er á menn að róa í stað þess að hafa 48 daga yfir allt sumarið og geta valið eftir sínu höfði.</seg>
        <seg id="32">Svo mætti svæðisskiptingin fara líka mín vegna og sjávarpláss sem eru vel staðsett við fiskimið ættu að fá að njóta þess,“ segir Axel, sem dregur mestmegnis þorsk úr söltum sjó á strandveiðum sínum, en líka aðeins ufsa og einstaka aðrar tegundir fljóta með.</seg>
        <seg id="33">Axel vinnur yfir vetrartímann með háskólanáminu á leikskólanum Núpi í Kópavogi.</seg>
        <seg id="34">„Ég held við séum ekki margir sjómenn sem störfum á leikskólum landsins,“ segir Axel stoltur og bætir við að hann hafi aðeins ætlað að vinna tímabundið á leikskólanum.</seg>
        <seg id="35">„Ég festist þar af því að mér finnst þetta æðislegt starf.</seg>
        <seg id="36">Ég vona að sálfræðinámið nýtist mér á leikskólastiginu í framtíðinni,“ segir Axel, sem einnig er langt kominn með nám í viðskiptafræði.</seg>

        <seg id="1">Bought a boat after tenth grade</seg>
        <seg id="2">"I don't think there's many of us sailors working in the country's preschools," says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, who is an inshore fisherman in the summer and studies psychology at the University of Iceland in winter.</seg>
        <seg id="3">"Inshore fishing is a very comfortable summer job when you're a student.</seg>
        <seg id="4">You can have a good income if the fishing is good, and I think it's great to be able to avoid taking student loans.</seg>
        <seg id="5">My income also lasts well into the winter," says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, a 25-year old psychology student who works as an inshore fisherman this summer, like in previous summers.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Axel had just docked in the Tálknafjörður harbour when this reporter met up with him late one evening at the start of the week.</seg>
        <seg id="7">"During my 10th grade winter, I got a licence to skipper boats under 12 metres in length, and I bought my boat in the summer after I finished elementary school.</seg>
        <seg id="8">I have been inshore fishing on my boat every summer since then.</seg>
        <seg id="9">I bought a used boat from my acquaintance, Hartmann Jónsson, and named the boat after him.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Hartmann was getting on in years and had retired from fishing by the time I bought his boat, and he was very pleased when he saw that the boat bore his name.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Hartmann died a few years after I took over the boat," says Axel, adding that he bought the boat for three million.</seg>
        <seg id="12">"I made an agreement with Hartmann to pay half, one and a half million, at the beginning of summer and the other half at the end of summer, when I was done fishing.</seg>
        <seg id="13">So I owned the boat, debt-free, at the end of my first summer on it."</seg>
        <seg id="14">But how could a boy own one and a half million to use as a down payment on a boat when he had just finished elementary school?</seg>
        <seg id="15">"I had saved and raised money, I went out to sea with my dad when I was a boy, I spent all summers fishing with him and got my share.</seg>
        <seg id="16">I also put the money from my confirmation into my boat fund."</seg>
        <seg id="17">Axel was born in Ísafjörður, the home of all his maternal relatives, but has lived in Kópavogur since he was a boy.</seg>
        <seg id="18">"I'm allowed to fish here in the western area because my domicile is with my grandmother in Ísafjörður.</seg>
        <seg id="19">I learned about these spots out here in the west from going fishing with my dad.</seg>
        <seg id="20">I move from fjord to fjord according to how I feel, because this fishing zone extends across the entire Westfjords.</seg>
        <seg id="21">Although I think it's best to be out west, I have also fished around Snæfellsnes and in other places.</seg>
        <seg id="22">I have also gone fishing down south, but then it's mainly lumpfish," says Axel, who always sails out alone in the very early hours of the morning and says that he'll sometimes talk to the seagulls and sing to the sky in his hours of solitude in the middle of the ocean.</seg>
        <seg id="23">"There's good internet connection out at sea so I can make calls and listen to podcasts and music.</seg>
        <seg id="24">I don't find it difficult at all to be alone on the boat.</seg>
        <seg id="25">Of course I try to avoid danger, but there have certainly been instances of something going wrong with the weather, although never any great risk," says Axel, who is lucky in that he is never seasick.</seg>
        <seg id="26">He says that the length of the working day depends on how the fishing goes each time.</seg>
        <seg id="27">"In inshore fishing, I never spend more than 14 hours fishing at a time, but I have also been fishing according to other systems, the hired quota system, for instance, where I have been out at sea fishing for one and a half days without interruption.</seg>
        <seg id="28">He says that according to the inshore fishing arrangement, he's allowed to catch 770 kilos per day, which he feels is restrictive.</seg>
        <seg id="29">"Other restrictions are not being allowed to fish on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, and I'm only allowed to fish for twelve days a month for the four months of inshore fishing, May, June, July and August.</seg>
        <seg id="30">I believe that sailors should pick their fishing days according to the weather and nothing else.</seg>
        <seg id="31">There is this unnecessary pressure to go out fishing instead of having 48 days over the whole summer and being able to pick them as you please.</seg>
        <seg id="32">I also wouldn't mind if the division into zones would stop, in which case the fishing villages that are ideally located close to fishing grounds should be allowed to reap the benefits," says Axel, whose main catch in his inshore fishing is cod, along with some saithe and the occasional other species.</seg>
        <seg id="33">During the winter, Axel works at the preschool Núpur in Kópavogur alongside his university studies.</seg>
        <seg id="34">"I don't think there's many of us sailors working in the country's preschools," says Axel with pride, adding that he only intended to work temporarily at the preschool.</seg>
        <seg id="35">"I got stuck there because I think it's a wonderful job.</seg>
        <seg id="36">I hope that the psychology studies will be useful for me at the preschool level," says Axel, who is also well on his way in his business administration studies.</seg>

        <seg id="3">Coastal fishing is a very comfortable summer job when you are studying.</seg>
        <seg id="4">If you fish well, you can have a good income and I think it's great to be able to skip taking out a student loan.</seg>
        <seg id="5">The income is also good enough for me into the winter, "says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, a 25-year-old psychology student who is engaged in coastal fishing this summer as in previous summers.</seg>

        <seg id="29">"Other restrictions are that I am not allowed to fish Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, and I am only allowed to fish twelve days a month, during the four months of coastal fishing, in May, June, July and August.</seg>
        <seg id="30">In my opinion, fishermen should choose their days of fishing depending on the weather and nothing else.</seg>
        <seg id="31">This unnecessary pressure is on people to row instead of having 48 days all summer and be able to choose in their own way.</seg>
        <seg id="32">This could also be enjoyed by the regionalization because of me, and marine space that is well located by the fishing grounds should be enjoyed, "says Axel, who mainly reduces cod from salted sea water during his coastal fishing, but also only sauna and individual other species float along.</seg>
        <seg id="33">Axel works for the winter with the university program at Nupur kindergarten in Kópavogur.</seg>
        <seg id="34">"I don't think we're many sailors working in the country's kindergartens," says Axel proudly, adding that he only intended to work temporarily in the kindergarten.</seg>
        <seg id="35">"I got stuck there because I think it's an awesome job.</seg>
        <seg id="36">I hope that psychology will benefit me at kindergarten level in the future, "says Axel, who has also come a long way since his studies in business administration.</seg>

        <seg id="2">Devon Brumfield could hear through the phone how difficult it was for her father to catch his breath.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Her father had diabetes so she urged him to seek medical care.</seg>
        <seg id="4">The next day he was dead.</seg>
        <seg id="5">His death was traced to acute respiratory distress from coronavirus infection.</seg>
        <seg id="6">His death certificate noted diabetes as an underlying condition and Brumfield, who also has diabetes, is terrified of meeting the same fate.</seg>
        <seg id="7">According to Reuters, Brumfield's fear is not unfounded.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Figures from a new study commissioned by the US government show that nearly 40% of those who have died had type 2 diabetes as an underlying condition.</seg>
        <seg id="9">When looking at those who had not reached the age of 65, the proportion increases to half.</seg>
        <seg id="10">The study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) extended to over 10,000 people in 15 states who died from the coronavirus during the period between February and May.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Jonathan Wortham, an epidemiologist with the CDC, said that the findings were striking, not least for those who have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and their loved ones.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Was a slow-moving pandemic Reuters commissioned a survey where the answers from the 12 states that responded indicate a similar rate.</seg>
        <seg id="13">10 states, including California, Arizona and Columbia, have not yet began reporting underlying conditions.</seg>
        <seg id="14">"Diabetes was already a slow-moving pandemic.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Now COVID-19 has crashed through like a powerful wave," said Elbert Huang, director of the University of Chicago's Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy, to Reuters.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Diabetes is more common among Blacks and Latinos, who have also suffered more from the coronavirus.</seg>
        <seg id="17">One of the best defences for those who have type 2 diabetes is to keep the disease under control with exercise, a healthy diet and the assistance of healthcare workers.</seg>
        <seg id="18">However, the coronavirus pandemic has made it difficult for many to maintain a routine.</seg>
        <seg id="19">The high price of insulin has also forced some people to keep showing up for work, thereby risking virus exposure.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Reuters points out that US authorities should have been aware of the high risk that the virus may pose to type 2 diabetes patients.</seg>
        <seg id="21">During the SARS coronavirus outbreak of 2003, more than 20% of fatalities had the disease, and in the swine flu pandemic of 2009, this group faced triple the risk of hospitalisation.</seg>
        <seg id="22">And when MERS emerged in 2012, one study showed that 60% of those who died or were admitted to intensive care units had diabetes.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Charles S. Dela Cruz, researcher at Yale University says that because the effects of the COVID-19 virus last longer, the pandemic may unearth a number of previously unknown complications.</seg>

        <seg id="1">"We were offered champagne, then they left the room"</seg>
        <seg id="2">Husband and wife Atli Bollason and Ásrún Magnúsdóttir agreed to an unusual request from artist Ragnar Kjartansson: to have sex in front of a camera for an exhibition that the artist was mounting in Paris.</seg>
        <seg id="3">"We loved each other so this was not complicated."</seg>
        <seg id="4">Atli Bollason never forgets meeting his wife and mother of his children, Ásrún Magnúsdóttir, for the first time.</seg>
        <seg id="5">"I became very infatuated with her.</seg>
        <seg id="6">There was her charisma, of course, but I also thought she was just incredibly cute.</seg>
        <seg id="7">And I still think so," he says.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Ásrún also remembers this, as her husband regularly reminisces about their first encounter.</seg>
        <seg id="9">"I'm always hearing this story.</seg>
        <seg id="10">The last time was just this weekend," says Ásrún, who was also attracted to her husband when they first met.</seg>
        <seg id="11">"I felt, and still feel, that there's so much excitement around Atli, which I like.</seg>
        <seg id="12">There's a lot going on and much happening and I was charmed by that."</seg>
        <seg id="13">Atli says that in their relationship, the couple have focused on going their own way.</seg>
        <seg id="14">"We don't tread the well-worn paths.</seg>
        <seg id="15">We avoid the routines that we can detect around us."</seg>
        <seg id="16">That may be why they simply welcomed artist Kjartan Ragnarsson's request, despite it being unusual, to put it mildly.</seg>
        <seg id="17">"Our mutual friend, Kristín Anna, contacted us to ask whether we could join her, Raggi and Ragnar's wife, Ingibjörg, for desserts at Snaps."</seg>
        <seg id="18">They accepted the invitation, met the trio at Snaps and had dessert wine and one dessert each.</seg>
        <seg id="19">They listened to Ragnar, who talked them through his plans for the art exhibition that he intended to mount at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris that autumn.</seg>
        <seg id="20">"He had a multi-channel video installation called Scenes from Western Culture.</seg>
        <seg id="21">He described it in a simple manner."</seg>
        <seg id="22">According to Ásrún, he described the piece as banal and decadent scenes from the everyday life of Westerners.</seg>
        <seg id="23">"He had sketches of all the scenes that he intended to shoot and the last thing he told us about was the thing that he wanted to know whether we would be interested in taking part in."</seg>
        <seg id="24">The scene that Ragnar asked the couple to take part in was supposed to show a middle-class couple making love in a minimalistic room.</seg>
        <seg id="25">"It's intercourse with a beginning and end," says Atli.</seg>
        <seg id="26">The couple didn't know Ragnar well, although they were aware of him and he of them, "but they were familiar with us and felt that we were right for this.</seg>
        <seg id="27">They mentioned that they didn't want to advertise for people.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Maybe they thought that they wouldn't get the right people but rather people who receive sexual gratification from performing for others."</seg>
        <seg id="29">They said goodbye to Ragnar and agreed to think about the matter, but that didn't take long.</seg>
        <seg id="30">"As we walked out of Snaps we said: Aren't we up for this?</seg>
        <seg id="31">It was just like that.</seg>
        <seg id="32">I trust Ragnar as an artist, as well as his whole team," says Ásrún and Atli concurs.</seg>
        <seg id="33">"This is about the love and intimacy"</seg>
        <seg id="34">The scene was filmed in a fancy apartment at Mýrargata.</seg>
        <seg id="35">The crew was very small: a cameraman, Ragnar and a sound technician, and the couple.</seg>
        <seg id="36">When the recording had been turned on, everyone except Atli and Ásrún left the room to wait in a car outside.</seg>
        <seg id="37">"We hadn't decided anything about what we were going to be like.</seg>
        <seg id="38">We received some minor instructions, but we tried to forget the time and place.</seg>
        <seg id="39">To be unaware of what we were doing and for whom.</seg>
        <seg id="40">There was no acting, we just loved each other so it wasn't complicated," says Ásrún.</seg>
        <seg id="41">But was it romantic?</seg>
        <seg id="42">"Yes, it was a little romantic," says Atli, and Ásrún agrees.</seg>
        <seg id="43">„We were offered champagne before they left the room.</seg>
        <seg id="44">It was a little like being on vacation at a fancy hotel in Paris."</seg>
        <seg id="45">The crew was pleased with the couple's performance in the piece, and it moved them.</seg>
        <seg id="46">"Tommi the cameraman cried when he watched it, he thought it was so beautiful," says Atli.</seg>
        <seg id="47">"It's as much about the love and intimacy as about the intercourse itself," says Ásrún.</seg>
        <seg id="48">The couple's parents have seen the piece, and Atli says that his mother heard her son's voice at the Reykjavik Art Museum and then realised that he was part of the piece.</seg>
        <seg id="49">"Then she turned around and began to examine it," says Atli.</seg>
        <seg id="50">"Mom and dad saw it in Paris.</seg>
        <seg id="51">We hadn't told anyone about this, but then dad just sends me a message and says: It was fun to run into the little family in the Palais de Tokyo," Ásrún recalls.</seg>
        <seg id="52">And did taking part in the project deepen the relationship between Ásrún and Atli?</seg>
        <seg id="53">We're still together, anyway, so maybe it deepened something.</seg>
        <seg id="54">At least it deepened the relationship with my in-laws," says Ásrún with a laugh.</seg>
        <seg id="55">As for Ásrún, she saw the piece in Copenhagen with her colleague.</seg>
        <seg id="56">"I found it a little difficult to be with someone other than you," she says, turning to her husband.</seg>
        <seg id="57">"But it was fun to see it because it's just one scene in a much bigger piece and it's very impressive when you see it along with the other pieces.</seg>
        <seg id="58">I was able to detach myself a little from it, and I was just proud.</seg>
        <seg id="59">And there was the little bean in my belly," says Ásrún, who was pregnant with the couple's second child when the scene was shot.</seg>
        <seg id="60">"It was just beautiful."</seg>

        <seg id="2">Ásrún Magnúsdóttir and Atli Bollason received the unusual request from artist Ragnar Kjartansson to have sex in front of a camera for a work the artist was installing in Paris.</seg>
        <seg id="3">"We loved each other so it wasn't complicated."</seg>
        <seg id="4">Atli Bollason will never forget when he met his wife and infant daughter, Ásrún Magnúsdóttir, for the first time.</seg>
        <seg id="5">"I was very fascinated by her.</seg>

        <seg id="13">Atli says he and his wife focused on their relationship going their separate ways.</seg>

        <seg id="19">They listened to Ragnar, who led them through their plans at an art exhibition he planned to set up in the Palais de Tokyo in Paris in the autumn.</seg>
        <seg id="20">"He had a multichannel video project called Scenes from western culture.</seg>
        <seg id="21">He simply described it."</seg>
        <seg id="22">Ásrún says that he described the work as banal and dekadent scenes from the everyday lives of westerners.</seg>
        <seg id="23">"He had sketches of all the scenes he was going to shoot, and last time he told us about what he wanted to know if we were interested in getting involved."</seg>
        <seg id="24">The scene that Ragnar asked the pair to join was supposed to show young middle-class couples making love in a minimalist room.</seg>
        <seg id="25">"These are intercourse with the beginning and the end," says Atli.</seg>
        <seg id="26">The pair didn't know much, even though they knew about him and him of them "but they knew us and felt we fit in.</seg>
        <seg id="27">They had a word that they didn't want to advertise for people.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Maybe they thought they wouldn't get the right people, but people who would get sexual masturbation from performing for others.""</seg>
        <seg id="29">They said goodbye to Ragnar and agreed to think about it, but it didn't take long.</seg>
        <seg id="30">"When we walked out of Snaps, we said, aren't we just up for this?</seg>
        <seg id="31">It was just like that.</seg>
        <seg id="32">I trust Ragnar as an artist and his entire team," says Ásrún, and Atli takes over.</seg>
        <seg id="33">"It's about love and intimat"</seg>
        <seg id="34">The scene was filmed in a fancy apartment on The Mýrargata.</seg>
        <seg id="35">There was a very rare film team; cameraman, Ragnar and the sound man and the pair.</seg>
        <seg id="36">After the recording had been turned on, all left the room to wait in the car except Atli and Ásrún.</seg>
        <seg id="37">'We hadn't decided anything what we should be like.</seg>
        <seg id="38">We had some little instructions, but we tried to forget a moment and a place.</seg>
        <seg id="39">To be unaware of what we were doing and for whom.</seg>
        <seg id="40">There was nothing played, we just loved each other so it wasn't complicated," says Asrún.</seg>
        <seg id="41">But was it romantic?</seg>
        <seg id="42">"Yes, it was a little romantic," says Atli, and Asrún agrees.</seg>
        <seg id="43">"We were offered champagne before they left the room.</seg>
        <seg id="44">It was a little bit like being on vacation in a fancy paris hotel."</seg>
        <seg id="45">The team was pleased with the pair's performance in the work that moved them.</seg>
        <seg id="46">"When Cameraman Tom watched this, he cried, he thought it was so beautiful," says Atli.</seg>
        <seg id="47">"It's as much about love and intimacence as the actual intercourse," says Asrún.</seg>
        <seg id="48">The pair's parents have seen the work, and Atli says that his mother heard the voice in the son at the Reykjavík Art Museum and realized he was part of the piece.</seg>
        <seg id="49">"Then she turns around and starts thinking about this," says Atli.</seg>
        <seg id="50">"Mom and Dad saw it in Paris.</seg>
        <seg id="51">We hadn't told anyone like that, but then my dad just texts me and says, "Nice to bump into the little family in the Palais de Tokyo," Recalls Asrún.</seg>
        <seg id="52">And I wonder if the participation in the project deepened the relationship between Ásrún and Atli.</seg>
        <seg id="53">'At least we're still together so maybe it deepened something.</seg>
        <seg id="54">At least this deepened my relationship with my in-laws," says Asrún, laughing.</seg>
        <seg id="55">Ásrún herself saw the work in Copenhagen with her colleague.</seg>
        <seg id="56">"I found it a little difficult not to be with you but someone else," she says, turning to her husband.</seg>
        <seg id="57">'But it was nice to see this because it's just one scene in a much bigger piece and when you saw this with the other pieces it's really cool.</seg>
        <seg id="58">I was a little bit able to tear myself away from it and I was just proud.</seg>
        <seg id="59">And there was the little bean in my stomach," says Asrún, who was pregnant with the couple's second child when the scene was filmed.</seg>

        <seg id="36">After that the trigger had been at the recording left any room to wait outside in the car except Mr and Ásrún.</seg>
        <seg id="37">"We were not equipped to decide anything, how we should be.</seg>
        <seg id="38">We got some little instructions but we tried to forget time and place.</seg>
        <seg id="39">To be oblivious about what we were doing and for whom.</seg>
        <seg id="40">There was no play, we just loved each other so it was not complicated,“ says Ásrún.</seg>
        <seg id="41">But was this romantic?</seg>
        <seg id="42">"Yes, this was a little bit romantic," says Atli, and Ásrún agree with it.</seg>
        <seg id="43">"We were offered champagne before they went out of the room.</seg>
        <seg id="44">This was a little like being on vacation in a nice hotel in Paris.“</seg>
        <seg id="45">The team was happy with the performance of the couple in the job that moved them.</seg>
        <seg id="46">"When Tom the cameraman looked at this then cried he, him thought it was so beautiful," says Atli.</seg>
        <seg id="47">"It's as much about love and nándina and themselves the sexual experience," says Ásrún.</seg>
        <seg id="48">Parents of the couple have seen the work and says that his mom has heard the voice of the son of the Reykjavík Art museum and then realized that he was part of the job.</seg>
        <seg id="49">"Then she turns around and goes thinking in this," says Atli.</seg>
        <seg id="50">"Mom and dad saw this in Paris.</seg>
        <seg id="51">We had not told anyone this so but then it just sends dad me a message and says: Nice to come across a small family in the Palais de Tokyo,“ recalls Ásrún up.</seg>
        <seg id="52">And I wonder if participation in the work has deepened the relationship Ásrúnar and Atli?</seg>
        <seg id="53">"We are at least still together so maybe dýpkaði this something.</seg>
        <seg id="54">This dýpkaði at least my relationship with tengdafjölskylduna,“ says Ásrún and laughs.</seg>
        <seg id="55">Self sow Ásrún work in Copenhagen with their colleague.</seg>
        <seg id="56">"I felt a little hard to not be with you but someone else," she says and turns to the husband.</seg>
        <seg id="57">"But it was fun to see this because this is just one scene in a much larger work, and when the man saw this with the other works, this is very cool.</seg>
        <seg id="58">I could a little bit to tear myself away from this and was just proud.</seg>
        <seg id="59">And there was the little pea in the stomach,“ says Ásrún who was pregnant of the second child of the couple when the scene was taken up.</seg>
        <seg id="60">"This was just beautiful.“</seg>

        <seg id="2">The couple Ásrún Magnúsdóttir and Atli Bollason received an unusual request from artist Ragnar Kjartansson to have sex in front of a camera for a work the artist was putting up in Paris.</seg>
        <seg id="3">"We loved each other so it wasn't complicated."</seg>
        <seg id="4">Atli Bollason never forgets when he met his wife and mother, Ásrún Magnúsdóttir, for the first time.</seg>
        <seg id="5">"I became very fascinated with her.</seg>

        <seg id="19">They listened to Ragnar, who led them through his plans for an art exhibition he planned to put up in Palais de Tokyo in Paris in the autumn.</seg>
        <seg id="20">"He had a marvelous video work called Scenes from western culture.</seg>

        <seg id="24">The scene that Ragnar asked the couple to participate in was supposed to show a young middle-class couple making love in a minimalist room.</seg>
        <seg id="25">"This is sex with beginning and end," says Atli.</seg>
        <seg id="26">The couple didn't know Ragnar much if they knew about him and him about them," but they knew us and thought we fit into this.</seg>
        <seg id="27">They had a saying that they did not want to advertise for people.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Maybe they thought that they would not get the right people but people who would get sexual masturbation from performing for others."</seg>
        <seg id="29">They called Ragnar and agreed to think about it, but it didn't take long.</seg>
        <seg id="30">"When we walked out of Snaps, we said: Aren't we ready for this?</seg>

        <seg id="8">Ásrún remembers this, too, as the husband recalls the first meeting regularly.</seg>
        <seg id="9">"I'm always hearing this story.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Last just this weekend, "she says, who was also attracted to her husband at first encounter.</seg>
        <seg id="11">"I felt and felt so agitated around Atli, which I like.</seg>
        <seg id="12">There's a lot going on and a lot going on and I was fascinated by it. "</seg>
        <seg id="13">Atli said that he and his wife had focused on going their own way in their relationship.</seg>
        <seg id="14">"We don't tie our bales to the same knots as fellow travellers.</seg>
        <seg id="15">We avoid routine that we analyze around us. "</seg>
        <seg id="16">That's possibly why they just welcomed the talk from artist Ragnari Kjartansson, although that was the least unusual.</seg>
        <seg id="17">"Our mutual friend Kristín Anna contacted us and asked if we could come to eat desert with her, Raggi and Ragnar's wife Ingibjörg, at Snaps."</seg>
        <seg id="18">They accepted the invitation, met the trio at Snaps and had desert wine and separate desserts.</seg>
        <seg id="19">They listened to Ragnar who led them through his plans to an art exhibition he intended to set up in Palais de Tokyo, Paris in the autumn.</seg>
        <seg id="20">"He had a multifaceted video work called Scenes from western culture.</seg>
        <seg id="21">He described it in a simple way. "</seg>
        <seg id="22">Ásrún says that he described the work as banal and decadent scenes from the everyday lives of Westerners.</seg>
        <seg id="23">"He had sketches of all the scenes he was going to shoot and last time he told us about what he wanted to know if we were interested in participating in."</seg>
        <seg id="24">The scene that Ragnar asked the couple to take part in was supposed to show a young middle class couple making love in a minimalist room.</seg>
        <seg id="25">"These are intercourse with the beginning and the end," says Atli.</seg>
        <seg id="26">The couple didn't know Ragnar much even though they knew about him and him about them, "but they knew us and thought we fit into it.</seg>
        <seg id="27">They had a word that they didn't want to advertise for people.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Maybe they didn't think they would get the right people, but people who would get sexual masturbation from performing for others. "</seg>
        <seg id="29">They said goodbye to Ragnar and agreed to think about it, but it didn't take long.</seg>
        <seg id="30">"When we walked out of Snaps, we said: Aren't we just ready for this?</seg>
        <seg id="31">It was just like that.</seg>
        <seg id="32">I trust Ragnar as an artist and his whole team, "says Ásrún and Atli.</seg>
        <seg id="33">"It's about love and intimacy"</seg>
        <seg id="34">The scene was filmed in a finer apartment on Mýrargata.</seg>
        <seg id="35">There was a very small film team; a cameraman, Ragnar and a soundman and the couple.</seg>
        <seg id="36">After a recording had been turned on, everyone left the room to wait in the car except Atli and Ásrún.</seg>
        <seg id="37">"We hadn't decided how to be.</seg>
        <seg id="38">We had some little instructions, but we tried to forget about time and place.</seg>
        <seg id="39">Being unaware of what we were doing and for whom.</seg>
        <seg id="40">Nothing was played, we just loved each other, so it wasn't complicated, "says Ásrún.</seg>
        <seg id="41">But was that romantic?</seg>
        <seg id="42">"Yes, it was a little romantic," says Atli, and Ásrún agrees with that.</seg>
        <seg id="43">"We were offered champagne before they left the room.</seg>
        <seg id="44">It was a little like being on vacation in a nice hotel in Paris. "</seg>
        <seg id="45">The team was delighted with the couple's performance in the piece that moved them.</seg>
        <seg id="46">"When Tommi the cameraman looked at it, he cried, he thought it was so beautiful," says Atli.</seg>
        <seg id="47">"It's as much about love and intimacy as the sexual intercourse itself," says Ásrún.</seg>
        <seg id="48">The couple's parents have seen the work and Atli says that his mother heard the voice in the son at the Reykjavík Art Museum and realised that he was part of the work.</seg>
        <seg id="49">"Then she turned around and began to think about it," says Atli.</seg>
        <seg id="50">"Mom and Dad saw this in Paris.</seg>
        <seg id="51">We hadn't told anyone that way, but then my dad just sent me a message saying: Nice to come across the little family in Palais de Tokyo, "Ásrún recalls.</seg>
        <seg id="52">And I wonder if the participant in the work has deepened the relationship between Ásrún and Atli.</seg>
        <seg id="53">"At least we're still together, so maybe it deepened something.</seg>
        <seg id="54">At least this deepened my relationship with my father-in-law, "says Ásrún, laughing.</seg>
        <seg id="55">Ásrún herself saw the work in Copenhagen with her colleague.</seg>
        <seg id="56">"I found it a little difficult not to be with you but with someone else," she says, turning to her husband.</seg>
        <seg id="57">"But it was nice to see this because it's only one scene in a much bigger piece, and when you saw it with the other pieces, it's really cool.</seg>
        <seg id="58">I could tear myself away from this a little bit and I was just proud.</seg>
        <seg id="59">And there was the little bean in my stomach, "says Ásrún, who was pregnant with one of the couple's children when the scene was filmed.</seg>
        <seg id="60">"It was just beautiful."</seg>
        <seg id="61">Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke to Ásrún and Atli in Love Stories on Rás 1.</seg>

        <seg id="5">Van Voorst lét af embætti við sérkennilegar aðstæður, en Kastljós greindi frá því 2009 að hún hefði átt að fá Fálkaorðina.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Á leið á kveðjufund með forseta Íslands fékk hún símtal frá forsetaskrifstofunni þess efnis að hún yrði ekki sæmd orðunni.</seg>

        <seg id="8">Sextán mánuðir liðu þar til eftirmaður Van Voorst kom til starfa, í september 2010.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Það má að einhverju leyti rekja til þess að Robert S. Connan hafði verið skipaður sem sendiherra en hætti svo við.</seg>

        <seg id="12">Þá tók við annað sendiherralaust tímabil.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Robert Barber hlaut samþykki Bandaríkjaþings í janúar 2015 og kom til starfa skömmu síðar, en þá hafði enginn sendiherra verið á staðnum í 13 mánuði.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Barber var pólitískt skipaður en ekki diplómati, heldur hafði hann starfað sem lögmaður og stutt kosningasjóð Baracks Obama.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Hann lét af störfum um leið og Donald Trump tók við forsetaembættinu, 20. janúar 2017, eins og venjan er með pólitískt skipaða sendiherra.</seg>

        <seg id="1">No ambassador for five years since 2009</seg>
        <seg id="2">The US ambassador to Iceland, Jeffrey Gunter Ross, is the focus of media attention following CBS's report this morning that he requested an armed bodyguard because he feared for his life.</seg>
        <seg id="3">It has not been an easy task for the US President to appoint an ambassador to this country, however.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Since Carol Van Voorst left the office of US ambassador in late April 2009, Iceland has been without an ambassador for a total of 62 months, or over five years.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Van Voorst left office under peculiar circumstances, with Kastljós reporting in 2009 that she was supposed to receive the Order of the Falcon.</seg>
        <seg id="6">While on her way to a farewell meeting with the President of Iceland, she received a telephone call from the President's office to tell her that she wouldn't be awarded the honour.</seg>
        <seg id="7">After leaving Iceland, she taught international communications at the Army War College.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Sixteen months passed until Van Voorst's successor arrived in September 2010.</seg>
        <seg id="9">This may be have been due in part to Robert S. Connan being previously appointed ambassador but then changing his mind.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Finally, Loius Ariega, who had worked in the foreign service for decades, took on the job.</seg>
        <seg id="11">He stepped down in the autumn of 2013 to assume the office of ambassador to Guatemala.</seg>
        <seg id="12">There was subsequently another ambassador-less period.</seg>
        <seg id="13">In January 2015, the United States Senate approved the appointment of Robert Barber, who arrived shortly thereafter, by which time there had been no ambassador for 13 months.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Barber was politically appointed rather than a diplomat, having worked as a lawyer and contributed to Barack Obama's election fund.</seg>
        <seg id="15">He stepped down as soon as Donald Trump assumed the office of President on 20 January 2017, as is the custom with politically appointed ambassadors.</seg>
        <seg id="16">The Trump administration took unusually long to appoint both ambassadors and high-ranking officials in Washington.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Two years passed until the United States Senate summoned Jeffrey Ross Gunter to question him thoroughly before confirming his appointment as ambassador to Iceland.</seg>
        <seg id="18">In his Senate hearing, he said that he had never been to Iceland but had frequently been to Western Europe, as his late wife had been of Dutch descent.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Gunter is a political appointee who was previously a dermatologist in California and has been active in the organisation of Jews in the Republican Party, the Republican Jewish Coalition.</seg>
        <seg id="20">The organisation was founded by casino owner Sheldon Adelson, who is a fervent supporter of Donald Trump.</seg>
        <seg id="21">Gunter arrived to assume office in Iceland in May 2019, by which time there had been no ambassador in the country since early 2017, for two years and four months, which is a record length of time in this country.</seg>
        <seg id="22">The reason is both the long time it took for the Trump administration to appoint people to key offices and the great delays in the work of the Senate in recent years, including in the confirmation of ambassadors.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Since 2009, Iceland has therefore been without an ambassador for a total of over five years.</seg>
        <seg id="24">This has not prevented construction projects by the embassy, which recently opened new headquarters at Engjateigur.</seg>
        <seg id="25">The construction is believed to have cost about ISK 6.5 billion, with enormously thick security walls surrounding the building and bulletproof glass in all windows.</seg>
        <seg id="26">This does not seem to be enough to give the current ambassador a sense of security, however, as he is said to fear for his life and has requested an armed body guard.</seg>

        <seg id="18">In his testimony at the Althing, he said that he had never been to Iceland but often to Western Europe, but that his wife, who had died, had been broken by Dutch rock.</seg>

        <seg id="2">Fyrir framan Tollhúsið í Reykjavík er stór og djúp hola.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Ofan í henni eru menn með appelsínugula hjálma.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Þar er líka stór grafa.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Og fleiri minni vinnuvélar.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Gatan er lokuð fyrir umferð.</seg>
        <seg id="7">En gangstéttin er fær og þar staldra nú margir við og virða fyrir sér listaverk úr milljónum mósaíkflísa — líkt og þeir hafi aldrei séð það áður.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Kannski hafa þeir aldrei séð það áður.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Að minnsta kosti ekki virt það fyrir sér.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Verkið hefur hingað til verið nokkuð falið, beint fyrir framan það voru bílastæði sem voru alltaf umsetin.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Fólk lagði þar, læsti bílnum í snarhasti og stökk svo af stað að sinna erindum sínum í miðborginni.</seg>
        <seg id="12">„Lífleg og fjölbreytileg almenningsrými“ og „aðlaðandi borgarbragur“ eru leiðarljós við endurgerð Tryggvagötunnar sem nú stendur yfir.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Markmiðið er að fegra svæðið og leyfa mósaíkverki Gerðar Helgadóttur á Tollhúsinu að njóta sýn betur.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Framan við verkið verður torg og þar sem svæðið liggur vel við sólu er það talið henta vel sem dvalarsvæði fyrir vegfarendur.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Listaverkið verður lýst upp og fær nú efniviðurinn að njóta sín betur en áður á þessum 142 fermetra fleti.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Á svæðinu verða einnig litlir „þokuúðarar“, nokkurs konar vatnsskúlptúrar, sem bjóða upp á leik og veita svæðinu ákveðna dulúð.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Með þessum hætti er endurbótunum lýst af Reykjavíkurborg sem stendur að framkvæmdum ásamt Veitum.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Lagnir vatnsveitu, hitaveitu og rafveitu verða endurnýjaðar.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Margar þeirra eru komnar til ára sinna, en skólplögnin og kaldavatnslögnin eru frá árinu 1925 og hafa því þjónað íbúum og fyrirtækjum í miðbænum í tæpa öld.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Þegar gatan verður opnuð á ný að framkvæmdum loknum geta bílar ekið um hana aftur.</seg>
        <seg id="21">En hún verður þó einstefnugata og um leið skapast rólegra og aðgengilegra rýmri fyrir gangandi.</seg>
        <seg id="22">Í fróðleik um Tollhúsið á vef tollstjórans segir að húsið hafi verið tekið í notkun árið 1971 en arkitekt þess var Gísli Halldórsson.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Vegna þess að hafnarskemma náði í gegnum húsið myndaðist þar 250 fermetra gluggalaus veggflötur út að götu.</seg>
        <seg id="24">Byggingarnefnd og arkitekt voru sammála um að slíkur flötur myndi hafa slæm áhrif á heildargötumyndina, ef ekki væru gerðar sérstakar ráðstafanir til að prýða útlit hússins.</seg>
        <seg id="25">Aðilar urðu því sammála um að reikna með því að láta setja þarna upp varanlegt listaverk.</seg>
        <seg id="26">Á þessum tíma fór mikið orð af Gerði Helgadóttur, listakonu, segir í samantektinni.</seg>
        <seg id="27">Hafði hún unnið mikið að mósaíklistaverkum í Þýskalandi og víðar.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Afráðið var að hafa fyrst samband við hana áður en ákveðið yrði hvort efnt yrði til samkeppni um verkið.</seg>
        <seg id="29">Oft hafði verið rætt um að verkið þyrfti að spegla lífið við höfnina, enda hafði höfnin verið lífæð Reykjavíkur síðan hún var gerð.</seg>
        <seg id="30">Þegar rætt var við listakonuna varð hún að trax hugfangin af slíku verki.</seg>
        <seg id="31">Varð að samkomulagi að hún fengi teikningar og aðra aðstoð áður en hún færi aftur af landi brott, þar sem hún myndi vinna við tillögurnar erlendis.</seg>
        <seg id="32">Gerður fékk þann tíma sem hún ákvað sjálf að þyrfti, og þegar hún sneri aftur heim lagði hún nokkrar tillögur fram til umræðu.</seg>
        <seg id="33">Samþykkt var án tafar að biðja hana um að vinna verkið.</seg>
        <seg id="34">Jafnframt var óskað eftir að gera heildarsamning við hana og hið fræga listaverkafyrirtæki í Þýskalandi, Bræðurna Oidtmann, en Gerður hafði lengi starfað með þeim að uppsetningu frægra listaverka víða um Evrópu.</seg>
        <seg id="35">Samningar tókust og Gerður vann listaverkið undir uppsetningu á verkstæði þeirra bræðra, sem sáu síðan um uppsetningu á Tollhúsið.</seg>
        <seg id="36">Allt verkið var einstaklega vel af hendi leyst, bæði af hálfu Gerðar Helgadóttur og Oidtmannbræðra, segir í samantektinni.</seg>
        <seg id="37">Hefur það æ síðan staðist óblíða íslenska veðráttu.</seg>
        <seg id="38">Það tók Gerði um tvö ár að vinna verkið, sem var unnið og sett upp á árunum 1972 og 1973.</seg>
        <seg id="39">Listakonan lést tveimur árum eftir að Tollhúsverkið var klárað, aðeins 47 ára gömul.</seg>

        <seg id="1">Gerður's mosaic will finally come into its own</seg>
        <seg id="2">There is a big and deep hole in front of the Customs House in Reykjavik.</seg>
        <seg id="3">In it are men with orange helmets.</seg>
        <seg id="4">There is also a big excavator there.</seg>
        <seg id="5">And other smaller machines.</seg>
        <seg id="6">The road is closed for traffic.</seg>
        <seg id="7">But the pavement is clear and many people now stop there to observe artwork made from millions of mosaic tiles  — like they have never seen it before.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Perhaps they never have seen it before.</seg>
        <seg id="9">At least not observed it.</seg>
        <seg id="10">The mural has been relatively hidden until now, right in front of it were parking spaces that were in constant demand.</seg>
        <seg id="11">People parked there, quickly locked their car and then rushed to perform their errands in the city centre.</seg>
        <seg id="12">"Lively and diverse public spaces" and "an attractive urban environment" are the guiding themes in the renovation of Tryggvagata that is currently underway.</seg>
        <seg id="13">The aim is to beautify the area and make Gerður Helgadóttir's mosaic on the Customs House more prominent.</seg>
        <seg id="14">There will be a square in front of the mural, and the site is considered well suited as a leisure area for pedestrians due to its advantageous sunlight position.</seg>
        <seg id="15">The mural will be illuminated, enabling a better appreciation of the material on this 142 square metre surface.</seg>
        <seg id="16">The site will also have small "fog sprinklers", a kind of water sculptures that provide an opportunity for play and lend the place a certain mystical air.</seg>
        <seg id="17">This is how the renovations are described by the City of Reykjavik, which is responsible for the project, along with Veitur.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Cold water, hot water and electrical utilities will be renewed.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Many of these are getting on in age, with the sewage and cold water pipelines dating from the year 1925, thus having served residents and businesses in the city centre for close to a century.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Cars will again be able to drive on the road when it will be reopened following the end of the construction project.</seg>
        <seg id="21">It will be a one-way street, however, which will also create a more tranquil and accessible space for pedestrians.</seg>
        <seg id="22">According to the information on the Customs House on the Directorate of Custom's website, the building, by architect Gísli Halldórsson, was taken into use in 1971.</seg>
        <seg id="23">As a dock warehouse extended through the building, there was a 250 square metre windowless wall surface facing the street.</seg>
        <seg id="24">The building committee and architect agreed that such a surface would have a negative effect on the overall look of the street if special measures were not made to decorate the building.</seg>
        <seg id="25">The parties therefore agreed to assume that permanent artwork would be installed there.</seg>
        <seg id="26">Gerður Helgadóttir had a great reputation as an artist during this period, according to the summary.</seg>
        <seg id="27">She had been heavily involved in making mosaics in Germany and other places.</seg>
        <seg id="28">A decision was made to contact her first, before deciding whether a competition for the project would be held.</seg>
        <seg id="29">It had often been noted that the artwork would have to reflect life at the harbour, as the harbour had been Reykjavik's lifeline ever since it was built.</seg>
        <seg id="30">When the artist was contacted, she was immediately captivated by the task.</seg>
        <seg id="31">It was agreed that she would receive drawings and other assistance before leaving the country again to work on the proposals abroad.</seg>
        <seg id="32">Gerður was given the time that she herself decided she needed and upon her return home, she submitted several proposals for discussion.</seg>
        <seg id="33">It was agreed without delay to ask her to carry out the task.</seg>
        <seg id="34">A request was also made to make a comprehensive agreement with her and the famous German art company Oidtmann Brothers, Gerður's long-time collaborators in installing renowned works of art all over Europe.</seg>
        <seg id="35">An agreement was reached, and Gerður prepared the mural for installation at the workshop of the brothers, who then oversaw the installation on the Customs House.</seg>
        <seg id="36">All the work was exceptionally well carried out, both by Gerður Helgadóttir and the Oidtmann Brothers, says the summary.</seg>
        <seg id="37">The mural has been able to withstand the harsh Icelandic climate ever since.</seg>
        <seg id="38">It took Gerður about two years to complete her mural, which was prepared and installed in the years 1972 and 1973.</seg>
        <seg id="39">The artist died two years after completing her Customs House mural, only 47-years old.</seg>

        <seg id="2">The State Internal Revenue Board has rejected a claim from the Director of Tax Investigations demanding that a man be fined for underreporting capital income from sales of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.</seg>
        <seg id="3">The Board concludes that the Director of Tax Investigations has not provided clear arguments for the necessity of fining the man.</seg>
        <seg id="4">According to the Board's ruling, the Director of Tax Investigations believed that the man had filed materially false tax statements for the income years of 2016 and 2017.</seg>
        <seg id="5">He was said to have underreported financial income from sales of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin amounting to ISK 27 million, either intentionally or due to gross negligence.</seg>
        <seg id="6">The man should consequently be fined for his conduct.</seg>
        <seg id="7">The man rejected this in a letter to the Board.</seg>
        <seg id="8">He did, however, admit to selling cryptocurrency for ISK 27 million in 2016.</seg>
        <seg id="9">He said that he acquired this cryptocurrency through mining in the years 2009 and 2010, at a time when this could be done both easily and inexpensively with an ordinary home computer.</seg>
        <seg id="10">He also pointed out that when he sold the cryptocurrency, the administration of taxes for such sales was highly ambiguous and unpredictable.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Members of the general public could hardly have been expected to be aware of such arrangements in their tax statement.</seg>
        <seg id="12">He said that he did not intend to avoid paying taxes on his harvesting and that he had reported his asset in the statement as a deposit in a currency account.</seg>
        <seg id="13">He had asked both experts and the Directorate of Internal Revenue about the arrangement for this but to no avail.</seg>
        <seg id="14">He furthermore believed that the fact that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland, and had only lived here for a few years when he began mining for Bitcoin, must be taken into account.</seg>
        <seg id="15">That meant that he was in a worse position than others to familiarise himself with complex rules on which the tax authorities had not formed a clear opinion.</seg>
        <seg id="16">The man therefore considered it appropriate for his taxes for these two income years to be reassessed and a surcharge applied, but that no other penalties should be imposed.</seg>
        <seg id="17">He reiterated that he worked in Iceland and had paid taxes in this country since 2012.</seg>
        <seg id="18">He had never intended to shirk his responsibilities by improper means.</seg>

        <seg id="2">Í rúmt ár hefur Bjartmar Leósson átt sér áhugamál ólíkt flestum öðrum.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Hann þefar upp og bjargar týndum og stolnum reiðhjólum, rafhjólum og vespum.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Hefur Bjartmar áunnið sér nafnið „hjólahvíslarinn“ fyrir vikið.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Í gær varð svo uppi talsvert fjaðrafok þegar maður birti frásögn af samskiptum sínum við Bjartmar.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Vísaði DV þá í umræður á Facebook hóp Vesturbæinga þar sem fram kom að Bjartmar hafi tekið manninn á tal á Austurvelli og sagt vespuna mögulega vera stolna.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Var ekki annað hægt að lesa úr upphaflegu skrifum rafskutlumannsins en að Bjartmar hafi þjófkennt hann.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Þeim texta hefur nú verið breytt á Facebook og fyrirsögn upphaflegu fréttar DV uppfærð í samræmi við það.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Bjartmar segir upphaflegar fréttir af málinu alls ekki lýsandi fyrir það sem raunverulega gekk á í gær á Austurvelli.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Bjartmar sagðist hafa fengið upplýsingar frá fórnarlambi rafskutlustuldar um að þetta væru sannarlega sín rafskutla.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Þær upplýsingar fékk meintur eigandi frá öðrum, en upplýsingarnar reyndust rangar segir Bjartmar.</seg>
        <seg id="12">„Ég sá til gaursins og ég kannaðist við skutluna, enda með upplýsingar um að þarna væri rafskutla sem hafði verið saknað mjög lengi og leitað hafi verið að.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Ég hikaði vissulega fyrst, en þegar ég sá hann búa sig undir að aka af stað á skutlunni ákveð ég að kýla á að ræða við manninn.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Eigandinn var viss í sinni sök og ákvað ég því að eiga samtal við manninn.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Almennt fer ég mjög fínt í svona mál, en áður en ég náði að klára það sem ég hafði að segja hafði maðurinn tekið af mér orðið.“</seg>
        <seg id="16">Bjartmar segir að maðurinn á rafskutlunni hafi undir eins boðið honum að sýna honum kvittunina fyrir hjólinu og hafi sjálfur kallað til lögreglu.</seg>
        <seg id="17">„Já, flott,“ sagði Bjartmar, „fáum þetta bara á hreint.“</seg>
        <seg id="18">Svo fór að eigandi rafskutlunnar sannaði eignarhald á rafskutlunni sinni og ók af stað.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Síðar sagði réttur eigandi rafskutlunnar frá sögu sinni á Facebook, líkt og greindi frá í fyrri frétt.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Á þessu rúmu ári sem Bjartmar hefur lagt stund á þessa iðkun sína segist hann geta talið skiptin sem hann lenti upp á kant við fólk á fingrum annarar handar.</seg>
        <seg id="21">„Ég hef átt í friðsamlegum samskiptum við erfiðustu menn Reykjavíkur,“ sagði Bjartmar og bendir á að reiðhjólaþjófar séu langoftast minnstu bræður og systur samfélagsins, fíklar, geðfatlað fólk og annað fólk sem einhverra hluta vegna er á götunni.</seg>
        <seg id="22">„Fíknin er harður húsbóndi og einhvernveginn þarf að fjármagna næsta skammt, því miður er þjófnaður á svona lausafjármunum auðveld leið að því markmiði,“ segir Bjartmar.</seg>
        <seg id="23">„Samskipti mín við þetta fólk eru í raun svo góð að ég er komin með margt af því góða fólki með mér í lið.</seg>
        <seg id="24">Dæmi eru um að fólk hafi farið í meðferð og tekið sig á og leitað svo til mín og aðstoðað mig við það sem ég er að gera,“ segir hann.</seg>
        <seg id="25">Almennt séu samskipti Bjartmars við reiðhjólafólk á kurteisislegum nótum.</seg>
        <seg id="26">Sumir vita af honum og hvað hann er að gera og bjóðast friðsællega til þess að sýna honum kvittanir, stellnúmer hjóla og svo framvegis.</seg>
        <seg id="27">Reiðhjólaþjófnaður sé stórt vandamál sem lítið hefur verið fjallað um.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Ennfremur segir Bjartmar að lögreglan sé meira að segja farin að benda fólki á að tala við hann útaf stolnum reiðhjólum.</seg>
        <seg id="29">Bjartmar er ósáttur við fyrri fréttaflutning DV og segist ekki vera eitthverskonar sjálfskipuð lögregla í persónulegri leit að réttvísinni.</seg>
        <seg id="30">Aðspurður hvort hann sé nú samt ekki kominn á hálan ís með athæfi sínu, og hvort þetta sé ekki fyrst og fremst hlutverk lögreglu, segir Bjartmar svo vissulega vera.</seg>
        <seg id="31">„Auðvitað á löggan að gera þetta, en staðreynd málsins er að löggan er hreinlega ekki að sinna þessu.</seg>
        <seg id="32">Ég hef til að mynda horft upp á lögreglumenn keyra í burtu frá stórri hrúgu af stolnum hjólum.</seg>
        <seg id="33">Hún er hreint út sagt grútmáttlaus í þessum málum.“</seg>
        <seg id="34">„Þegar löggan er ekki að gera neitt í þessu, og þetta er bara fyrir framan nefið á þér, og reynslan hefur sýnt að ég get náð árangri í þessum málaflokki, þá afhverju ekki?“ spyr Bjartmar.</seg>
        <seg id="35">Hann segist hafa náð svo miklum árangri í að hafa uppi á stolnum hjólum, að stundum rekist hann á sína „skjólstæðinga“ á götunni að þá hafi þeir bara rétt Bjartmari hjólin sem þeir höfðu áður náð sér í.</seg>
        <seg id="36">Þau skipti sem Bjartmar hefur kallað eftir aðstoð lögreglu hefur komið fyrir að hún hreinlega mæti ekki.</seg>
        <seg id="37">„Þetta er bara ekki að virka með lögregluna, og það er ekki mér að kenna og það er ekki eigendum reiðhjólanna að kenna,“ sagði Bjartmar og þykir það leitt að fórnarlömb reiðhjólaþjófnaða þurfi að líða fyrir tómlæti lögreglu í þessum málaflokki.</seg>
        <seg id="38">Um árangur Bjartmars er ekki deilt.</seg>
        <seg id="39">Víða má finna sögur af fólki þakka Bjartmari fyrir að hafa náð eigum sínum til þeirra aftur.</seg>
        <seg id="40">Sjálfur segir Bjartmar löngu vera búinn að týna tölunni á fjölda reiðhjóla sem hann hefur skilað, en upphæðirnir hlaupi sjálfsagt á milljónum, ef ekki milljónatugum.</seg>
        <seg id="41">Vega þar rafmagnsvespur, rafhjól og rafmagnsskutlur þungt, en rafhjól getur kostað upp undir hálfa milljón.</seg>
        <seg id="42">Bjartmar starfar að degi til á leikskóla og aðra hverja helgi vinnur hann á sambýli.</seg>
        <seg id="43">Reiðhjólaleitin hans er því ólaunuð vinna sem hann sinnir í frítíma sínum.</seg>

        <seg id="1">Bicycle whisperer Bjartmar has recovered bicycles worth millions - now defends himself after DV's report</seg>
        <seg id="2">For over a year, Bjartmar Leósson has had a hobby unlike most others.</seg>
        <seg id="3">He finds and rescues lost and stolen bicycles, electric bikes and scooters.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Due to this, Bjartmar has been called the "bicycle whisperer".</seg>
        <seg id="5">There was quite a commotion yesterday, however, when a man published an account of his interactions with Bjartmar.</seg>
        <seg id="6">DV referred to a discussion in a Facebook group for residents in West Reykjavik where Bjartmar was reported to have approached the man on Austurvöllur and said that his scooter was possibly stolen.</seg>
        <seg id="7">The original post from the man on the electric scooter seemed to say that Bjartmar had accused him of theft.</seg>
        <seg id="8">This text has now been edited on Facebook and the headline of DV's original report has been updated accordingly.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Bjartmar says that the original reports of the matter were in no way indicative of what actually transpired at Austurvöllur yesterday.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Bjartmar said that he received information from the victim of an electric scooter theft that this was certainly his electric scooter.</seg>
        <seg id="11">This was information that the alleged owner received from someone else, but this information turned out to be wrong, says Bjartmar.</seg>
        <seg id="12">"I saw the guy and the scooter was familiar to me, as I had information that this was an electric scooter that had been missing and searched for for a very long time.</seg>
        <seg id="13">I was certainly hesitant at first, but when I saw him prepare to drive away on the scooter, I decided to take the plunge and talk to the man.</seg>
        <seg id="14">The owner was certain in his belief so I decided to have a conversation with the man.</seg>
        <seg id="15">I'm generally very subtle in such matters, but before I could finish what I had to say, the man had interrupted me."</seg>
        <seg id="16">Bjartmar says that the man on the electric scooter immediately offered to show him the receipt for the scooter and called the police himself.</seg>
        <seg id="17">"Yes, great," said Bjartmar, "let's just get this sorted."</seg>
        <seg id="18">The owner of the electric scooter eventually proved his ownership and rode away.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Later, the actual owner of the electric scooter told his story on Facebook, as was detailed in the previous report.</seg>
        <seg id="20">In the more than a year that Bjartmar has been doing this, he says he can count on the fingers of one hand the times he got into altercations with people.</seg>
        <seg id="21">"I have had peaceful interactions with Reykjavik's most difficult men," said Bjartmar and points out that in the vast majority of cases, bicycle thieves are society's most vulnerable brothers and sisters, addicts, people with mental disorders and people who are on the street for some reason.</seg>
        <seg id="22">"Addiction is a merciless taskmaster, the next fix must be funded somehow and unfortunately, stealing these kinds of movable properties is an easy way to reach that goal," says Bjartmar.</seg>
        <seg id="23">"In fact, my interactions with these people are actually so good that many of these good people are now on my side.</seg>
        <seg id="24">There are examples of people going to rehab and straightening themselves out and then coming to me to assist me in what I'm doing," he says.</seg>
        <seg id="25">He says that his interactions with cyclists are generally polite.</seg>
        <seg id="26">Some are aware of him and what he's doing and volunteer peacefully to show him receipts, bicycle frame numbers, etc.</seg>
        <seg id="27">Bicycle theft is a big problems that has been little reported, he says.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Bjartmar adds that the police is even beginning to advise people to talk to him about stolen bicycles.</seg>
        <seg id="29">Bjartmar is displeased with DV's previous reporting and says that he not some kind of vigilante on a personal quest for justice.</seg>
        <seg id="30">When asked whether he isn't going too far in his activities, and whether this is not first and foremost the role of the police, Bjartmar says that that is certainly the case.</seg>
        <seg id="31">"Of course the cops should do this, but the fact of the matter is that the cops are simply not tending to this.</seg>
        <seg id="32">I have seen policemen drive away from a large pile of stolen bicycles, for example.</seg>
        <seg id="33">They are completely useless in these matters, to tell you the truth."</seg>
        <seg id="34">"When the cops aren't doing anything about this, and it's just right in front of you and experience has shown that I can get results in these cases, then why not?" asks Bjartmar.</seg>
        <seg id="35">He says that he has been so successful in finding lost bicycles that sometimes when he has run into his "protégés" on the street, they have simply handed the bicycles that they had snatched over to Bjartmar.</seg>
        <seg id="36">In the instances when Bjartmar has requested assistance from the police, they have sometimes simply not shown up.</seg>
        <seg id="37">"It's just not working with the police, and it's not my fault and it's not the fault of the bicycle owners," said Bjartmar, who is sorry that victims of bicycle theft have to suffer the disinterest of police when it comes to this issue.</seg>
        <seg id="38">Bjartmar's success rate is undisputable.</seg>
        <seg id="39">Stories from people thanking Bjartmar for retrieving their properties are rampant.</seg>
        <seg id="40">Bjartmar himself says that he has long ago lost count of the bicycles that he has returned, but that the amounts are probably in the millions, if not the tens of millions.</seg>
        <seg id="41">That is largely due to electric scooters, e-bikes and mobility scooters, with electric bikes sometimes costing up to half a million.</seg>
        <seg id="42">Bjartmar works at a preschool during the day and at a group home every other weekend.</seg>
        <seg id="43">His search for bicycles is therefore unpaid work that he undertakes in his spare time.</seg>

        <seg id="8">That text has now been changed on Facebook and the headline of the original DV news item updated accordingly.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Bjartmar says that the original news of the case is not at all descriptive of what really happened yesterday at Austurvellir.</seg>

        <seg id="11">The information was received by the alleged owner from others, but the information turned out to be incorrect, says Bjartmar.</seg>
        <seg id="12">"I looked at the guy and I recognized the shuttle, with information that there was an electric shuttle that had been missing for a very long time and had been searched for.</seg>
        <seg id="13">I certainly hesitated at first, but when I saw him getting ready to leave on the shuttle, I decided to punch him to talk to the man.</seg>
        <seg id="14">The owner was sure of his guilt, so I decided to have a conversation with the man.</seg>
        <seg id="15">"In general, I do very well in such matters, but before I could finish what I had to say, the man had taken my word for it."</seg>
        <seg id="16">Bjartmar says that the man in the electric shuttle had at one point invited him to show him the receipt for the bike and had called the police himself.</seg>
        <seg id="17">"Yes, cool," said Bjartmar, "let's just get this straight."</seg>
        <seg id="18">Then the owner of the electric shuttle proved ownership of his electric shuttle and drove off.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Later, the rightful owner of the electric shuttle told his story on Facebook, as reported in a previous article.</seg>
        <seg id="20">In the little over a year that Bjartmar has practiced this practice, he says he can count the times he got on the edge with people on the fingers of one hand.</seg>
        <seg id="21">"I have had peaceful relations with the most difficult people in Reykjavík," said Bjartmar and points out that bicycle thieves are often the youngest brothers and sisters in society, addicts, people with mental disabilities and other people who for some reason are on the streets.</seg>
        <seg id="22">"Addiction is a hard master and somehow the next dose has to be financed, unfortunately the theft of such liquid assets is an easy way to that goal," says Bjartmar.</seg>
        <seg id="23">"My communication with these people is really so good that I have brought a lot of the good people with me to the team.</seg>
        <seg id="24">There are examples of people going to treatment and taking action and then looking to me and helping me with what I am doing, "he says.</seg>
        <seg id="25">In general, Bjartmar's communication with cyclists is polite.</seg>
        <seg id="26">Some people know about him and what he is doing and offer to show him receipts, bike numbers and so on.</seg>
        <seg id="27">Bicycle theft is a big problem that has been little discussed.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Furthermore, Bjartmar says that the police have even started to warn people to talk to him about stolen bicycles.</seg>
        <seg id="29">Bjartmar is dissatisfied with DV's previous news coverage and says that he is not some kind of self-appointed police in a personal search for justice.</seg>
        <seg id="30">Asked if he is still not on slippery ice with his actions, and if this is not primarily the role of the police, Bjartmar certainly says so.</seg>
        <seg id="31">"Of course the police have to do this, but the fact of the matter is that the police are not doing this at all.</seg>
        <seg id="32">For example, I have watched police officers drive away from a large pile of stolen wheels.</seg>
        <seg id="33">She is downright powerless in these matters. "</seg>
        <seg id="34">"When the police are not doing anything about this, and this is just in front of your nose, and experience has shown that I can succeed in this area, then why not?" Bjartmar asks.</seg>
        <seg id="35">He says that he has achieved so much success in finding stolen bikes that he sometimes comes across his "clients" on the street that then they just got the Bjartmar bikes they had previously picked up.</seg>
        <seg id="36">The times that Bjartmar has called for the help of the police, it has happened that she does not show up.</seg>
        <seg id="37">"This is just not working with the police, and it's not my fault and it's not the owners of the bicycles who are to blame," said Bjartmar, and he is sorry that the victims of bicycle thefts have to suffer from the indifference of the police in this area.</seg>
        <seg id="38">Bjartmar's success is not disputed.</seg>

        <seg id="41">Electric scooters, electric bicycles and electric shuttles weigh heavily, but electric bicycles can cost less than half a million.</seg>
        <seg id="42">Bjartmar works during the day at a kindergarten and every other weekend he works in a dormitory.</seg>

        <seg id="12">"I looked at the guy and I recognized the shuttle, with information that there was an electric scooter that had been missing for a long time and was searched for.</seg>
        <seg id="13">I certainly hesitated at first, but when I saw him preparing to drive off on the shuttle, I decided to punch on talking to the man.</seg>
        <seg id="14">The owner was certain in his fault, so I decided to have a conversation with the man.</seg>
        <seg id="15">In general, I'm very good at this, but before I managed to finish what I had to say, the man had taken the word from me."</seg>
        <seg id="16">Bjartmar says that the man on the electric shuttle immediately invited him to show him the receipt for the bike and called the police himself.</seg>
        <seg id="17">"Yes, cool," said Bjartmar, "let's just get it straight."</seg>
        <seg id="18">Then the owner of the electric shuttle proved ownership of his electric shuttle and drove off.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Later, the electric shuttle owner's right told his story on Facebook, as reported in an earlier news release.</seg>
        <seg id="20">In the more than year that Bjartmar has pursued this practice, he says he can count the exchange he caught up with people on the fingers of one hand.</seg>
        <seg id="21">"I have had peaceful relations with Reykjavik's most difficult people," said Bjartmar, pointing out that bicycle thieves are by far the smallest brothers and sisters in the community, addicts, disabled people and other people who are on the street for some reason.</seg>
        <seg id="22">"The addiction is a tough master and somehow the next dose needs to be funded, unfortunately, the theft of such liquid assets is an easy way to that goal," says Bjartmar.</seg>

        <seg id="27">Bicycle theft is a major problem that has not been discussed.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Furthermore, Bjartmar says that the police are even advising people to talk to him on stolen bicycles.</seg>
        <seg id="29">Bjartmar is unhappy with DV's previous news report and says he is not some kind of self-appointed police in a personal search for justice.</seg>
        <seg id="30">Asked if he is still not on slippery ice with his actions, and whether this is not primarily the role of the police, says Bjartmar certainly.</seg>
        <seg id="31">"Of course, the cops are supposed to do this, but the fact of the matter is that the cops are simply not doing this.</seg>
        <seg id="32">For example, I have watched police officers drive away from a large pile of stolen bikes.</seg>

        <seg id="34">"When the cops aren't doing anything about this, and it's just in front of your nose, and experience has shown that I can succeed in this area, why not?" asks Bjartmar.</seg>
        <seg id="35">He says he has achieved so much success in finding stolen bikes that he sometimes comes across his "clients" on the street that they just got the Bjartmar bikes they had previously recovered.</seg>
        <seg id="36">The time Bjartmar has called for police assistance has happened that she simply did not show up.</seg>
        <seg id="37">"It's just not working with the police, and it's not my fault, and it's not the owners of the bicycles' fault," Bjartmar said, sorry that victims of bicycle theft have to suffer the emptiness of the police in this area.</seg>
        <seg id="38">Bjartmar's success is not disputed.</seg>
        <seg id="39">In many places you can find stories of people thank Bjartmari for having recovered their belongings to them.</seg>
        <seg id="40">According to Bjartmar himself, the figure has long been lost on the number of bicycles he has returned, but the amounts probably run on millions, if not millions.</seg>
        <seg id="41">Weigh there electric scooters, electric bikes and electric scooters heavily, but electric bikes can cost up to half a million.</seg>
        <seg id="42">Bjartmar works day in kindergarten and every other weekend he works in a community.</seg>

        <seg id="32">For example, I've watched police officers drive away from a large heap of stolen bikes.</seg>
        <seg id="33">She is frankly powerless in these matters. "</seg>
        <seg id="34">"When the cops are not doing anything about it, and it's just in front of your nose, and experience has shown that I can succeed in this area, why not?" Bjartmar asks.</seg>
        <seg id="35">He claims to have made so much progress in tracking down stolen bikes, that sometimes he bumps into his "clients" on the street that they just straightened out the Bjartmar bikes they had previously recovered.</seg>
        <seg id="36">The times Bjartmar has called for police assistance, it has happened that she simply does not show up.</seg>
        <seg id="37">"It's just not working with the police, and it's not my fault and it's not the fault of the owners of the bicycles," Bjartmar said, and is sorry that victims of bicycle theft have to suffer from police emptiness in this area.</seg>
        <seg id="38">Bjartmar's success is not disputed.</seg>
        <seg id="39">You can find stories of people in many places to thank Bjartmar for getting their belongings back to them.</seg>
        <seg id="40">Bjartmar himself says that he has long lost the figure on the number of bicycles he has returned, but the sums probably run at millions, if not millions.</seg>
        <seg id="41">Weigh there electric scooters, electric bikes and electric shuttles heavily, but electric bikes can cost up to half a million.</seg>
        <seg id="42">Bjartmar works by day in kindergarten and every other weekend he works in a cohabitation.</seg>
        <seg id="43">So his bicycle search is an unpaid job he does in his spare time.</seg>

        <seg id="2">Árið 2019 var mikið afmælisár í sögu lífeyrissjóða á Íslandi.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Embættismenn höfðu að vísu fengið eftirlaun frá Danakonungi allar götur frá 19. öld, en árið 1919 var stofnaður lífeyrissjóður embættismanna sem varð að lokum að lífeyrissjóði allra opinberra starfsmanna.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Grundvöllurinn að núverandi lífeyrissjóðum almennra launamanna var síðan lagður með allsherjar kjarasamningum á vinnumarkaði árið 1969 þar sem kveðið var á um atvinnutengda lífeyrissjóði með skylduaðild og fullgildri sjóðsöfnun frá ársbyrjun 1970.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Árið 1974 voru svo sett lög á grundvelli þessara samninga og lífeyriskerfið hélt áfram að eflast eftir það.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Lífeyriskerfi launamanna var ekki eina róttæka breytingin sem verkalýðshreyfing 20. aldar knúði fram með kjarabaráttu sinni.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Atvinnuleysistryggingar höfðu fengist með svipuðum hætti í sögufrægum verkfallsátökum árið 1955, og einnig fengu samtökin smám saman framgengt kröfum sínum um veikindarétt og sjúkrasjóði, veruleg orlofsréttindi, styttingu vinnutímans, umbætur í húsnæðismálum og fleira slíkt sem miklu skipti.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Öll þessi réttindi kostuðu mikla og stranga baráttu en reyndust, eftir á að hyggja, miklu meiri og varanlegri kjarabót en fjölgun auranna í launaumslaginu, sem hvarf jafnharðan í hít verðbólgunnar sem einkenndi tímabilið eftir stríð og fram til 1990 eins og margir muna.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Aðdragandinn að stofnun almennra lífeyrissjóða árið 1969 var bæði langur og flókinn.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Þó að mönnum kæmi að lokum saman um að sjóðirnir yrðu í reynd eign sjóðsfélaga varð verkalýðshreyfingin að fallast á að stjórnir þeirra skyldu skipaðar fulltrúum atvinnurekenda og sjóðsfélaga til jafns.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Á næstu árum eftir stofnun sjóðanna kom krafan um meirihluta verkafólks í stjórn sjóðanna oft til umræðu í samtökum launþega en hún náði þó aldrei fram að ganga, og því sitjum við enn uppi með það óeðlilega fyrirkomulag að fulltrúar sjóðsfélaga eru ekki í meirihluta í stjórnum sjóðanna.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Í 36. grein laga nr. 129/1997 um skyldutryggingu lífeyrisréttinda og starfsemi lífeyrissjóða er fjallað um fjárfestingarstefnu sjóðanna.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Þar segir í 1. tölulið að „lífeyrissjóður skal hafa hagsmuni sjóðfélaga að leiðarljósi.“</seg>
        <seg id="14">Einnig segir í 5. tölulið: „Lífeyrissjóður skal setja sér siðferðisleg viðmið í fjárfestingum.“</seg>
        <seg id="15">Í hluthafastefnu Lífeyrissjóðs verslunarmanna eru meðal annars eftirfarandi ákvæði, í framhaldi af fyrrnefndum lagaákvæðum:</seg>
        <seg id="16">Lífeyrissjóðurinn er aðili að reglum Sameinuðu Þjóðanna (UN PRI) um ábyrgar fjárfestingar, ásamt mörgum af stærstu lífeyrissjóðum og fagfjárfestum vestanhafs og í Evrópu.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Í reglunum er fjallað um hvernig áhersla á umhverfisleg og samfélagsleg málefni auk góðra stjórnarhátta fyrirtækja getur stuðlað að bættum fjárfestingarárangri verðbréfasafna.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Þannig fari saman hagsmunir fjárfesta og markmið þjóðfélagsins í víðara samhengi.</seg>
        <seg id="19">LV telur mikilvægt að félög, einkum þau sem skráð eru á hlutabréfamarkaði, setji sér opinbera stefnu um: að viðhafa góða stjórnarhætti starfskjör samfélagslega ábyrgð og umhverfismál.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Lífeyrissjóðurinn Gildi, sem er með stærstu sjóðum landsins, hefur sett sér „stefnu um ábyrgar fjárfestingar“ og þar eru ákvæði af svipuðum toga.</seg>
        <seg id="21">Þetta er allt rifjað upp hér sem inngangur að nýjasta tískuorði íslenskunnar, „skuggastjórnun“.</seg>
        <seg id="22">Þar sem orðið er nýtt í málinu er þess ekki von að það hafi verið skilgreint til hlítar, en mér sýnist eftirfarandi skilgreining nú vera „mest tekin“: Skuggastjórnun er það þegar forystumaður í stéttarfélagi segir í fjölmiðlum að hann ætli að senda fulltrúum félagsins í stjórn lífeyrissjóðs tilmæli eða fyrirmæli um hvernig þeir eigi að taka afstöðu í tilteknu máli.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Ef þeir fari ekki eftir tilmælunum verði þeir látnir víkja úr stjórninni við fyrsta hentugleika.</seg>
        <seg id="24">Ef forystumaðurinn fer ekki með þetta í fjölmiðla og talar ekki um uppsögn, þá er það hins vegar ekki „skuggastjórnun“ enda eru svoleiðis samskipti milli manna auðvitað altíð í fjármálaheiminum eins og annars staðar.</seg>
        <seg id="25">Ég læt lesandann um að hugleiða hvor leiðin honum finnst „skuggalegri.“</seg>
        <seg id="26">Það eru einkum tveir menn sem hafa reynt að móta þessa skilgreiningu þegar þetta er skrifað, að morgni laugardagsins 25. júlí 2020.</seg>
        <seg id="27">Það eru þeir Hörður Ægisson blaðamaður á Fréttablaðinu og Ásgeir Jónsson seðlabankastjóri.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Tilefnið hjá báðum varð til eftir að Bogi Nils Bogason forstjóri Icelandair hafði sagt frá þeirri ætlun sinni að slíta samningum félagsins við flugfreyjur og flugþjóna (segja þeim upp), og Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, formaður Verslunarmannafélags Reykjavíkur sendi þá út þau tilmæli til fulltrúa félagsins í stjórn Lífeyrissjóðs verslunarmanna að styðja ekki hugsanleg kaup sjóðsins á hlutabréfum í félaginu, ella kynnu þeir að verða látnir víkja.</seg>
        <seg id="29">Nokkru síðar dró Bogi Nils ákvörðun sína til baka og í kjölfarið fór Ragnar Þór sömu leið með tilmæli sín sem miðuðust auðvitað við ákvörðun Boga.</seg>
        <seg id="30">Engu að síður sáu þeir Hörður og Ásgeir ástæðu til að fjölyrða um málið í föstudagsblaði Fréttablaðsins með stórum orðum um skuggastjórnun, lögbrot og ríka þörf fyrir breytingar á lögum.</seg>
        <seg id="31">Þar átti lítil þúfa sannarlega að velta þungu hlassi þótt blessuð þúfan hefði verið í viðtengingarhætti og auk þess verið þurrkuð út snarlega.</seg>
        <seg id="32">Þar sem málið er mikilvægt skulum við huga að efninu sjálfu í lokin.</seg>
        <seg id="33">Ég rakti hér á undan þau atriði í lögum um lífeyrissjóði sem lúta að þessu máli.</seg>
        <seg id="34">Í þeim felst að sjóðstjórnum ber að gæta hagsmuna sjóðfélaga og hafa siðferðileg viðmið í fjárfestingum, og þessi atriði eru útfærð nánar í samþykktum bæði Gildis og Lífeyrissjóðs verslunarmanna eins og ég nefndi.</seg>
        <seg id="35">Lífeyrissjóðir eiga hins vegar EKKI að horfa eingöngu til skammtíma arðsemissjónarmiða í fjárfestingum sínum.</seg>
        <seg id="36">Slíkt væri einmitt stórhættuleg stefna og þarf ekki að leita lengi að dæmum um slíkt í fortíðinni, þar sem stór útlán banka og sjóða hafa runnið til siðlausra ævintýramanna og umhverfissóða, með hörmulegum afleiðingum.</seg>
        <seg id="37">Forstjóri Icelandair var augljóslega á hálum ís þegar honum datt í hug að þurrka út heilan hóp starfsmanna, draga þannig verulega úr þeirri velvild sem félagið hefur notið á íslenskum markaði og veikja stöðu þess gagnvart fjárfestum.</seg>
        <seg id="38">Sem betur fer sá hann að sér og dró þetta til baka.</seg>
        <seg id="39">Tíminn leiðir í ljós hvort það dugir til þess að fjárfesting lífeyrissjóða í félaginu geti talist ábyrg gagnvart sjóðfélögum þegar upp er staðið.</seg>

        <seg id="1">Pension funds and long shadows</seg>
        <seg id="2">2019 was a major anniversary year in the history of Icelandic pension funds.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Public officials had in fact received a pension from the King of Denmark ever since the 19th century, but 1919 saw the founding of a pension fund for public officials, which eventually became a pension fund for all public-sector employees.</seg>
        <seg id="4">The foundations for the present-day pension funds for general wage earners were laid with the collective wage agreements on the labour market in 1969, which provided for fully funded mandatory occupational pension funds from the beginning of 1970.</seg>
        <seg id="5">In 1974, laws were established on the basis of these agreements, after which the pension fund system continued to strengthen.</seg>
        <seg id="6">A pension fund system for wage earners was not the only radical change that the 20th century labour movement enforced through its fight for improved employment conditions.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Unemployment insurance had been secured by similar means in the historic strike of 1955, and the movement gradually also achieved its demands for sickness rights and sickness funds, significant vacation rights, reduced working hours, improved housing and other such important matters.</seg>
        <seg id="8">All these rights were the result of a long and difficult struggle but proved, in retrospect, to be a much more significant and permanent improvement of employment terms than adding a few coins to the pay envelope, which were immediately lost to the inflation that characterised the post-war period until 1990, as many will remember.</seg>
        <seg id="9">The backstory to the founding of general pension funds in 1969 is both long and complex.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Although it was eventually agreed that the funds would in fact be owned by the fund members, the labour movement had to agree to the boards of the funds being composed of an equal number of representatives of employers and fund members.</seg>
        <seg id="11">In the years following the establishment of the funds, the demand for a majority of workers on the boards of the funds was often discussed in employees' organisations but never became an actuality, so we are still stuck with the unnatural arrangement of fund member representatives not being in the majority on the boards of the funds.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Article 36 of Act no. 129/1997 on Mandatory Pension Insurance and on the Activities of Pension Funds pertains to the investment policy of the funds.</seg>
        <seg id="13">According to Item 1, "a pension fund must be guided by the interests of fund members".</seg>
        <seg id="14">Item 5 furthermore reads: "A pension fund must establish ethical criteria for its investments."</seg>
        <seg id="15">The shareholder policy of the Pension Fund of Commerce includes the following provisions, following the aforementioned legal provisions:</seg>
        <seg id="16">The Pension Fund is a signatory of the UN Principles for Responsible Investment (UN PRI), as are many of the largest pension funds and institutional investors in North America and Europe.</seg>
        <seg id="17">These principles discuss how emphasis on social and environmental issues, together with good corporate governance, can improve returns on investment portfolios.</seg>
        <seg id="18">In this manner the interests of investors and the objectives of society in a broader perspective go hand in hand.</seg>
        <seg id="19">LV considers it important for companies, especially those publicly listed on an equity market, to adopt official policies on practising good corporate governance, remuneration, social responsibility and environment issues.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Gildi Pension Fund, which is among Iceland's biggest funds, has established a "policy on responsible investments" which includes provisions of a similar nature.</seg>
        <seg id="21">All this is recollected here as an introduction to the latest buzz word in Icelandic, "shadow direction".</seg>
        <seg id="22">As the word is a new one in the language, it has understandably not been fully defined, but it seems to me like the following definition is currently the "most popular pick": Shadow direction is when a trade union leader proclaims in the media that they will give the union's representatives on the board of a pension fund recommendations or instructions on what position to take on a particular matter.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Failure to follow the recommendation would result in dismissal from the board at the first opportunity.</seg>
        <seg id="24">However, this is not "shadow direction" if the leader does not take this to the media or talk about dismissal, as such communications between people are of course common in the financial world, like elsewhere.</seg>
        <seg id="25">I leave it to the reader to decide which method is more "shadowy".</seg>
        <seg id="26">At the time of writing, on the morning of Saturday, 25 July 2019, there are mainly two men who have tried to shape this definition.</seg>
        <seg id="27">They are Hörður Ægisson, reporter at Fréttablaðið, and Central Bank Governor Ásgeir Jónsson.</seg>
        <seg id="28">For both of them, the motive arose when Bogi Nils Bogason, CEO of Icelandair, had told of his intention to terminate the company's agreements with airline hostesses and flight attendants (dismiss them), and Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, Chairman of VR, recommended that the union's representatives on the board of the Pension Fund of Commerce refrained from supporting any purchase of the company's shares by the fund, or else they may be made to step down.</seg>
        <seg id="29">Some time later, Bogi Nils withdrew his decision and Ragnar Þór subsequently did the same with his recommendation, which was of course based on Bogi's decision.</seg>
        <seg id="30">Hörður and Ásgeir nevertheless saw reason to expound on the matter in Fréttablaðið's Friday edition, using big words on shadow direction, illegal acts and the urgent need for legal amendments.</seg>
        <seg id="31">This was truly a molehill that was to be made into a mountain, even though the molehill in question was conditional as well as being quickly removed.</seg>
        <seg id="32">Finally, let's consider the subject itself, as it is an important one.</seg>
        <seg id="33">Above, I noted the provisions of the Pension Fund Act that pertain to this issue.</seg>
        <seg id="34">They say that the boards of pension funds are obliged to protect the interests of fund members and have ethical investment criteria, and these provisions are further elaborated in the Articles of Association of both Gildi and the Pension Fund of Commerce, as I have noted.</seg>
        <seg id="35">On the other hand, pension fund are NOT supposed to only consider short-term profitability in their investments.</seg>
        <seg id="36">In fact, such a policy would be very dangerous, and one would not have to look long for such examples in the past, where big loans from banks and funds have gone to unethical speculators and environmental polluters, with terrible consequences.</seg>
        <seg id="37">The CEO of Icelandair was obviously on thin ice when he got the idea to wipe out an entire group of employees, thus significantly reducing the goodwill that the company has enjoyed in the Icelandic market and weakening its position towards investors.</seg>
        <seg id="38">Fortunately, he reconsidered and reversed this.</seg>
        <seg id="39">Time will tell whether that will be enough, when all is said and done, for pension fund investment in the company to be considered responsible towards the fund members.</seg>

        <seg id="22">Since the word is new in the case, it is not hoped that it has been fully defined, but it seems to me that the following definition is now "most taken": Shadow management is when a union leader says in the media that he intends to send representatives of the union to the board the pension fund's recommendations or instructions on how they should take a position on a particular matter.</seg>
        <seg id="23">If they do not follow the recommendations, they will be removed from the board at the earliest convenience.</seg>
        <seg id="24">If the leader does not cover this in the media and does not talk about dismissal, then it is not "shadow management", as such communication between people is of course always in the financial world as elsewhere.</seg>
        <seg id="25">I leave it to the reader to consider which way he finds more "shady."</seg>
        <seg id="26">There are two people in particular who have tried to formulate this definition as of this writing, on the morning of Saturday, July 25, 2020.</seg>
        <seg id="27">They are Hörður Ægisson, a journalist at Fréttablaðið, and Ásgeir Jónsson, Governor of the Central Bank.</seg>
        <seg id="28">The occasion arose for both of them after Bogi Nils Bogason, CEO of Icelandair, had announced his intention to terminate the company's agreements with flight attendants and flight attendants (terminate them), and Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, chairman of the Reykjavík Tradesmen's Association, sent the recommendation to the company's board representative.

        <seg id="29">Some time later Bogi Nils withdrew his decision and as a result Ragnar Þór went the same way with his recommendations which of course were based on Bogi's decision.</seg>
        <seg id="30">Nonetheless, Hörður and Ásgeir saw reason to talk about the matter in the Friday issue of Fréttablaðið with big words about shadow management, violations of the law and the great need for changes in the law.</seg>

        <seg id="32">Since the issue is important, let's consider the subject at the end.</seg>
        <seg id="33">I have outlined above the points in the law on pension funds that pertain to this matter.</seg>
        <seg id="34">This means that fund boards must safeguard the interests of fund members and have ethical standards in investments, and these issues are elaborated in more detail in the articles of association of both Gildi and the Retailers' Pension Fund, as I mentioned.</seg>
        <seg id="35">Pension funds, on the other hand, should NOT look solely at short-term profitability considerations in their investments.</seg>
        <seg id="36">This would be a very dangerous policy and one does not have to look long for examples of this in the past, as large loans from banks and funds have gone to immoral adventurers and environmental messes, with disastrous consequences.</seg>

        <seg id="1">Pension funds and long shadows</seg>
        <seg id="2">2019 was a major anniversary year in the history of pension funds in Iceland.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Admittedly, officials had received retirement from the Danish king all the streets since the 19th century, but in 1919 a pension fund was established by officials, which eventually became the pension fund of all civil servants.</seg>
        <seg id="4">The basis for existing pension funds for employees was subsequently laid by comprehensive collective bargaining agreements in the labour market in 1969, which provided for job-related pension funds with compulsory membership and a qualified fund collection from the beginning of 1970.</seg>
        <seg id="5">In 1974, legislation was passed on the basis of these agreements and the pension system continued to strengthen thereafter.</seg>
        <seg id="6">The workers' pension system was not the only radical change driven by the 20th-century labor movement through its wage struggle.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Unemployment insurance had been achieved in a similar way in the historic strike conflict in 1955, and the organization also gradually implemented its claims for sickness rights and sickness funds, significant leave rights, reduction of working hours, housing reforms and more as a major factor.</seg>
        <seg id="8">All these rights cost a great and strict struggle but proved, in retrospect, a much greater and more lasting wage improvement than an increase in the money in the wage envelope, which disappeared as quickly as the inflation that characterized the post-war period and until 1990 as many remember.</seg>
        <seg id="9">The run-up to the creation of general pension funds in 1969 was both long and complicated.</seg>
        <seg id="10">While people eventually agreed that the funds would actually be the property of fund members, the labor movement had to agree that their boards should be composed of equal representatives of employers and fund members.</seg>
        <seg id="11">In the years after the establishment of the funds, the requirement for the majority of workers on the board of the funds was often discussed by workers' organisations, but it never succeeded, and therefore we are still stuck with the abnormal arrangements that the representatives of fund members are not a majority on the boards of the funds.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Article 36 of Act No. 129/1997 on the compulsory insurance of pension rights and the activities of pension funds deals with the investment policy of the funds.</seg>
        <seg id="13">It says in point 1 that "a pension fund shall be guided by the interests of members."</seg>
        <seg id="14">Point 5 also says: "Pension funds should establish ethical criteria in investments."</seg>
        <seg id="15">The shareholder policy of Lífeyrissjóður merchants includes the following provisions, following the aforementioned legal provisions:</seg>
        <seg id="16">The Pension Fund is a member of the United Nations (UN PRI) rules on responsible investments, along with many of the largest pension funds and professional investors in the US and Europe.</seg>
        <seg id="17">The rules discuss how focusing on environmental and societal issues as well as good corporate governance can contribute to improved portfolio investment performance.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Thus, the interests of investors and the objectives of society go together in a broader context.</seg>
        <seg id="19">LV believes it's important for companies, especially those listed on the stock market, to adopt a public policy: to have good governance of remuneration, social responsibility and environmental issues.</seg>
        <seg id="20">The pension fund Gildi, which is one of the largest funds in the country, has adopted a "responsible investment policy" and contains provisions of a similar nature.</seg>
        <seg id="21">This is all recalled here as an introduction to Iceland's latest fashion motto, "shadow management."</seg>
        <seg id="22">Since the word is new to the case, there is no hope that it has been fully defined, but to me the following definition now seems to be "most taken": Shadow management is when a union leader says in the media that he intends to send a recommendation or instructions to the company's representatives on the pension fund's board on how to take a stand on a particular case.</seg>
        <seg id="23">If they do not follow the recommendations, they will be removed from the board at the earliest convenience.</seg>
        <seg id="24">However, if the leader doesn't deal with this in the media and doesn't talk about resignation, it's not "shadow management" as relations between people are, of course, universal in the financial world as elsewhere.</seg>
        <seg id="25">I leave the reader to reflect on which way he thinks is "shadowy."</seg>
        <seg id="26">In particular, there are two people who have tried to formulate this definition when this is written, on the morning of Saturday 25 July 2020.</seg>
        <seg id="27">There are journalist Hörður Ægisson at Fréttablað and Governor Ásgeir Jónsson.</seg>
        <seg id="28">The reason for both came after Bogi Nils Bogason, CEO of Icelandair, had announced his intention to terminate the company's contracts with flight attendants and flight servants (withdraw them), and Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, chairman of the Reykjavik Commercial Society, then sent out the recommendation to the company's representative on the board of Lífeyrissjóður merchants not to support the fund's possible purchase of shares in the company, otherwise they might be relieved.</seg>
        <seg id="29">Some time later, Bogi Nils withdrew his decision and subsequently Ragnar Thor went the same way with his recommendations, which were, of course, aimed at Bogi's decision.</seg>
        <seg id="30">Nevertheless, Hörður and Ásgeir saw reason to talk about the case in the Friday newspaper Fréttablaðið with big words about shadow management, violation of the law and a rich need for changes to the law.</seg>
        <seg id="31">There was certainly a small thump to overturn a heavy load even though the blessed thump had been in a connection mode and was also quickly wiped out.</seg>
        <seg id="32">Since the issue is important, let's consider the substance itself in the end.</seg>
        <seg id="33">I previously discussed the issues of the Pension Funds Act relating to this matter.</seg>
        <seg id="34">This means that fund managers should protect the interests of fund members and have ethical investment criteria, and these issues are further elaborated in the statutes of both Gildis and Lífeyrissjóður merchants as I mentioned.</seg>
        <seg id="35">However, pension funds should NOT look only at short-term profitability considerations in their investments.</seg>
        <seg id="36">This would be a highly dangerous policy and need not look long for examples of this in the past, as large lending by banks and funds has flowed to unethical adventurers and environmental codes, with disastrous consequences.</seg>
        <seg id="37">The CEO of Icelandair was obviously on slippery ice when he thought of wiping out a whole group of employees, thus significantly reducing the benevolence the company has enjoyed in the Icelandic market and weakening its position towards investors.</seg>
        <seg id="38">Fortunately, he saw in and withdrew this.</seg>
        <seg id="39">Time reveals whether this is enough for the investment of pension funds in the company to be considered liable to members at the end of the day.</seg>

        <seg id="1">Pension funds and long shadows</seg>
        <seg id="2">2019 was a major anniversary year in the history of pension funds in Iceland.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Officials had received a pension from the King of Denmark throughout the 19th century streets, but in 1919 a pension fund was established by pension fund officials who eventually became a pension fund for all public servants.</seg>
        <seg id="4">The basis for the current pension fund for general salaried employees was subsequently proposed by a full collective bargaining agreement in the labour market in 1969, which provided for employment-related pension funds with compulsory membership and a full fund collection since the beginning of 1970.</seg>
        <seg id="5">In 1974, laws were passed on the basis of these agreements and the pension scheme continued to intensify thereafter.</seg>
        <seg id="6">The workers' pension scheme was not the only radical change driven by a 20th-century union with its bargaining power.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Unemployment insurance had been obtained in a similar manner in a historic strike in 1955, and the organisation also gradually advanced its demands for sick leave and health funds, significant vacation rights, shortening the working hours, housing reform and more of that as much as anything.</seg>
        <seg id="8">All of these rights cost great and rigorous struggles but turned out, afterwards, much greater and more permanent scrutiny than the increase in the number of pennies in the wage envelope, which disappeared as hard in the hiacity of inflation that characterized the period after the war and until 1990 as many remember.</seg>
        <seg id="9">The prelude to the creation of general pension funds in 1969 was both long and complex.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Although the men eventually agreed that the funds would be in fact the property of the Treasury, the union had to agree that their boards should be appointed representatives of employers and treasury members equally.</seg>
        <seg id="11">In the coming years after the creation of the funds, the requirement for the majority of workers on the Board of Directors of the Treasury often came into discussion in workers' organisations, but it never reached its point, so we still sit down with the abnormal arrangement that representatives of the Treasury are not in the majority on the boards of the funds.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Article 36 of the Act No. 129/1997 on the compulsory guarantee of pension entitlements and the activities of pension funds deals with the investment strategy of the funds.</seg>
        <seg id="13">It states in Paragraph 1 that "pension funds shall have the interests of the Treasury as a guide."</seg>
        <seg id="14">It also states in Paragraph 5: "Pension funds should set ethical standards for investment."</seg>
        <seg id="15">The pension fund's shareholder policies include the following provisions, as a result of the aforementioned legal provisions:</seg>
        <seg id="16">The pension fund is a member of the United Nations (UN PRI) Rules on Responsible Investments, along with many of the largest pension funds and professional investors in the west and in Europe.</seg>
        <seg id="17">The rules discuss how focusing on environmental and societal issues as well as good corporate governance can contribute to improved investment performance of securities portfolios.</seg>

        <seg id="19">LV believes it is important that companies, particularly those listed on the stock market, set a public policy on: maintaining good governance terms of social responsibility and environmental issues.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Pension fund Gildi, which has the largest funds in the country, has a "policy of responsible investment" and there are provisions of a similar type.</seg>
        <seg id="21">It's all recalled here as an introduction to Icelandic latest fashion word, "shadow management."</seg>
        <seg id="22">Since the word is new in the case, it is not hoped that it has been defined to comply, but it seems to me the following definition now is "most taken": Shadow management is when a union leader says in the media that he intends to send the company's representatives to the board of pension fund recommendations or instructions on how to take sides in a particular case.</seg>
        <seg id="23">If they do not comply with the recommendations, they will be deported from the board at the earliest convenience.</seg>
        <seg id="24">If the leadership doesn't take this to the press and doesn't talk about resignation, however, it's not "shadow management" provided that kind of interaction between men is of course frequent in the financial world as elsewhere.</seg>
        <seg id="25">I'll leave it to the reader to reflect on which way he feels "scarier."</seg>
        <seg id="26">In particular, there are two men who have tried to shape this definition at the time of writing, on the morning of Saturday, July 25, 2020.</seg>
        <seg id="27">They are Hörður Ægisson, journalist at The News and Asgeir Jonsson, the Governor of the Central Bank.</seg>
        <seg id="28">The occasion for both was created after Archer Nils Bogason, CEO of Icelandair, had dismissed his intention to terminate the company's contracts with flight attendants and flight attendants (terminate them), and Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, chairman of the Reykjavik Traders Association, then issued the recommendation to the company's representatives on the board of the Pension Fund traders not to support the potential acquisition of the fund. "or they might be extended.</seg>
        <seg id="29">Some time later, Archer Nils withdrew his decision, and subsequently Ragnar Thor took the same path with his recommendation, which, of course, was aimed at Archer's decision.</seg>
        <seg id="30">Nevertheless, Hörður and Ásgeir saw reason to reproduce the issue in Friday's newspaper, with big words on shadow management, offence and a rich need for changes to the law.</seg>
        <seg id="31">There, a small chopper was truly supposed to roll out a heavy load, although the blessed chopper had been in a connected manner and also been swiftly wiped out.</seg>
        <seg id="32">Since the issue is important, let's consider the topic itself at the end.</seg>
        <seg id="33">I traced here before the issues in the Pension Protection Act pertaining to this matter.</seg>
        <seg id="34">These include that the Treasury boards should take care of the interests of the Treasury and have ethical standards in investment, and these considerations are implemented in detail in the approvals of both Value and pension fund traders as I mentioned.</seg>
        <seg id="35">Pension funds, however, should NOT look solely at short-term profitability considerations in their investments.</seg>
        <seg id="36">This would be precisely a dangerous strategy and does not have to look for long-lasting examples of such things in the past, as large lending banks and funds have slipped to uncontested adventurers and environmental messes, with disastrous consequences.</seg>
        <seg id="37">Icelandair's CEO was obviously on slippery ice when he thought about wiping out an entire group of employees, thus significantly reducing the goodwill the company has enjoyed in the Icelandic market and weakening its position towards investors.</seg>
        <seg id="38">Fortunately, he saw himself and pulled it back.</seg>

        <seg id="1">Pension funds and long shadows</seg>
        <seg id="2">The year 2019 was much the anniversary of a year in the history of the pension funds in the united states.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Officials had admittedly received a pension from the King of all the streets from the 19th. century, but in 1919 was constituted the pension fund officials who eventually became to the pension fund all public sector employees.</seg>
        <seg id="4">The basis of the existing pension funds of ordinary salaried employees was subsequently charged with the hosts collective bargaining in the labor market in 1969 which provides a work pension fund with compulsory membership and fullgildri sjóðsöfnun from the beginning of the 1970s.</seg>
        <seg id="5">In 1974 there were so put the law on the basis of these agreements and pension system continued to grow stronger after it.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Pension system salaried employees was not the only radical change verkalýðshreyfing 20. century knocked out by kjarabaráttu time.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Unemployment insurance had been obtained by similar means in the legendary verkfallsátökum in 1955, and also received the organization gradually they wanted their claims about veikindarétt and your sickness fund, a significant orlofsréttindi, shortening vinnutímans, reform in housing and more such as a great replacement.</seg>
        <seg id="8">All of these rights are cost intensive and strict struggle but proved, in retrospect, much greater, and more permanent kjarabót but propagation auranna in launaumslaginu, which disappeared jafnharðan in hít of inflation that characterized the period after the war and until the early 1990s, as many remember.</seg>
        <seg id="9">The creation of the general pension fund in 1969 was both long and complicated.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Although humans would finally together that the funds would be in practice the property sjóðsfélaga became verkalýðshreyfingin to consent to the boards of their duty of appointed representatives of the employers and sjóðsfélaga to par.</seg>
        <seg id="11">In the next few years after the establishment of the funds came the requirement for a majority of workers in the management of the funds often for discussion in the federation of workers, but she managed, however, never carried out to walk, and, therefore, do we sit still stuck with it, an abnormal arrangement of the representatives of the sjóðsfélaga are not in the majority on the boards of the funds.</seg>
        <seg id="12">In the 36. article of the law no. 129/1997 about the disability pension is covered by the investment strategy of the funds.</seg>
        <seg id="13">It says in 1. paragraph that "the pension fund shall have the interests of the members to the forefront.“</seg>
        <seg id="14">Also says in 5. paragraph: "the pension Fund should be set moral criteria in their investments.“</seg>
        <seg id="15">In hluthafastefnu the Pension fund verslunarmanna include the following provisions, in consequence of the previously mentioned legal provisions:</seg>

        <seg id="17">In the rules is about how the emphasis on environmental and social issues as well as the good governance of companies can contribute to the enhancement of fjárfestingarárangri verðbréfasafna.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Thus brought together in the interests of the investors and the goal of the society in a broader context.</seg>
        <seg id="19">LV believes it is important to organizations, especially those listed on the stock market, the posture of a public policy on: to introduce good governance remuneration of corporate social responsibility and environmental issues.</seg>
        <seg id="20">The pension fund Value, which is the largest funds in the country, has set a "strategy for responsible investment" and where are the provisions of a similar nature.</seg>
        <seg id="21">This is all brushed up here as an introduction to the latest tískuorði íslenskunnar, "skuggastjórnun".</seg>
        <seg id="22">Where the word is new in the case is not hope that it has been defined fully, but I think the following definition now be "the most captured": Skuggastjórnun is it already fought in the union says in the media that he is going to send the representatives of the company in the board of the pension fund recommendations or instructions on how they should take a position in a particular case.</seg>

        <seg id="24">If forystumaðurinn'm not going with this in the press and speaks not of termination, then it is not, however, "skuggastjórnun" the ends are sort of communication between people of course always in the financial world as elsewhere.</seg>
        <seg id="25">I'll leave the reader to contemplate either way, he feels "a more sinister.“</seg>
        <seg id="26">There are in particular two men who have tried to formulate this definition when this is written, the morning of Saturday the 25th. July 2020.</seg>
        <seg id="27">There are those Hordur Ægisson journalist on Fréttablaðið and Ásgeir Jónsson governor.</seg>
        <seg id="28">The occasion provided both became after Bogi Nils Bogason ceo of Icelandair had told of the intention to terminate the contracts of the company with the flight attendants and attendants (tell them up), and Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, chairman of the Verslunarmannafélags Reykjavik sent them out the recommendations to the representative of the company in the board of the Pension fund verslunarmanna that do not support the potential purchase of the fund shares in the company, or should they be made to depart.</seg>
        <seg id="29">Some time later, drew Bogi Nils its decision to back and subsequently went Ragnar Thor the same way with its recommendation that miðuðust of course with the decision of the Bow.</seg>

        <seg id="34">In those inherent to sjóðstjórnum should represent the interests of members and have ethical standards in the investment, and these points are elaborated in more detail in the articles of both Value and Pension fund verslunarmanna as I mentioned.</seg>
        <seg id="35">Pension funds have NOT, however, looking solely to the short-term arðsemissjónarmiða in their investments.</seg>
        <seg id="36">Such was precisely the treacherous policy and does not need to search long to examples of such in the past, where a large lending banks and funds have flowed to the immoral ævintýramanna and umhverfissóða, with disastrous consequences.</seg>

        <seg id="2">2019 was a great anniversary year in the history of pension funds in Iceland.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Officials had reportedly received pensions from the Danish king all the way since the 19th century, but in 1919 a pension fund of officials was established, which eventually became the pension fund of all civil servants.</seg>
        <seg id="4">The basis for the current employee pension funds was then laid down by a comprehensive collective bargaining agreement in 1969, which provided for occupational pension funds with compulsory membership and full fund collection from the beginning of 1970.</seg>
        <seg id="5">In 1974, laws were enacted on the basis of these agreements, and the pension system continued to expand thereafter.</seg>
        <seg id="6">The workers' pension system was not the only radical change that the 20th century labor movement brought about with its wage struggles.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Unemployment insurance had been similar in the history of the strike in 1955, and the organization gradually implemented its requirements for sickness and sickness funds, significant leave rights, reduced working hours, improvements in housing and more as a matter of urgency.</seg>
        <seg id="8">All these rights were a great and difficult struggle but, in retrospect, proved to be a much greater and more lasting benefit than the increase in the pay gap, which disappeared as hard as the inflation that characterised the period after the war and until 1990, as many remember.</seg>
        <seg id="9">The process of establishing a general pension fund in 1969 was long and complicated.</seg>
        <seg id="10">While people eventually agreed that the funds would be the property of fund members, the union movement had to agree that their boards should be composed of representatives of employers and fund members equally.</seg>
        <seg id="11">In the years following the foundation of the funds, the requirement for a majority of workers on the board of the funds was often discussed in the employees' association, but it never materialised, so we are still stuck with the abnormal arrangement that members of the fund members are not a majority on the board of the funds.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Article 36 of Act No. 129 / 1997 on compulsory insurance of pension rights and operations of pension funds deals with the investment policy of the funds.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Point 1 states that "a pension fund should be guided by the interests of members."</seg>

        <seg id="21">This is all recalled here as an introduction to the latest Icelandic fashion word," shadow management."</seg>
        <seg id="22">As the word is used in the case, it is not expected to have been fully defined, but it seems to me that the following definition is now "most accepted": Shadow Management is when a union leader says in the media that he intends to send members of the union to the Board of Pension Funds a recommendation or an instruction on how to take a position in a particular case.</seg>
        <seg id="23">If they do not follow the recommendation, they will be removed from the Board at the earliest opportunity.</seg>
        <seg id="24">If the leader does not take this to the media and does not talk about resignation, however, it is not "shadow management" as the kind of interaction between people is of course always in the financial world as elsewhere.</seg>

        <seg id="29">Some time later, Bogi Nils withdrew his decision, and then Ragnar Þór went the same way with his recommendation, which was of course based on Bogi's decision.</seg>

        <seg id="32">As the issue is important, let's consider the topic itself at the end.</seg>
        <seg id="33">I referred to above the points in the Pension Fund Act pertaining to this matter.</seg>
        <seg id="34">This means that fund managers should protect the interests of fund members and have ethical criteria in investments, and these issues are further elaborated in the statutes of both Gildi and the Pension Fund of Traders as I mentioned.</seg>

        <seg id="36">This would be a highly dangerous policy and you don't have to look long for examples of this in the past, where large loans from banks and funds have flowed to immoral adventurers and environmental wasters, with disastrous consequences.</seg>
        <seg id="37">The CEO of Icelandair was obviously on slippery ice when he thought of wiping out a whole group of employees, thereby drastically reducing the benefits the company has enjoyed in the Icelandic market and weakening its position towards investors.</seg>

        <seg id="28">The occasion for both arose after Bogi Nils Bogason, CEO of Icelandair, had announced his intention to terminate the company's contracts with flight attendants and flight attendants (dismiss them), and Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, chairman of the Reykjavik Merchants' Association, then sent out the recommendation to the company's representative on the board of the Merchants' Pension Fund not to support the fund's possible purchase of shares in the company, otherwise they might be dismissed.</seg>
        <seg id="29">Some time later, Bogi Nils withdrew his decision, and subsequently Ragnar Þór went the same way with his recommendation, which of course was based on Bogi's decision.</seg>
        <seg id="30">Nevertheless, Hörður and Ásgeir saw a reason to discuss the matter in the Friday edition of Fréttablaðið with big words about shadow management, lawbreaking and the need for changes in the law.</seg>
        <seg id="31">There, a small number of people really had to cast a heavy vote, even though the blessed thousands had been in attendance and were also quickly wiped out.</seg>
        <seg id="32">Since the subject is important, let's consider the subject itself at the end.</seg>
        <seg id="33">I have already mentioned the aspects of the law on pension funds that are relevant to this issue.</seg>
        <seg id="34">This means that fund managers must protect the interests of fund members and have ethical standards in investments, and these points are elaborated in more detail in the statutes of both Gildis and the Merchants' Pension Fund, as I mentioned.</seg>
        <seg id="35">However, pension funds should NOT look only at the short-term profitability of their investments.</seg>
        <seg id="36">This would be a very dangerous policy, and one does not have to look far for examples of this in the past, where large loans from banks and funds have gone to unscrupulous adventurers and environmentalists, with disastrous consequences.</seg>
        <seg id="37">The CEO of Icelandair was obviously on thin ice when he came up with the idea of wiping out an entire group of employees, thereby significantly reducing the goodwill that the company has enjoyed in the Icelandic market and weakening its position with investors.</seg>
        <seg id="38">Fortunately, he saw sense and withdrew it.</seg>
        <seg id="39">Time will tell whether this is enough for the pension funds' investment in the company to be considered responsible towards the fund members in the end.</seg>

        <seg id="1">Pension funds and long shadows</seg>
        <seg id="2">The year 2019 was a great anniversary year in the history of pension funds in Iceland.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Admittedly, officials had retired from the King of Denmark all the way since the 19th century, but in 1919 an officials' pension fund was set up, which eventually became a pension fund for all civil servants.</seg>
        <seg id="4">The basis for the current pension funds for civil servants was then laid down by a comprehensive collective labour agreement in 1969 which provided for occupational pension funds with compulsory membership and a qualifying fund collection from the beginning of 1970.</seg>
        <seg id="5">In 1974, laws were passed on the basis of these agreements and the pension scheme continued to grow stronger thereafter.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Employees' pension scheme was not the only radical change driven by the labor movement of the 20th century through its wage struggle.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Unemployment insurance had been obtained in a similar way in a historic strike conflict in 1955, as well as gradually pursuing its demands for sickness rights and sickness funds, substantial leave entitlements, reduction of working hours, housing reform and other important matters.</seg>
        <seg id="8">All these rights cost a great and rigorous struggle, but in retrospect they turned out to be much higher and more permanent wage compensation than an increase in the number of ounces in the pay envelope, which disappeared as soon as possible into the chalk of inflation that characterised the period after the war until 1990 as many remember.</seg>
        <seg id="9">The prelude to the establishment of general pension funds in 1969 was both long and complex.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Although people finally agreed that the funds would in fact be the property of fund members, the union movement had to agree that their boards should be composed of equal representatives of employers and fund members.</seg>
        <seg id="11">In the years following the establishment of the funds, the requirement for a majority of employees on the board of the funds was often discussed in employees' organisations, but it never succeeded, so we still have such abnormal arrangements that representatives of fund members do not hold a majority on the boards of the funds.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Article 36 of Act No. 129 / 1997 on Mandatory Pension Insurance and the Activities of Pension Funds deals with the investment policy of the Funds.</seg>
        <seg id="13">It states in point 1 that "a pension fund shall be guided by the interests of fund members."</seg>
        <seg id="14">It is also stated in point 5: "A pension fund shall establish ethical criteria in investments."</seg>
        <seg id="15">The shareholder policy of the Tradesmen's Pension Fund contains, inter alia, the following provisions, following the aforementioned legal provisions:</seg>
        <seg id="16">The Pension Fund is a member of the United Nations (UN PRI) Code on Responsible Investments, along with many of the largest pension funds and professional investors in the West Sea and Europe.</seg>
        <seg id="17">The rules discuss how focus on environmental and societal issues as well as good corporate governance can contribute to improving the investment performance of portfolios.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Thus, the interests of investors and the objectives of society coincide in a broader context.</seg>
        <seg id="19">LV believes that it is important for companies, particularly those listed on the stock market, to establish a public policy on: to maintain good governance of social responsibility and the environment.</seg>
        <seg id="20">The Pension Fund Values, which is one of the country's largest funds, has established a "responsible investment policy," which contains provisions of a similar nature.</seg>
        <seg id="21">This is all recalled here as an introduction to Icelandic's latest fashion word, "Shadow Management."</seg>
        <seg id="22">As the word is new in the matter, there is no hope that it has been fully defined, but it seems to me that the following definition is now "most widely taken": Shadow management is when a union leader says in the media that he intends to send recommendations or instructions to members of the Pension Fund Board on how to take a position on a particular matter.</seg>
        <seg id="23">If they do not follow the recommendation, they will be removed from the Board at the earliest opportunity.</seg>
        <seg id="24">However, if the leader does not deal with this in the media and does not talk about dismissal, it is not "shadow management," as this kind of communication between people is of course common in the financial world, as elsewhere.</seg>
        <seg id="25">I leave the reader to reflect on which way he thinks is "more shady."</seg>
        <seg id="26">In particular, there are two people who have attempted to formulate this definition at the time of writing, on the morning of Saturday 25 July 2020.</seg>
        <seg id="27">These are Hörður Ægisson, journalist on Fréttablaðið, and Ásgeir Jónsson, Governor of the Central Bank.</seg>
        <seg id="28">The occasion arose after Bogi Nils Bogason, CEO of Icelandair, had stated his intention to terminate the company's contracts with flight attendants and flight attendants (terminate them), and Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, chairman of the Reykjavík Chamber of Commerce, sent out a recommendation to the company's representatives on the Board of Directors of the Pension Fund of Commercial Officers not to support the fund's potential acquisition of shares in the company, otherwise they might be removed.</seg>
        <seg id="29">Some time later, Bogi Nils withdrew his decision, followed by Ragnar Þór following his recommendation, which was of course based on Bogi's decision.</seg>
        <seg id="30">Nevertheless, Hörður and Ásgeir saw reason to talk about the matter in the Newspaper's Friday newspaper in big words about shadow management, criminal offences and the strong need for amendments to the law.</seg>
        <seg id="31">A small cap was certainly supposed to overturn a heavy load even though the blessed cap had been in an attachment mode and was also erased quickly.</seg>
        <seg id="32">Since the issue is important, let's consider the subject itself at the end.</seg>
        <seg id="33">I outlined above the issues in the Pension Fund Act pertaining to this matter.</seg>
        <seg id="34">These imply that fund managers should protect the interests of fund members and have ethical investment criteria, and these issues are elaborated in more detail in the statutes of both Valid and the Tradesmen's Pension Fund, as I mentioned.</seg>
        <seg id="35">However, pension funds should NOT look solely at short-term profitability considerations in their investments.</seg>
        <seg id="36">This would be a very dangerous policy and do not have to look for long for examples of this in the past, as large loans from banks and funds have accrued to immoral adventurers and environmental slobs, with tragic consequences.</seg>
        <seg id="37">The CEO of Icelandair was obviously on slippery ice when he thought of wiping out a whole group of employees, thereby significantly reducing the goodwill that the company has enjoyed in the Icelandic market and weakening its position towards investors.</seg>
        <seg id="38">Fortunately, he took care of himself and pulled this back.</seg>
        <seg id="39">Time reveals whether this is sufficient for the investment of pension funds in the company to be considered responsible to fund members at the end of the day.</seg>

        <seg id="3">Hann er Íslendingur sem er þó ekki búsettur hér að staðaldri og fékk því ekki skýrar leiðbeiningar um að viðhafa svokallaða heimkomusmitgát eftir komuna til landsins og fara í aðra sýnatöku nokkrum dögum eftir komuna.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Hann fékk neikvætt úr skimun við landamærin.</seg>
        <seg id="5">„En hann er í íslensku samfélagi og í raun átt að fara í það úrræði,“ segir Kamilla Jósepsdóttir, sérfræðingur á sóttvarnasviði hjá Landlækni og staðgengill sóttvarnalæknis á meðan hann er í sumarfríi, í samtali við Fréttablaðið í dag.</seg>

        <seg id="21">„Það er í raun mjög ólíklegt,“ segir Kamilla en tekur fram að ekki sé hægt að útiloka það fyrr en Íslensk erfðagreining er búin að raðgreina veiruna í manninum.</seg>

        <seg id="2">One of the three diagnosed with Covid-19 in the country yesterday arrived from a Baltic state on 15 July, about one and a half weeks ago.</seg>

        <seg id="6">"He used the English registration form, where it is not required to record your identification number, and if the identification number is not recorded, you are not automatically summoned to be tested for the second time."</seg>
        <seg id="7">She says that the man was able to use the English registration form because he does in fact reside abroad, but because of his contact network in Iceland, as an Icelander, he should rather have used the Icelandic one.</seg>

        <seg id="13">Fortunately, the man in question was not in contact with many people when he came to the country despite being defined as a participant in Icelandic society, being Icelandic.</seg>

        <seg id="18">However, she does not want to rule out that the man was infected here in Iceland rather than bringing the virus with him to the country.</seg>

        <seg id="1">A whole apartment building rotting away in the best part of town</seg>
        <seg id="2">Romanian workers live for free at Dunhagi 18-20.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Meanwhile, the owners want a construction licence to make renovations, but their request has been stuck in the system for more than two years.</seg>
        <seg id="4">In one of Reykjavik's oldest, most established and most expensive neighbourhoods stands a stately three-storey apartment building.</seg>
        <seg id="5">The ground floor has approximately 600 square metres of commercial space.</seg>
        <seg id="6">The backside of the building has two doors to stairwells, each of which provides access to four rather grand apartments.</seg>
        <seg id="7">They range in size from 93 to 130 square metres, although most of them are over 100.</seg>
        <seg id="8">The building has a considerable history.</seg>
        <seg id="9">It was built in 1959 and former activities there include a video rental shop, shoemaker, milk shop, gunsmith, fishmonger and, most recently, University Printing.</seg>
        <seg id="10">The house has seen better days, to put it mildly.</seg>
        <seg id="11">The building is now subject to extensive damage, as can be seen in the accompanying photos.</seg>
        <seg id="12">The house is owned by D18 ehf.</seg>
        <seg id="13">According to the Company Register, D18 ehf.'s owners include Magnús Magnússon and Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Magnús was at the forefront of Borgun's group of owners and was the spokesman for the holding company Borgun.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Among the owners of the holding company Borgun is Stálskip ehf.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Stálskip ehf. is the investment company of Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir and her children.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Guðrún also owns a one-third share of D18 ehf.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Guðrún and her husband, Ágúst Guðmundur Sigurðsson, once operated the fishing enterprise Stálskip.</seg>
        <seg id="19">D18 ehf. bought the house in the summer of 2009 and little or no maintenance work has been done on it since then.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Neighbours say that since then, the condition of the building has deteriorated steadily, but mostly in recent years.</seg>
        <seg id="21">On a Facebook page for residents of the neighbourhood, one resident says that the house has "not been particularly lively in the last few years."</seg>
        <seg id="22">The fact that the owners have, for several years, sought to alter the building and the lot may play a part in this.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Other neighbours say that the building has not been in acceptable condition for a long time.</seg>
        <seg id="24">The time has long come to do something proper with this spot, and its unfortunate that there has been such a delay."</seg>
        <seg id="25">He also says that he is ticked off at the owners of the building for not having made the effort to complete this thing, to find some common ground with the neighbours of the building and stop this "legal back-and-forth".</seg>
        <seg id="26">"Just do it in consultation with the surrounding community so this can be done quickly and completed."</seg>
        <seg id="27">The "legal back-and-forth" that the neighbour refers to is the planning process for the lot, which has been ongoing since at least 2017.</seg>
        <seg id="28">That was when the owners of Dunhagi 18 and 20 sought permission to add a storey to the current apartment building and build, behind the building, a new elevator shaft and single-storey annex, as well as a basement.</seg>
        <seg id="29">The construction licence issued for this project was appealed to the Ruling Committee on the Environment and Natural Resources, which cancelled the licence as the construction project did not have a basis in the land use plan and the hearing notification procedure was not satisfactory.</seg>
        <seg id="30">The City of Reykjavik then commenced land-use planning work, which concluded with a notice in the Government Gazette in July of last year.</seg>
        <seg id="31">That plan was also appealed and the Commission invalidated it in March of 2020.</seg>
        <seg id="32">At this point, almost three years had passed from the original application for a construction licence, and the owners of the building were back on square one.</seg>
        <seg id="33">The building had deteriorated considerably during that time, and the neighbours were getting weary.</seg>
        <seg id="34">When DV asked the neighbours about the condition of the building and their response, the answers were varied.</seg>
        <seg id="35">Some could understand the intentions of the owners of the house, others not at all.</seg>
        <seg id="36">Some directed their anger towards city authorities, others did not.</seg>
        <seg id="37">Others were just angry. not necessarily with anyone in particular.</seg>
        <seg id="38">Then there were those who said that the parking spaces were a cause of contention, as neighbours have used the unused parking spaces at Dunhagi 18-20 for their own vehicles.</seg>
        <seg id="39">One complainant in the matter said that they were long tired of the administrative system:</seg>
        <seg id="40">"It's incredible that we would have to go through the process three times.</seg>
        <seg id="41">It's like the City of Reykjavik can't read."</seg>
        <seg id="42">Today, the house is empty, abandoned and neglected.</seg>
        <seg id="43">A testament to cumbersome city administration and the noble intentions of the owners and their many years of work, which is now back on square one.</seg>
        <seg id="44">This reporter was met with wide open doors and piles of garbage upon arrival at Dunhagi 18.</seg>
        <seg id="45">A Playstation console and a newish television lay surrounded by other waste on the floor — victims of Icelandic summer precipitation.</seg>
        <seg id="46">The doors to the old University Print office was open and there was quite a lot of cats there, judging from the smell of urine.</seg>
        <seg id="47">Someone has obviously made a spot for themselves in one of the corners, but no one can be seen.</seg>
        <seg id="48">There were stacks of sofas and beds and a few pallets of pages on geology, which were undoubtedly intended to become a book.</seg>
        <seg id="49">The stairwells of the apartment building were also open and there were signs of life in both of them.</seg>
        <seg id="50">The reporter was so lucky as to meet the residents of one.</seg>
        <seg id="51">They were Romanians who were boiling a potato dish for dinner and invited the journalist to step inside.</seg>
        <seg id="52">The Romanians work for the temporary agency Ztrongforce ehf.</seg>
        <seg id="53">They have been there for some time and according to DV's sources, the company has not paid anything for the housing except heat and electricity.</seg>
        <seg id="54">It is not considered acceptable to collect rent, due to the condition of the building.</seg>
        <seg id="55">Judging from the stacks of mail in the lobby, it is obvious that a number of foreign workers have lived there recently.</seg>
        <seg id="56">The operations of temporary agencies have not been unaffected by the Covid-19 situation, as the recession in tourism has resulted in a recession in the construction industry, and these two industries have been among the ones that have made the most use of the services of temporary agencies.</seg>
        <seg id="57">The residents of Dunhagi 18 nevertheless seemed to have plenty to do, and their work overalls and gloves were hanging to dry in the communal area after a long day of work in the rain.</seg>
        <seg id="58">It should be noted that despite the awful state of the building, the apartment shared by the boys seemed to be decently maintained.</seg>
        <seg id="59">When the journalist said goodbye to the Romanian boys, he became suddenly aware of the irony: In a prime spot in Reykjavik stands a 1,500 square metre property in disrepair.</seg>
        <seg id="60">The owners want to change and improve the building and the neighbours want the situation to improve but they disagree on the definition of "improvement".</seg>
        <seg id="61">Caught in between is the City's planning department, back on square one, the victim of endless means of appeals and complaints in the planning process and the Ruling Committee on the Environment and Natural Resources' sluggishness in providing a solution.</seg>
        <seg id="62">And the building is home to Romanian workers, who are perhaps exactly the ones who will go on to improve the situation, once the Icelanders stop squabbling.</seg>
        <seg id="63">The article was originally published in DV's weekend edition on 17 July.</seg>

        <seg id="26">"Do this only in consultation with the surrounding community so that it can be rushed and completed."</seg>
        <seg id="27">The "legal step" that the resident refers to is the planning process of the block that has been going on at least since 2017.</seg>
        <seg id="28">The owners of Dunhagi 18 and 20 then applied for permission to build a floor on top of the existing apartment building and behind the building, a new elevator building and an extension on one floor as well as a basement.</seg>
        <seg id="29">The building permit granted for that project was appealed to the Appellate Committee on Environment and Natural Resources, and the committee revoked it as the project had no basis in the local plan and the local presentation was not satisfactory.</seg>

        <seg id="7">They range from 93–130 square meters, most of them over 100.</seg>
        <seg id="8">The house has a considerable history.</seg>
        <seg id="9">It was built in 1959 and has hosted video rentals, the Shoe Lab, the Dairy Dairy Dairy, Joe Gunmaker, fish sales and, most recently, University Print.</seg>

        <seg id="14">Magnús went before the owners group Borgunar and was the custodian of the holding company Borgunar.</seg>

        <seg id="16">Steelship Ltd. Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir and her children are the investment firms of Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir.</seg>

        <seg id="18">Guðrún and her husband, August Guðmundur Sigurdsson, once ran the steel ship exit.</seg>
        <seg id="19">D18 Ltd. bought the house in the summer of 2009, so little to nothing has been maintained since then.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Neighbors say the condition of the building has deteriorated steadily since, although the most in recent years.</seg>
        <seg id="21">On the neighborhood resident's Facebook page, one resident says the house has 'not been particularly vibrant for the last year'.</seg>
        <seg id="22">It may play into the fact that owners have for several years sought to change the house and grounds.</seg>

        <seg id="26">"Just do this in consultation with the surrounding community so you can get on with it and finish it."</seg>
        <seg id="27">The "legal staple" referred to by the resident is the planning process of the field that has been running a.m.k. since 2017.</seg>
        <seg id="28">The owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 were then authorized to build a hill on top of the existing urban area and behind the house, a new lift house and an annex on one floor as well as a basement.</seg>
        <seg id="29">The construction permit granted for that practice was appealed to the Ruling Committee on Environment and Natural Resources, and the committee repealed it because the construction did not have an adequate shareholding and the neighbourhood presentation was insufficient.</seg>
        <seg id="30">The city of Reykjavík then started sharing work and completed it with an advertisement in the Board of Directors in July last year.</seg>
        <seg id="31">That structure was also sued and the committee repealed it in March 2020.</seg>
        <seg id="32">At this point, it was nearly three years since the initial application for a building permit and the owners of the building to the starting point.</seg>
        <seg id="33">The house had at this time drab down considerably and neighbours managed to get tired.</seg>
        <seg id="34">When the DV asked the neighbours of the house about the situation and the response from neighbours, the answers were in a number of ways.</seg>

        <seg id="54">Because of the condition of the house, it is not premeditated to collect rent.</seg>
        <seg id="55">Judging by the reasons for mail in the lobby of the building, it is clear that there have been a number of foreign workers living in the last few years.</seg>
        <seg id="56">The operation of employee rentals has not been part of the Covid-19 situation, the end of the recession in tourism led to a contraction in the construction sector, and these two businesses have been the most efficient at taking advantage of employee rental services.</seg>

        <seg id="2">Romanian workers live for free at Dunhaga 18-20.</seg>
        <seg id="3">In the meantime, the owners are seeking a building permit for renovations, but their case has languished in the system for three years.</seg>
        <seg id="4">In one of Reykjavik's oldest, greenest and most expensive neighbourhoods stands a stately three-storey apartment building.</seg>
        <seg id="5">On the ground floor of the building there is about 600 square meters of commercial space.</seg>
        <seg id="6">At the back of the house are the doors to two stairwells, each holding four fairly substantial apartments.</seg>
        <seg id="7">They range from 93 to 130 square metres, although most are over 100.</seg>
        <seg id="8">The house has a lot of history.</seg>
        <seg id="9">It was built in 1959 and has housed, among other things, a video rental store, a shoe store, a dairy store, a gunsmith, a fish store and, most recently, a university print shop.</seg>
        <seg id="10">The house has, to put it mildly, outlived its usefulness.</seg>
        <seg id="11">The house is now heavily damaged, as can be seen in the accompanying photos.</seg>
        <seg id="12">The owner of the building is D18 Ltd.</seg>
        <seg id="13">According to the register of companies, the owners of D18 ehf. include Magnús Magnússon and Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Magnús led the ownership group of Borgun and was the representative of the holding company Borgun.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Steel Ship Ltd. is one of the owners of the Borgun holding company.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Steel Ship Ltd. is the investment company of Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir and her children.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Gudrun also owns a third of D18 ehf.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Guðrún and her husband, Ágúst Guðmundur Sigurðsson, once ran the shipping company Steel Ship.</seg>
        <seg id="19">D18 ehf. bought the house in the summer of 2009 and it has hardly been maintained since then.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Neighbors say the condition of the house has steadily deteriorated since then, though mostly in recent years.</seg>
        <seg id="21">On the neighborhood's Facebook page, one resident said the house "hasn't been very lively the last few years."</seg>
        <seg id="22">This may have something to do with the fact that the owners have been looking to change the house and grounds for several years.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Other neighbours said the house had not been in order for a long time.</seg>
        <seg id="24">"It's long overdue to do something decent with this spot and it's a shame it's dragged on like this."</seg>
        <seg id="25">He also says that he is angry with the owners of the house for not having the drive to finish it, to find some common ground with the neighbors of the house and to stop this "lawyering."</seg>
        <seg id="26">"Just do it in consultation with the community so we can hurry up and get it done."</seg>
        <seg id="27">The "legal button" to which the resident refers is the planning process for the field, which has been ongoing since at least 2017.</seg>
        <seg id="28">The owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 then applied for permission to build a floor on top of the existing apartment building and behind the building, a new lift building and an extension on one floor plus a basement.</seg>
        <seg id="29">The building permit granted for this project was appealed to the Committee on the Environment and Natural Resources, and the committee annulled it because the project was not based on a zoning plan and the zoning notice was not sufficient.</seg>
        <seg id="30">The City of Reykjavik then started the planning process and completed it with an advertisement in the Government Gazette in July last year.</seg>
        <seg id="31">That plan was also challenged, and the commission repealed it in March 2020.</seg>
        <seg id="32">At this point, nearly three years had passed since the initial application for a building permit and the owners of the building were just getting started.</seg>
        <seg id="33">By this time the house had fallen into considerable disrepair and the neighbours were beginning to tire of it.</seg>
        <seg id="34">When DV asked the neighbors of the house about the situation and the neighbors' reactions, the answers were varied.</seg>
        <seg id="35">Some understood the intentions of the owners of the house, others not at all.</seg>
        <seg id="36">Others directed their anger at the city, while others did not.</seg>
        <seg id="37">Others were just angry, but not necessarily at anyone.</seg>
        <seg id="38">Still others called the parking lot a nuisance, but neighbors have used the unused Dunhaga 18-20 parking lot for their vehicles.</seg>
        <seg id="39">One plaintiff in the case said he was fed up with the administration:</seg>
        <seg id="40">"For us to have to go through the process three times is just unbelievable.</seg>
        <seg id="41">It's as if the city of Reykjavik can't read."</seg>
        <seg id="42">Today, the house stands empty, abandoned and neglected.</seg>
        <seg id="43">A monument to the city administration and the noble intentions of the owner and their many years of work, which is now in its infancy.</seg>
        <seg id="44">When a reporter arrived at Dunhaga 18's yard, he was greeted by an open door and piles of garbage.</seg>
        <seg id="45">A Playstation and a recent television lay among other debris on the ground - victims of the Icelandic summer wet.</seg>
        <seg id="46">The old office of the University Press was open and there were quite a few cats there judging by the smell.</seg>
        <seg id="47">It is clear that someone has nested in one corner, but no one is visible.</seg>
        <seg id="48">Stacks of sofas and beds and several pallets of geology papers, no doubt destined to become a book, lay scattered about.</seg>
        <seg id="49">The stairwells of the apartment building were both open and full of life.</seg>
        <seg id="50">A reporter was lucky enough to bump into a resident of one of them.</seg>
        <seg id="51">The Romanians were cooking a potato dish for dinner and invited the journalist in.</seg>
        <seg id="52">The Romanians work for the staffing company Ztrongforce Ltd.</seg>
        <seg id="53">They have been there for some time and DV sources say that the company has paid nothing for the premises except for heating and electricity.</seg>
        <seg id="54">Due to the condition of the house, it is not justifiable to charge rent.</seg>
        <seg id="55">Judging by the stacks of mail in the lobby of the building, it is clear that a number of foreign workers have lived there in recent years.</seg>
        <seg id="56">The operation of temporary employment agencies has not been spared by the Covid-19 situation, as the decline in tourism has led to a decline in the construction sector, and these two industries have been the most efficient in using the services of temporary employment agencies.</seg>
        <seg id="57">Nevertheless, the householders at Dunhaga 18 seemed to have plenty to do, hanging their work gloves and mittens out to dry after a long day's work in the rain.</seg>
        <seg id="58">It should be noted that despite the deplorable condition of the house, the apartment the boys shared seemed to be well maintained.</seg>
        <seg id="59">When the reporter said goodbye to the boys in Romanian, the irony suddenly became clear to him: In the best location in Reykjavik, 1,500 square meters of real estate is dilapidated.</seg>
        <seg id="60">The owners want to improve the house, and the neighbors want to improve the situation, but they disagree on the definition of "improvement."</seg>

        <seg id="2">Elísa Viðarsdóttir is an elite footballer who plays with Valur.</seg>
        <seg id="3">She is also an MA student of nutritional science, a mother and working as a food scientist.</seg>
        <seg id="4">She needs plenty of energy for her day-to-day life and she usually gives herself time to cook good, healthy food.</seg>
        <seg id="5">"A normal day for me begins when I arrive at work at just over eight," says Elísa.</seg>
        <seg id="6">"After work, I go to the store so I can prepare dinner before picking up my girl from preschool at about three o'clock."</seg>
        <seg id="7">Elísa finds it very nourishing to pick her daughter up early from preschool.</seg>
        <seg id="8">"It's good to have some time with her before I go to practice in the afternoon.</seg>
        <seg id="9">After practice, it's good to come home and only have to heat up the food.</seg>
        <seg id="10">In the evenings, when our girl has gone to sleep, we like to watch one episode to clear the mind."</seg>
        <seg id="11">Elísa does not adhere to any particular diet.</seg>
        <seg id="12">She's about to complete her Master's thesis in nutritional science so she's well aware of what is suitable for her to eat in order to have enough energy to tend to her work, studies, family and practice schedule.</seg>
        <seg id="13">"It suits me to eat varied food that has a good combination of proteins, carbohydrates and fat.</seg>
        <seg id="14">But most important for me is to have a healthy relationship with food and not categorise food as being either bad or good, but rather as having much or little nutritional value.</seg>
        <seg id="15">The thing is that it's OK to eat everything, just not all at once and not all the time.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Elísa is very interested in cooking.</seg>
        <seg id="17">"I find that there is a kind of meditation in standing and cooking in the kitchen so I try to do it often.</seg>
        <seg id="18">I have to admit that I have confidence on my side in the kitchen and I sincerely believe that I'm an excellent cook."</seg>
        <seg id="19">Breakfast: Oats, chia seeds, hempseeds, a little lemon juice, soaked in almond milk overnight.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Then I top the meal off with what I have at each time.</seg>
        <seg id="21">Usually it's a banana and crispy muesli &amp; COFFEE.</seg>
        <seg id="22">I'm a great coffee enthusiast.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Between meals: It varies incredibly, but fruits or vegetables, rye flatbread, plain skyr with banana and muesli, bread with toppings, and then I could eat hummus with a spoon straight from the box if necessary.</seg>
        <seg id="24">Lunch: I often make all kinds of rich salads from what's in the refrigerator; quinoa or barley, falafel, rocket and oven-baked vegetables with a tasty dressing are some of the things I'm working with.</seg>
        <seg id="25">If the schedule becomes completely unravelled (which happens frequently), the egg boiler at work has quite often saved me, and then it's 2 pieces of bread with butter, cheese and boiled egg, and Bob's your uncle.</seg>
        <seg id="26">Between meals: I'll get something rich in carbohydrates before practice, bread with toppings, breakfast cereal or fruits.</seg>
        <seg id="27">Dinner: Fish is very often the choice in my household, or else some delicious vegetable dishes.</seg>

        <seg id="4">Joe Biden, væntanlegur frambjóðandi Demókrataflokksins, hefur mikið forskot á Trump á landsvísu, sé mið tekið af skoðanakönnunum.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Samkvæmt nýrri könnun AP fréttaveitunnar telur metfjöldi Bandaríkjamanna að þjóðin sé á rangri leið.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Viðbrögð Trump vegna heimsfaraldurs nýju kórónuveirunnar eru sömuleiðis mjög óvinsæl og þar að auki telja fleiri Bandaríkjamenn en áður að forsetinn hafi haldið illa á efnahagsmálum.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Nánar tiltekið segja einungis tveir af hverjum tíu Bandaríkjamönnum að Bandaríkin séu á réttri leið.</seg>
        <seg id="8">32 prósent segjast styðja viðbrögð Trump vegna faraldursins og 48 prósent segja hann hafa haldið vel á efnahagsmálum.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Í mars var það hlutfall 56 prósent og í janúar var það 67 prósent.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Samkvæmt meðaltali FiveThirtyEight er fylgi Biden 49,9 prósent á landsvísu en fylgi Trump 41,9 prósent.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Trump sjálfur hefur reynt að færa athyglina frá frammistöðu hans gagnvart faraldrinum að Biden, ýta undir svokallaðar menningardeilur og boða stefnumál sem eiga að snúa að lögum og reglu.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Framboð Biden leggur þó mikið kapp á að halda athyglinni á Trump og telja miklar líkur á því að bera sigur úr býtum ef kosningin snýst í raun um það hvernig Trump hefur staðið sig í starfi á síðustu fjórum árum.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Óvinsældir Trump virðast einnig ætla að koma niður á þingmönnum Repúblikanaflokksins og óttast Frammámenn að Demókratar gætu jafnvel náð meirihluta á öldungadeild Bandaríkjaþings, sem hingað til hefur þótt mjög hæpið.</seg>

        <seg id="15">Úthverfi hafi reynst flokknum sérstaklega slæm í þingkosningunum 2016 og nú sé útlit fyrir að sú þróun muni halda áfram.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Trump hefur á undanförnum dögum reynt að hræða íbúa úthverfa til að fylgja sér, meðal annars með því að segja að verði Biden forseti, muni hann rústa úthverfum Bandaríkjanna og ýta undir kynþáttadeilur.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Meðal annars hefur Trump fellt niður reglugerð frá tíma Barack Obama í Hvíta húsinu sem ætlað var að auka fjölbreytni í úthverfum.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Þá hvatti hann „húsmæður“ úthverfa Bandaríkjanna til að lesa grein eftir fyrrverandi aðstoðarríkisstjóra New York, þar sem hún hélt því fram að Biden myndi eyða úthverfum Bandaríkjanna og tók Trump undir það.</seg>
        <seg id="19">„Biden mun rústa hverfum ykkar og bandaríska draumnum.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Ég mun varðveita það, og jafnvel gera það enn betra!“ sagði forsetinn.</seg>

        <seg id="22">Samkvæmt NPR eru þeir um helmingur allra kjósenda í Bandaríkjunum.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Allt frá því að George W. Bush var endurkjörinn árið 2004 hefur sá frambjóðandi sem hefur fengið meirihluta atkvæða þessa hóps orðið forseti.</seg>
        <seg id="24">Nema árið 2012 þegar Mitt Romney fékk meirihluta atkvæða frá þessum hópi en tapaði fyrir Barack Obama.</seg>
        <seg id="25">Skoðanakannanir hafa sýnt að þrátt fyrir að Trump tryggði sér nauman meirihluta í úthverfunum 2016 hefur fylgi hans þar dregist verulega saman.</seg>
        <seg id="26">Þó það sé mismunandi á milli kannana hefur Biden mælst með um fimmtán prósentustiga forskot á Trump í útverfunum að undanförnu.</seg>

        <seg id="2">In one hundred days, Americans will go to the polls to elect a President for the next four years.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Donald Trump seeks reelection but faces an uphill battle.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Joe Biden, the expected Democratic candidate, has a big nationwide lead on Trump if opinion polls are to be believed.</seg>
        <seg id="5">According to a recent survey by the AP news agency, a record number of Americans believe that the nation is headed in the wrong direction.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Trump's response to the novel coronavirus pandemic is also highly unpopular, in addition to which an increasing number of Americans believe that the President has handled the economy poorly.</seg>
        <seg id="7">More precisely, only two out of ten Americans say that the United States are heading in the right direction.</seg>
        <seg id="8">32 percent say that they support Trump's response to the pandemic, and 48 percent say that he has handled the economy well.</seg>
        <seg id="9">That proportion was 56 percent in March and 67 percent in January.</seg>
        <seg id="10">According to FiveThirtyEight's average, Biden's support is 49.9 percent nationwide while Trump's support is 41.9 percent.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Trump himself has attempted to shift the focus away from his response to the pandemic and onto Biden, promote the so-called culture gap and announce policies intended to revolve around law and order.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Meanwhile, the Biden campaign makes great efforts to keep the focus on Trump, believing that there's a great chance of victory if the elections will actually revolve around Trump's performance in office over the past four years.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Trump's unpopularity also seems likely to have a negative effect on Republican senators, and prominent Republicans fear that Democrats might even gain a majority in the US Senate, which has been considered highly unlikely until now.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Politico recently reported that if support for parties and candidate remained similar to what it is now, the Republican Party would suffer its biggest defeat in decades.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Suburbs had proved to be particularly bad for the party in the 2016 senate elections and the trend was likely to continue now.</seg>
        <seg id="16">In recent days, Trump has tried to scare suburbanites into supporting him, including by claiming that if elected President, Biden will destroy the suburbs of America and increase racial tensions.</seg>
        <seg id="17">One of Trump's measures was to repeal a regulation from Obama's time in the White House intended to increase diversity in the suburbs.</seg>
        <seg id="18">He also encouraged "housewives" in American suburbs to read an article by a former New York lieutenant governor who claimed that Biden would destroy American suburbs, which Trump agreed with.</seg>
        <seg id="19">"Biden will destroy your neighbourhoods and the American dream.</seg>
        <seg id="20">I will preserve it, and make it even better!" said the President.</seg>
        <seg id="21">Suburban residents are an ever-growing proportion of voters.</seg>
        <seg id="22">According to NPR, they make up about half of all voters in the United States.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Ever since the reelection of George W. Bush in 2004, the candidate who has received the majority of votes from this segment has become President.</seg>
        <seg id="24">The exception was in 2012, when Mitt Romney received the majority of votes from this segment but lost to Barack Obama.</seg>
        <seg id="25">Polls have shown that although Trump secured a narrow majority of suburban voters in 2016, his support among them has decreased significantly.</seg>
        <seg id="26">Although polls have varied, Biden has recently been measured as having a fifteen percent lead on Trump in the suburbs.</seg>

        <seg id="1">It is a steep climb for a hundred days to go to the polls</seg>
        <seg id="2">There are a hundred days until the Americans go to the polls and elect a president for four years.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Donald Trump is running for re-election, but he has a steep run.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Joe Biden, the Democratic Party's prospective candidate, has a huge advantage over Trump nationally, according to opinion polls.</seg>
        <seg id="5">According to a new survey by the AP news agency, a record number of Americans believe that the nation is on the wrong track.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Trump's response to the pandemic of the new coronation virus is also very unpopular, and more Americans than ever before believe that the president has mismanaged the economy.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Specifically, only two out of ten Americans say the United States is on the right track.</seg>
        <seg id="8">32 percent say they support Trump's response to the epidemic and 48 percent say he has kept the economy afloat.</seg>
        <seg id="9">In March it was 56 percent and in January it was 67 percent.</seg>
        <seg id="10">According to the FiveThirtyEight average, Biden's support is 49.9 percent nationally, compared to Trump's 41.9 percent.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Trump himself has tried to divert attention from his performance against the epidemic to Biden, incite so-called cultural disputes and proclaim policies that should be law and order.</seg>
        <seg id="12">However, Biden's candidacy is working hard to keep Trump in the spotlight, and he believes there is a good chance he will win by a landslide if the election is really about how Trump has performed over the past four years.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Trump's unpopularity also appears to be hurting Republican lawmakers, with Democrats fearing that Democrats could even gain a majority in the U.S. Senate, which has so far been seen as very unlikely.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Politico recently reported that party and candidate support would remain comparable to what the Republican Party would be doing now in decades.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Suburbs proved to be particularly bad for the party in the 2016 parliamentary elections and now it looks like this trend will continue.</seg>
        <seg id="16">In recent days, Trump has tried to intimidate suburban residents to follow him, including by saying that if Biden becomes president, he will destroy US suburbs and incite racial strife.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Among other things, Trump has repealed a regulation from the time of Barack Obama in the White House that was intended to increase diversity in the suburbs.</seg>
        <seg id="18">He urged suburban "housewives" to read an article by former New York Deputy Secretary of State in which she argued that Biden would destroy US suburbs, and Trump agreed.</seg>
        <seg id="19">"Biden will destroy your neighborhoods and your American dream.</seg>
        <seg id="20">I will preserve it, and even make it even better! "Said the President.</seg>
        <seg id="21">The suburbs of the United States are a growing group of voters.</seg>
        <seg id="22">According to NPR, they are about half of all voters in the United States.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Ever since George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004, the candidate who has won the majority of this group has become president.</seg>
        <seg id="24">Except in 2012 when Mitt Romney received a majority of votes from this group but lost to Barack Obama.</seg>
        <seg id="25">Opinion polls have shown that despite Trump securing a narrow majority in the 2016 suburbs, his support there has fallen sharply.</seg>
        <seg id="26">Although there are differences between the polls, Biden has recommended a fifteen percentage point advantage over Trump in the recent suburbs.</seg>

        <seg id="24">Except in 2012 when Mitt Romney received a majority of votes from this group but lost to Barack Obama.</seg>
        <seg id="25">Polls have shown that despite Trump securing a small majority in the suburbs in 2016, his follow-up there has slowed considerably.</seg>

        <seg id="2">One hundred days remain until Americans go to the polls to elect a president for a four-year term.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Donald Trump is seeking re-election, but he faces an uphill battle.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has a wide lead over Trump nationally, according to polls.</seg>
        <seg id="5">According to a new AP poll, a record number of Americans think the nation is on the wrong track.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Trump's handling of the novel coronavirus pandemic is also deeply unpopular, and more Americans than ever think the president has handled the economy poorly.</seg>
        <seg id="7">More specifically, only two in 10 Americans say the country is headed in the right direction.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Thirty-two percent say they approve of Trump's response to the outbreak, and 48 percent say he has handled the economy well.</seg>
        <seg id="9">In March it was 56 per cent and in January it was 67 per cent.</seg>
        <seg id="10">According to the FiveThirtyEight average, Biden is at 49.9 percent nationally, while Trump is at 41.9 percent.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Trump himself has tried to shift the focus from his performance on the pandemic to Biden, pushing so-called culture wars and touting law-and-order policies.</seg>
        <seg id="12">However, Biden's campaign is working hard to keep the focus on Trump and believes it has a good chance of winning if the election is really about how Trump has performed in the job over the past four years.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Trump's unpopularity also looks set to hit Republican lawmakers, with forecasters fearing the Democrats could even win a majority in the US Senate, which has so far proved elusive.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Politico recently reported that if party and candidate support remained at current levels, the Republican Party would suffer its worst defeat in decades.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Suburbs were particularly bad for the party in the 2016 general election, and that trend looks set to continue.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Trump has tried in recent days to scare suburbanites into following him, including by saying that a Biden presidency would devastate America's suburbs and stoke racial divisions.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Among other things, Trump has repealed a regulation from Barack Obama's time in the White House that was intended to increase diversity in the suburbs.</seg>
        <seg id="18">He then urged the "housewives" of America's suburbs to read an article by the former deputy governor of New York, in which she argued that Biden would destroy America's suburbs, and Trump agreed.</seg>
        <seg id="19">"Biden will destroy your neighborhoods and the American dream.</seg>
        <seg id="20">I will preserve it, and even make it better!" he said.</seg>
        <seg id="21">America's suburbanites are an ever-expanding group of voters.</seg>

        <seg id="13">Trump's unpopularity also seems to come down to Republican Party MPs, fearing that Democrats could even reach a majority in the Senate, which so far has felt very slow.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Politico recently reported that following a party and a candidate comparable to what it is now, the Republican Party would have its greatest demise in decades.</seg>
        <seg id="15">The suburbs have proved to be particularly bad for the party in the 2016 parliamentary elections and it is now likely that this trend will continue.</seg>

        <seg id="17">Among other things, Trump has waived a regulation since Barack Obama's time in the White House designed to diversify the suburbs.</seg>

        <seg id="16">Í seinna skiptið, þegar sótt var um leikana 2020, voru 75 milljónir dala, um tíu milljarðar króna, settir í kynninguna.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Árið 2013, þegar ákveðið var að Tókýó fengið leikana í ár, höfðu japönsk yfirvöld þannig þegar varið sem nemur 30 milljörðum króna til verkefnisins.</seg>
        <seg id="18">En sú upphæð er þó bara dropi í hafið miðað við hvað það kostar að byggja Ólympíuþorp, leikvanga og almennt að styrkja innviði landsins til að ráða við svona mót, undirbúa það og halda sjálfa leikana.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Skipuleggjendur í Japan hafa sagt að Ólympíuleikarnir í Tókýó, sem hefðu átt að vera í gangi þessa dagana en hefur verið frestað um eitt ár vegna kórónuveirunnar, myndu hafa kostað 12,6 milljarða dala.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Í skýrslu frá ríkisendurskoðanda í Japan sem út kom í lok síðasta árs kom þó fram að nær væri að kostnaðurinn væri tvöföld sú tala.</seg>
        <seg id="21">Líklega verður ekki hægt að leggja fyllilega mat á kostnaðinn við að fresta leikunum en áætlað hefur verið að það geti kostað á bilinu tvo til sex milljarða dala til viðbótar við upphaflegan kostnað.</seg>
        <seg id="22">Heildarkostnaður fyrir japönsku Ólympíunefndina og japanska skattgreiðendur gæti því hlaupið á bilinu 15 til 30 milljörðum dala.</seg>

        <seg id="27">Ríó í Brasilíu situr uppi með verulegar skuldir vegna leikanna 2016 og hefur verið í vandræðum með að kosta viðhald á öllum þeim stóru íþróttamannvirkjum sem byggð voru fyrir leikana.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Rýnt hefur verið í tölur eftir leikana í London 2012 en þar hefur komið í ljós að aðeins 10 prósent þeirra sem fengu atvinnu tengda Ólympíuleikunum í borginni voru atvinnulaus áður.</seg>
        <seg id="29">Það þýðir að ekki var um að ræða ný störf nema að litlu leyti.</seg>
        <seg id="30">Almennt hafa borgir ekki komið sérlega vel út úr því fjárhagslega að halda Ólympíuleika vegna þess sligandi kostnaðar sem fylgir mannvirkjunum sem byggð eru fyrir leikana.</seg>
        <seg id="31">Ávinningur er þó gjarnan talinn felast í aukinni umferð ferðamanna sem vilji heimsækja Ólympíuborgirnar í kjölfar leikanna, sem þó er mikil óvissa um varðandi leikana 2021.</seg>
        <seg id="32">Einnig er óvíst hvort hægt verður að taka við öllum þeim fjölda áhorfenda sem vanalega sækja leikana.</seg>

        <seg id="34">Því þrátt fyrir gríðarlegan kostnað þá má líka að segja að gleðin sem leikarnir færa sé ekki þess eðlis að hægt sé að setja á hana verðmiða.</seg>
        <seg id="35">En þótt sýningin sé gjarnan mikilfengleg og hvergi sé til sparað þá snýst þetta auðvitað ekki bara um peninga.</seg>

        <seg id="1">Will the Olympic flame be the light at the end of the tunnel?</seg>
        <seg id="2">When the final decision had been taken to postpone the Olympic Games, an event that only world wars had disrupted until then, the President of the International Olympic Committee said that the famous Olympic flame would be the "light at the end of the tunnel", presumably referring to the coronavirus pandemic through which the world is now jointly navigating.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Elite athletes have one more year to prepare themselves and Japanese authorities take on extra costs because of the postponement.</seg>
        <seg id="4">But all keep their chin up, as there is much at stake.</seg>
        <seg id="5">When it was announced that Tokyo, Japan, would be the site of this year's Olympics, the celebrations of the Japanese delegates were genuine.</seg>
        <seg id="6">They cried and laughed in turns, Tokyo having applied to host the 2016 games but losing out Rio, Brazil.</seg>
        <seg id="7">This time, Tokyo and Japan would revel in the global spotlight.</seg>
        <seg id="8">The Olympics were supposed to be held on 24 July to 9 August, but have now been postponed for a year so they will instead begin on 23 July 2021 and end on 8 August.</seg>
        <seg id="9">If the games cannot be held then, if the coronavirus will still be too much of a threat, the games will be cancelled.</seg>
        <seg id="10">But this is something that no one really wants to contemplate.</seg>
        <seg id="11">The Olympic Games are no ordinary sporting competition.</seg>
        <seg id="12">No expense is spared, the spectacle is always supposed to be dazzling and top the previous games.</seg>
        <seg id="13">The selection of a host city for the Olympics is based on how an evaluation commission rates the cities' presentations.</seg>
        <seg id="14">The more spectacular the presentation — the more likely it is to be awarded.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Tokyo spent USD 150 million on its bid to host the 2016 Olympics, or the equivalent of over ISK 20 billion.</seg>
        <seg id="16">In the second instance, in the application for the 2020 games, USD 75 million, about ISK 10 billion, was spent on the promotion.</seg>
        <seg id="17">In 2013, when it was decided that Toyko would be awarded this year's games, Japanese authorities had therefore already spent the equivalent of ISK 30 billion on the project.</seg>
        <seg id="18">But this amount is only a drop in the ocean compared to the cost of building an Olympic village and stadiums, and the general cost of strengthening the country's infrastructures in order to be able to manage such a tournament, preparing for it and holding the games themselves.</seg>
        <seg id="19">The Japanese organisers have said that the Tokyo Olympics, which were supposed to be taking place now but have been postponed for a year because of the coronavirus, would have cost USD 12.6 billion.</seg>
        <seg id="20">However, a report by the Japanese Board of Audit, published at the end of last year, revealed that the actual cost was closer to double that figure.</seg>
        <seg id="21">It's probably not possible to fully assess the cost of postponing the games but according to estimates, the cost may be from two to six billion dollars, in addition to the original cost.</seg>
        <seg id="22">The full cost for the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese tax payers could therefore range from 15 to 30 billion dollars.</seg>
        <seg id="23">These numbers are so high that all of the Icelandic State's tax income would only cover just under half the Olympics, assuming the lowest possible cost.</seg>
        <seg id="24">The Olympic Games are an event of such magnitude that they have often been the subject of economists who attempt to review the figures and study the benefits and gains from the games.</seg>
        <seg id="25">In short, quite a number of people seem to have concluded that the effects of the Olympics are anything but positive for the economy of the host cities.</seg>
        <seg id="26">There are some short-term effects, including a great short-term increase in jobs, but in the longer term, cites are often left with a trail of debts and enormous operating costs for little-used facilities.</seg>
        <seg id="27">Rio, Brazil, is left with significant debts from the 2016 games and has had trouble funding the maintenance of all the large sports facilities that were built for the games.</seg>
        <seg id="28">A study of the figures from the 2012 games in London has shown that only 10 percent of those who got a job related to the Olympic games in the city were unemployed before.</seg>
        <seg id="29">This means that new jobs weren't created except to a limited extent.</seg>
        <seg id="30">In general, cities have not been particularly economically successful in hosting the Olympics because of the onerous costs related to the structures built for the games.</seg>
        <seg id="31">On the other hand, many believe there to be a benefit in the increased traffic of tourists who want to visit the Olympic cities after the games, although this is highly uncertain when it comes to the 2021 games.</seg>
        <seg id="32">It is also unclear whether it's possible to receive the large number of spectators who usually attend the games.</seg>
        <seg id="33">Most important, however, is the honour accorded to the cities in being selected, which is difficult to assess in terms of money.</seg>
        <seg id="34">The fact is that despite the enormous costs, it could also be said that the joy created by the games is of such a nature that it's impossible to put a price tag on it.</seg>
        <seg id="35">But although the spectacle is often impressive and no expense is spared, money is of course not the only issue.</seg>
        <seg id="36">The sports stars are at the forefront.</seg>
        <seg id="37">For some elite athletes, postponing the games is an accidental blessing.</seg>
        <seg id="38">One of these is Australian pentathlon competitor and gold medallist at the last Olympics, Chloe Esposito, who is heavily pregnant and would have been absent this summer but is hoping to be in competitive shape for the 2021 games.</seg>
        <seg id="39">That is why she is one of the athletes who are rather pleased with the postponement, for understandable reasons.</seg>
        <seg id="40">For the athletes who intended to retire after this year's games, had they been held at the right time, the postponement of the games means, in some instances, that they will retire from competition before the games are held.</seg>
        <seg id="41">They simply do not trust their body to withstand another year of hard training.</seg>
        <seg id="42">Few athletes were as successful in securing their place in the hearts of spectators at the 2016 Olympics in Rio as the gymnastics star Simone Biles.</seg>
        <seg id="43">She came home with four gold medals around her neck and one bronze.</seg>
        <seg id="44">Biles has sat down for several interviews in her home country of the United States to discuss the Olympic Games.</seg>
        <seg id="45">She intends to go to the 2021 games but is not certain that she will still be at her peak at the games next year, when she will be 24 years old.</seg>
        <seg id="46">Although that is generally not considered old, it is rather much for a top-flight gymnast.</seg>
        <seg id="47">"This is a delicate subject" says Biles with a slight smile in an interview on the Olympic Committee's Instagram page when asked whether she intends to be as successful at the 2021 games as she was in Rio in 2016.</seg>
        <seg id="48">"I simply don't know whether I'll still be at the top after another whole year of training," says Biles.</seg>
        <seg id="49">She has previously said that her body will not stand the strain of gymnastic training much longer.</seg>
        <seg id="50">She is nevertheless training enthusiastically for the 2021 Olympics.</seg>
        <seg id="51">Biles admits that it was an uncomfortable feeling to have to stop training all of a sudden when the gymnasium was closed at the height of the pandemic.</seg>
        <seg id="52">Just as with everyone else, there were no exemptions for Biles while all sports facilities were closed for seven weeks.</seg>
        <seg id="53">All her Olympic gold medals could not buy her any priority access and like others, she had to find various ways to stay in shape.</seg>
        <seg id="54">The basic form is certainly a little better than for most people.</seg>
        <seg id="55">"We have a strict schedule now.</seg>
        <seg id="56">It was hard to begin training again when the gymnasium first opened again.</seg>
        <seg id="57">We began slowly but have reached full speed again and I will gradually add to the training as the year goes on.</seg>
        <seg id="58">Obviously, we don't know for sure how these games will be, or whether they will be held, but we can't do anything but train as if they will take place.</seg>
        <seg id="59">I have put in too much effort to leave the sport now," says Biles.</seg>
        <seg id="60">She, like others, has some doubts, or perhaps rather awareness of the possibility of the games not being held in 2021 either.</seg>
        <seg id="61">But trying to make predictions about this is hopeless.</seg>
        <seg id="62">No one can know what the status of the coronavirus pandemic will be in July 2021 and there is nothing to do but prepare for the Olympics assuming that they will be held in a year.</seg>
        <seg id="63">Perhaps the Olympic flame will be the light at the end of the Covid tunnel.</seg>

        <seg id="3">Achievements have an additional year to prepare and the Japanese authorities will cover the costs of the delay.</seg>

        <seg id="10">However, no one really wants to think that thought to the end.</seg>
        <seg id="11">The Olympics are no ordinary sporting event.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Nothing is spared, the show should always be magnificent and strive to top the last games.</seg>
        <seg id="13">The selection of a city for the Olympics is based on the selection committee's assessment of the cities' presentations.</seg>
        <seg id="14">The more magnificent the presentation, the more likely it is to get the nod.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Tokyo spent $ 150 million trying to host the 2016 Olympics, or more than $ 20 billion.</seg>
        <seg id="16">The second time, when the 2020 Games were applied for, 75 million dollars, about ten billion ISK, were put into the presentation.</seg>

        <seg id="19">Organizers in Japan have said that the Tokyo Olympics, which should have been running these days but have been postponed for a year due to the coronary heart disease, would have cost 12.6 billion dollars.</seg>
        <seg id="20">However, a report by the Auditor General of Japan published at the end of last year stated that the cost was almost double that figure.</seg>
        <seg id="21">It will probably not be possible to fully estimate the cost of postponing the games, but it has been estimated that it could cost between two and six billion dollars in addition to the initial cost.</seg>
        <seg id="22">The total cost to the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could therefore range from 15 to 30 billion dollars.</seg>
        <seg id="23">The figures are so high that all the Icelandic state's tax revenue would have been enough for just under half of the Olympics, based on the lowest possible cost.</seg>
        <seg id="24">The Olympics are an event of such magnitude that they have often been the subject of discussion by economists, who try to look at numbers and see the benefits and advantages of the Games.</seg>
        <seg id="25">In short, many people seem to have come to the conclusion that the impact of the Olympics is less than positive for the economies of the cities that host them.</seg>
        <seg id="26">There are some short-term effects, for example, the number of jobs will increase significantly in the short term, but in the long term, cities often end up with debt burdens and the alarmingly high operating costs of little-used structures.</seg>
        <seg id="27">Rio in Brazil is in significant debt due to the 2016 Games and has been struggling to pay for the maintenance of all the major sports facilities built before the Games.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Figures after the London 2012 Games have been examined, but it has been found that only 10 percent of those who got a job related to the Olympic Games in the city were previously unemployed.</seg>
        <seg id="29">This means that there were only a few new jobs.</seg>
        <seg id="30">In general, cities have not benefited much financially from hosting the Olympics due to the staggering costs of the facilities built for the Games.</seg>
        <seg id="31">However, the benefit is often seen in the increased traffic of tourists who want to visit the Olympic cities in the wake of the Games, which is, however, a great deal of uncertainty regarding the 2021 Games.</seg>
        <seg id="32">It is also uncertain whether it will be possible to receive all the number of spectators who usually attend the games.</seg>
        <seg id="33">The main issue, however, is the honor that the cities receive, but it is difficult to value in money.</seg>
        <seg id="34">Because despite the enormous cost, it can also be said that the joy that the games bring is not of the nature that it is possible to put a price tag on it.</seg>
        <seg id="35">But even though the show is often magnificent and there is no saving anywhere, it is of course not just about money.</seg>
        <seg id="36">It is the sports heroes who are in the foreground.</seg>
        <seg id="37">For some high achievers, it's a good idea to postpone the games.</seg>
        <seg id="38">The Australian pentathlete and gold medalist in her article at the recent Olympics, Chloe Esposito, for example, is pale and would have been far from fun this summer but hopes to be in competition form before the 2021 Games.</seg>
        <seg id="39">She is therefore among the athletes who are just rather happy with the postponement, for understandable reasons.</seg>
        <seg id="40">For those athletes who planned to retire after this year's games, if they had been held on time, postponing the games would in some cases mean that they would stop competing before the games take place.</seg>
        <seg id="41">Simply do not trust your body to go through years in addition to rigorous exercises.</seg>
        <seg id="42">Few athletes have been as thoroughly immersed in the hearts of spectators at the 2016 Rio Olympics as gymnastics star Simone Biles.</seg>
        <seg id="43">She came home with four gold around her neck and one bronze.</seg>
        <seg id="44">Biles has recently appeared in several interviews in his home country, the United States, to discuss the Olympics.</seg>
        <seg id="45">She is planning for the 2021 games, but she is not necessarily sure that she will still be at the top of the games next year, as she will then be 24 years old.</seg>
        <seg id="46">Although it is not generally considered old age, it is at best for a gymnast in the forefront.</seg>
        <seg id="47">"This is a sensitive issue," says Biles, but smiles to herself in an interview published on the Olympic Committee's Instagram page when asked if she intends to achieve as much in the 2021 Games as she did in Rio 2016.</seg>
        <seg id="48">"I really do not know if I will still be at the top after a full year of training," said Biles.</seg>
        <seg id="49">She has previously said that her body can no longer withstand the stress that comes with gymnastics training much longer.</seg>
        <seg id="50">Nevertheless, she is training hard for the 2021 Olympics.</seg>
        <seg id="51">Biles admits it was an awkward feeling to have to abruptly stop exercising when the pandemic peaked and the gym closed.</seg>
        <seg id="52">There were no exceptions for Biles rather than others while all sports facilities were closed for seven weeks.</seg>
        <seg id="53">All her Olympic gold could not buy any access above the others, she had to find various ways to stay in shape like others.</seg>
        <seg id="54">The basic form is certainly a bit better than most people.</seg>
        <seg id="55">"We have a strict plan now.</seg>
        <seg id="56">It was difficult to start practicing again after the gym opened.</seg>
        <seg id="57">We started slowly but are back on track and I will increase the exercises gradually as the year goes on.</seg>
        <seg id="58">Of course, we do not know exactly how these games will be or whether they will be held, but we still practice considering that they will be, we can not do otherwise.</seg>
        <seg id="59">"I've put too much effort into leaving the sport now," said Biles.</seg>
        <seg id="60">With her, like many others, she doubts or perhaps is more aware that the situation may arise that the games will not be held at all in 2021 either.</seg>
        <seg id="61">Predicting that, though, is hopeless.</seg>
        <seg id="62">No one can know what the situation will be like during the pandemic virus pandemic in July 2021, and there is nothing to do but prepare for the Olympics, given that they will be held next year.</seg>

        <seg id="1">Will the Olympic fire be the light at the end of the tunnel?</seg>
        <seg id="2">After the final decision had been made to postpone the Olympics, events that only world wars have advanced to date, the president of the International Olympic Committee said that the famous Olympic fire would be "the light at the end of the tunnel," referring presumably to the coronavirus pandemic that the world is now undergoing together.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Athletes have another year to prepare and the Japanese authorities are compensating for the cost of the delay.</seg>
        <seg id="4">At least everyone holds a head, as there is a lot at stake.</seg>
        <seg id="5">When it was announced that Tokyo in Japan would be the venue for this year's Olympics, the cheers of the Japanese representatives were genuine.</seg>
        <seg id="6">They wept and laughed alternately, as Tokyo had applied to host the 2016 Games, but that time was lower for Rio in Brazil.</seg>
        <seg id="7">This time, Tokyo and Japan should bathe in the attention of the world.</seg>
        <seg id="8">The tournament was scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August but has been postponed for a year and will instead start on 23 July 2021 and end on 8 August.</seg>
        <seg id="9">If the Games are not held, if the coronavirus still becomes too much of a threat, the Games will be cancelled.</seg>
        <seg id="10">However, no one wants to completely think that thought to the end.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Olympics is no ordinary sports competition.</seg>
        <seg id="12">There is nothing saved, the show should always be magnificent and strive to top the last games.</seg>
        <seg id="13">The selection of a city for the Olympics is based on the selection committee's assessment of the cities' presentations.</seg>
        <seg id="14">The more magnificent the presentation - the more likely it will be.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Tokyo spent $150 million trying to host the 2016 Olympics, or more than ISK 20 billion.</seg>
        <seg id="16">The second time, when the 2020 Games were applied for, $75 million, about $10 billion, was put into the presentation.</seg>
        <seg id="17">In 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo will receive the Games this year, the Japanese authorities had already spent ISK 30 billion on the project.</seg>
        <seg id="18">However, that amount is just a drop in the ocean considering the cost of building Olympic villages, toys and generally strengthening the country's infrastructure to cope with such tournaments, prepare it and host the Games themselves.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Organizers in Japan have said the Tokyo Olympics, which should have been running these days but has been delayed by a year due to the coronavirus, would have cost $12.6 billion.</seg>
        <seg id="20">However, a report from the State Auditor of Japan, published at the end of last year, stated that the cost was almost double that figure.</seg>
        <seg id="21">It is likely that it will not be possible to fully assess the cost of postponing the Games, but it has been estimated that it can cost between two and six billion dollars in addition to the original cost.</seg>
        <seg id="22">The total cost for the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could therefore run between $15 and $30 billion.</seg>
        <seg id="23">There are so high figures that all tax revenues of the Icelandic state would only cover almost half of the Olympics, compared to the lowest possible cost.</seg>
        <seg id="24">The Olympics are an event of the magnitude that they have often become a topic of discussion for economists, who try to review figures and look at the benefits and benefits of the Games.</seg>
        <seg id="25">In the shortest matter, quite a lot of people seem to have concluded that the impact of the Olympics is less than so positive for the economy of the cities that hold them.</seg>
        <seg id="26">There are some short-term effects, for example, the number of jobs is increasing considerably in the short term, but in the long term, cities are often stuck with debt deals and the threatening operating costs of low-used structures.</seg>
        <seg id="27">Brazil's Rio is stuck with significant debt due to the 2016 Games and has been having trouble costing maintenance of all the major sports facilities built for the Games.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Figures have been reviewed after the London 2012 Games, which revealed that only 10 percent of those who won a related Olympics in the city were unemployed in the past.</seg>
        <seg id="29">This means that there were no new jobs except to a small extent.</seg>
        <seg id="30">In general, cities have not come out particularly well of hosting the Olympics financially because of the adjacent costs associated with the structures built for the Games.</seg>
        <seg id="31">However, there is often thought to be an increase in the traffic of tourists who want to visit the Olympic cities following the Games, which is, however, a lot of uncertainty regarding the 2021 Games.</seg>
        <seg id="32">It is also uncertain whether it will be possible to accept all the number of spectators who usually attend the Games.</seg>
        <seg id="33">However, the main issue is the honor the cities are allowed to be chosen, but it is difficult to estimate for money.</seg>
        <seg id="34">Therefore, despite enormous costs, it can also be said that the joy brought by the Games is not of the nature that a price tag can be placed on it.</seg>
        <seg id="35">But although the exhibition is often magnificent and there is nowhere to be saved, of course, it's not just about money.</seg>
        <seg id="36">It's the sports heroes that are in the foreground.</seg>
        <seg id="37">For some athletes, it's accidentally just welcome to postpone the Games.</seg>
        <seg id="38">For example, the Australian fifth-winner and gold medallist in her article at the last Olympics, Chloe Esposito, is casolate and would have been away from good fun this summer, but has hope of being in the form of a competition for the 2021 Games.</seg>
        <seg id="39">She is therefore among the athletes who is just rather pleased with the postponement, for understandable reasons.</seg>
        <seg id="40">For those athletes who planned to retire after this year's Games, if they had been held on time, the suspension of the games means in some cases that they will retire before the Games take place.</seg>
        <seg id="41">Simply don't trust their body to go through years in addition to strict exercises.</seg>

        <seg id="47">"This is a sensitive issue," says Biles, but smiles at another in an interview published on the Olympic Committee's Instagram page asked if she intends to achieve the 2021 Games as long as she did in Rio 2016.</seg>
        <seg id="48">"I honestly don't know if I'll still be at the top after a whole year in addition to rehearsals," says Biles.</seg>

        <seg id="28">Numbers after the London Games 2012 have been reviewed, and it has been found that only 10 percent of those who received employment related to the Olympics in the city were unemployed before.</seg>

        <seg id="19">Organizers in Japan have said the Tokyo Olympics, which should have been running these days but have been postponed for a year because of the coronavirus, would have cost $12.6 billion.</seg>
        <seg id="20">However, a report from the State Auditor of Japan published at the end of last year stated that the cost was almost double that figure.</seg>
        <seg id="21">It is likely that the cost of postponing the games will not be fully estimated, but it has been estimated to cost between two and six billion dollars in addition to the initial cost.</seg>
        <seg id="22">The total cost for the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could therefore run between $15 and $30 billion.</seg>
        <seg id="23">The figures are so high that all the tax revenues of the Icelandic state would only cover about half of the Olympic Games, at the lowest possible cost.</seg>
        <seg id="24">Olympic Games are events of such magnitude that they have often become a topic of discussion for economists, who try to look at numbers and look at the benefits and benefits of the Games.</seg>
        <seg id="25">As a matter of fact, an awful lot of people seem to have concluded that the effects of the Olympic Games are less than positive for the economy of the cities that hold them.</seg>
        <seg id="26">There are some short-term effects, for example, large numbers of jobs in the short-term, but in the long-term, cities tend to suffer from debt burdens and enormous operating costs of little used infrastructure.</seg>
        <seg id="27">Rio in Brazil is facing significant debt due to the 2016 Games and has been struggling to cost the maintenance of all the big sports facilities built for the Games.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Figures have been looked at after the 2012 London Games, but it has become clear that only 10 per cent of those who received employment related to the city's Olympic Games were unemployed before.</seg>
        <seg id="29">That means that there were no new jobs except to a small extent.</seg>
        <seg id="30">In general, cities have not been particularly successful in hosting the Olympic Games because of the low cost of the infrastructure built for the Games.</seg>
        <seg id="31">However, there is often thought to be an increased traffic of tourists who want to visit the Olympic cities following the Games, although there is considerable uncertainty about the 2021 Games.</seg>
        <seg id="32">It is also uncertain whether all the number of spectators who usually attend the games will be accepted.</seg>
        <seg id="33">However, the main issue is the credit that the cities have to be selected, which is difficult to estimate for money.</seg>
        <seg id="34">Because despite the enormous cost, it can also be said that the joy that the Games bring is not such that it can be put on a price tag.</seg>
        <seg id="35">But although the exhibition is often grand and there is no saving, it is of course not just about money.</seg>
        <seg id="36">It's the sports halls that are in the foreground.</seg>
        <seg id="37">For some achievement people, postponing the games is surprising.</seg>
        <seg id="38">Australian fifth and gold medallist Chloe Esposito, for example, is a boxer and would have been far from a good sport this summer, but is hoping to be in shape for the 2021 Games.</seg>
        <seg id="39">She is therefore among those athletes who are just rather happy with the postponement, for understandable reasons.</seg>
        <seg id="40">For those athletes who planned to retire after this year's Games, if they had been held on time, the postponement of the Games in some cases means that they will retire before the Games take place.</seg>
        <seg id="41">Trust their body simply not to go through years of rigorous exercise.</seg>
        <seg id="42">Few athletes came to the hearts of spectators at the Rio Olympics in 2016 as well as gymnast Simone Biles.</seg>
        <seg id="43">She came home with four gold around her neck and one bronze.</seg>
        <seg id="44">Biles has attended several interviews in his native United States recently to discuss the Olympic Games.</seg>
        <seg id="45">She is going to the 2021 Games, but she is not necessarily sure that she will still be at the top of the Games next year, as she will be 24 years old.</seg>
        <seg id="46">Although it is generally not considered a high age, it is higher for a leading gymnast.</seg>
        <seg id="47">"This is a delicate issue," says Biles, but smiles for a second in an interview published on the Olympic Committee's Instagram page asked if she intends to make the same progress in the 2021 Games as she did in Rio 2016.</seg>
        <seg id="48">"I honestly don't know if I'll still be at the top after another year of training," says Biles.</seg>
        <seg id="49">She has previously said that her body cannot withstand the stress of gymnastics training much longer.</seg>
        <seg id="50">Nevertheless, she trains diligently for the 2021 Olympic Games.</seg>
        <seg id="51">Biles admits that it was an unpleasant feeling to have to stop exercising suddenly during the pandemic and the gymnasium was closed.</seg>
        <seg id="52">There were no exemptions for Biles rather than others while all sports facilities were closed for seven weeks.</seg>
        <seg id="53">All her Olympic gymnasts could not buy any access beyond the others, she had to find various ways to stay in shape like others.</seg>
        <seg id="54">The basic form is certainly a little better than most people.</seg>
        <seg id="55">"We have a rigid schedule now.</seg>
        <seg id="56">It was difficult to start practicing first again after the gymnasium opened.</seg>
        <seg id="57">We started slowly, but we are back on track and I will increase the training steadily as the year progresses.</seg>
        <seg id="58">Of course, we don't quite know how these games will be or if they will be held, but we still practice assuming they will be, can't help it.</seg>
        <seg id="59">I've put too much effort into leaving the sport now," says Biles.</seg>
        <seg id="60">With it, like other slumbers, doubt or perhaps rather awareness that the situation may arise that the Games will not be held in 2021 at all.</seg>
        <seg id="61">Predicting it is hopeless, however.</seg>
        <seg id="62">No one can know how the situation of the coronavirus pandemic will be in July 2021 and nothing else to do but prepare for the Olympic Games given that they will be held this year.</seg>

        <seg id="1">Will the Olympics be the light at the end of the tunnel?</seg>
        <seg id="2">After a final decision had been made to postpone the Olympics, an event that only world wars have streamlined until now, the president of the International Olympic Committee said that the famous Olympic flame would be “the light at the end of the tunnel,” referring presumably to a pandemic coronavirus that the world is now following through together.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Affluent people have another year to prepare, and authorities in Japan are adding to the cost of the delay.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Everyone keeps their heads down, though, with a lot at stake.</seg>
        <seg id="5">When it was announced that Tokyo, Japan, would be the venue for this year's Olympics, the celebrations of the Japanese representatives were genuine.</seg>
        <seg id="6">They wept and laughed in turn, as Tokyo had applied to hold the 2016 Games but bowed out of the time to Rio in Brazil.</seg>
        <seg id="7">This time, Tokyo City and Japan should bathe in the world's attention.</seg>
        <seg id="8">The games were due to take place from July 24 to August 9, but have been postponed for a year, starting instead on July 23, 2021 and ending on August 8.</seg>
        <seg id="9">If the Games cannot be held then, if the coronavirus still becomes too much of a threat, the Games will be cancelled.</seg>
        <seg id="10">No one quite wants to think that thought through, though.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Olympics are no ordinary sporting competition.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Nothing is saved, the show should always be amazing and seek to top the last few games.</seg>
        <seg id="13">The selection of a city for the Olympics is based on the selection committee's assessment of the cities' presentations.</seg>
        <seg id="14">The more spectacular the publicity — the more likely to get booed.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Tokyo spent $150 million trying to hold the 2016 Olympics, or roughly $20 billion.</seg>
        <seg id="16">The second time, when the 2020 Games were applied for, $75 million, about ten billion euros, was put into the presentation.</seg>
        <seg id="17">In 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo got the Games this year, Japanese authorities had thus already spent as much as ISK 30 billion on the project.</seg>
        <seg id="18">But at least that amount is just a drop in the ocean compared to how much it costs to build Olympic villages, stadiums and generally to strengthen the country's infrastructure to handle this kind of tournament, prepare it and hold the Games themselves.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Organizers in Japan have said the Tokyo Olympics, which should have been running these days but have been postponed for one year because of the coronavirus, would have cost $12.6 billion.</seg>
        <seg id="20">However, a report from Japan's auditor general released at the end of last year found that the cost was nearly double that figure.</seg>
        <seg id="21">It probably won't be possible to fully estimate the cost of postponing the games, but it has been estimated that it may cost between two and six billion dollars in addition to the original cost.</seg>
        <seg id="22">The total cost to the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could therefore run between $15 billion and $30 billion.</seg>
        <seg id="23">There are such large numbers that all of the Icelandic state’s tax revenues would only cover about half of the Olympics, given the lowest possible cost.</seg>
        <seg id="24">Olympics are an event of such magnitude that they have often become the subject of discussion by economists, who try to review numbers and examine the benefits and benefits of the Games.</seg>
        <seg id="25">In the shortest, it seems quite a lot of people have concluded that the impact of the Olympics is less than positive for the economy of the cities that hold them.</seg>
        <seg id="26">Short-term impacts are some, for example, jobs are growing very much in the short term, while longer-term cities tend to be stuck with debt tailwinds and the threatened running costs of little-used infrastructure.</seg>
        <seg id="27">Rio in Brazil is sitting on substantial debt for the 2016 Games and has been troubled by costly maintenance of all the major sports facilities built for the Games.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Figures have been analysed after the London 2012 Games, which have found that only 10 per cent of those who had jobs linked to the Olympics in the city were unemployed before.</seg>
        <seg id="29">This means that there were no new jobs except a small amount.</seg>
        <seg id="30">In general, cities have not been particularly well off financially holding Olympic Games because of the hefty costs associated with the structures built for the Games.</seg>
        <seg id="31">However, benefits are often thought to include an increase in tourist traffic who want to visit the Olympic cities following the Games, which is still highly uncertain regarding the 2021 Games.</seg>
        <seg id="32">It is also unclear whether the full number of spectators who usually attend the Games will be able to be accepted.</seg>
        <seg id="33">The central issue, though, is the honour afforded to the cities, which is hard to value for money.</seg>
        <seg id="34">Because despite the huge cost, you can also say that the joy the games bring is not the kind of thing that you can put on it a price tag.</seg>
        <seg id="35">But while the show tends to be grand and there's nowhere to save, of course it's not just about money.</seg>
        <seg id="36">It's the sporting heroes that are at the forefront.</seg>
        <seg id="37">For some accomplished people, inadvertently postponing the Games is just appealing.</seg>
        <seg id="38">For example, Australian five-time medallist and gold medallist in her pageant Olympics, Chloe Esposito, is casual and would have been away for the summer but is hoping to be in competitive shape for the 2021 Games.</seg>
        <seg id="39">So she's among the athletes who are just rather happy with the postponement, for understandable reasons.</seg>
        <seg id="40">For those athletes who planned to retire after this year's Games, had they been held on time, the postponement of the Games in some cases means they retire before the Games take place.</seg>
        <seg id="41">Simply don't trust your body in order to go through another year of rigorous exercise.</seg>
        <seg id="42">Few athletes established themselves as thoroughly in the hearts of spectators at the 2016 Rio Olympics as gymnastics star Simone Biles.</seg>
        <seg id="43">She came home with four golds around her neck and one bronze.</seg>
        <seg id="44">Biles has attended several interviews in his native United States in the past to discuss the Olympics.</seg>
        <seg id="45">She is planning for the 2021 Games, but she is not necessarily sure she will still be able to stay at the top of the Games next year, by which time she will be 24.</seg>
        <seg id="46">Although it is not generally considered advanced age, it is higher for a top-ranked gymnast.</seg>
        <seg id="47">"It's a sensitive issue," Biles says, while smiling at another in an interview posted on the Olympic Committee's Instagram page asked if she intends to reach as far in the 2021 Games as she did in Rio 2016.</seg>
        <seg id="48">“I honestly don’t know if I’ll still be at the top after another year of practice,” says Biles.</seg>
        <seg id="49">She has previously spoken about how her body can't stand the stress of gymnastics training for much longer.</seg>
        <seg id="50">Nevertheless, she is training hard for the 2021 Olympics.</seg>
        <seg id="51">Biles admits it was an uncomfortable feeling having to suddenly stop practicing when the pandemic stalled and the gym was closed.</seg>

        <seg id="9">If the Games cannot be held, if the coronavirus remains too much of a threat, the Games will be cancelled.</seg>
        <seg id="10">At least no one wants to completely think that thought through.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Olympics are no ordinary sports competition.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Nothing is saved, the show should always be magnificent and strive to top the last games.</seg>
        <seg id="13">The selection of a city for the Olympic Games is based on the selection committee's assessment of the cities' presentations.</seg>
        <seg id="14">The more magnificent the presentation is - the greater the likelihood of getting the knee.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Tokyo spent $150 million trying to host the 2016 Olympics, which amounts to more than ISK 20 billion.</seg>
        <seg id="16">The second time, when the 2020 Games were applied for, $75 million, around ISK 10 billion, was put into the presentation.</seg>
        <seg id="17">In 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo would receive the Games this year, the Japanese authorities had already spent ISK 30 billion on the project.</seg>
        <seg id="18">But this amount is just a drop into the sea considering how much it costs to build Olympic villages, stadiums and generally to strengthen the country's infrastructure to handle tournaments like this, prepare them and host the Games themselves.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Organizers in Japan have said that the Tokyo Olympics, which should have been running these days but have been postponed by one year due to the coronavirus, would have cost 12.6 billion dollars.</seg>
        <seg id="20">However, a report from the Statutory Auditor in Japan published at the end of last year found that the cost was almost twice that figure.</seg>
        <seg id="21">The cost of postponing the games is likely not to be fully estimated, but it has been estimated that it can cost between $2 and $6 billion in addition to the original cost.</seg>
        <seg id="22">The total cost for the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could therefore run between $15 billion and $30 billion.</seg>
        <seg id="23">There are so high figures that all tax revenues from the Icelandic state would cover only almost half of the Olympic Games, based on the lowest possible costs.</seg>
        <seg id="24">Olympic Games are an event of such a magnitude that they have often become the subject of economists who try to review numbers and look at the benefits and benefits of the Games.</seg>
        <seg id="25">In the shortest possible case, quite a few people seem to have concluded that the impact of the Olympic Games is less than positive for the economy of the cities that hold them.</seg>
        <seg id="26">There are some short-term effects, for example, the number of jobs increases greatly in the short term, but in the long term cities are often left with debt deficits and tremendous operating costs of little-used infrastructure.</seg>
        <seg id="27">Rio, Brazil, has significant debts due to the 2016 Games and has had trouble costing the maintenance of all the large sports facilities built before the Games.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Figures have been reviewed after the London Games in 2012, where it has been found that only 10 percent of those who received employment related to the city's Olympics were unemployed before.</seg>
        <seg id="29">That means that there were no new jobs except to a small extent.</seg>
        <seg id="30">In general, cities have not particularly benefited financially from hosting the Olympics because of the surging costs associated with the structures built for the Games.</seg>
        <seg id="31">However, the benefits are often considered to be increased traffic for tourists who want to visit the Olympic cities following the Games, although there is great uncertainty about the 2021 Games.</seg>
        <seg id="32">It is also unclear whether it will be possible to accept all the number of spectators who usually attend the games.</seg>
        <seg id="33">The main thing, however, is the honor for the cities to be chosen, but it is difficult to value for money.</seg>
        <seg id="34">Because despite enormous costs, it can also be said that the nature of the joy that the games bring is not such that a price tag can be placed on it.</seg>
        <seg id="35">But although the exhibition is often magnificent and there is nowhere to save, of course, it's not just about money.</seg>
        <seg id="36">It's the sports heroes who are in the foreground.</seg>
        <seg id="37">For some successful people, postponing the games is accidentally just appealing.</seg>
        <seg id="38">In her article at the latter Olympic Games, Australian and gold medalist Chloe Esposito is pregnant, for example, and would have been far from having fun this summer, but sees hope of being in competition shape for the 2021 Games.</seg>
        <seg id="39">She is therefore among the athletes who are just rather happy with the postponement, for understandable reasons.</seg>
        <seg id="40">For those athletes who intended to leave after this year's Games, had they been held on time, the postponement of the Games in some cases means that they will cancel the competition before the Games take place.</seg>
        <seg id="41">Simply don't trust their bodies to go through another year of rigorous exercises.</seg>
        <seg id="42">Few athletes placed themselves as thoroughly in the hearts of the audience at the Rio Olympics 2016 as gymnastics star Simone Biles.</seg>
        <seg id="43">She brought home four gold around her neck and one bronze.</seg>
        <seg id="44">Biles has attended several interviews in his home country in the United States recently to discuss the Olympics.</seg>
        <seg id="45">She plans to attend the 2021 Games, although she is not necessarily confident that she will still be at the top of the Games next year, as she will then be 24 years old.</seg>
        <seg id="46">Although it is generally not considered a high age, it is higher for a leading gymnastician.</seg>
        <seg id="47">"This is a sensitive issue," says Biles, while smiling at one another in an interview posted on the Olympic Committee's Instagram page asked if she intended to go as far at the 2021 Games as she did in Rio 2016.</seg>
        <seg id="48">"I honestly don't know if I'll still be at the top after another year of practice," Biles says.</seg>
        <seg id="49">She has previously talked about her body not tolerating the stress of gymnastics training for much longer.</seg>
        <seg id="50">Nevertheless, she rehearses hard for the 2021 Olympics.</seg>
        <seg id="51">Biles admits that it was an uncomfortable feeling to have to stop rehearsing suddenly when the pandemic was high and the gymnastics hall was closed.</seg>
        <seg id="52">There were no exemptions for Biles rather than others while all sports facilities were closed for seven weeks.</seg>
        <seg id="53">All her Olympic gold couldn't buy any access over the others, she had to find various ways to stay in shape like others.</seg>
        <seg id="54">The basic form certainly a little better than in most people.</seg>
        <seg id="55">"We have a rigorous plan now.</seg>
        <seg id="56">It was difficult to start rehearsing first again after the gymnastics hall opened.</seg>
        <seg id="57">We started slowly but are fully crawling again and I will increase the exercises steadily as the year progresses.</seg>
        <seg id="58">Of course, we don't know exactly how these games will be or whether they will be held, but we still practice considering that they will be, can't help it.</seg>
        <seg id="59">I've worked too hard to leave the sport now, "says Biles.</seg>
        <seg id="60">With her, like others, there is doubt or perhaps rather awareness that there may be a situation where the matches will not be held at all in 2021 either.</seg>
        <seg id="61">At least predicting this is hopeless.</seg>
        <seg id="62">No one can know what the situation of the coronavirus pandemic will be like in July 2021 and nothing else to do but prepare for the Olympics considering that they will be held in a year.</seg>
        <seg id="63">Maybe the Olympic fire will be the light at the end of the Covid tunnel.</seg>
