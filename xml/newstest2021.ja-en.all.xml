        <seg id="3">A bottom heavy, medium-length hairstyle with layers that keeps it bouncy  [Minami style]</seg>
        <seg id="4">CanCam model, Honoka, goes for a hairstyle with bounce, like Tanaka Minami, whom she gushes is, "Not only beautiful, but very professional respectable!"</seg>
        <seg id="5">She went to Asahi Mitsuteru of the Hair Salon "SUN VALLEY" in Omotesando, who cuts Tanaka Minami's hair, to give her the "Minami-style " cut.</seg>
        <seg id="6">We will explain the process to get the "cut"!</seg>
        <seg id="7">Nogizaka46 Yamashita Mizuki, her first cover with her new, short look!</seg>
        <seg id="8">Let's check out Honoka's hair before cutting.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Thin, soft and volumenous hair.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Curly and unruly especially during the rainy season, she sometimes gets her hair straightened.</seg>
        <seg id="11">A heavy medium-length, with side bangs.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Let's start the cut!</seg>
        <seg id="13">First, we dampen the whole head, making it easier to cut.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Then section out the hair on the crown (just above the widest part of the head) and start cutting from the bottom.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Here are some key points to achieve a hairstyle just like Minami!</seg>
        <seg id="16">1. Double Bangs:  by cutting the inside layer of the bang a little shorter, you can either choose thicker full bangs by letting both layers fall or achieve lighter, see-through look when you separate the layers.</seg>
        <seg id="17">2. Making the most of your curls:  when those with curlier hair try to thin out volume, it may make it more difficult to tame.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Need to keep the balance of easy care, taming unruliness, and making the most of the curls while thinking about proportion.</seg>
        <seg id="19">3. Layering around the face and loose hair:  layered cut = a cutting at different lengths.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Layering around the face gives bounce and a cute finish.</seg>
        <seg id="21">By creating loose hair in 3 areas, around the temple and at the front and back of sideburns, you can create a stylish look when the hair is casually put up.</seg>
        <seg id="22">Release the sectioned out hair on the crown, cut together, then release around the face.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Pull out the upper part of the hair around the face and snip the ends of the hair.</seg>
        <seg id="24">This will create layers when the hair is let down, giving it bounce (this is a layered haircut).</seg>

        <seg id="2">Great play from No. 4 Yasuda, and 2 points scored for good measure by Toritani (Baseball King) - Yahoo!News</seg>
        <seg id="3">Seibu 0 - 5 Lotte (10 innings, played at the MetLife Dome): Lotte's starting pitcher, Taneichi Atsuki, delivered 136 pitches during the nine innings, resulting in his delightful first shutout in the 4th year of his professional career.</seg>
        <seg id="4">It was the first shutout of the Pacific League this season, resulting in the team's third win and halting their losing streak at just two.</seg>
        <seg id="5">To begin with, Taneichi allowed Suzuki Shohei, who was first up to bat, to hit a double that broke through the third-base line, but following this, Genda Sosuke was immediately grounded out from third base and then Suzuki himself was also touched out when trying to advance to third base.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Helped out by the calm response of his fielders, Taneichi got through this initial slip-up with zero, and from the second inning onwards, he made short work of Seibu's batting lineup, using a combination of sliders and forkballs based around his accomplished straight.</seg>
        <seg id="7">This progress only served to improve his confidence, and the zeros lined up on the scoreboard.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Lotte's batting line had been unable to hit anything thrown by Seibu's starting pitcher, Honda Keisuke, until finally, at the top of the seventh inning, No. 3 Sugano Tsuyoshi walked on base with a four ball, and pinch runner Oka Hiromi succeeded in stealing second base.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Taking this chance, No. 4 Yasuda Hisanori sent a ball sailing perfectly over to the right of the field, and finally broke the deadlock.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Continuing on into the eighth inning, Toritani Takashi, who had been substituted in, was on the offensive against Seibu's No. 3 Miyagawa Tetsu, hitting a run-scoring hit between the left and centre fielders for two points, racking up four points for Lotte in no time.</seg>
        <seg id="11">This left everything resting on the shoulders of the Marines' young ace candidate, and the match was quickly decided.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Taneichi ended the eighth inning by getting all three batters out, and continued pitching in the ninth inning, by which point he had thrown over 100 balls.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Exerting himself, Taneichi allowed a succession of walks and found himself with two out and bases loaded, but in the end, a fast ball to Cory Spangenberg produced the 10th strikeout of the day, and the game was set.</seg>

        <seg id="6">He was also helped by the calm response of the ally defense, and after 2 times, he tossed the Seibu batting line with a combination of sliders and forks centered on his proud straight.</seg>

        <seg id="3">Tsuruoka Police Station (chief of police: Sato Keizo) has begun a new "Bye-bye Accident Zero Initiative" in an effort to curb the relatively high number of accidents involving bicycles and motorbikes that occur in its jurisdiction.</seg>
        <seg id="4">The station will not only be promoting awareness of accident prevention together with local road safety organisations, but also aims to clampdown on bicycle traffic rule violations.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Three fatal traffic accidents happened this year within the jurisdiction, where the rider of a bicycle or motorbike was killed.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Although the overall number of accidents is on the decline, as of June 30th, the percentage of accidents involving bicycles is 11.7%, and 5.8% for motorbikes, both of which are higher than the average for the prefecture.</seg>
        <seg id="7">For bicycle accidents in particular, the rate has exceeded the prefectural average for the majority of the past five years, and so they planned the new initiative to try to overcome the situation.</seg>
        <seg id="8">The naming of the initiative is a play on the words "bike" and "bicycle" to eradicate accidents.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Related organisations will be asked to appeal to people more than ever in endeavours such as road safety classes, encouraging driving instruction for elderly people and the use of reflective clothing at night.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Police officers will issue people with a yellow card (disciplinary warning slip) as a caution when they violate a traffic rule.</seg>
        <seg id="11">A ceremony to signal the start of the initiative was held on the 21st at Shoku Gakuen Driving School in Tsuruoka.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Around 30 related officials were in attendance, to whom Chief Sato asked for their cooperation in "reducing even just one tragic accident" in his opening remarks.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Officials from the police department explained the details of the initiative and the activities of the various organisations.</seg>
        <seg id="14">And then a bicycle class was also held as one of the starting events.</seg>
        <seg id="15">A station official driving a car demonstrated how the impact exerted on a bicycle changes depending on whether the driver was applying the brakes at the time of the crash, or if they were travelling at 55km/h and not applying the brakes.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Kanauchi Koichi, chairman of the Tsuruoka Regional Road Safety Action Promotion Committee, said, "Today's demonstration served as a stark reminder of the horror of traffic accidents. I urge not only the elderly, but also young people, to take due care."</seg>

        <seg id="2">High school students at the School of Special Needs Attached to Okayama University (Hirai, Naka ward, Okayama city) are making Bizen ware ornaments of Amabie, a spirit said to be able to quell epidemics, to give as gifts to elderly people in the community.</seg>
        <seg id="3">The endeavour was planned in the hopes of bringing the pandemic to an early end and praying for health in an environment where the impact of COVID-19 precludes the in-person sales experience in stores and the interaction with local residents that would normally take place.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Starting in June, 11 high school seniors made the figures three days a week as part of their morning classes.</seg>
        <seg id="5">After putting effort into rolling out the clay and shaping it with cutters, they worked to wrap them in straw to bring out the distinctive "hidasuki" scarlet color of Bizen ware.</seg>
        <seg id="6">The students said that it took about two or three weeks to complete, including the process of drying and firing.</seg>
        <seg id="7">"We worked really hard to make these and we filled them with our hope that the elderly will not give up hope in the face of COVID-19 and will continue to stay healthy and happy," explained a third-year student (18).</seg>
        <seg id="8">On the 27th, the students plan to deliver 40 of the Bizen ware figurines to the residents of Okayama Yurakuen (part of the same facility), a nursing home where they hold choral events and other interactions.</seg>
        <seg id="9">The students say they will continue making the Bizen ware Amabie figurines until the end of July, and then they will decide where to send the remaining ones.</seg>

        <seg id="3">The exclusive Hyogo high school baseball tournament was held on the 24th, with the first game being Akashi Shougyo HS (top four in the last spring/summer Koshien tournament), a strong team playing against Takasago (2nd round, Takasago Municipal Baseball Stadium) and wins a called game in the 5th inning, 11-0.</seg>
        <seg id="4">151 km right-handed pitcher, Nakamori Shunsuke (senior), who is a top draft pick, showed off with a no-hitter, seven strikeouts and excellent pitching in the 3rd inning.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Wada Yutaka (57), technical advisor for Hanshin baseball team's headquarters, highly praised him.</seg>
        <seg id="6">The start was delayed by 39 minutes due to the continuous rain and field maintenance.</seg>
        <seg id="7">A muddy mound.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Even so, the long-awaited first official game of the year caused enthusiasm.</seg>
        <seg id="9">In the end, he gave up one walk, but pitched an impressive no-hitter.</seg>
        <seg id="10">He had 7 strikeouts and with a no hit and no run in the 3rd inning, contributed to a called game in the 5th inning.</seg>
        <seg id="11">"It was floating all over. It was good to strikeout with fastballs, but the easily recognized low curve balls needs to be adjusted." Nakamori critiqued himself harshly, even when he marked the fastest pitch that day at 148 km, impressing the professional eyes of Hanshin, Giants, and Orix who were behind the net.</seg>
        <seg id="12">It was Hanshin • Wada TA's first onsite observation since the first round of Koshien last summer (2nd round ○ 4-3 Hanasaki Tokuharu HS).</seg>
        <seg id="13">He praised that "he is still growing. He is a top class high schooler, after all. Even with bad footing, his form didn't collapse and he controlled well. He will most likely be a top candidate recruit."</seg>

        <seg id="15">He's managed to improve himself in the middle of this Covid crisis.", showering with praise.</seg>
        <seg id="16">While he was "still undecided between going pro or to go to college, a 50/50 chance" at the end of June, he will make up his mind after the August 16th Koshien exchange game (vs Kiryu No1 HS), saying he "would love to turn pro but it's still hard to make decisions."</seg>
        <seg id="17">But before that, the goal is to win this tournament and be in the top eight.</seg>
        <seg id="18">There is a rule that allows you to change the lineup of 20 players on the bench every game.</seg>
        <seg id="19">This game was also played by all 16 Seniors.</seg>

        <seg id="21">"This is the last tournament and we've been practicing hard for three years. We hope all seniors participate. We want to win all the games including Koshien. For me personally, my goal is to have a shutout game, as coach (Hazama) keeps reminding me I haven't yet." The team and his goals seem to have been set for their last summer.</seg>

        <seg id="2">The Heat's first scrimmage (practice) game is against the Kings (photo credit: Getty Images).</seg>
        <seg id="3">At 104-98, the Heat secured an easy victory in this game, with backcourt heroes in their elements as Duncan Robinson scored 18 points, the most out of the team, and Tyler Herro followed with 15.</seg>
        <seg id="4">In addition to Robinson, who is one of the best shooters in the league, the stepping up of Herro, a rookie who was nominated 13th overall in the draft, will likely become a key element for the Heat.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Herro missed 15 games in February and March due to an ankle injury, and the season began a long hiatus after his first game back against the Hornets on March 12th.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Herro said, "I was able to get my condition back up to 100% as there was plenty of time available. I feel the best I've ever felt," but actions speak louder than words, and his performance during the scrimmage was ample evidence of this.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Herro has been afforded more play time due to the delay in starting point guard Kendrick Nunn joining back with the team, a chance that he did not let go to waste.</seg>
        <seg id="8">It certainly paid off, since he played splendidly in a different role from normal, and was able to score 15 points.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Team captain Jimmy Butler once again praised his "favourite", Herro.</seg>
        <seg id="10">"Herro's a great handler, he's able to score points, he can defend. He's able to do anything to support the team. He doesn't think like a rookie, which is why he's comfortable in any position. He studies video footage, and thinks about how his teammates move and get in a free position, and what he should do in response."</seg>
        <seg id="11">Even before this season started, Butler was impressed with Herro's strong, un-rookie-like competitive spirit and stoic attitude towards basketball.</seg>
        <seg id="12">That's why he invited Herro to individual training sessions starting at 4am, and they trained together.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Butler has said of Herro in the past, "He makes his opinion known to anyone, and never backs down. I respect that kind of fighting spirit."</seg>
        <seg id="14">Butler is also a player who speaks his mind and, if he thinks it will help the team, is known to air harsh opinions, even while knowing it will cause a conflict.</seg>
        <seg id="15">In the past, this has caused a rift between him and his teammates.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Butler may see some of his younger self in Herro.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Though his fearsome countenance sometimes gets the better of other players, those with the fortitude to follow Butler receive excellent guidance.</seg>
        <seg id="18">If this quality of mutual respect between pupil and teacher spreads through the ranks, then there will be no limit to what the Heat can do as a team.</seg>

        <seg id="3">In the 104-98 win, Duncan Robinson scored a team-high 18 points and Tyler Hero added 15.</seg>
        <seg id="4">As well as Robinson, the league's leading shooter, the 13th overall draft rookie and hero step-up is an important factor for the heat.</seg>
        <seg id="5">The Hero missed 2 to 3 of 15 games due to an ankle injury, and the season ended with a long suspension following the 3-12 Hornets ' return game.</seg>
        <seg id="6">The hero said, " We had a lot of time and we were able to get back to 100% condition.It's the best feeling I've ever felt, " he said, but his performance at Scrimmage was more convincing than words.</seg>
        <seg id="7">The late arrival of Kendrick Nan, the starting point guard, increased the hero's playing time and made use of that opportunity.</seg>
        <seg id="8">It is worth a lot because it is 15 points after doing a different role brilliantly.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Team leader Jimmy Butler once again praised his "favorite" hero.</seg>

        <seg id="11">Prior to the start of the season, Butler has enjoyed the strength of his hero's non-rookie mentality and his stoic attitude towards basketball.</seg>
        <seg id="12">That's why I invited them to practice at 4 o'clock in the morning, and they trained together.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Butler once said, " He says his opinion to anyone, and he doesn't back down.I can respect that spirit."</seg>
        <seg id="14">The butler is the type to always say what he thought, and he will strike a tough opinion knowing that conflicts will occur if he thinks it will be for the team.</seg>
        <seg id="15">In the past, the relationship with his teammates had deteriorated.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Butler must have been a hero of his youth.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Butler's character, which is sometimes too harsh for his teammates, is a good guide for those who have the guts to follow.</seg>
        <seg id="18">If the relationship between 2 mentors and students who respect each other spreads to the whole team, the heat should be a team that can aim for even higher.</seg>

        <seg id="2">"I want to know what disasters and incidents are occurring where as soon as possible!"</seg>
        <seg id="3">This strong need is held not only by newspapers, television, and other news organizations, but also by social infrastructure companies and local governments.</seg>
        <seg id="4">A service to address this need is "Sepctee," developed by Spectee, which handles information analysis using AI.</seg>
        <seg id="5">(Photo) A specialized team determines the authenticity of social media information after alerts from Spectee.</seg>
        <seg id="6">At present, the means through which people get information about the disasters and accidents happening is starting to shift from television to internet information (social media).</seg>
        <seg id="7">Social media such as Twitter has become crucial for transmitting information directly after the onset of an accident or disaster.</seg>
        <seg id="8">However, it is difficult to constantly monitor and manually extract what is useful from the overflowing information.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Spectee has the faculty to detect information related to natural disasters and accidents from the information circulating on social media such as Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, and after analyzing the content and upon determining the truth or falsehood of the information, will transmit it to corporations.</seg>
        <seg id="10">"We asses a wide range of events that have the negative impact of stopping or delaying society's activities as 'crises'," (Murakami Kenjiro, Representative Director CEO), it is a crisis management support service that visualizes various crises occurring domestically and overseas.</seg>
        <seg id="11">NHK, at the time of the Kumamoto earthquake that occurred in April, 2016, was the first major case to utilize Spectee, and after that the move to implement it among companies has spread rapidly.</seg>
        <seg id="12">It is stated that over 350 companies are using Spectee, including not only news outlets such as television stations and newspapers, but also companies that support social infrastructure such as electric, gas and transportation, as well as local governments across the country.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Analyzing posts and determining the type and location of "crises"</seg>
        <seg id="14">Spectee distributes information by taking four steps: "information gathering," "analysis and content classification," "setting titles," and "judging authenticity."</seg>
        <seg id="15">User companies specify in advance the region (prefecture, administrative district, or city, town, village etc.) and crisis category (natural disaster, accidents, etc.) for information collection.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Spectee uses the API provided by social media to gather posts that apply to these specifications.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Then, it analyzes and categorizes the text, images, and videos contained in those posts.</seg>
        <seg id="18">For example, if a video is posted that shows a fire engine, black smoke rising from a building, and orange flames coming out from the roof, it will be classified under "fire."</seg>
        <seg id="19">In addition, it will classify an image of an overturned vehicle under "traffic accident," or streets submerged in water as "road flooding."</seg>
        <seg id="20">Spectee also makes an estimate of the location where the disaster or accident has occurred.</seg>
        <seg id="21">"There are many cases in which the location is unknown based on a post, so the estimate is made by combining a variety of information" said CEO Murakami.</seg>
        <seg id="22">For example, if a road sign or sign board appears in an image or video, information about location names will be extracted from there and compared against a database of locations to determine where it is.</seg>

        <seg id="12">Not only television stations, newspapers and other media outlets, but also companies that support social infrastructure such as electricity, gas, and transportation, and more than 350 local governments across the country are currently using Spectre.</seg>
        <seg id="13">■ Analyze posts to determine the type and place of occurrence of"crisis"</seg>
        <seg id="14">Specti takes 4 steps to deliver information: "Collect information", "Analyze and classify content", "Title", and"Verify authenticity".</seg>
        <seg id="15">The user must specify in advance the region (prefecture, city, town, etc.) and the category of crisis (disaster, accident, etc.) in which information is collected.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Specti collects posts that fall under that designation using the API provided by social media.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Then, we analyze and classify the text, images, and videos contained in the collected posts.</seg>
        <seg id="18">For example, if a fire engine is shown, black smoke is rising from a building, and an orange flame is coming out from a room, it is classified as "fire".</seg>
        <seg id="19">In addition, if the image of a car overturned, it is classified as"traffic accident", and if the image of a road covered with water, it is classified as"road flood".</seg>

        <seg id="21">"We often don't know the location from the post, so we combine various information to estimate it," says CEO Murakami.</seg>
        <seg id="22">For example, if a road sign or billboard is reflected in an image or video, it extracts the information of the place name from there, and identifies the place by matching with the place name database.</seg>

        <seg id="2">The reason behind "chilled noodle dishes'" unpopularity - Yahoo!News</seg>
        <seg id="3">In China, hiyashi chuka is called "Japanese cold noodles."</seg>
        <seg id="4">As previously stated, hiyashi chuka, invented based off of China's "liang ban mian (chilled stirred noodles)," is a Chinese dish of Japanese origin (Japanese-style Chinese Cuisine).</seg>
        <seg id="5">Therefore, although it never really exists in China, with food diversification, it has come to be seen there in the summer at Japanese restaurants.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Also, adapted products with names such as "Japanese Style Soba Liang Mian/Soba Hiyashi Chuka" and "Sichuan Chicken Liang Mian/Sichuan-style Chicken Hiyashi Chuka" are recently popping up at Japanese-run convenience stores.</seg>
        <seg id="7">However, in China the popularity of this Japanese-style Chinese dishes is generally not high, pushed out by trendy Chinese cuisines that pack a punch, such as Sichuan cuisine and Hunan cuisine.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Naturally, the flavors of Japanese-style Chinese cuisine is often familiar to Chinese people as well.</seg>
        <seg id="9">For that reason, though not as terrible, it does tend to be criticized as lacking in impressiveness.</seg>
        <seg id="10">"Hiyashi chuka" is not an exception to this, and remains a modest presence.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Incidentally, the name for hiyashi chuka in China is "Japanese-style chilled noodles."</seg>
        <seg id="12">For Chinese people, it is perceived as a Japanese dish.</seg>
        <seg id="13">The summer staple is "Liangpi".</seg>
        <seg id="14">In China, when it comes to a summery noodle dish, it is "liangpi."</seg>
        <seg id="15">Though in Japan many people may not be familiar with it, liangpi is a flat noodle made from wheat, rice, or starch that originated in the Shanxi province.</seg>
        <seg id="16">In fact, it is said to have a more than 2000 years of history.</seg>
        <seg id="17">It is a staple of the gourmet street food fare sold at food stalls, and at a price of 10~20 yuan (150~300 yen) it is extremely reasonable.</seg>
        <seg id="18">It does include the character "chilled," but liangpi is not shocked with ice like Japan's hiyashi chuka.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Rather, room temperature is the standard.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Preferred toppings such as matchstick cucumbers and carrots or boiled bean sprouts are placed on top of the noodles, and condiments like cilantro, chili pepper, vinegar and garlic are added on.</seg>
        <seg id="21">A special seasoning mix of soy sauce, chili oil, vinegar, tahini and peanut paste is topped as a finishing touch.</seg>
        <seg id="22">Together with the smooth noodles, the tartness is refreshing and intertwines with the richness of the spicy sauce while going down smoothly even when appetites are low in the heat of summer.</seg>
        <seg id="23">In addition, because it has permeated all of China, it is known for its range of varieties with many different types toppings and seasonings, and is enjoyed as such.</seg>

        <seg id="8">Of course, Japanese-style Chinese seasoning is often familiar to the Chinese.</seg>

        <seg id="2">The benefits that cold showers have for your body and mind (Cosmopolitan) - Yahoo!News</seg>
        <seg id="3">Suppressing inflammation such as muscle pain</seg>
        <seg id="4">A study published in The North American Journal of Medical Sciences that examined the effectiveness of hydrotherapy (a type of treatment that uses water) found that it seems to have a promising effect on physical and mental recovery.</seg>
        <seg id="5">It seems that by showering with cold water after exercising, muscle pain and other inflammatory symptoms can be reduced.</seg>
        <seg id="6">According to Professor Douglas Casa, CEO of the Korey Stringer Institute sports medicine research facility, who holds a teaching position at the University of Connecticut, "After exercising, it's important to take a cold shower as soon as possible. By lowering the body temperature soon after you finish physical exertion, your recovery from both the fatigue and the inflammation caused by exercise will be quicker."</seg>
        <seg id="7">Reduce fatigue</seg>
        <seg id="8">If you exercise when it's hot, your heart, muscles and skin need more blood pumping around them than normal.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Professor Casa explains, "When you exercise, your heart rate increases, which in turn increases the blood flow to the heart, and you require energy to contract your muscles, so the blood flow to your muscles increases. When it comes to your skin, you have a lot of blood flowing to your skin so that you can regulate your body temperature."</seg>
        <seg id="10">"A cold shower will reduce your skin temperature, thereby reducing the flow of blood to the skin. Instead, blood is routed to internal organs such as your stomach and intestines, which makes it easier to absorb fluids and nutrients after exercise. As a result, you feel less fatigued after exercise."</seg>
        <seg id="11">Can induce the effect of hormesis</seg>
        <seg id="12">Professor Droszewski also explains how a cold shower can induce the effect of hormesis.</seg>
        <seg id="13">The idea of hormesis is that it is better for your body to undergo small amounts of stress and harmful substances rather than none at all.</seg>
        <seg id="14">"Exercising in low oxygen conditions, intermittent fasting and cold showers are all common examples of hormesis that can promote good health. Taking a cold shower stimulates your hormones and neurotransmitters, which can lead to stronger physical tenacity and resilience."</seg>

        <seg id="10">"Taking a cold shower lowers the temperature of the skin, so we can reduce the amount of blood flow that is sent to the skin.Instead, blood flow is sent to internal organs such as the gastrointestinal tract, so it is easy to take water and nutrition after exercise.As a result, you can reduce the fatigue you feel after exercise」</seg>

        <seg id="5">Oyama hits a homer for two consecutive games and goes around the diamond.</seg>
        <seg id="6">When he returned to the bench, he showed his pearly whites.</seg>
        <seg id="7">"While I've been making good swings, I focused on this one ball and took the full swing."</seg>
        <seg id="8">He entered his turn at bat in the 4th inning, 0-2.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Swinging aggressively from the beginning, he fouled off the first pitch, then came pitch number 2.</seg>
        <seg id="10">He didn't miss the so-so 134 km slider from Ohno Yudai.</seg>
        <seg id="11">A perfect hit, the moment the ball hit the sweet spot of the bat, it was surely in the stands.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Following the previous day's game against Hiroshima (Koshien) on the 23rd, the hits in two consecutive games were the sign of a comeback.</seg>
        <seg id="13">It was also a valuable hit off a pitcher that is his nemesis.</seg>
        <seg id="14">When he played against Ohno Yudai at Koshien on the 17th, he tallied nine hits and four runs.</seg>
        <seg id="15">However, as for games at Nagoya Dome, he has allowed seven wins, one loss and one no-decision in the past 12 games, and suffered from seven consecutive losses since August 23, 2013 with a tie in between.</seg>
        <seg id="16">He got the hit for the first time in 23 innings with a spectacular swing off such a difficult opponent at Nagoya Dome (despite the pitcher being replaced mid-inning, it still counts as an inning pitched) and did not allow the opponent a chance.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Manager Yano commented, "He is highly skilled to be able to take firm advantage of a weak pitch. Even when timing is off and results in a foul ball, he hits with great form. I think he will continue to hit.", expecting continued success.</seg>
        <seg id="18">He hit into right-field in the first inning, marking six consecutive hits and three consecutive games with multiple hits.</seg>
        <seg id="19">At the start of the season, he started as a second stringer, but with seven home runs and 16 RBIs, he is now working perfectly as the team leader and No.4 batter.</seg>

        <seg id="1">Bringing Art Closer During the COVID-19 Pandemic, Online Art Museum (HASARD) Launched by Konno (Hachinohe Native) (The Daily Tohoku Shimbun) - Yahoo! News</seg>
        <seg id="2">There exists an art museum where anyone can encounter art for free any time they like.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Its lineup is wide-ranging, from notable painters like Claude Monet and Gustav Klimt, to unknown domestic artists.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Since the online art museum HASARD "opened its doors" in April 2019, its user-friendliness and novelty have won users' hearts, and now the new lifestyle of the pandemic has been an opportunity for it to garner even more attention.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Museum director Shinnosuke Konno (26) from Hachinohe, now resident in Tokyo, who launched the site, says, "I wanted to create a service that would allow anyone to enjoy art easily. I want people to come into contact with art, especially under such dire circumstances."</seg>
        <seg id="6">What surprises visitors to HASARD is the sheer abundance of exhibitions and the beauty of the images.</seg>
        <seg id="7">As of the 24th, there are a total of 14 exhibitions publicly available, including permanent exhibitions and special exhibitions, and the viewers are fascinated by the works in ultra-high-resolution that shows not just the coloring, but even the texture of the brush strokes.</seg>
        <seg id="8">With no member registration and no admittance fees required, it is distinctive because it is free not only for viewers but also for artists who want to hold individual exhibitions.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Also attracting attention is the way artworks are displayed, something which could only be achieved online.</seg>
        <seg id="10">One example of this is how the paintings are made to move.</seg>
        <seg id="11">"It Begins to Move Again," a permanent exhibition on Claude Monet, employs digital processing to make the clouds, flowers, and fields of grass move.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Stemming from the desire (of Director Konno) of "wanting to make it absorbing even for people with little interest in art," it can make you feel like you are inside the painting.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Director Konno was an elementary school student when he first discovered art.</seg>
        <seg id="14">When he and his family visited the Aomori Museum of Art, which had just been completed at the time, he saw the three giant paintings of Marc Chagall's Aleko and was shocked by their impressive impact.</seg>
        <seg id="15">From the very next day, his time in art class became fun, and even after he took admission to university as an opportunity to come to Tokyo, he developed a habit of visiting galleries.</seg>
        <seg id="16">At the same time, he felt that there were many people who have little opportunity to encounter art for a variety of reasons, like not having art museums nearby, or big exhibitions only being held in metropolitan areas, or being unable to go out because they're caring for children.</seg>
        <seg id="17">For that reason, while working at an IT-related company, he spent about two months launching a website where you can appreciate art online.</seg>
        <seg id="18">User numbers reached an average of 10,000 per month in the first 10 months after startup, and rose to about 30,000 after COVID-19 infections spread.</seg>
        <seg id="19">If anybody could enjoy art however they want, whenever they want to see it...</seg>
        <seg id="20">HASARD's aim resonated with even more people than expected because of the COVID-19 pandemic.</seg>
        <seg id="21">Director Konno emphasized that the significance of art appreciation is how it can enrich the imagination.</seg>
        <seg id="22">"If your imagination becomes enriched, you gain the ability to reach out to people who are suffering.</seg>
        <seg id="23">I want society to become better by bringer art closer to people," he says, expressing his thoughts.</seg>

        <seg id="1">Corona Magnificence: Closer to Art Online Museum "HASARD" Konno (from Hachinohe) Launched (Daily Tohoku Shimbun) - Yahoo!News</seg>
        <seg id="2">There is an art museum where anyone can touch art for free whenever they want.</seg>
        <seg id="3">His works range from famous painters such as Claude Monet and Gustav Klimt to unknown artists in the country.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Since its opening in April 2019, the online museum "HASARD" has grasped the user's mind due to its convenience and novelty, and the attention has increased further with the introduction of a new lifestyle caused by the coronal disaster.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Shinnosuke Konno (26), a representative from Hachinohe City who launched the website, says, "I wanted to create a service that everyone can enjoy art easily, and I want people to experience art only in a difficult situation."</seg>
        <seg id="6">When you visit Asa, you will be surprised by the abundance of exhibits and the beauty of the images.</seg>
        <seg id="7">As of 24th, a total of 14 permanent and special exhibitions are open to the public, attracting people who see ultra high-resolution works that convey not only color but also the texture of brushes.</seg>
        <seg id="8">No membership registration or admission fee is required, and artists who want to hold solo exhibitions, as well as the viewer, do not cost much.</seg>
        <seg id="9">The way to show it online is attracting attention.</seg>
        <seg id="10">It is one of them that moves the picture.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Claude Monet's permanent exhibition, "It Begins to Move Again," features digital processing to move clouds, flowers, and grasslands.</seg>
        <seg id="12">"I want to make it possible for people who are not interested in art to enter" (Representative Konno) From the thought, you can feel as if you are in the picture.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Art and art meet when he was in elementary school.</seg>
        <seg id="14">At that time, when I visited the newly completed Aomori Museum of Art with my family, I saw three huge pictures of "Aleco" by Marc Chagall, and I was shocked by the power of it.</seg>
        <seg id="15">From the next day, art classes changed into a fun time, and after going to Tokyo on the occasion of going to university, he began to visit galleries.</seg>
        <seg id="16">At the same time, I also felt that there are many people who do not have much opportunity to interact with art from various perspectives, such as the fact that there are not many museums nearby and large exhibitions are only held in the Tokyo metropolitan area, and it is difficult to go out due to childcare.</seg>
        <seg id="17">So, while working at an IT affiliate, for about two months, we launched a site where you can view art on the Internet.</seg>
        <seg id="18">The number of users reached an average of 10,000 a month in the first 10 months, and increased to about 30,000 after the spread of the new corona.</seg>
        <seg id="19">When you want to see any person, you can appreciate the art freely.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Asa's aim was accepted by more and more people as a result of the Corona disaster.</seg>
        <seg id="21">Mr. Konno emphasized that the significance of the art appreciation will enrich the imagination.</seg>
        <seg id="22">"When your imagination becomes rich, you can reach out to the people in need."</seg>
        <seg id="23">I want art to become a better society by becoming closer."</seg>

        <seg id="7">そして、その2つの「物質 (経済・ビジネス) 」 と「精神」が合体した形として我々の目にはっきり見えるようになると思われるのが 、 「 中国品質から日本品質へ」の大きな流れである。</seg>
        <seg id="8">例えば、Tシャツやデジカメで不良・欠陥があれば腹立たしいことだが、購入した人の命には別条がない。</seg>

        <seg id="1">The simple reason the Age of Japanese Quality will come as the Age of Chinese Quality ends (Modern business) - Yahoo!News</seg>
        <seg id="2">With the pandemic, a change in values</seg>
        <seg id="3">A lot of predictions and debates are happening regarding the world after the pandemic.</seg>
        <seg id="4">In the realm of business, there is a possibility that the changes mentioned in the July 8 article, "In Japan "management" jobs are now starting to disappear...! The cruel truth" and the July 4 article "The reason "Japanese manufacturing" is looking like it will make a big come back in the "Post-covid" World" could occur.</seg>
        <seg id="5">(Photograph) The true form of "Japan's Strength" that only Japanese people do not know.... An unexpected reality in Asia</seg>
        <seg id="6">In addition, in the emotional arena it is thought that trends such as those in the June 26 article ""How to fully burnout" to send to those who have become aware of the end of life with corona," and the June 10 article, "With corona and riots rising, now is the time to reevaluate the effect of "only calling on the gods in times of hardship"" will become mainstream.</seg>
        <seg id="7">And what we can expect will become clearly visible to us with the combination of these two, "material (economy/business)" and "emotion," is a large shift "from Chinese quality to Japanese quality."</seg>
        <seg id="8">For example, if a T-shirt or a digital camera is inferior or defective, it is frustrating, but it does not put the consumer's life at stake.</seg>
        <seg id="9">In comparison, what has been a topic of attention recently is the unreliable quality of Chinese-made masks and ventilators... for products such as these, that are linked directly to life and safety, "Chinese quality" is deadly.</seg>
        <seg id="10">No matter how cheap they are no one can buy such products.</seg>
        <seg id="11">People will seek "Japanese quality" products even if it means paying a considerable price.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Of course this trend is not only arising in Japan.</seg>
        <seg id="13">The Western countries have fallen into a dire situation due to shortages of masks and medical equipment, yet even so it has become clear that they have had to return products time and time again due to inexcusably poor "Chinese quality."</seg>
        <seg id="14">Safety and Security over Price</seg>
        <seg id="15">Moreover, products such as automobiles are also products in which a defect can be fatal (deaths caused by vehicular accidents).</seg>
        <seg id="16">No matter how aggressive countries such as China, Korea and others are on this "you get what you pay for" bargain sale strategy, ultimately, they cannot stand up against Japan-made products, and the reason a situation like the one described in the June 6 article "Will it be a sole victory after all, and the world's car manufacturers bow down to Toyota?", will arise is because "Japanese quality" is strongly sought after for automobiles.</seg>
        <seg id="17">And this pandemic has given rise to thoughts about the necessity of "safety and security" in many other products as well.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Furthermore, safety and security are not only important in the "Japanese quality of manufacturing" but also the "Japanese quality of logistics and other services."</seg>
        <seg id="19">Such as the case with the toilet paper craze, even if there is sufficient production capacity, there are cases in which there are hold-ups at intermediate distribution stages and the product is not delivered.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Furthermore, as with the April 17 article "Who is the culprit behind the mask shortage! We will not tolerate the crisis opportunism of the Chinese Communist Party", it makes us keenly aware that Japan's domestic self-sufficiency is also an important component for "safety and security."</seg>
        <seg id="21">In an emergency it is natural for any country to prioritize their own nation, and it is very important to make the procurement of necessities such as masks (medical equipment) and food possible domestically.</seg>

The reason for this situation is that"Japanese quality"is strongly required for automotive products.</seg>
        <seg id="17">And this pandemic reminded us that"safety and security" are necessary for many other products as well.</seg>
        <seg id="18">In addition, security and safety are important not only in"Japanese quality in manufacturing"but also in"Japanese quality in services such as logistics".</seg>
        <seg id="19">Like the toilet paper commotion, there are times when there is a proper production capacity, but the intermediate distribution is blocked and it does not reach the hand.</seg>
        <seg id="20">In addition, 4/17"Who is the real culprit of the lack of masks!"The article"Do not allow fire thieves of the CCP regime"made me keenly aware that self・sufficiency in Japan is an important element of"security and safety".</seg>
        <seg id="21">In the event of an emergency, it is very important for all countries to give priority to their own countries, and to be able to procure essential items such as masks (medical equipment) and food within their own countries.</seg>

        <seg id="2">Changing Values in a Pandemic</seg>
        <seg id="3">There has been a lot of discussion and predictions about the world after the pandemic.</seg>
        <seg id="4">On the business front, the July 8 article, "In fact, 'managerial' jobs are starting to disappear in Japan ... It's a cruel reality. On the business front, I wrote an article on July 8, "The brutal reality" and an article on July 4, "Why Japanese manufacturing is actually going to make a big comeback in the post-Corona world ...! I'm not sure. "There is a possibility that the changes described in the articles of July 4 and 5 will occur.</seg>
        <seg id="5">What is the true nature of Japan's strength that only the Japanese know? Surprising reality in Asia</seg>
        <seg id="6">In terms of spirituality, I believe that the trend described in my June 26 article, "Corona: A Guide for Those Who Have Become Aware of the End of Life," and my June 10 article, "Corona: Now is the Time to Reconsider the Benefits of 'Asking God in Times of Distress,'" will become the mainstream.</seg>
        <seg id="7">And what we will see more clearly as the merging of these two concepts of "material (economic and business)" and "spirit" is the major trend of "Chinese quality to Japanese quality.</seg>
        <seg id="8">For example, it is annoying if a T-shirt or digital camera is defective, but the life of the person who purchased it is not in danger.</seg>
        <seg id="9">On the other hand, the sloppy quality of masks and respirators made in China has become a hot topic recently. ... The "Chinese quality" of such products, which are directly related to life and safety, is fatal.</seg>
        <seg id="10">I cannot buy such products no matter how cheap they are.</seg>
        <seg id="11">No matter how cheap they are, they will not buy such products, and will seek "Japanese quality" products even if they have to pay a considerable price.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Of course, this trend is not only happening in Japan.</seg>
        <seg id="13">It is evident from the fact that Western countries that have fallen on hard times due to shortages of masks and medical equipment have returned the products one after another because of the terrible quality of Chinese products.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Safety and security rather than cheapness</seg>
        <seg id="15">In addition, products such as automobiles are also products where a defect can be fatal (death by accident).</seg>
        <seg id="16">"No matter how much China, South Korea, and other countries attack with their "cheap is as good as cheap" strategy, in the end they cannot compete with Japanese products. The reason for the situation described in the June 16 article, "Will the World's Automakers Bow Down to Toyota?" is that "Japanese quality" is strongly demanded in automotive products.</seg>
        <seg id="17">The recent pandemic has reminded us that "safety and security" are also necessary for many other products.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Safety and security are important not only for "Japanese quality in manufacturing" but also for "Japanese quality in services such as logistics.</seg>
        <seg id="19">As in the case of the toilet paper fiasco, there are times when the production capacity is in place, but the product does not reach the customer's hands due to delays in intermediate distribution.</seg>
        <seg id="20">In addition, in the April 17 article "Who is the real culprit behind the mask shortage? Don't allow the Chinese Communist regime to steal from the fire" on April 17, I was made keenly aware that self-sufficiency within Japan is also an important element of "safety and security.</seg>
        <seg id="21">It is very important to be able to procure necessities such as masks (medical equipment) and food within one's own country, as it is natural for any country to put its own country first in an emergency.</seg>

        <seg id="6">On the spiritual side, it seems that the trend will become mainstream, such as the article on June 26, "The idea of complete combustion" to give to people who are conscious of the end of life with the corona, "and the article on June 10," Corona, now full of riots, let's reconsider the effectiveness of "God's favor in hard times."</seg>
        <seg id="7">And what we can clearly see is a major shift from "Chinese quality" to "Japanese quality" in the form of combining these two "materials" (economy and business) and "spirit."</seg>

        <seg id="9">On the other hand, the sloppy quality of masks and artificial respirators made in China, which has recently become a hot topic, is critical in terms of "Chinese quality" in products directly linked to life and safety.</seg>

        <seg id="11">They will want "Japanese quality" products even if they pay a considerable price.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Of course, this trend is not confined to Japan.</seg>
        <seg id="13">It is clear from the fact that the Western countries, which faced difficulties due to shortages of masks and medical equipment, returned products one after another due to the extremely poor quality of Chinese products.</seg>

        <seg id="16">No matter how much China, Korea, and other countries launch an offensive on the "cheap or bad" strategy of selling cars at a low price, they can not compete with Japanese cars, and the situation as described in the article on June 16, "Is the world's automakers going to bow down to Toyota?" Is because "Japanese quality" is strongly required for automobile products.</seg>
        <seg id="17">The recent pandemic also reminded us that safety and security are essential for many other products.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Also, safety and security are important not only for "Japanese quality in manufacturing" but also for "Japanese quality in services such as logistics."</seg>
        <seg id="19">In some cases, such as toilet paper riots, even though the production capacity is adequate, the intermediate distribution system is stuck and cannot be reached.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Furthermore, an article on April 17th titled, "Who is the real culprit behind the lack of masks? Don't allow the Chinese Communist government to rob fireplaces," made me keenly aware that self-sufficiency in Japan is also an important element of safety and security.</seg>
        <seg id="21">In the event of an emergency, each country will naturally give priority to its own country, and it is very important to be able to procure necessities such as masks (medical equipment) and food within its own country.</seg>

        <seg id="2">The pandemic has changed our values</seg>
        <seg id="3">Various predictions and discussions are taking place about the post-pandemic world.</seg>
        <seg id="4">On the business front, there is a possibility that the changes mentioned in the July 8th article, "In fact, 'managerial' jobs are starting to disappear in Japan...! The cruel reality", and the July 4th article, "In the post-corona world, 'Japanese manufacturing' is actually about to make a big comeback...!"</seg>
        <seg id="5">Photo: The true identity of "Japan's strength" that only Japanese people don't know... Unexpected reality seen in Asia</seg>
        <seg id="6">Also, on the mental front, it seems that the trend will become mainstream, such as the June 26th article, "How to burn completely" for people who have become aware of the end of their lives due to corona, and the June 10th article, "Now that corona is full of riots, let's reexamine the utility of 'asking God in times of hardship'".</seg>
        <seg id="7">And what we can clearly see as a combination of these two "materials (economy and business)" and "spirit" is the major trend of "from Chinese quality to Japanese quality".</seg>
        <seg id="8">For example, if a T-shirt or digital camera is defective or defective, it would be exasperating, but there is no difference in the life of the person who bought it.</seg>
        <seg id="9">On the other hand, the sloppy quality of masks and ventilators made in China that have recently become a hot topic... "Chinese quality" in products that are directly linked to life and safety is fatal.</seg>
        <seg id="10">No matter how cheap it is, you can't buy such a product.</seg>
        <seg id="11">They will be looking for products of "Japanese quality" even if they pay a considerable price.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Of course, this trend is not just happening in Japan.</seg>
        <seg id="13">It is clear from the fact that Western countries, which had fallen into a difficult situation due to a shortage of masks and medical equipment, still made "returns" one after another due to the severity of "Chinese quality".</seg>
        <seg id="14">Safe and secure rather than cheap</seg>
        <seg id="15">In addition, products such as automobiles are products where defects can be fatal (death in an accident).</seg>
        <seg id="16">No matter how many countries, including China and Korea, go on the offensive with the cheap selling strategy of "cheap or bad", they will not be able to compete with Japanese products in the end, and the situation that I mentioned in the June 16th article, "Will the world's automakers fall in love with Toyota after all?" is due to the strong demand for "Japanese quality" in automobile products.</seg>
        <seg id="17">And the pandemic has reminded us that many other products also need "safety and security."</seg>
        <seg id="18">In addition, safety and security are important not only for "Japanese quality in manufacturing" but also for "Japanese quality in logistics and other services".</seg>
        <seg id="19">Like the toilet paper scandal, there are times when production capacity is properly available, but intermediate distribution is delayed and cannot be reached.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Furthermore, as in the April 17th article, "Who is the real culprit in the shortage of masks? Don't forgive the Chinese Communist government's fire pit thieves", it made me keenly aware that self-sufficiency in Japan is also an important element of "safety and security."</seg>
        <seg id="21">In the event of an emergency, it is natural for every country to give priority to their own country, and it is very important to be able to procure essential items such as masks (medical equipment) and food within their own country.</seg>

        <seg id="3">Various predictions and discussions are being made about the after-pandemic world.</seg>
        <seg id="4">On the business side, the July 8 article "Actually, the jobs of" managers "are beginning to disappear in Japan ...!

        <seg id="5">[Photo] The true identity of "Japan's strength" that only Japanese people do not know ... Unexpected reality seen in Asia</seg>
        <seg id="6">In terms of spirit, the article on June 26, "Given to those who have become aware of the end of life in Corona,'Knowledge of complete burning'", and the article on June 10, "Corona, now is full of riots." It seems that the flow of "Let's review the utility of" God's request when suffering "" will become mainstream.</seg>
        <seg id="7">And it is the big flow of "from Chinese quality to Japanese quality" that we can see clearly as a form that combines the two "materials (economy / business)" and "spirit".</seg>
        <seg id="8">For example, if a T-shirt or digital camera is defective or defective, it is annoying, but there is nothing special about the life of the person who purchased it.</seg>
        <seg id="9">On the other hand, the sloppy quality of masks and respirators made in China, which has recently become a hot topic .... "Chinese quality" in such products that are directly related to life and safety is fatal.</seg>
        <seg id="10">No matter how cheap it is, you cannot buy such a product.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Even if you pay a considerable price, you will want "Japanese quality" products.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Of course, this trend is not unique to Japan.</seg>
        <seg id="13">It is clear from the fact that Western countries, which were in a difficult situation due to lack of masks and medical equipment, still made "returns" one after another due to the terrible "Chinese quality".</seg>
        <seg id="14">Safer and more secure than cheap</seg>
        <seg id="15">In addition, products such as automobiles are also products whose defects can be fatal (death due to an accident).</seg>
        <seg id="16">No matter how much China, South Korea and other countries attacked with the "cheap or bad" bargain strategy, they couldn't compete with the products made in Japan. The reason for the situation described in "Do you bow down to Toyota?" Is that "Japanese quality" is strongly required for automobile products.</seg>
        <seg id="17">And this pandemic reminded me that many other products also need "safety and security".</seg>
        <seg id="18">In addition, safety and security are important not only in "Japanese quality in manufacturing" but also in "Japanese quality in services such as logistics".</seg>
        <seg id="19">Like the toilet paper turmoil, there are times when the production capacity is decent, but the intermediate distribution is delayed and cannot be delivered.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Furthermore, self-sufficiency in Japan is also an important factor of "safety and security", as in the article "Who is the true criminal of mask shortage! Do not forgive the fireplace thief of the Chinese Communist Party administration" on April 17. I was keenly aware of that.</seg>
        <seg id="21">In the event of an emergency, it is natural for all countries to prioritize their own country, and it is very important to be able to procure essentials such as masks (medical equipment) and food in their own country.</seg>

        <seg id="2">The white paint originally from Teflon-treated frying pans has been confirmed to enhance the cooling effect through insulation!</seg>
        <seg id="3">What an unexpected huge discovery!</seg>
        <seg id="4">This was a rainy season with notable amounts of rainfall not seen in previous years, and yet, as it lifts the fierce heat of summer intensifies.</seg>
        <seg id="5">The hot, hot days of scorching heat when even the air conditioner has no effect.... it's exhausting just thinking about it, isn't it?</seg>
        <seg id="6">Global warming is a worldwide problem, and humankind has racked its collective brain for how we can overcome the midsummer heat even slightly more comfortably.</seg>
        <seg id="7">One of those methods is to wear light white clothing.</seg>
        <seg id="8">There's no need to go out of your way to wear heat-absorbing black clothes in summer, right?</seg>
        <seg id="9">And it seems that the use of white paints is increasing by applying the same principle to the architecture of houses.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Though white may be white, there was the cutting-edge research whether there is yet something that could be made into a specialized paint that reflects even more light and absorbs even less heat.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Recently the Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) in collaboration with researchers from the Columbia University School of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics, announced that they have discovered a compounding method for a white paint that most efficiently reflects solar heat and boosts the effectiveness of cooling inside buildings.</seg>
        <seg id="12">They say they are striving for early implementation.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Up until now, the white paint with the highest rate of sunlight reflection was one that was made with titanium oxide and had a reflection rate of 85%.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Paints using titanium oxide are already being painted on the roofs of buildings in high-temperature environments, and are proving useful in blocking sunlight and raising air cooling efficiency.</seg>
        <seg id="15">However, what was newly discovered is a paint based in a fluororesin from none other than polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), which is used in those Teflon-treated frying pans.</seg>
        <seg id="16">It is thought that with paint that applies this Teflon effect, almost 98% of sunlight will be reflected and it will be possible to make a substantial cut in heat.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Even in the hot summer, with the unexpected paint that uses Teflon, inside there is no exposure to the intense heat and it is so comfortable!</seg>
        <seg id="18">Maybe such an age will come soon?</seg>
        <seg id="19">It seems like there are a lot of Japanese houses with dark-colored roofs, but maybe from now on white will become mainstream?</seg>

        <seg id="1">A Critical Eye Cast Over Excessive Restrictions on Mobile Number Transfers</seg>
        <seg id="2">What will happen to fees and point allocation?</seg>
        <seg id="3">(Newswitch) - Yahoo! News</seg>
        <seg id="4">The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications is proceeding at full tilt in its decision to review the mobile number portability system (MNP), which makes it possible to use an old cell phone number as-is when changing mobile phone carriers.</seg>
        <seg id="5">At a meeting of experts on the 21st, they otulined the objective to revise the MNP guidelines, which were established in 2004.</seg>
        <seg id="6">The specific points at issue are wide-ranging, including the current state of MNP handling fees and the pros and cons of restrictions on those wishing to transfer.</seg>
        <seg id="7">With opposition expected from carriers, all eyes are on whether it will encourage healthy market competition.</seg>
        <seg id="8">It is a shady aspect of phone carriers, with unlimited mobile transfer still a long way away; when MNP was introduced in 2006, the fees customers had to pay was 2000 yen, but that has now risen to 3000 yen.</seg>
        <seg id="9">The amount of revenue the three major mobile phone carriers receive from MNP fees is estimated to exceed 15.9 billion annually.</seg>
        <seg id="10">On the 21st, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications enumerated the current circumstances surrounding MNP at the Working Group (WG) on Verification of Competition Rules, a panel of experts debating subjects like the competitive environment of the communications market.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Criticism was also levelled at the time period in which one can receive an MNP reservation number, which is necessary when a consumer transfers to another carrier.</seg>
        <seg id="12">The major carriers accept applications online, but due to circumstances such as core system operation, it is normal for applications to only be accepted between 9:00 and 20:00.</seg>
        <seg id="13">It was specified in the working group's documents that the direction of future considerations is that all-day support should be the norm.</seg>
        <seg id="14">It is also viewed as problematic that people who wish to transfer under the MNP are are bound to their mobile phone carrier through strategies such as points allocation schemes.</seg>
        <seg id="15">This comes from the judgment that excessive restrictions can only obstruct fair competition.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Partner Kita Shinichi of the Nomura Research Institute, who serves as a member of the working group, proposed, "Carriers should get customers' permission to take the time and explain the financial benefits they are offering, and those customers who do not consent should be immediately issued with MNP numbers and end it there. It is important to thoroughly ensure this process first."</seg>
        <seg id="17">However, among the series of points at issue with regard to MNP handling fees, it seems that structural problems lie ahead, as a source at the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications explains, "The more expensive they are, the harder it becomes to lose customers, so it's difficult to motivate carriers to lower them proactively."</seg>
        <seg id="18">There also are worries that if an operator emerges that takes the initiative to lower MNP handling fees, the number of users leaving that company will increase and its business efforts will not be rewarded.</seg>
        <seg id="19">The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications has also pointed out that in many countries overseas, carriers do not demand a fee from their customers for MNP, and it is thought that Japan could become that way as well.</seg>
        <seg id="20">The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications will consolidate the results of the working group in a report around September or October, and it is thought that they will want to begin procedures to revise the MNP guidelines thereafter.</seg>
        <seg id="21">If revisions are implemented, the timing will likely be in 2021 or thereafter.</seg>
        <seg id="22">This will likely cause mobile phone carriers to worry about issues including the state of sales and customer support.</seg>

        <seg id="11">The time required for issuing MNP reservation numbers when consumers move to another telecommunications company is also a yardstick.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Major telecommunications companies accept it on the web, but due to the convenience of the operation of the core system, the mainstream reception time is 9-20 o'clock.</seg>
        <seg id="13">In the WG document, it was clearly stated that all-day response would be a principle as a direction for future consideration.</seg>
        <seg id="14">For those who wish to move out in MNP, it is also a problem that mobile carriers try to detain by granting points.</seg>
        <seg id="15">This is because it is judged that excessive retention may hinder fair competition.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Shunichi Kita, Partner at Nomura Research Institute, who is a member of the WG, said,"We will promptly issue a number to users who do not grant permission from users if they have time to explain the provision of economic benefits.It is important to thoroughly implement this process first."</seg>
        <seg id="17">However, in a series of issues, there is a structural problem that"the higher the MNP fee, the more difficult it is for customers to flow out, so it is difficult to motivate them to actively lower it." (The person in charge of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications)</seg>
        <seg id="18">If some operators take the initiative to lower MNP fees, they will increase the outflow of customers from that company, and it is also a concern that corporate efforts will not be rewarded.</seg>
        <seg id="19">The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications has also pointed out that many countries overseas do not ask for user-paid fees for MNP, and it is possible that this will happen in Japan as well.</seg>
        <seg id="20">The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications summarized the results of the WG in a report around 9-10 May, and then decided to start the procedure for amending the MNP guidelines.</seg>
        <seg id="21">It is believed that the revision will take place after 21 years.</seg>

        <seg id="4">The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications is in the midst of a full-scale review of the Mobile Number Portability Program (MNP), which allows users to keep their existing phone numbers when changing mobile carriers.</seg>
        <seg id="5">At a meeting of experts on the 21st, they announced a plan to revise the MNP guidelines established in 2004.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Specific issues range from the nature of MNP fees to the pros and cons of retaining those who wish to move.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Amid expectations of a backlash from telecommunications companies, attention is focused on whether this will lead to the promotion of healthy competition in the market.</seg>
        <seg id="8">In 2006, when MNP was introduced, the initial user fee was 2,000 yen, but now it is 3,000 yen.</seg>

        <seg id="11">The reception time for issuing MNP reservation numbers, which are required when consumers move to other telecommunications companies, was also cited as a problem.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Major telecommunications companies accept applications online, but due to the operation of their core systems, applications are generally accepted between 9 a.m. and 8 p.m.</seg>
        <seg id="13">In the WG document, it was clearly stated that, in principle, all-day support will be provided as a direction for future consideration.</seg>

        <seg id="16">Kita Shunichi, a partner at Nomura Research Institute who serves as a member of the WG, suggests that "it is important to thoroughly go through this process first, either by taking the time to explain the provision of economic benefits or by obtaining permission from the user, and then promptly issuing a number to the user who does not give permission and ending it."</seg>
        <seg id="17">However, among a series of issues, there is a structural problem with MNP fees: "The higher they are, the more difficult it is for customers to leave, so it is difficult to motivate them to actively reduce them" (Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications official).</seg>
        <seg id="18">If a business operator takes the initiative to reduce the MNP fee, there is also concern that the outflow of customers from that company will increase and the company's efforts will not be rewarded.</seg>
        <seg id="19">The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications has also pointed out that many countries overseas do not require user fees for MNP, and it is conceivable that this will also be the case in Japan.</seg>
        <seg id="20">The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications plans to compile the results of the WG into a report around September or October, and then begin the process of revising the MNP guidelines.</seg>

        <seg id="5">At the meeting of experts on the 21st, the policy was made to amend the MNP guidelines enacted in 2004.</seg>

        <seg id="7">While a repulsion from telecom companies is expected, attention will be drawn to whether it can lead to healthy market competition.</seg>
        <seg id="8">The darkness of communication companies far from all you can transfer to mobile phones is far from the darkness of MNP. At the beginning of 2006, the user fee was 2000 yen, but now 3000 yen.</seg>

        <seg id="13">In the WG materials, it was clearly stated that the all-day response is as a rule as a direction for future consideration.</seg>
        <seg id="14">For those who wish to move out at MNP, it is also a problem that a mobile carrier is trying to redeem points by granting points.</seg>
        <seg id="15">It is because of the judgment that excessive retention can hinder fair competition.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Shunichi Kita, partner of Nomura Research Institute, who serves as a member of WG, said, “If you can have time to explain the provision of economic benefits or obtain permission from the user, we will issue a number promptly to users who do not grant permission and terminate. It is important to ensure this process first.”</seg>
        <seg id="17">However, in a series of issues, the structural problem of MNP fee is “the higher the customer is less likely to flow out, so motivation to proactively lower it is difficult to work” (the person in charge of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications) lies.</seg>
        <seg id="18">If a business operator takes the initiative to lower the MNP fee, there is also a concern that the customer outflow from the company will increase and the efforts of the company will not be rewarded.</seg>
        <seg id="19">The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications also pointed out that many countries overseas do not seek user fees for MNP, and it is likely that this will happen in Japan.</seg>
        <seg id="20">The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications summarizes the results of WG as a report around September to October, and then wants to begin the amendment of the MNP guidelines.</seg>
        <seg id="21">The time when the amendment is made is considered to be after 21 years.</seg>

        <seg id="2">It's the second biggest contract after the Angels' Mike Trout!</seg>
        <seg id="3">It was revealed that Right fielder Mookie Betts has signed a new contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers.</seg>
        <seg id="4">He was traded to the Dodgers by the Boston Red Sox during the off-season.</seg>
        <seg id="5">This means that before the start of his first year at his new home, he is already in a contract through to 2032.</seg>
        <seg id="6">US media outlets such as CBS Sports broke the news on the 22nd (23rd, Japan time).</seg>
        <seg id="7">Video: Betts shows off a wide range of abilities with the Red Sox!</seg>
        <seg id="8">He can also do some other amazing things besides baseball!</seg>
        <seg id="9">Betts made his major league debut in 2014 at the age of 21.</seg>
        <seg id="10">He played a central role in the Boston Red Sox's strong batting lineup, and also flourished as a right fielder with a powerful throw.</seg>
        <seg id="11">From 2015 up until last season, he was the quintessential intermediate-range batter, racking up more than 40 doubles every year.</seg>
        <seg id="12">In 2018, he became the world's number one with an average of .346, batting champion and MVP.</seg>
        <seg id="13">According to CBS Sports, last year, Betts rejected a 10-year offer from the Red Sox for 300 million dollars (approximately 32.1 billion yen).</seg>
        <seg id="14">During the off-season, the Red Sox traded Betts to the Dodgers together with ace left-handed pitcher, David Price, in exchange for cash considerations and multiple players.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Betts' contract for this season is 27 million dollars (approximately 2.9 billion yen) for the year.</seg>
        <seg id="16">His new contract is for 12 years, from the 2021 season to the 2032 season, and is reported to be worth a total of 365 million dollars (approximately 39.1 billion yen).</seg>
        <seg id="17">To date, the largest contract in major league baseball went to Mike Trout, centre fielder for the Los Angeles Angels, totalling 426 million dollars (approximately 45.6 billion yen) for 12 years.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Betts' latest contract will become the second largest amount after that.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Since Betts was due to become a free agent during this off-season period, it was inevitable that there would be a fierce battle to snap him up if he ever went on the market.</seg>
        <seg id="20">His contract follows the recent trend of tying players into long-term, big-money contracts before they become free agents.</seg>
        <seg id="21">This means that in the turbulent world of major league baseball, Betts has been granted some long-term stability.</seg>

        <seg id="2">National Route 152 was subject to a total road closure, with lines of vehicles waiting to take the detour, where one side of the road was closed and traffic could only pass at alternate intervals: At Tatsuyamacho, Tenryu ward, Hamamatsu City, on the afternoon of the 22nd (Photo partially altered)</seg>
        <seg id="3">July's heavy rains caused severe damage in Kyushu and other parts of Japan, and even in Shizuoka prefecture, the Tenryu area of Hamamatsu city was particularly affected.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Landslides have affected National Route 152, a major road, and the JR Iida Line, many people's daily mode of transport, and many places still need time for recovery.</seg>
        <seg id="5">It has not only been an inconvenience in the lives of local residents, but has also caused worries about the negative impact on economic activity.</seg>
        <seg id="6">During the day, there are long lines of vehicles waiting to cross Sejiri Bridge, which spans the Tenryu River in the Tatsuyamacho part of the city.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Vehicles at the front had been stopped for close to 40 minutes.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Approximately 10km of National Route 152 has been subject to a total road closure, necessitating a detour to the opposite bank of the Tenryu River in order to be able to get around town.</seg>
        <seg id="9">However, the road is narrow and, along the whole section, traffic can only pass on one side at alternate intervals, so waiting times are unpredictable.</seg>
        <seg id="10">In the town, a landslide occured on the National Highway on the 9th, and the road was closed due to the risk of falling rocks from the nearby slope.</seg>
        <seg id="11">On the 13th, cracks were found in Akiba tunnel, which is within the town's jurisdiction, but no estimates have yet been made as to when it will reopen to traffic.</seg>

        <seg id="14">Due to the collapsed bank beside the railroad track, the JR Iida Line has been cut off between Misakubo Station (in the ward's Misakubocho town) and Hiraoka Station (Nagano prefecture).</seg>
        <seg id="15">Ukai Shiori (16), who was commuting to Shizuoka Prefecture Hamamatsukohoku High School Sakuma Branch, in the ward's Sakuma town, via Ozore Station (in the same town), which is in the cut-off section, now needs to be dropped off and picked up by car, about an hour each way.</seg>
        <seg id="16">"Going by car is a big burden on my parents and on me," she says, hoping for early recovery.</seg>
        <seg id="17">According to JR Central, they anticipate that it will take about three months to reopen the section of track, and, starting from the 27th, there will be a special train service making round trips between Misakubocho Station and Ozore Station, with one train in the morning and in the evening on weekdays.</seg>
        <seg id="18">In Misakubocho, where forest roads also serve as roads for people's daily coming and going, landslides are a frequent occurrence.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Detours can sometimes take several hours.</seg>
        <seg id="20">The Misakubo Forestry Association Chairman Keiji Kumagai (69) commented with a gloomy expression, "Log removal is delayed too. There are isolated places all over, like islands. I'm worried about future rains."</seg>

        <seg id="3">Two weather phenomena appeared together over Yamagata just before 9am on the 24th: a solar halo, which looks like a ring of light encompassing the sun, and a circumhorizontal arc, which is a rainbow-coloured band of light.</seg>
        <seg id="4">According to a source at the Yamagata Meteorological Observatory, both the solar halo and the circumhorizontal arc result from sunlight hitting fine ice crystals within a cloud and being bent or reflected.</seg>
        <seg id="5">A normal rainbow can be seen when the sun is behind you, but a peculiar feature of a circumhorizontal arc is that it appears in the same direction that the sun is in.</seg>

        <seg id="14">As her eldest was preparing to take university entrance exams, the exam prep centre fees racked up, resulting in more than a few months in the red, so A-san discussed reducing her husband's spending money, which he naturally resisted.</seg>
        <seg id="15">At that time, A-san's husband asked to see what their income and expenditures were, so A-san showed him the household accounting book.</seg>
        <seg id="16">All the expenses should have been recorded, but when they checked the household accounting book, there was not enough to cause them to go into the red.</seg>
        <seg id="17">A-san's husband said, "We have enough," and almost managed to get his way, so A-san impulsively declared, "Okay, I'm in over my head managing the household finances, so can you please handle everything," which led her husband to say, "I think I'll leave it to you after all."</seg>
        <seg id="18">When quizzed about this later, A-san's husband told her, "Although it's true that I'm not happy with the way that my spending money is controlled, to be honest, I don't have the time or energy to manage the various household expenses (for instance expenses for school supplies and PTA expenses)."</seg>
        <seg id="19">When the husband manages the household finances: B-san, a full-time housewife, is given living expenses by her husband, on which she has to get by every day.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Last spring, the freezer section of the refrigerator broke, so B-san asked her husband to buy a new fridge.</seg>
        <seg id="21">However, her husband was reluctant to buy a new one, saying, "It's still fine to use, only the freezer part is broken."</seg>
        <seg id="22">However, when the summer came round, B-san's husband apparently wanted to be able to eat ice cream whenever he fancied and decided that maybe they should buy a new fridge after all.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Recounting the episode to a friend, B-san complained that her husband is "stingy with a capital S".</seg>
