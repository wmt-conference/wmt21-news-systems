        <seg id="13">カットしやすいように、まずは全体を軽く濡らします。</seg>

        <seg id="2">The complete report (CanCam.jp) --Yahoo! News</seg>
        <seg id="3">A bottom heavy, medium-length hairstyle with layers that keeps it bouncy  [Minami style]</seg>
        <seg id="4">CanCam model, Honoka, goes for a hairstyle with bounce, like Tanaka Minami, whom she gushes is, "Not only beautiful, but very professional respectable!"</seg>
        <seg id="5">She went to Asahi Mitsuteru of the Hair Salon "SUN VALLEY" in Omotesando, who cuts Tanaka Minami's hair, to give her the "Minami-style " cut.</seg>
        <seg id="6">We will explain the process to get the "cut"!</seg>
        <seg id="7">Nogizaka46 Yamashita Mizuki, her first cover with her new, short look!</seg>
        <seg id="8">Let's check out Honoka's hair before cutting.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Thin, soft and volumenous hair.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Curly and unruly especially during the rainy season, she sometimes gets her hair straightened.</seg>
        <seg id="11">A heavy medium-length, with side bangs.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Let's start the cut!</seg>
        <seg id="13">First, we dampen the whole head, making it easier to cut.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Then section out the hair on the crown (just above the widest part of the head) and start cutting from the bottom.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Here are some key points to achieve a hairstyle just like Minami!</seg>
        <seg id="16">1. Double Bangs:  by cutting the inside layer of the bang a little shorter, you can either choose thicker full bangs by letting both layers fall or achieve lighter, see-through look when you separate the layers.</seg>
        <seg id="17">2. Making the most of your curls:  when those with curlier hair try to thin out volume, it may make it more difficult to tame.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Need to keep the balance of easy care, taming unruliness, and making the most of the curls while thinking about proportion.</seg>
        <seg id="19">3. Layering around the face and loose hair:  layered cut = a cutting at different lengths.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Layering around the face gives bounce and a cute finish.</seg>
        <seg id="21">By creating loose hair in 3 areas, around the temple and at the front and back of sideburns, you can create a stylish look when the hair is casually put up.</seg>
        <seg id="22">Release the sectioned out hair on the crown, cut together, then release around the face.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Pull out the upper part of the hair around the face and snip the ends of the hair.</seg>
        <seg id="24">This will create layers when the hair is let down, giving it bounce (this is a layered haircut).</seg>

        <seg id="24">This way, when the hair is pulled down, there will be a stepped look and it will be easier to create movement (this is called a layered cut).</seg>

        <seg id="23">Pull the upper part of the hair around the face forward and cut the tip of the hair.</seg>
        <seg id="24">This way, when the hair bundle is lowered, there will be a step difference, making it easier to move (this is the layer cut).</seg>

        <seg id="2">Great play from No. 4 Yasuda, and 2 points scored for good measure by Toritani (Baseball King) - Yahoo!News</seg>
        <seg id="3">Seibu 0 - 5 Lotte (10 innings, played at the MetLife Dome): Lotte's starting pitcher, Taneichi Atsuki, delivered 136 pitches during the nine innings, resulting in his delightful first shutout in the 4th year of his professional career.</seg>
        <seg id="4">It was the first shutout of the Pacific League this season, resulting in the team's third win and halting their losing streak at just two.</seg>
        <seg id="5">To begin with, Taneichi allowed Suzuki Shohei, who was first up to bat, to hit a double that broke through the third-base line, but following this, Genda Sosuke was immediately grounded out from third base and then Suzuki himself was also touched out when trying to advance to third base.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Helped out by the calm response of his fielders, Taneichi got through this initial slip-up with zero, and from the second inning onwards, he made short work of Seibu's batting lineup, using a combination of sliders and forkballs based around his accomplished straight.</seg>
        <seg id="7">This progress only served to improve his confidence, and the zeros lined up on the scoreboard.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Lotte's batting line had been unable to hit anything thrown by Seibu's starting pitcher, Honda Keisuke, until finally, at the top of the seventh inning, No. 3 Sugano Tsuyoshi walked on base with a four ball, and pinch runner Oka Hiromi succeeded in stealing second base.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Taking this chance, No. 4 Yasuda Hisanori sent a ball sailing perfectly over to the right of the field, and finally broke the deadlock.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Continuing on into the eighth inning, Toritani Takashi, who had been substituted in, was on the offensive against Seibu's No. 3 Miyagawa Tetsu, hitting a run-scoring hit between the left and centre fielders for two points, racking up four points for Lotte in no time.</seg>
        <seg id="11">This left everything resting on the shoulders of the Marines' young ace candidate, and the match was quickly decided.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Taneichi ended the eighth inning by getting all three batters out, and continued pitching in the ninth inning, by which point he had thrown over 100 balls.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Exerting himself, Taneichi allowed a succession of walks and found himself with two out and bases loaded, but in the end, a fast ball to Cory Spangenberg produced the 10th strikeout of the day, and the game was set.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Taneichi rejoiced with a smile on his face.</seg>

        <seg id="6">Helped by the calm response of the ally defense, when he cut through the pinch of standing up at zero, after the second inning, he tossed the Seibu Uchisen with a combination of sliders and forks around the straight of pride.</seg>

        <seg id="3">The endeavour was planned in the hopes of bringing the pandemic to an early end and praying for health in an environment where the impact of COVID-19 precludes the in-person sales experience in stores and the interaction with local residents that would normally take place.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Starting in June, 11 high school seniors made the figures three days a week as part of their morning classes.</seg>
        <seg id="5">After putting effort into rolling out the clay and shaping it with cutters, they worked to wrap them in straw to bring out the distinctive "hidasuki" scarlet color of Bizen ware.</seg>
        <seg id="6">The students said that it took about two or three weeks to complete, including the process of drying and firing.</seg>
        <seg id="7">"We worked really hard to make these and we filled them with our hope that the elderly will not give up hope in the face of COVID-19 and will continue to stay healthy and happy," explained a third-year student (18).</seg>
        <seg id="8">On the 27th, the students plan to deliver 40 of the Bizen ware figurines to the residents of Okayama Yurakuen (part of the same facility), a nursing home where they hold choral events and other interactions.</seg>
        <seg id="9">The students say they will continue making the Bizen ware Amabie figurines until the end of July, and then they will decide where to send the remaining ones.</seg>

        <seg id="3">The exclusive Hyogo high school baseball tournament was held on the 24th, with the first game being Akashi Shougyo HS (top four in the last spring/summer Koshien tournament), a strong team playing against Takasago (2nd round, Takasago Municipal Baseball Stadium) and wins a called game in the 5th inning, 11-0.</seg>
        <seg id="4">151 km right-handed pitcher, Nakamori Shunsuke (senior), who is a top draft pick, showed off with a no-hitter, seven strikeouts and excellent pitching in the 3rd inning.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Wada Yutaka (57), technical advisor for Hanshin baseball team's headquarters, highly praised him.</seg>
        <seg id="6">The start was delayed by 39 minutes due to the continuous rain and field maintenance.</seg>
        <seg id="7">A muddy mound.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Even so, the long-awaited first official game of the year caused enthusiasm.</seg>
        <seg id="9">In the end, he gave up one walk, but pitched an impressive no-hitter.</seg>
        <seg id="10">He had 7 strikeouts and with a no hit and no run in the 3rd inning, contributed to a called game in the 5th inning.</seg>
        <seg id="11">"It was floating all over. It was good to strikeout with fastballs, but the easily recognized low curve balls needs to be adjusted." Nakamori critiqued himself harshly, even when he marked the fastest pitch that day at 148 km, impressing the professional eyes of Hanshin, Giants, and Orix who were behind the net.</seg>
        <seg id="12">It was Hanshin • Wada TA's first onsite observation since the first round of Koshien last summer (2nd round ○ 4-3 Hanasaki Tokuharu HS).</seg>
        <seg id="13">He praised that "he is still growing. He is a top class high schooler, after all. Even with bad footing, his form didn't collapse and he controlled well. He will most likely be a top candidate recruit."</seg>
        <seg id="14">Giant • Kishi Scout also said, "He was one of the best I've seen recently.</seg>
        <seg id="15">He's managed to improve himself in the middle of this Covid crisis.", showering with praise.</seg>
        <seg id="16">While he was "still undecided between going pro or to go to college, a 50/50 chance" at the end of June, he will make up his mind after the August 16th Koshien exchange game (vs Kiryu No1 HS), saying he "would love to turn pro but it's still hard to make decisions."</seg>
        <seg id="17">But before that, the goal is to win this tournament and be in the top eight.</seg>
        <seg id="18">There is a rule that allows you to change the lineup of 20 players on the bench every game.</seg>
        <seg id="19">This game was also played by all 16 Seniors.</seg>
        <seg id="20">For all 39 seniors to play in the games, they must continue to win the remaining three games.</seg>
        <seg id="21">"This is the last tournament and we've been practicing hard for three years. We hope all seniors participate. We want to win all the games including Koshien. For me personally, my goal is to have a shutout game, as coach (Hazama) keeps reminding me I haven't yet." The team and his goals seem to have been set for their last summer.</seg>

        <seg id="3">104-98で快勝したこの試合、ダンカン・ロビンソンがチームハイの18得点、タイラー・ヒーローがそれに続く15得点とバックコートの活躍が光った。</seg>
        <seg id="4">リーグ屈指のシューターであるロビンソンはもちろん、ドラフト全体13位指名のルーキー、ヒーローのステップアップがヒートにとっては重要な要素になる。</seg>

        <seg id="1">Butler once again praises Tyler Herro, the young star carrying the future of the Heat, "He doesn't think like a rookie" (Basket Count) - Yahoo!News</seg>
        <seg id="2">The Heat's first scrimmage (practice) game is against the Kings (photo credit: Getty Images).</seg>
        <seg id="3">At 104-98, the Heat secured an easy victory in this game, with backcourt heroes in their elements as Duncan Robinson scored 18 points, the most out of the team, and Tyler Herro followed with 15.</seg>
        <seg id="4">In addition to Robinson, who is one of the best shooters in the league, the stepping up of Herro, a rookie who was nominated 13th overall in the draft, will likely become a key element for the Heat.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Herro missed 15 games in February and March due to an ankle injury, and the season began a long hiatus after his first game back against the Hornets on March 12th.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Herro said, "I was able to get my condition back up to 100% as there was plenty of time available. I feel the best I've ever felt," but actions speak louder than words, and his performance during the scrimmage was ample evidence of this.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Herro has been afforded more play time due to the delay in starting point guard Kendrick Nunn joining back with the team, a chance that he did not let go to waste.</seg>
        <seg id="8">It certainly paid off, since he played splendidly in a different role from normal, and was able to score 15 points.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Team captain Jimmy Butler once again praised his "favourite", Herro.</seg>
        <seg id="10">"Herro's a great handler, he's able to score points, he can defend. He's able to do anything to support the team. He doesn't think like a rookie, which is why he's comfortable in any position. He studies video footage, and thinks about how his teammates move and get in a free position, and what he should do in response."</seg>
        <seg id="11">Even before this season started, Butler was impressed with Herro's strong, un-rookie-like competitive spirit and stoic attitude towards basketball.</seg>
        <seg id="12">That's why he invited Herro to individual training sessions starting at 4am, and they trained together.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Butler has said of Herro in the past, "He makes his opinion known to anyone, and never backs down. I respect that kind of fighting spirit."</seg>
        <seg id="14">Butler is also a player who speaks his mind and, if he thinks it will help the team, is known to air harsh opinions, even while knowing it will cause a conflict.</seg>
        <seg id="15">In the past, this has caused a rift between him and his teammates.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Butler may see some of his younger self in Herro.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Though his fearsome countenance sometimes gets the better of other players, those with the fortitude to follow Butler receive excellent guidance.</seg>
        <seg id="18">If this quality of mutual respect between pupil and teacher spreads through the ranks, then there will be no limit to what the Heat can do as a team.</seg>

        <seg id="3">Duncan Robinson scored a team-high 18 points in a comfortable 104-98 win, followed by Tyler Hero with 15 and a backcourt run.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Robinson, one of the league's leading shooters, as well as the 13th-ranked rookie of the entire draft, and the hero step up will be a key factor for the Heat.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Hero missed 15 games between February and March due to an ankle injury, and the season ended with a lengthy suspension against the Hornets on March 12, his return.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Hero said, "We had a lot of time, so we were able to get 100% back in shape. It's the best I've ever felt," he said, but his performance in scrimmage was more convincing than words.</seg>
        <seg id="7">The late confluence of starting point guard Kendrick Nunn increased the hero's playing time and took advantage of that opportunity.</seg>
        <seg id="8">It's worth it because he's scored 15 goals in a different role.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Team leader Jimmy Butler praised the favorite hero again.</seg>
        <seg id="10">"He can be a handler, he can score goals, he can defend. He's a player who can do everything for the team. I can do it in any position because my way of thinking is not that of a rookie. I watch the footage and research it, and my teammates are banging their heads on where and how they move and get free, and what I should do with it."</seg>
        <seg id="11">Even before the start of the season, Butler likes his hero's rookie-like strength and his stoic attitude toward basketball.</seg>
        <seg id="12">That's why we invited them to practice at 4:00 a.m. and trained together.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Butler once said, "He has his opinion on everyone, and he doesn't back down. I can respect that kind of fighting spirit."</seg>
        <seg id="14">The butler is the type who always says what he thought, and if he thinks it will be for the team, he will clash with him and he will clash with him.</seg>
        <seg id="15">In the past, this has worsened my relationship with my teammates.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Butler is likely layering his younger days on his hero.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Butler's character, which is sometimes too harsh for his teammates, is a good guide for those who have the guts to just come about it.</seg>
        <seg id="18">If the relationship between two mutually respected teachers and children spreads throughout the team, the Heat should be able to move even further.</seg>

        <seg id="3">This strong need is held not only by newspapers, television, and other news organizations, but also by social infrastructure companies and local governments.</seg>
        <seg id="4">A service to address this need is "Sepctee," developed by Spectee, which handles information analysis using AI.</seg>
        <seg id="5">(Photo) A specialized team determines the authenticity of social media information after alerts from Spectee.</seg>
        <seg id="6">At present, the means through which people get information about the disasters and accidents happening is starting to shift from television to internet information (social media).</seg>
        <seg id="7">Social media such as Twitter has become crucial for transmitting information directly after the onset of an accident or disaster.</seg>
        <seg id="8">However, it is difficult to constantly monitor and manually extract what is useful from the overflowing information.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Spectee has the faculty to detect information related to natural disasters and accidents from the information circulating on social media such as Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, and after analyzing the content and upon determining the truth or falsehood of the information, will transmit it to corporations.</seg>
        <seg id="10">"We asses a wide range of events that have the negative impact of stopping or delaying society's activities as 'crises'," (Murakami Kenjiro, Representative Director CEO), it is a crisis management support service that visualizes various crises occurring domestically and overseas.</seg>
        <seg id="11">NHK, at the time of the Kumamoto earthquake that occurred in April, 2016, was the first major case to utilize Spectee, and after that the move to implement it among companies has spread rapidly.</seg>
        <seg id="12">It is stated that over 350 companies are using Spectee, including not only news outlets such as television stations and newspapers, but also companies that support social infrastructure such as electric, gas and transportation, as well as local governments across the country.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Analyzing posts and determining the type and location of "crises"</seg>
        <seg id="14">Spectee distributes information by taking four steps: "information gathering," "analysis and content classification," "setting titles," and "judging authenticity."</seg>
        <seg id="15">User companies specify in advance the region (prefecture, administrative district, or city, town, village etc.) and crisis category (natural disaster, accidents, etc.) for information collection.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Spectee uses the API provided by social media to gather posts that apply to these specifications.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Then, it analyzes and categorizes the text, images, and videos contained in those posts.</seg>
        <seg id="18">For example, if a video is posted that shows a fire engine, black smoke rising from a building, and orange flames coming out from the roof, it will be classified under "fire."</seg>
        <seg id="19">In addition, it will classify an image of an overturned vehicle under "traffic accident," or streets submerged in water as "road flooding."</seg>
        <seg id="20">Spectee also makes an estimate of the location where the disaster or accident has occurred.</seg>
        <seg id="21">"There are many cases in which the location is unknown based on a post, so the estimate is made by combining a variety of information" said CEO Murakami.</seg>
        <seg id="22">For example, if a road sign or sign board appears in an image or video, information about location names will be extracted from there and compared against a database of locations to determine where it is.</seg>

        <seg id="8">However, it is difficult for human hands to constantly watch overflowing information and pull useful information out of it.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Specty has the function of detecting and analyzing information related to natural disasters and accidents from information flowing through social media such as Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, determining the authenticity of the information, and delivering it to the companies using it.</seg>
        <seg id="10">"We position negative impactful events that stop or stagnate social activities as "crises" (Mr. Kenjiro Murakami, Ceo) and crisis management support services that visualize various crises occurring in Japan and overseas.</seg>
        <seg id="11">NHK, which occurred during the Kumamoto Earthquake in April 2016, was the first major use case of Specty, and the recruitment movement spread rapidly among companies.</seg>
        <seg id="12">More than 350 companies in Japan, including television stations and newspapers, as well as companies that support social infrastructure such as electricity, gas, and transportation, and local governments around the country, are currently using the specs.</seg>
        <seg id="13">■ Analyze posts to determine the type of "crisis" and where it occurs</seg>
        <seg id="14">The specty delivers information in four steps: "Collecting Information", "Analysis and Content Classification", "Title", and "Authenticity Determination".</seg>
        <seg id="15">The company must specify in advance which areas (prefectures, cities, etc.) to collect information in, and categories of crises (disasters, accidents, etc.).</seg>
        <seg id="16">Specty collects posts that fall under its designation using apIs provided by social media.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Next, analyze and categorize the text, images, and videos included in the collected posts.</seg>
        <seg id="18">For example, if there is a video showing a fire truck, black smoke rising from the building, and an orange flame coming out of the room, it will be classified as "fire".</seg>
        <seg id="19">In addition, if it is an image of a car that has overturned, it is classified as "traffic accident", and if it is an image of a road with water, it is classified as "road flooding".</seg>
        <seg id="20">Specty also estimates where disasters and accidents occur.</seg>
        <seg id="21">"We often don't know where from the posts, so we use a combination of different information to estimate it," Murakami said.</seg>
        <seg id="22">For example, if a road sign or signboard is reflected in an image or video, information on the place name is extracted from it, and the location is identified by matching it with the place name database.</seg>

        <seg id="17">It is a staple of the gourmet street food fare sold at food stalls, and at a price of 10~20 yuan (150~300 yen) it is extremely reasonable.</seg>
        <seg id="18">It does include the character "chilled," but liangpi is not shocked with ice like Japan's hiyashi chuka.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Rather, room temperature is the standard.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Preferred toppings such as matchstick cucumbers and carrots or boiled bean sprouts are placed on top of the noodles, and condiments like cilantro, chili pepper, vinegar and garlic are added on.</seg>

        <seg id="2">The benefits that cold showers have for your body and mind (Cosmopolitan) - Yahoo!News</seg>
        <seg id="3">Suppressing inflammation such as muscle pain</seg>
        <seg id="4">A study published in The North American Journal of Medical Sciences that examined the effectiveness of hydrotherapy (a type of treatment that uses water) found that it seems to have a promising effect on physical and mental recovery.</seg>
        <seg id="5">It seems that by showering with cold water after exercising, muscle pain and other inflammatory symptoms can be reduced.</seg>
        <seg id="6">According to Professor Douglas Casa, CEO of the Korey Stringer Institute sports medicine research facility, who holds a teaching position at the University of Connecticut, "After exercising, it's important to take a cold shower as soon as possible. By lowering the body temperature soon after you finish physical exertion, your recovery from both the fatigue and the inflammation caused by exercise will be quicker."</seg>
        <seg id="7">Reduce fatigue</seg>
        <seg id="8">If you exercise when it's hot, your heart, muscles and skin need more blood pumping around them than normal.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Professor Casa explains, "When you exercise, your heart rate increases, which in turn increases the blood flow to the heart, and you require energy to contract your muscles, so the blood flow to your muscles increases. When it comes to your skin, you have a lot of blood flowing to your skin so that you can regulate your body temperature."</seg>
        <seg id="10">"A cold shower will reduce your skin temperature, thereby reducing the flow of blood to the skin. Instead, blood is routed to internal organs such as your stomach and intestines, which makes it easier to absorb fluids and nutrients after exercise. As a result, you feel less fatigued after exercise."</seg>
        <seg id="11">Can induce the effect of hormesis</seg>
        <seg id="12">Professor Droszewski also explains how a cold shower can induce the effect of hormesis.</seg>
        <seg id="13">The idea of hormesis is that it is better for your body to undergo small amounts of stress and harmful substances rather than none at all.</seg>
        <seg id="14">"Exercising in low oxygen conditions, intermittent fasting and cold showers are all common examples of hormesis that can promote good health. Taking a cold shower stimulates your hormones and neurotransmitters, which can lead to stronger physical tenacity and resilience."</seg>

        <seg id="5">By bathing in cold water after exercise, muscle pain and other inflammatory effects can be suppressed.</seg>
        <seg id="6">According to Douglas Casa, head of the Korey Stringer Institute, which studies sports medicine and teaches at the University of Connecticut, "It's important to exercise and take a cold water shower with as much time as possible. By lowering the body temperature immediately after moving the body, recovery from inflammation and fatigue due to exercise is faster."</seg>
        <seg id="7">Reduce fatigue</seg>
        <seg id="8">When exercising in high temperatures, the heart, muscles, and skin need more blood flow than usual.</seg>
        <seg id="9">"When exercising, myo-blood flow increases because my heart rate is higher, which increases blood flow to the heart and requires energy to contract muscles. Also, when it comes to the skin, a lot of blood flows in to regulate body temperature," says Casa.</seg>
        <seg id="10">"Taking a cold water shower lowers the temperature of the skin, reducing the amount of blood flow sent to the skin. Instead, blood flow is sent to internal organs such as the stomach and intestines, which makes it easier to consume water and nutrients after exercise. As a result, you can reduce the fatigue you feel after exercising."</seg>
        <seg id="11">Expected for Hormosis effect</seg>
        <seg id="12">Drozewski also explains that you can expect the "Hormisis effect" to be activated by bathing in cold water.</seg>
        <seg id="13">The hormosis effect is the idea that it is better to have a little bit of substances and stresses that are harmful to the body than not at all.</seg>
        <seg id="14">"Hypoxia, petit fasting, and cold water showers are prime examples of the expected hormosis effect for health. Cold water showers stimulate hormones and neurotransmitters to increase physical and physical resilience and resilience."</seg>

        <seg id="3">(Central League, Nagoya D on the 24th, Chunichi 2-5 Hanshin, seventh game, Hanshin 4 wins, 3 losses) The momentum of No. 4 continues.</seg>
        <seg id="4">The ball soared and landed in the middle rows of the left field seats.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Oyama hits a homer for two consecutive games and goes around the diamond.</seg>
        <seg id="6">When he returned to the bench, he showed his pearly whites.</seg>
        <seg id="7">"While I've been making good swings, I focused on this one ball and took the full swing."</seg>
        <seg id="8">He entered his turn at bat in the 4th inning, 0-2.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Swinging aggressively from the beginning, he fouled off the first pitch, then came pitch number 2.</seg>
        <seg id="10">He didn't miss the so-so 134 km slider from Ohno Yudai.</seg>
        <seg id="11">A perfect hit, the moment the ball hit the sweet spot of the bat, it was surely in the stands.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Following the previous day's game against Hiroshima (Koshien) on the 23rd, the hits in two consecutive games were the sign of a comeback.</seg>
        <seg id="13">It was also a valuable hit off a pitcher that is his nemesis.</seg>
        <seg id="14">When he played against Ohno Yudai at Koshien on the 17th, he tallied nine hits and four runs.</seg>
        <seg id="15">However, as for games at Nagoya Dome, he has allowed seven wins, one loss and one no-decision in the past 12 games, and suffered from seven consecutive losses since August 23, 2013 with a tie in between.</seg>
        <seg id="16">He got the hit for the first time in 23 innings with a spectacular swing off such a difficult opponent at Nagoya Dome (despite the pitcher being replaced mid-inning, it still counts as an inning pitched) and did not allow the opponent a chance.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Manager Yano commented, "He is highly skilled to be able to take firm advantage of a weak pitch. Even when timing is off and results in a foul ball, he hits with great form. I think he will continue to hit.", expecting continued success.</seg>
        <seg id="18">He hit into right-field in the first inning, marking six consecutive hits and three consecutive games with multiple hits.</seg>
        <seg id="19">At the start of the season, he started as a second stringer, but with seven home runs and 16 RBIs, he is now working perfectly as the team leader and No.4 batter.</seg>
        <seg id="20">He will continue to show results, helping contribute to the team's victories.</seg>

        <seg id="2">Approximately 40 casino facilities in Macau were closed for 15 days from February 5th to 19th under the new coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), but since businesses resumed on the 20th of the same month, strict epidemic prevention measures have been taken.</seg>
        <seg id="3">The Macau Casino Regulatory Authority (DICJ) is asking operating casinos to take the utmost precautions for the health of its employees and guests when it reopens, ensuring distances between gaming (casino) tables and distances with seating at table games (for example, only 3 to 4 people can be seated at one table at the same time at a baccarat table), as well as stipulating that every other or every third slot machine be operated, in order to reduce risk of cross infection.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Disinfection of gaming equipment such as chips has also been reinforced.</seg>
        <seg id="5">In addition, guests are required to wear masks, have body temperature taken, and provide a valid health code (by entering recent travel history, contact history with covid-19 patients, presence of symptoms such as fever and coughs, and contact information) at the time of admission.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Starting midnight of July 15th, the presentation of a negative PCR test result for COVID-19 (issued within the validity period by a licensed facility from Macau or Guangdong Province) was also added to the condition.</seg>
        <seg id="7">The new requirement to present a negative certificate is due to the relaxation of the border measures between Macau and Guangdong Province from 15th, at 6am (eliminating the 14-day quarantine requirement, with conditions), and will be a precautionary measure.</seg>
        <seg id="8">In response to changes in admission conditions from July 15th, DICJ has on July 18th, had Adriano Ho, director of the bureau, and others inspected the implementation status of epidemic prevention measures at casino facilities, as well as calling a meeting with the security representatives from six casino operating companies reiterating the health protection of employees and guests by thoroughly controlling guest admission.</seg>
        <seg id="9">DICJ will continue to carry out rigorous patrols of casino facilities, and will have regular meetings with the operating companies according to the situation and evaluation, as well as adjusting appropriate epidemic prevention measures at the casino in accordance with the guidelines of the Government Health Agency.</seg>
        <seg id="10">This visit to the casino facility was accompanied by Lam Chong, Chief of Center for Health Protection, and was provided with guidance on disinfecting gaming (casino) chips and safe distancing between the seats of electronic casino equipment.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Because of the sharp decline in inbound tourists due to epidemic prevention measures including entry restrictions, the cumulative casino sales for the period from January to June of this year was down 77.4% from the same period of the previous year to 33.72 billion Macau Pataca (Japanese yen equivalent: about 451.9 billion yen).</seg>

        <seg id="6">Fourth up, Yamakawa, was given an intentional walk and Tonozaki, who from the day had switched with Mori and returned to fifth, smashed a fastball from Masuda, leading to a 3-2 victory.</seg>
        <seg id="7">"Even I was surprised by (Genda's drag bunt) there on the bench, and I thought I just had to do something. Tomoya also conveyed through his bunt that he believed in me and that he was connecting it to me there after him. Before Yamakawa went to first with the walk he said, "Be aggressive!" and with that I fully got into the mood and was able to do it," the hero, Tonozaki said, wrapping up the hopes of the three who had set the course for the walk-off win.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Mori and Yamakawa, the first and second draft of 2013, Tonozaki, 3rd draft of 2014, and Genda, 3rd draft of 2016, are the "Core 4," the 4 players that team officials have dubbed "the current core of the team."</seg>

        <seg id="11">"Genda's drag bunt? That wasn't a sign. But at that I thought "Okay, we can do this." Tomoya's was also a fantastic bunt. Tonosaki also hit well," Coach Tsuji said in praise of the joint forces of spirits of "Mori Yama Tono Gen."</seg>

        <seg id="2">Moriyama Sogen, which Seibu is proud of, showed the cooperation of the soul, and directed the second victory of this season.</seg>
        <seg id="3">In the 24th round of the LOTTE (MetLife) in the 2-2, the four men who were still far away from the main condition showed their determination to win the race.</seg>
        <seg id="4">The lead, Genda, came from the safety vantage point to the first base with head sliding.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Then, in the 6th game, the batting rate was 10.8 minutes and 2 ri, and Mori, who was on the bottom, decided to send a bat and died first base.</seg>
        <seg id="6">The fourth and fourth Yamakawa were disrespected, and from this day, Tozaki, who switched to the forest and returned to No. 5, crushed Masuda's right ball and led to a victory of 3-2.</seg>
        <seg id="7">" (Genda's safety) I was surprised even by myself on the bench, and I thought I had no choice but to do something.Tomoya also believed in me behind in the vantage, and the feeling was transmitted.Yamakawa gave me a word "actively go!," before going to the first base at Keito, so I could enter feelings quickly," he said, and made the result of the three thought that made the flow of goodbye.</seg>
        <seg id="8">In the 13th draft, Mori, Yamakawa, Tozaki, and Genda, who were ranked 3rd in 14th and 3rd in 16th, were the "core 4" of the wild players who called themselves "the heart of our present" by the team members.</seg>
        <seg id="9">All of them have experience as captains in the amateur era, and the sense of responsibility is doubled.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Mr. Tozaki, who took over the captain from Yamakawa when he was 4 years old at Fuji University, said, "Mr. Yamakawa is a captain who pulls the team with words because he is good at speaking anyway.On the contrary, I was a type that left the speech to the vice captain who is good at talking, and was standing behind."</seg>
        <seg id="11">Director Tsuji said, "Genda's safety?That's not a sign, but I thought, "You can do it well."Tomoya was also a great vantage point.Tomozaki also hit me well."</seg>
        <seg id="12">Both of them are now suffering from a batting rate of 20-4-5 minutes, but they support the team with the wisdom to win even if they do not.</seg>

        <seg id="2">I'm not sure what to make of this.</seg>
        <seg id="3">In the ninth inning of the 2-2 loss to Lotte at MetLife on March 24, four slumping players who are still far from their best showed their determination to win.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Genda led off the inning with a head-slide to first base off a safety bunt.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Then No. 3 Mori, who has been hitting .182 in the last six games, laid down a bunt to load the bases with one out.</seg>
        <seg id="6">After Yamakawa, the fourth baseman, was given a no-show, Tonosaki, who had replaced Mori in the fifth spot, crushed a straight ball by Masuda to give the team a 3-2 victory.</seg>
        <seg id="7">The hero, Togosaki, said, "(Genda's safety) caught me off guard even as I was on the bench, and I knew I had to do something about it. Tomoya bunted, and I could tell that he was believing in me behind the plate and was trying to connect. Before Mr. Yamakawa went to first base to honor me, he told me to be aggressive! I was able to put my mind to it.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Mori and Yamakawa, the first and second round picks in the 2001 draft, Tonosaki, the third round pick in 2002, and Genda, the third round pick in 2004, are the "core four" of the team's fielders, whom team officials refer to as "the heart of our team.</seg>
        <seg id="9">All of them have been captains in their amateur days and have a greater sense of responsibility than most.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Sotozaki, who took over the captaincy from Yamakawa in his senior year at Fuji University, said, "Yamakawa-san is a good talker, so he is the captain who leads the team with his words. On the other hand, I'm not much of a talker, so I left the talking to the vice-captain, who is a good talker, and stayed in the background." Each of them is supporting the new captain, Genda, and the new players' president, Mori, by showing their own individuality.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Manager Tsuji said, "Genda's safety? That's not a sign. But that made me think, 'Okay, I can go. Tomoya had a great bunt. Tomoya bunted beautifully, and Tonosaki hit well," praised the soulful cooperation of Moriyama and Togen.</seg>
        <seg id="12">All four are now struggling with batting averages of .240 to .500, but even if they can't hit, they are supporting the team with their wisdom and ways to win.</seg>

        <seg id="2">Seibu's proud "Moriyama Gaigen" showed the spirit of cooperation and produced the second farewell win of the season.</seg>
        <seg id="3">In the match against Lotte (MetLife) on the 24th, it was 2-2 in the ninth inning, and the four players, who were still far from being in good shape, showed their tenacity to win.</seg>
        <seg id="4">In the first inning, Genda started the game with a head slide from a safety bunt to first base.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Then, in the last six games, Mori, who is at the bottom of the table with a batting average of 10%, 8% and 2%, sent a bunt to second base with one out.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Yamakawa, No. 4, was shunned, and Sotozaki, who had been replaced by Mori since that day and returned to No. 5, smashed Masuda's straight ball, leading to a 3-2 victory.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Hero Sotozaki said, "(Genda's safety) caught me by surprise even when I was on the bench, and I thought I had no choice but to do something about it. I felt that Tomoya believed in me behind him with a bunt and connected with me. Yamakawa was shy and gave me a word before going to first base, saying, 'Be active!', so I was able to get my feelings in quickly." and the result was the thoughts of the three of them who made the flow of farewell.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Mori and Yamakawa, who were first and second in the 2013 draft, Sotozaki, who was third in 2014, and Genda, who was third in 2016, are the "core four" of the field that team officials call "the heart of our current home."</seg>

        <seg id="11">Director Tsuji praised the spirit of Moriyama Gaigen, saying, "Genda's safety? That's not a sign. But I thought, 'Alright, I can go.' Tomoya was also a great bunt. Sotozaki also hit well."</seg>
        <seg id="12">All four of them are currently struggling with a batting average of 20%, 4 to 5 minutes, but even if they can't hit, they are still supporting the team with the wisdom and wisdom to win.</seg>

        <seg id="1">Bringing Art Closer During the COVID-19 Pandemic, Online Art Museum (HASARD) Launched by Konno (Hachinohe Native) (The Daily Tohoku Shimbun) - Yahoo! News</seg>
        <seg id="2">There exists an art museum where anyone can encounter art for free any time they like.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Its lineup is wide-ranging, from notable painters like Claude Monet and Gustav Klimt, to unknown domestic artists.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Since the online art museum HASARD "opened its doors" in April 2019, its user-friendliness and novelty have won users' hearts, and now the new lifestyle of the pandemic has been an opportunity for it to garner even more attention.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Museum director Shinnosuke Konno (26) from Hachinohe, now resident in Tokyo, who launched the site, says, "I wanted to create a service that would allow anyone to enjoy art easily. I want people to come into contact with art, especially under such dire circumstances."</seg>
        <seg id="6">What surprises visitors to HASARD is the sheer abundance of exhibitions and the beauty of the images.</seg>
        <seg id="7">As of the 24th, there are a total of 14 exhibitions publicly available, including permanent exhibitions and special exhibitions, and the viewers are fascinated by the works in ultra-high-resolution that shows not just the coloring, but even the texture of the brush strokes.</seg>
        <seg id="8">With no member registration and no admittance fees required, it is distinctive because it is free not only for viewers but also for artists who want to hold individual exhibitions.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Also attracting attention is the way artworks are displayed, something which could only be achieved online.</seg>
        <seg id="10">One example of this is how the paintings are made to move.</seg>
        <seg id="11">"It Begins to Move Again," a permanent exhibition on Claude Monet, employs digital processing to make the clouds, flowers, and fields of grass move.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Stemming from the desire (of Director Konno) of "wanting to make it absorbing even for people with little interest in art," it can make you feel like you are inside the painting.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Director Konno was an elementary school student when he first discovered art.</seg>
        <seg id="14">When he and his family visited the Aomori Museum of Art, which had just been completed at the time, he saw the three giant paintings of Marc Chagall's Aleko and was shocked by their impressive impact.</seg>
        <seg id="15">From the very next day, his time in art class became fun, and even after he took admission to university as an opportunity to come to Tokyo, he developed a habit of visiting galleries.</seg>
        <seg id="16">At the same time, he felt that there were many people who have little opportunity to encounter art for a variety of reasons, like not having art museums nearby, or big exhibitions only being held in metropolitan areas, or being unable to go out because they're caring for children.</seg>
        <seg id="17">For that reason, while working at an IT-related company, he spent about two months launching a website where you can appreciate art online.</seg>
        <seg id="18">User numbers reached an average of 10,000 per month in the first 10 months after startup, and rose to about 30,000 after COVID-19 infections spread.</seg>
        <seg id="19">If anybody could enjoy art however they want, whenever they want to see it...</seg>
        <seg id="20">HASARD's aim resonated with even more people than expected because of the COVID-19 pandemic.</seg>
        <seg id="21">Director Konno emphasized that the significance of art appreciation is how it can enrich the imagination.</seg>
        <seg id="22">"If your imagination becomes enriched, you gain the ability to reach out to people who are suffering.</seg>
        <seg id="23">I want society to become better by bringer art closer to people," he says, expressing his thoughts.</seg>

        <seg id="2">There is an art museum where anyone can experience art for free whenever they want.</seg>
        <seg id="3">They range from famous painters such as Claude Monet and Gustav Klimt to unknown artists in Japan.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Since its opening in April 2019, the online art museum HASARD has attracted attention for its convenience and newness, and has become even more popular with a new way of life caused by the coronal disaster.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Shinnosuke Konno, 26, a representative from Hachinohe City who started the site, said, "I wanted to create a service that makes it easy for everyone to enjoy art. I want you to come into contact with art only under difficult circumstances."</seg>
        <seg id="6">When you visit Azar, you will be surprised by the abundance of exhibits and the beauty of the images.</seg>
        <seg id="7">As of 24th, a total of 14 permanent and special exhibitions have been exhibited, and ultra-high-resolution works that convey not only color but also the texture of the brush attract the eye.</seg>
        <seg id="8">There is no need for membership registration or admission, and not only the person who sees it but also the artist who wants to open a solo exhibition does not have to pay.</seg>
        <seg id="9">The way it looks unique to online also attracts attention.</seg>
        <seg id="10">One of them is to move the picture.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Claude Monet's permanent exhibition It Begins to Move Again is digitally processed to move clouds, flowers and grasslands.</seg>
        <seg id="12">"I want to be able to get in people who are not interested in art" (Konno representative), so you can feel like you are in a picture.</seg>

        <seg id="7">As of the 24th, a total of 14 permanent and special exhibitions have been opened to the public, and the ultra-high resolution works that convey not only the color but also the texture of the brush attract visitors.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Membership registration and admission fees are not required, and it is characterized by the fact that not only the viewer but also the artist who wants to hold a solo exhibition do not have to pay.</seg>
        <seg id="9">The way it is shown online is also attracting attention.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Moving the picture is one of them.</seg>
        <seg id="11">In Claude Monet's permanent exhibition, "It Starts Moving Again." clouds, flowers and grasslands are digitally processed to make them move.</seg>
        <seg id="12">"I want people who are not interested in art to be able to enter." Konno said, so you can feel like you are in a painting.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Konno first encountered art when he was in elementary school.</seg>
        <seg id="14">When I visited the newly completed Aomori Prefectural Museum of Art with my family at the time, I saw three huge paintings of Marc Chagall's "Aleko" and was shocked by their power.</seg>
        <seg id="15">The next day, art classes turned into a fun time, and even after moving to Tokyo on the occasion of going to university, he began to visit galleries and other places.</seg>
        <seg id="16">At the same time, I also felt that there were many people who did not have many opportunities to interact with art from various perspectives, such as the lack of museums nearby, large exhibitions being held only in the Tokyo metropolitan area, and the difficulty of going out due to childcare.</seg>
        <seg id="17">So, while working for an IT company, he spent about two months setting up a website where art can be viewed on the internet.</seg>
        <seg id="18">The number of users reached an average of 10,000 per month in the first 10 months, and increased to about 30,000 after the spread of the new coronavirus.</seg>
        <seg id="19">I hope that anyone can appreciate art in a free way when they want to see it.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Azar's aim was unexpectedly accepted by more people due to the corona crisis.</seg>
        <seg id="21">Speaking about the significance of art appreciation, Konno emphasized that it enriches the imagination.</seg>
        <seg id="22">"When you have a lot of imagination, you can reach out to people in need.</seg>
        <seg id="23">I hope that by making art more accessible, we can become a better society. "</seg>

        <seg id="7">そして、その2つの「物質 (経済・ビジネス) 」 と「精神」が合体した形として我々の目にはっきり見えるようになると思われるのが 、 「 中国品質から日本品質へ」の大きな流れである。</seg>
        <seg id="8">例えば、Tシャツやデジカメで不良・欠陥があれば腹立たしいことだが、購入した人の命には別条がない。</seg>

        <seg id="1">The simple reason the Age of Japanese Quality will come as the Age of Chinese Quality ends (Modern business) - Yahoo!News</seg>
        <seg id="2">With the pandemic, a change in values</seg>
        <seg id="3">A lot of predictions and debates are happening regarding the world after the pandemic.</seg>
        <seg id="4">In the realm of business, there is a possibility that the changes mentioned in the July 8 article, "In Japan "management" jobs are now starting to disappear...! The cruel truth" and the July 4 article "The reason "Japanese manufacturing" is looking like it will make a big come back in the "Post-covid" World" could occur.</seg>
        <seg id="5">(Photograph) The true form of "Japan's Strength" that only Japanese people do not know.... An unexpected reality in Asia</seg>
        <seg id="6">In addition, in the emotional arena it is thought that trends such as those in the June 26 article ""How to fully burnout" to send to those who have become aware of the end of life with corona," and the June 10 article, "With corona and riots rising, now is the time to reevaluate the effect of "only calling on the gods in times of hardship"" will become mainstream.</seg>
        <seg id="7">And what we can expect will become clearly visible to us with the combination of these two, "material (economy/business)" and "emotion," is a large shift "from Chinese quality to Japanese quality."</seg>
        <seg id="8">For example, if a T-shirt or a digital camera is inferior or defective, it is frustrating, but it does not put the consumer's life at stake.</seg>
        <seg id="9">In comparison, what has been a topic of attention recently is the unreliable quality of Chinese-made masks and ventilators... for products such as these, that are linked directly to life and safety, "Chinese quality" is deadly.</seg>
        <seg id="10">No matter how cheap they are no one can buy such products.</seg>
        <seg id="11">People will seek "Japanese quality" products even if it means paying a considerable price.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Of course this trend is not only arising in Japan.</seg>
        <seg id="13">The Western countries have fallen into a dire situation due to shortages of masks and medical equipment, yet even so it has become clear that they have had to return products time and time again due to inexcusably poor "Chinese quality."</seg>
        <seg id="14">Safety and Security over Price</seg>
        <seg id="15">Moreover, products such as automobiles are also products in which a defect can be fatal (deaths caused by vehicular accidents).</seg>
        <seg id="16">No matter how aggressive countries such as China, Korea and others are on this "you get what you pay for" bargain sale strategy, ultimately, they cannot stand up against Japan-made products, and the reason a situation like the one described in the June 6 article "Will it be a sole victory after all, and the world's car manufacturers bow down to Toyota?", will arise is because "Japanese quality" is strongly sought after for automobiles.</seg>
        <seg id="17">And this pandemic has given rise to thoughts about the necessity of "safety and security" in many other products as well.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Furthermore, safety and security are not only important in the "Japanese quality of manufacturing" but also the "Japanese quality of logistics and other services."</seg>
        <seg id="19">Such as the case with the toilet paper craze, even if there is sufficient production capacity, there are cases in which there are hold-ups at intermediate distribution stages and the product is not delivered.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Furthermore, as with the April 17 article "Who is the culprit behind the mask shortage! We will not tolerate the crisis opportunism of the Chinese Communist Party", it makes us keenly aware that Japan's domestic self-sufficiency is also an important component for "safety and security."</seg>
        <seg id="21">In an emergency it is natural for any country to prioritize their own nation, and it is very important to make the procurement of necessities such as masks (medical equipment) and food possible domestically.</seg>

        <seg id="7">And it is a big flow of "From Chinese quality to Japanese quality" that it seems that the two "materials (economy and business)" and "spirit" will be clearly visible to our eyes as a form that combines them.</seg>

        <seg id="15">In addition, products such as automobiles can also be fatal defects (death by accident).</seg>
        <seg id="16">No matter how much countries such as China and South Korea attack with the cheap selling strategy of "cheap or bad", after all it is not possible to compete with Japanese-made, and the article "After all, it wins by oneself, and the world's automobile manufacturers fall down to Toyota?" The the situation described in "Japan quality" is strongly required for the product named the car.</seg>
        <seg id="17">The pandemic also made many other products a wake-up time to the need for "security and security."</seg>
        <seg id="18">In addition, safety and security are important not only for "Japanese quality in manufacturing" but also for "Japanese quality in services such as logistics".</seg>
        <seg id="19">Like the toilet paper riot, even if the production capacity is proper, intermediate distribution may be stagnant and it may not reach you.</seg>
        <seg id="20">In addition, on April 17, "Who is the true culprit of the lack of masks!" As in the article "Don't allow fire robbers of the Chinese Communist Party administration", self-sufficiency in Japan was also an important element of "safety and security".</seg>
        <seg id="21">In the event of an emergency, it is important for any country to take precedence over its own country, and to be able to procure essentials such as masks (medical equipment) and food in its own country.</seg>

        <seg id="2">The white paint originally from Teflon-treated frying pans has been confirmed to enhance the cooling effect through insulation!</seg>
        <seg id="3">What an unexpected huge discovery!</seg>
        <seg id="4">This was a rainy season with notable amounts of rainfall not seen in previous years, and yet, as it lifts the fierce heat of summer intensifies.</seg>
        <seg id="5">The hot, hot days of scorching heat when even the air conditioner has no effect.... it's exhausting just thinking about it, isn't it?</seg>
        <seg id="6">Global warming is a worldwide problem, and humankind has racked its collective brain for how we can overcome the midsummer heat even slightly more comfortably.</seg>
        <seg id="7">One of those methods is to wear light white clothing.</seg>
        <seg id="8">There's no need to go out of your way to wear heat-absorbing black clothes in summer, right?</seg>
        <seg id="9">And it seems that the use of white paints is increasing by applying the same principle to the architecture of houses.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Though white may be white, there was the cutting-edge research whether there is yet something that could be made into a specialized paint that reflects even more light and absorbs even less heat.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Recently the Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) in collaboration with researchers from the Columbia University School of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics, announced that they have discovered a compounding method for a white paint that most efficiently reflects solar heat and boosts the effectiveness of cooling inside buildings.</seg>
        <seg id="12">They say they are striving for early implementation.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Up until now, the white paint with the highest rate of sunlight reflection was one that was made with titanium oxide and had a reflection rate of 85%.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Paints using titanium oxide are already being painted on the roofs of buildings in high-temperature environments, and are proving useful in blocking sunlight and raising air cooling efficiency.</seg>
        <seg id="15">However, what was newly discovered is a paint based in a fluororesin from none other than polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), which is used in those Teflon-treated frying pans.</seg>
        <seg id="16">It is thought that with paint that applies this Teflon effect, almost 98% of sunlight will be reflected and it will be possible to make a substantial cut in heat.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Even in the hot summer, with the unexpected paint that uses Teflon, inside there is no exposure to the intense heat and it is so comfortable!</seg>
        <seg id="18">Maybe such an age will come soon?</seg>
        <seg id="19">It seems like there are a lot of Japanese houses with dark-colored roofs, but maybe from now on white will become mainstream?</seg>

        <seg id="10">White was the latest research field, as it could not be made into a paint with properties that reflect more light and do not absorb heat, even if it was white.</seg>

        <seg id="12">It is said that it aims at the practical application at an early time.</seg>

        <seg id="1">A Critical Eye Cast Over Excessive Restrictions on Mobile Number Transfers</seg>
        <seg id="2">What will happen to fees and point allocation?</seg>
        <seg id="3">(Newswitch) - Yahoo! News</seg>
        <seg id="4">The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications is proceeding at full tilt in its decision to review the mobile number portability system (MNP), which makes it possible to use an old cell phone number as-is when changing mobile phone carriers.</seg>
        <seg id="5">At a meeting of experts on the 21st, they otulined the objective to revise the MNP guidelines, which were established in 2004.</seg>
        <seg id="6">The specific points at issue are wide-ranging, including the current state of MNP handling fees and the pros and cons of restrictions on those wishing to transfer.</seg>
        <seg id="7">With opposition expected from carriers, all eyes are on whether it will encourage healthy market competition.</seg>
        <seg id="8">It is a shady aspect of phone carriers, with unlimited mobile transfer still a long way away; when MNP was introduced in 2006, the fees customers had to pay was 2000 yen, but that has now risen to 3000 yen.</seg>
        <seg id="9">The amount of revenue the three major mobile phone carriers receive from MNP fees is estimated to exceed 15.9 billion annually.</seg>
        <seg id="10">On the 21st, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications enumerated the current circumstances surrounding MNP at the Working Group (WG) on Verification of Competition Rules, a panel of experts debating subjects like the competitive environment of the communications market.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Criticism was also levelled at the time period in which one can receive an MNP reservation number, which is necessary when a consumer transfers to another carrier.</seg>
        <seg id="12">The major carriers accept applications online, but due to circumstances such as core system operation, it is normal for applications to only be accepted between 9:00 and 20:00.</seg>
        <seg id="13">It was specified in the working group's documents that the direction of future considerations is that all-day support should be the norm.</seg>
        <seg id="14">It is also viewed as problematic that people who wish to transfer under the MNP are are bound to their mobile phone carrier through strategies such as points allocation schemes.</seg>
        <seg id="15">This comes from the judgment that excessive restrictions can only obstruct fair competition.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Partner Kita Shinichi of the Nomura Research Institute, who serves as a member of the working group, proposed, "Carriers should get customers' permission to take the time and explain the financial benefits they are offering, and those customers who do not consent should be immediately issued with MNP numbers and end it there. It is important to thoroughly ensure this process first."</seg>
        <seg id="17">However, among the series of points at issue with regard to MNP handling fees, it seems that structural problems lie ahead, as a source at the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications explains, "The more expensive they are, the harder it becomes to lose customers, so it's difficult to motivate carriers to lower them proactively."</seg>
        <seg id="18">There also are worries that if an operator emerges that takes the initiative to lower MNP handling fees, the number of users leaving that company will increase and its business efforts will not be rewarded.</seg>
        <seg id="19">The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications has also pointed out that in many countries overseas, carriers do not demand a fee from their customers for MNP, and it is thought that Japan could become that way as well.</seg>
        <seg id="20">The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications will consolidate the results of the working group in a report around September or October, and it is thought that they will want to begin procedures to revise the MNP guidelines thereafter.</seg>
        <seg id="21">If revisions are implemented, the timing will likely be in 2021 or thereafter.</seg>
        <seg id="22">This will likely cause mobile phone carriers to worry about issues including the state of sales and customer support.</seg>

        <seg id="11">The time required for consumers to move to other telecommunications companies is also listed as a way to accept MNP reservation numbers.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Major telecommunications companies accept it on the web, but due to the convenience of the operation of the core system, the main time zone is 9-20 o'm.</seg>
        <seg id="13">The WG materials clearly stated that the direction of future examinations is in principle to be all-day.</seg>
        <seg id="14">It is also a problem for mobile carriers to provide points to people who wish to move out at MNP.</seg>
        <seg id="15">It is determined that excessive restraint could impede fair competition.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Shunichi Kita, a partner at Nomura Research Institute, a member of the WG, said, "We will promptly issue a number to users who do not grant permission, whether they have time to explain the offer of economic benefits or obtain permission from the user. It is important to thoroughly implement this process first."</seg>
        <seg id="17">However, among the series of issues, the structural problem of MNP fees is that "the higher the price, the less likely it is for customers to leak out, so it is difficult to motivate them to actively lower it" (person in charge of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications).</seg>
        <seg id="18">If some operators take the lead in lowering MNP fees, there will be more customer outflows from the companies, and there will be concerns that corporate efforts will not pay off.</seg>
        <seg id="19">The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications also pointed out that many countries overseas do not require user-borne fees for MNP, and it is possible that this will be the case in Japan.</seg>
        <seg id="20">The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (D INTERNAL AFFAIRS) would like to compile the results of the WG as a report around September and October, and then begin the procedures for revising the MNP Guidelines.</seg>
        <seg id="21">The timing of the revision is likely to be after 21 years.</seg>

        <seg id="5">At a meeting of experts on the 21st, the government announced its policy to revise the MNP guidelines established in 2004.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Specific issues include the ideal way of MNP fees and whether or not to retain those who wish to move out.</seg>
        <seg id="7">As a backlash from telecommunications companies is expected, attention will be focused on whether it will lead to the promotion of healthy market competition.</seg>
        <seg id="8">At the beginning of 2006, when the dark MNP of telecommunications companies that are far from unlimited mobile phone transfers was introduced, the user burden fee was 2000 yen, but now it is 3000 yen.</seg>
        <seg id="9">The MNP fee income of the three major mobile communication companies is estimated to be 15.9 billion yen per year.</seg>
        <seg id="10">On the 21st, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications listed the current situation surrounding MNP at the Working Group on Verification of Competition Rules (WG), a meeting of experts to discuss the competitive environment of the telecommunications market.</seg>
        <seg id="11">The time required to issue an MNP reservation number when consumers move to another telecommunications company is also listed as a challenge.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Major telecommunications companies accept it on the web, but due to the convenience of operating the core system, the acceptance time is mainly from 9 to 20 o'clock.</seg>
        <seg id="13">The WG material clearly stated that all-day support will be the principle as the direction of future consideration.</seg>
        <seg id="14">It is also a problem for mobile communication companies to give points to people who wish to move out with MNP to retain them.</seg>
        <seg id="15">It is judged that excessive retention may hinder fair competition.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Shunichi Kita, a partner at Nomura Research Institute, who is a member of the WG, said, "We will either have time to explain the provision of economic benefits or obtain permission from the user, and promptly issue a number to users who do not permit it. It is important to thoroughly implement this process first."</seg>
        <seg id="17">However, among the series of issues, regarding MNP fees, there is a structural problem that "the higher the fee, the more difficult it is for customers to leak out, so it is difficult to motivate them to actively lower it" (person in charge of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications).</seg>
        <seg id="18">If there is a business that takes the initiative in lowering MNP fees, there is concern that the outflow of customers from that company will increase and corporate efforts will not be rewarded.</seg>
        <seg id="19">The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications has also pointed out that many countries overseas do not require user-borne fees for MNP, and it is possible that this will be the case in Japan.</seg>
        <seg id="20">The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications wants to compile the results of the WG as a report around September-October, and then start the procedure for revising the MNP guidelines.</seg>

        <seg id="6">US media outlets such as CBS Sports broke the news on the 22nd (23rd, Japan time).</seg>
        <seg id="7">Video: Betts shows off a wide range of abilities with the Red Sox!</seg>
        <seg id="8">He can also do some other amazing things besides baseball!</seg>
        <seg id="9">Betts made his major league debut in 2014 at the age of 21.</seg>
        <seg id="10">He played a central role in the Boston Red Sox's strong batting lineup, and also flourished as a right fielder with a powerful throw.</seg>
        <seg id="11">From 2015 up until last season, he was the quintessential intermediate-range batter, racking up more than 40 doubles every year.</seg>
        <seg id="12">In 2018, he became the world's number one with an average of .346, batting champion and MVP.</seg>
        <seg id="13">According to CBS Sports, last year, Betts rejected a 10-year offer from the Red Sox for 300 million dollars (approximately 32.1 billion yen).</seg>
        <seg id="14">During the off-season, the Red Sox traded Betts to the Dodgers together with ace left-handed pitcher, David Price, in exchange for cash considerations and multiple players.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Betts' contract for this season is 27 million dollars (approximately 2.9 billion yen) for the year.</seg>
        <seg id="16">His new contract is for 12 years, from the 2021 season to the 2032 season, and is reported to be worth a total of 365 million dollars (approximately 39.1 billion yen).</seg>
        <seg id="17">To date, the largest contract in major league baseball went to Mike Trout, centre fielder for the Los Angeles Angels, totalling 426 million dollars (approximately 45.6 billion yen) for 12 years.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Betts' latest contract will become the second largest amount after that.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Since Betts was due to become a free agent during this off-season period, it was inevitable that there would be a fierce battle to snap him up if he ever went on the market.</seg>
        <seg id="20">His contract follows the recent trend of tying players into long-term, big-money contracts before they become free agents.</seg>
        <seg id="21">This means that in the turbulent world of major league baseball, Betts has been granted some long-term stability.</seg>

        <seg id="4">A Health Hotto Seminar (organised by Saga Shimbun, co-hosted by Yonezawa Glasses) was held on the 25th at the Saga branch of Yonezawa Glasses in Shimodamachi, Saga city, to provide advice from experts on various health-related issues.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Dr Kinoshita Akio, the head of ophthalmology at Hiramatsu Hospital (Ogi city), explained about dry eye, cataracts, and other eye ailments that are closely related to daily life.</seg>
        <seg id="6">He explained that dry eye, known as a tear disease, is an illness where the quality of lachrymal secretion deteriorates so it is not evenly distributed over the surface of the eye.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Dr Kinoshita said that, "Contact lens users are about four times as likely to suffer from dry eye," urging caution to "try not to use them for long periods or to sleep with them in."</seg>
        <seg id="8">He suggested measures such as lowering computer screens to below eye level and humidifying rooms where air conditioners are running.</seg>
        <seg id="9">He also introduced nutrients and foods that can be effective against dry eye.</seg>
        <seg id="10">He said, "Omega-3, which is present in foods such as oily fish, can prevent the evaporation of lachrymal fluid, and mucin, which is present in large amounts in natto and okra, can improve the quality of lachrymal fluid."</seg>
        <seg id="11">With regard to cataract surgery, he also touched on the monofocal and multifocal types of intraocular lenses inserted instead of crystalline lenses and the differences in visual performance between them.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Approximately 40 people participated in the seminar.</seg>
        <seg id="13">The seminar was split into two small group sessions, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, as a measure to prevent the spread of COVID-19, attendees also had their temperature taken and sanitised their hands before entering, and the venue was kept sufficiently ventilated.</seg>

        <seg id="2">National Route 152 was subject to a total road closure, with lines of vehicles waiting to take the detour, where one side of the road was closed and traffic could only pass at alternate intervals: At Tatsuyamacho, Tenryu ward, Hamamatsu City, on the afternoon of the 22nd (Photo partially altered)</seg>
        <seg id="3">July's heavy rains caused severe damage in Kyushu and other parts of Japan, and even in Shizuoka prefecture, the Tenryu area of Hamamatsu city was particularly affected.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Landslides have affected National Route 152, a major road, and the JR Iida Line, many people's daily mode of transport, and many places still need time for recovery.</seg>
        <seg id="5">It has not only been an inconvenience in the lives of local residents, but has also caused worries about the negative impact on economic activity.</seg>
        <seg id="6">During the day, there are long lines of vehicles waiting to cross Sejiri Bridge, which spans the Tenryu River in the Tatsuyamacho part of the city.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Vehicles at the front had been stopped for close to 40 minutes.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Approximately 10km of National Route 152 has been subject to a total road closure, necessitating a detour to the opposite bank of the Tenryu River in order to be able to get around town.</seg>
        <seg id="9">However, the road is narrow and, along the whole section, traffic can only pass on one side at alternate intervals, so waiting times are unpredictable.</seg>
        <seg id="10">In the town, a landslide occured on the National Highway on the 9th, and the road was closed due to the risk of falling rocks from the nearby slope.</seg>
        <seg id="11">On the 13th, cracks were found in Akiba tunnel, which is within the town's jurisdiction, but no estimates have yet been made as to when it will reopen to traffic.</seg>
        <seg id="12">The town also saw the closure of the National Highway in 2018 due to landslides, negatively impacting local life and tourism.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Tamamoto Kimie (76), CEO of the Dragon Mama Food Processing Plant, which sells local specialities, said wistfully, "We've been dealt another blow at a time when we've already lost a lot of business due to COVID-19. The number of customers has dropped significantly."</seg>
        <seg id="14">Due to the collapsed bank beside the railroad track, the JR Iida Line has been cut off between Misakubo Station (in the ward's Misakubocho town) and Hiraoka Station (Nagano prefecture).</seg>
        <seg id="15">Ukai Shiori (16), who was commuting to Shizuoka Prefecture Hamamatsukohoku High School Sakuma Branch, in the ward's Sakuma town, via Ozore Station (in the same town), which is in the cut-off section, now needs to be dropped off and picked up by car, about an hour each way.</seg>
        <seg id="16">"Going by car is a big burden on my parents and on me," she says, hoping for early recovery.</seg>
        <seg id="17">According to JR Central, they anticipate that it will take about three months to reopen the section of track, and, starting from the 27th, there will be a special train service making round trips between Misakubocho Station and Ozore Station, with one train in the morning and in the evening on weekdays.</seg>
        <seg id="18">In Misakubocho, where forest roads also serve as roads for people's daily coming and going, landslides are a frequent occurrence.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Detours can sometimes take several hours.</seg>
        <seg id="20">The Misakubo Forestry Association Chairman Keiji Kumagai (69) commented with a gloomy expression, "Log removal is delayed too. There are isolated places all over, like islands. I'm worried about future rains."</seg>

        <seg id="4">According to a source at the Yamagata Meteorological Observatory, both the solar halo and the circumhorizontal arc result from sunlight hitting fine ice crystals within a cloud and being bent or reflected.</seg>
        <seg id="5">A normal rainbow can be seen when the sun is behind you, but a peculiar feature of a circumhorizontal arc is that it appears in the same direction that the sun is in.</seg>
        <seg id="6">While solar halos are a relatively common occurrence, circumhorizontal arcs do not appear anywhere near as frequently.</seg>

        <seg id="2">Are their husbands happy? Or are they discontent?</seg>
        <seg id="3">I'm sure we all know someone who is surprised or angry when their husband complains that they're low on spending money this month?</seg>
        <seg id="4">This kind of conversation occur in households where the wife is in charge of the household finances.</seg>
        <seg id="5">But in what percentage of households do wives hold the purse strings in today's society?</seg>
        <seg id="6">We'll also take a look at the proportion of households in which husbands and wives handle their finances separately, and the proportion in which they jointly manage their finances.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Who is in charge of household finances?</seg>
        <seg id="8">Matsui Securities conducted an online survey of 800 married couples across the country - 400 young couples in their 20s-30s who have been married for up to 3 years, and 400 middle-aged couples in their 50s-60s who have been married for 30 years or more - on the subject of the management of household finances among married couples (results announced in June of 2020), from which the following findings were made.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Who is in charge of household finances?</seg>
        <seg id="10">Wife: 45.0%, husband: 24.8% - the finding was that households where the wife is in charge of the household finances are the most common.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Managing the household finances can be complicated whoever is in charge, but it seems that it can lead to a range of different episodes.</seg>
        <seg id="12">When the wife manages the household finances: take the case of A-san, a working mother around 50 who has two daughters, a freshman and a senior, in high school.</seg>
        <seg id="13">A-san is in full control of the household finances.</seg>
        <seg id="14">As her eldest was preparing to take university entrance exams, the exam prep centre fees racked up, resulting in more than a few months in the red, so A-san discussed reducing her husband's spending money, which he naturally resisted.</seg>
        <seg id="15">At that time, A-san's husband asked to see what their income and expenditures were, so A-san showed him the household accounting book.</seg>
        <seg id="16">All the expenses should have been recorded, but when they checked the household accounting book, there was not enough to cause them to go into the red.</seg>
        <seg id="17">A-san's husband said, "We have enough," and almost managed to get his way, so A-san impulsively declared, "Okay, I'm in over my head managing the household finances, so can you please handle everything," which led her husband to say, "I think I'll leave it to you after all."</seg>
        <seg id="18">When quizzed about this later, A-san's husband told her, "Although it's true that I'm not happy with the way that my spending money is controlled, to be honest, I don't have the time or energy to manage the various household expenses (for instance expenses for school supplies and PTA expenses)."</seg>
        <seg id="19">When the husband manages the household finances: B-san, a full-time housewife, is given living expenses by her husband, on which she has to get by every day.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Last spring, the freezer section of the refrigerator broke, so B-san asked her husband to buy a new fridge.</seg>
        <seg id="21">However, her husband was reluctant to buy a new one, saying, "It's still fine to use, only the freezer part is broken."</seg>
        <seg id="22">However, when the summer came round, B-san's husband apparently wanted to be able to eat ice cream whenever he fancied and decided that maybe they should buy a new fridge after all.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Recounting the episode to a friend, B-san complained that her husband is "stingy with a capital S".</seg>
