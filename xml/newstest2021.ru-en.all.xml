        <seg id="1">Семиларски против прокуратуры: кассацию бывшего вице-мэра Тарту рассмотрят 4 августа</seg>
        <seg id="2">Это означает, что решение по ней, скорее всего, будет вынесено в начале сентября.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Суды двух первых инстанций рассматривать иск Семиларски отказались, но на в апреле его кассационную жалобу принял в производство Государственный суд.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Тартуский административный суд 12 декабря 2019 года вернул жалобу заявителю, поскольку ее разрешение не входит в его компетенцию административного суда.</seg>
        <seg id="5">В постановлении суда указывалось, что жалоба содержит требование о возмещении ущерба, причиненного в ходе уголовного производства.</seg>
        <seg id="6">"Регулировать такие вопросы должны прокуратура и уездный суд", - ранее пояснила корреспонденту ERR пресс-секретарь Тартуских судов Анетт Крейтсманн.</seg>
        <seg id="7">По ее словам, Валво Семиларски обжаловал это постановление в окружном суде, который 5 февраля не изменил решение суда первой инстанции.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Теперь свое слово должен будет сказать Госсуд.</seg>
        <seg id="9">По словам защитника Семиларски, присяжного адвоката Оливера Няэса, его клиент около двух лет необоснованно находился под подозрением во взяточничестве.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Теперь он требует от прокуратуры опровергнуть неверные утверждения в свой адрес и возместить ему моральный ущерб.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Причиной для подачи жалобы в суд стали заявления прокурора по особым делам Лыунаской окружной прокуратуры Маргуса Гросса, сделанные им в октябре 2017 года, когда Семиларски вместе с другим на тот момент вице-мэром Тарту Артемом Суворовым был задержан по подозрению в совершении нескольких преступлений.</seg>
        <seg id="12">"Напомним, что когда меня задержали, Полиция безопасности и прокуратура немедленно организовали пресс-конференцию и проинформировали всю Эстонскую Республику о том, что руководители Тарту - одного из самых влиятельных органов местных самоуправлений - являются продажными.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Эти висевшие в воздухе публичные подозрения сопровождали меня около двух лет.</seg>
        <seg id="14">А теперь, когда эти утверждения и подозрения оказались ложными, прокуратура ничего не хочет об этом говорить", - комментировал Семиларски в начале августа 2019 года.</seg>
        <seg id="15">По словам Оливера Няэса, на пресс-конференции прокурор вышел за пределы правовых рамок, в которых должна действовать прокуратура.</seg>
        <seg id="16">"Утверждение о взятках и продажности оказалось ложным, но это не единственная проблема здесь.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Европейский суд по правам человека, например, неоднократно подчеркивал в своих постановлениях по России, а также по Литве, что на этапе следствия представители государства должны быть осторожны при выборе слов, чтобы подозреваемые не были бы представлены в роли преступников до вынесения приговора.</seg>
        <seg id="18">К этому прокуратуру обязывает и презумпция невиновности, которая, к сожалению, не была соблюдена в этом деле против Валво Семиларски", - сказал Няэс.</seg>
        <seg id="19">"Публичное представление Семиларски в качестве серьезного правонарушителя и взяточника в обстоятельствах, когда факты, лежащие в основе подозрения во взяточничестве, все еще выясняются, является неприемлемым, что противоречит презумпции невиновности и несправедливо по отношению к заявителю", - добавил адвокат.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Как писал rus.err.ee, бывшего вице-мэра Тарту Валво Семиларски не будут привлекать к ответственности по обвинению во взяточничестве - возбужденное против него уголовное дело в июле было частично закрыто.</seg>
        <seg id="21">В то же время бывшего чиновника судят по обвинению в сознательном нарушении антикоррупционного законодательства при проведении сделок в особо крупных размерах.</seg>
        <seg id="22">Согласно обвинительному заключению, в период с 2015 по 2017 год бывший заместитель мэра Тарту более тридцати раз участвовал в заседаниях городской управы при вынесении решений, связанных с действующими в Тарту компаниями, с владельцами или руководителями которых Семиларски активно общался на личном уровне во внерабочее время.</seg>
        <seg id="23">По словам Гросса, во всех этих случаях у Семиларски были личные интересы, а потому он должен был отстраниться от участия в принятии решений.</seg>
        <seg id="24">Ранее, как писал rus.err.ee, прокуратура предъявила Семиларски подозрения в получении взятки и нарушении антикоррупционного законодательства при проведении сделок в особо крупных размерах.</seg>
        <seg id="25">Это произошло в октябре 2016 года, когда он был задержан вместе с другим заместителем мэра Артемом Суворовым (Центристская партия).</seg>
        <seg id="26">Тогда прокуратура и Полиция безопасности заявили, что против обоих вице-мэров имеются веские доказательства.</seg>
        <seg id="27">После этого оба чиновника подали в отставку.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Дело Суворова позднее дошло до суда, который полностью оправдал политика.</seg>
        <seg id="29">Судебное следствие по делу Валво Семиларски пока продолжается.</seg>

        <seg id="1">Semilarski vs the prosecutor's office: Tartu former deputy mayor's appeal will be considered on August 4</seg>
        <seg id="2">This means that a decision on the matter will, most likely, be delivered at the start of September.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Judges from the two courts of first instance refused to consider the claim, but in April, his cassation appeal was taken up by the State Court.</seg>
        <seg id="4">On December 12, 2019, the Tartu administrative court returned the complaint to the applicant, as it did not fall within the competence of the administrative court.</seg>
        <seg id="5">The court's decision stated that the complaint contains demands for compensation for damages incurred during criminal proceedings.</seg>
        <seg id="6">"The prosecutor's office and district court should deal with these issues," Annett Kreitsmann, press secretary for the Tartu Courts, told ERR previously.</seg>
        <seg id="7">According to her, Valvo Semilarski appealed this ruling to the district court, which on February 5 declined to overturn the ruling of the court of first instance.</seg>
        <seg id="8">The State Court now has to make its statement.</seg>
        <seg id="9">According to Semilarski's lawyer, sworn attorney Oliver Naas, his client has been unjustifiably under suspicion of bribe-taking for about two years.</seg>
        <seg id="10">He is now demanding that the prosecutor's office refute its incorrect statements about himself and compensate him for moral damages.</seg>
        <seg id="11">The reason for submitting the complaint to the court was an announcement by the prosecutor for special cases of the Louna District Prosecutor's Office Margus Gross, made by him in October 2017, when Semilarski together with another Tartu deputy mayor, Artjom Suvorov, were held on suspicion of committing several crimes.</seg>
        <seg id="12">"I remember that when they held me, the security police and prosecutor's office immediately organized a press conference and informed all of Estonia that the leadership of Tartu – one of the most influential local governments – was corrupt.</seg>
        <seg id="13">These groundless public allegations have been following me for about two years.</seg>
        <seg id="14">And now, when these assertions and allegations turned out to be false, the prosecutor's office wants to say nothing about it," said Semilarski at the beginning of August 2019.</seg>
        <seg id="15">According to Oliver Naas, the prosecutor's press conference stepped outside legal bounds that the prosecutor's office should remain within.</seg>
        <seg id="16">"The assertions of bribe-taking and corruption turned out to be false, but that is not the only problem here.</seg>
        <seg id="17">The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly stressed in its rulings on Russia, as well as Latvia, that at this stage of investigations, government representatives should be careful with their choice of words, so that suspects will not be portrayed as criminals prior to the issuing of a verdict.</seg>
        <seg id="18">The prosecutor's office is obliged to support the presumption of innocence, which was not followed in the case against Valvo Semilarski, said Naas.</seg>
        <seg id="19">"Semilarski's public representation as a serious lawbreaker and bribe-taker in circumstances when the facts that formed the basis of the suspicions of bribe-taking were still being clarified is unacceptable, it contradicts the presumption of innocence and is unfair fo the claimant," added the lawyer.</seg>
        <seg id="20">According to russ.err.ee the former deputy mayor of Tartu, Valvo Semilarski, will not be charged with bribe-taking – the case that was brought against him in July has been partially closed.</seg>
        <seg id="21">Meanwhile, the former civil servant is being tried on charges of knowingly violating anti-corruption laws when conducting transactions of an especially large scale.</seg>
        <seg id="22">According to the criminal indictment, from 2015 to 2017, the former Tartu deputy mayor took part more than 30 times in meetings of the city council while it made decisions concerning companies operating in Tartu, the owners or managers of which Semilarski actively communicated with on a personal level outside of office hours.</seg>
        <seg id="23">According to Gross, in all these cases Semilarski had a personal interest, and as such he should have withdrawn from participation in making decisions.</seg>
        <seg id="24">As wrote rus.err.ee, the prosecutor's office earlier set forth their suspicions of Semilarski's bribe-taking and violating anticorruption laws in conducting transactions of especially large scale.</seg>
        <seg id="25">This took place in October 2016, when he was held together with another deputy mayor Artjom Suvorov (Center Party).</seg>
        <seg id="26">At the time, the prosecutor's office and Security Police announced that they had compelling evidence against both deputy mayors.</seg>
        <seg id="27">Following that both civil servants stepped down.</seg>
        <seg id="28">The case against Suvorov later went to court, which completely acquitted him on all charges.</seg>
        <seg id="29">The judicial inquiry in the case against Valvo Semilarski is currently continuing.</seg>

        <seg id="2">This means that a decision on it will, most likely, be made in the beginning of September.</seg>
        <seg id="3">The first two court instances declined to examine Semilarski's case, but in the beginning of April the Federal Court took up his cassation appeal.</seg>
        <seg id="4">On December 12, 2019, the Tartu administrative court returned the appeal to the appellant, as the decision was not within the purvey of the administrative court.</seg>
        <seg id="5">In its decision, the court indicated that the appeal contained demands for the compensation of damages incurred during the course of the criminal proceedings.</seg>
        <seg id="6">"The prosecutor and the circuit court should handle these issues," press secretary of Tartu courts Anett Kreitsmann earlier explained to ERR's correspondent.</seg>
        <seg id="7">According to Kreitsmann, Valvo Semilarski contested the decision in the district court which, on February 5th, did not alter the decision of the first-instance court.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Now the Federal Court will have to voice its opinion.</seg>
        <seg id="9">According to Semilarski's defense attorney, sworn attorney Oliver Nääs, for about two years his client was groundlessly under suspicion of taking bribes.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Now he demands that the prosecutor reverse the false assertions that were directed at him and compensate him for moral damages.</seg>
        <seg id="11">The reason for the court appeal was statements made by the prosecutor in the special cases of the Lyuna district prosecutor Margus Gross, which were made by him on October 2017, when Semilarski was arrested along with the other Taru deputy mayor at the time, Artjom Suvorov, under suspicion of committing several crimes .</seg>
        <seg id="12">"We'd like to remind you that, when I was arrested, the Security Police and the prosecutor quickly organized a press conference and informed the entire Republic of Estonia that administrators of Tartu, one of the most influential organs of local governance, were corrupt.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Those public suspicions that were left hanging in the air dogged me for about two years.</seg>
        <seg id="14">And now, when these assertions and suspicions turned out to be false, the prosecutor doesn't want to say anything about it," Semilarski commented in the beginning of August 2019.</seg>

        <seg id="17">The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has stressed more than once in its decisions regarding Russia, and also Lithuania, that during the stage of investigation government representatives should be careful in choosing their words, so that suspects are not presented as criminals until a judgement is made.</seg>
        <seg id="18">The prosecutor is also obliged to this by presumed innocence, which, unfortunately, was not observed in the case against Valvo Semilarski," Nääs said.</seg>
        <seg id="19">"Semilarski's presentation to the public as a serious violator of the law and bribe taker under circumstances when the facts laying at the base of the suspicion of bribe-taking were still being determined, is unacceptable, contradicts the presumption of innocence, and is unfair to the appellant," the attorney added.</seg>
        <seg id="20">rus.err.ee wrote that Tartu ex-deputy mayor Valvo Semilarski will not be brought to court on accusations of bribery—the criminal case made against him in June was partially closed.</seg>
        <seg id="21">Meanwhile, the former government official is being tried for accusations of intentional violation of anticorruption laws when conducting deals of an especially large size.</seg>
        <seg id="22">According to the letter of accusation, during the period of 2015–2017 on more than thirteen occasions the Tartu ex-deputy mayor participated in city administration meetings regarding the carrying-out of decisions relating to companies doing business in Tartu, the owners and managers of which Semilarski corresponded with personally during hours outside of work.</seg>
        <seg id="23">According to Gross, Semilarski had personal interests involved in all these cases, and for this reason should have avoided participating in the decision-making process.</seg>
        <seg id="24">Earlier, rus.err.ee wrote that the prosecutor put forward suspicions of Semilarski in the taking of bribes and the violation of anti-corruption laws when conducting deals of an especially large size.</seg>

        <seg id="1">Semilarski v. Prosecutor's Office: Former Vice Mayor of Tartu's cassation to be considered on August 4</seg>
        <seg id="2">That means a ruling on it is likely to be handed down in early September.</seg>
        <seg id="3">The two first courts to hear Semilarski's claim refused, but in April, his cassation complaint was taken into action by the State Court.</seg>
        <seg id="4">The Tartu Administrative Court returned the complaint to the complainant on December 12, 2019, because its permission was not within its jurisdiction of the administrative court.</seg>
        <seg id="5">The court order stated that the complaint included a claim for damages caused in criminal proceedings.</seg>
        <seg id="6">“The prosecutor's office and county court should regulate such matters,” Anette Creutsmann, a spokeswoman for the Tartu courts, previously explained to ERR.</seg>
        <seg id="7">She said Valvo Semilarski appealed the ruling to the District Court, which on February 5 did not change the trial court's decision.</seg>
        <seg id="8">The State Court will now have to say its word.</seg>
        <seg id="9">His client had been unreasonably under suspicion of bribery for about two years, according to Semilarski's defense attorney, sworn attorney Oliver Näes.</seg>
        <seg id="10">He now requires the prosecutor's office to refute incorrect allegations against its own and pay him for moral damages.</seg>
        <seg id="11">The reason for filing the complaint to the court was the statements made by the Liuna District Prosecutor's Office of Special Cases, Margus Gross, made by him in October 2017, when Semilarski along with another at that time Tartu Vice Mayor Artem Suvorov was detained on suspicion of several crimes.</seg>
        <seg id="12">“When I was detained, the Security Police and the Prosecutor's Office immediately organized a press conference and informed the entire Republic of Estonia that the leaders of Tartu are one of the most influential local governments - are saleable.</seg>
        <seg id="13">These hung public suspicions in the air accompanied me for about two years.</seg>
        <seg id="14">And now that these allegations and suspicions have been proven to be false, the prosecutor's office doesn't want to say anything about it,” Semilarski commented in early August 2019.</seg>
        <seg id="15">At a news conference, the prosecutor went beyond the legal framework in which the prosecutor's office should operate, Oliver Näes said.</seg>
        <seg id="16">'The claim of bribes and sales has been proven false, but that's not the only problem here.</seg>
        <seg id="17">The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly stressed in its rulings on Russia as well as Lithuania that during the investigation phase, state representatives must be careful when choosing words so that suspects would not be represented in the role of criminals before sentencing.</seg>
        <seg id="18">To this, the prosecutor's office also obliges the presumption of innocence, which unfortunately was not observed in this case against Valvo Semilarski,” Näes said.</seg>
        <seg id="19">“The public representation of Semilarski as a serious offender and briber in circumstances where the facts behind the suspicion of bribery are still being elucidated is unacceptable, which is contrary to the presumption of innocence and unfair to the complainant,” the lawyer added.</seg>
        <seg id="20">As rus.err.ee wrote, former Tartu Vice Mayor Valvo Semilarski will not be prosecuted on bribery charges - the criminal case against him in July was partially closed.</seg>
        <seg id="21">At the same time, the former official is being tried on charges of knowingly violating anti-corruption laws while carrying out transactions in particularly large amounts.</seg>
        <seg id="22">According to the indictment, between 2015 and 2017, the former deputy mayor of Tartu attended city department meetings more than thirty times in making decisions related to incumbents in Tartu companies whose owners or executives Semilarski actively communicated on a personal level during after-hours hours.</seg>
        <seg id="23">According to Gross, in all of these cases, Semilarski had personal interests, and therefore he had to be suspended from taking part in decision-making.</seg>
        <seg id="24">Earlier, rus.err.ee wrote, the prosecutor's office had raised Semilarski suspicions of taking a bribe and violating anti-corruption laws in particularly large transactions.</seg>
        <seg id="25">This happened in October 2016, when he was detained along with another deputy mayor, Artem Suvorov (Centrist Party).</seg>
        <seg id="26">The prosecutor's office and Security Police then said there was strong evidence against both vice mayors.</seg>
        <seg id="27">Both officials then resigned.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Suvorov's case later reached the court, which fully vindicated the politician.</seg>
        <seg id="29">The trial investigation of Valvo Semilarski is still ongoing.</seg>

        <seg id="2">This means that a decision on it is likely to be made in early September.</seg>
        <seg id="3">The courts of the first two instances refused to consider Semilarski's claim, but in April his cassation appeal was accepted by the Supreme Court.</seg>
        <seg id="4">On 12 December 2019, the Tartu Administrative Court returned the complaint to the applicant, as its resolution was not within its competence of the Administrative Court.</seg>
        <seg id="5">The court's ruling stated that the complaint contained a claim for compensation for damage caused in the course of criminal proceedings.</seg>
        <seg id="6">"Such matters should be regulated by the prosecutor's office and the county court," Tartu Courts spokeswoman Anette Kreitsmann previously told ERR.</seg>
        <seg id="7">According to her, Valvo Semilarski appealed this decision to the district court, which on February 5 did not change the decision of the court of first instance.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Now the State Court will have to say its word.</seg>
        <seg id="9">According to Semilarski's lawyer, a sworn lawyer Oliver Nyaes, his client was unreasonably suspected of bribery for about two years.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Now he demands from the prosecutor's office to refute the incorrect allegations against him and compensate him for moral damage.</seg>
        <seg id="11">The reason for filing a complaint with the court was the statements of the Prosecutor for Special Cases of the Lüuna District Prosecutor's Office Margus Gross, made by him in October 2017, when Semilarski, together with another at that time Vice-Mayor of Tartu Artem Suvorov, was detained on suspicion of committing several crimes.</seg>
        <seg id="12">"Recall that when I was detained, the Security Police and the Prosecutor's Office immediately organized a press conference and informed the whole Republic of Estonia that the leaders of Tartu - one of the most influential local government bodies - are corrupt.</seg>

        <seg id="16">"The allegation of bribery and venality has proven to be false, but that's not the only problem here.</seg>
        <seg id="17">The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly stressed in its rulings on Russia as well as lithuania that during the investigation phase, state representatives must be careful when choosing words so that suspects are not presented as criminals before sentencing.</seg>

        <seg id="6">(Смех) Начну я с парадокса.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Тут показана продолжительность жизни в зависимости от ВНД, или же средний уровень благосостояния стран.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Видно, что страны справа, такие как Норвегия и США, в два раза богаче Израиля, Греции и Португалии слева.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Но это совершенно не влияет на продолжительность жизни.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Нет никаких намёков на взаимосвязь.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Но внутри обществ заметны сильные градации в состоянии здоровья, затрагивающие все социальные слои.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Снова средняя продолжительность жизни.</seg>
        <seg id="13">График относится к небольшим территориям Англии и Уэльса: самые бедные — справа, самые богатые — слева.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Огромная разница между бедными и всеми остальными.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Даже те, что чуть беднее самых богатых, уже менее здоровы, чем самая верхушка.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Таким образом, доход очень важен внутри наших обществ, но не между ними.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Объяснение этому парадоксу таково: внутри наших обществ мы смотрим на относительный доход или социальную позицию, статус — на каком уровне мы по отношению к окружающим, и каковы дистанции между нами.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Поняв эту идею, вы сразу задумаетесь: что случится при увеличении разницы или её сжатии, иными словами, делая разницу в доходах больше или меньше?</seg>
        <seg id="19">Сейчас я это вам покажу.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Все используемые данные абсолютно реальны.</seg>
        <seg id="21">Я беру информацию ООН, такая же есть у Всемирного банка: масштаб различий в доходах в этих богатых и развитых рыночных демократиях.</seg>
        <seg id="22">Показатель, использованный нашей командой, очень прост, вы можете его скачать. Мы считаем разницу между 20% самых богатых и 20% самых бедных граждан в каждой стране.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Смотрите, в равных странах слева, в Японии, Финляндии, Норвегии и Швеции, богатые 20% в 3,5-4 раза богаче 20% бедных.</seg>
        <seg id="24">Но в неравных странах, в Великобритании, Португалии, США и Сингапуре, разница больше в два раза!</seg>
        <seg id="25">Согласно этим измерениям мы в два раза менее равны на фоне других успешных демократических государств.</seg>
        <seg id="26">А сейчас вы увидите, какое влияние это оказывает на общество.</seg>
        <seg id="27">Мы собрали статистические данные по социальным проблемам, более частым среди бедных слоёв населения.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Это сравнимые на международном уровне данные по продолжительности жизни, уровню грамотности и математической подготовки детей, смертности новорождённых, уровню убийств, количеству заключённых, подростковой беременности, уровню доверия, ожирению, психическим заболеваниям, которые, согласно стандартной диагностической классификации, включают в себя наркотическую и алкогольную зависимости, и наконец, данные по социальной мобильности.</seg>
        <seg id="29">Мы поместили это все в один индекс.</seg>
        <seg id="30">Все они имеют одинаковую важность.</seg>
        <seg id="31">Страна же является, своего рода, средним значением этих данных.</seg>
        <seg id="32">Вы видите страны в отношении показателя неравенства, который был показан в самом начале. Я буду возвращаться к нему снова и снова по ходу презентации.</seg>
        <seg id="33">Неравные страны в целом имеют больше сложностей со всеми этими социальными проблемами.</seg>
        <seg id="34">Это необычайно тесная связь. Вы видите, что корреляция необычайно высока.</seg>
        <seg id="35">Но если посмотреть на тот же индекс здоровья и социальных проблем по отношению к ВНП на душу населения, на Валовый Национальный Доход, никакой корреляции уже нет.</seg>
        <seg id="36">Мы немного волновались, что люди подумают, что мы подбирали проблемы под наши аргументы и просто «подогнали» доказательства. Поэтому мы также написали статью в Британский медицинский журнал об индексе детского благополучия ЮНИСЕФ.</seg>
        <seg id="37">Индекс состоит из 40 разных частей, собранных разными людьми воедино.</seg>
        <seg id="38">Среди критериев:, наличие книжек дома, возможность детей разговаривать с родителями, уровень иммунизации, наличие в школе издевательств.</seg>
        <seg id="39">Туда входит всё.</seg>
        <seg id="40">А вот это всё на фоне того же показателя неравенства.</seg>
        <seg id="41">Ситуация у детей хуже в неравных обществах.</seg>
        <seg id="42">И это статистически значимая взаимосвязь.</seg>
        <seg id="43">Но опять же, если посмотреть на уровень детского благополучия в отношении к национальному доходу на душу населения, то взаимосвязи нет, никакого намёка.</seg>
        <seg id="44">Все продемонстрированные данные говорят об одном:</seg>
        <seg id="45">в среднем, благосостояние наших обществ больше не зависит от национального дохода и экономического роста.</seg>
        <seg id="46">Они крайне важны в бедных странах, но не в развитом мире.</seg>
        <seg id="47">Разница между нами, и наше положение на фоне других — вот что имеет огромное значение.</seg>
        <seg id="48">Покажу вам фрагменты нашего индекса.</seg>
        <seg id="49">Вот, например, доверие.</seg>
        <seg id="50">Это часть населения, которая соглашается с тем, что большинству людей можно доверять.</seg>
        <seg id="51">Данные взяты из Всемирного исследования ценностей.</seg>
        <seg id="52">Вот, смотрите, в неравных странах только 15% населения доверяет другим.</seg>
        <seg id="53">А в равных обществах эта цифра достигает 60-65%.</seg>
        <seg id="54">Если вы посмотрите на измерения активности общественной деятельности, или социального капитала, то заметите очень похожие соотношения, тесно связанные с неравенством.</seg>
        <seg id="55">Можно сказать, мы проделали работу дважды.</seg>
        <seg id="56">Сначала мы проанализировали развитые страны, а затем в качестве контрольного исследования мы повторили процедуру на 50 американских штатах, задавая один вопрос: обстоят ли дела хуже по всем нашим показателям в наиболее неравных штатах?</seg>
        <seg id="57">Вот доверие по отношению к неравенству, согласно общему социальному исследованию федерального правительства.</seg>
        <seg id="58">Очень схожий разброс, по сравнению с аналогичным диапазоном уровней доверия.</seg>
        <seg id="59">Та же история.</seg>
        <seg id="60">В целом, мы обнаружили, что почти всё, что связано с доверием на международном уровне проявляется так же в нашем контрольном исследовании.</seg>
        <seg id="61">Это не просто совпадение.</seg>
        <seg id="62">Вот график психических заболеваний.</seg>
        <seg id="63">ВОЗ, при помощи идентичных диагностических интервью, проведённых на случайных выборках населения, собрало результаты, которые позволяют нам сравнить уровень психических заболеваний в каждом из обществ.</seg>
        <seg id="64">Вот тут показан процент населения, страдавшего от какой-либо психической болезни в прошлом году.</seg>
        <seg id="65">Цифры начинаются с примерно 8% и поднимаются до почти 24%; целые общества с трёхкратным уровнем психологических заболеваний.</seg>
        <seg id="66">И опять же, это тесно связано с неравенством.</seg>
        <seg id="67">А вот тут преступления.</seg>
        <seg id="68">Эти красные точки показывают американские штаты, а голубые треугольники — канадские провинции.</seg>
        <seg id="69">Но посмотрите на масштаб различий.</seg>
        <seg id="70">Начинается с 15 убийств на миллион и доходит до 150.</seg>
        <seg id="71">Это — пропорция заключённых.</seg>
        <seg id="72">Речь идёт о десятикратной разнице, выраженной в логарифмической шкале.</seg>
        <seg id="73">Цифры возрастают от 40 до 400 по количеству заключённых в тюрьмах.</seg>
        <seg id="74">Эти взаимосвязи не объясняются просто более высокой преступностью.</seg>
        <seg id="75">Да, в некоторых случаях это отчасти так.</seg>
        <seg id="76">Но в большинстве своём они связаны с более жёсткими приговорами.</seg>
        <seg id="77">Неравные общества чаще выступают за сохранение смертной казни.</seg>
        <seg id="78">Здесь показан процент детей, бросающих школу.</seg>
        <seg id="79">Опять же, довольно большая разница.</seg>
        <seg id="80">Она невероятно вредоносная, если речь идёт об использовании талантов.</seg>
        <seg id="81">А вот — социальная мобильность.</seg>
        <seg id="82">Это измерение мобильности в зависимости от дохода.</seg>
        <seg id="83">В основном речь идёт о следующем: имеют ли богатые отцы богатых сыновей, а бедные — бедных сыновей, или же здесь нет зависимости?</seg>
        <seg id="84">Среди неравных стран, в Великобритании и США, доход отца многократно важнее.</seg>
        <seg id="85">А в Скандинавских странах доход уже намного менее значим.</seg>
        <seg id="86">Как итог — бОльшая социальная мобильность.</seg>
        <seg id="87">И как мы часто любим говорить — я знаю, среди слушателей много американцев — если американцы хотят осуществить американскую мечту, им следует ехать в Данию.</seg>
        <seg id="88">(Смех) (Аплодисменты) Я показал лишь пару моментов, обозначенных курсивом.</seg>
        <seg id="89">Можно бы было продемонстрировать ряд других проблем.</seg>
        <seg id="90">Всякого рода проблемы, которые становятся значимее среди низших социальных слоёв.</seg>
        <seg id="91">Но существуют бесконечные проблемы с социальными градиентами, которые намного хуже в неравных странах; и не чуть-чуть, а в 2, в 10 раз хуже.</seg>
        <seg id="92">Подумайте об издержках, о том, во что это обходится людям.</seg>
        <seg id="93">Позвольте мне вернуться на ранее показанный график, где все данные собраны вместе. Сделаем два вывода.</seg>
        <seg id="94">Первый. График за графиком, менее преуспевающие страны, причём независимо от результата, оказываются из неравных, а хорошо успевающие это Скандинавские страны и Япония.</seg>
        <seg id="95">Таким образом, мы видим перед собой общую социальную дисфункцию на фоне неравенства.</seg>
        <seg id="96">Это не одна, не две отдельные проблемы. Это тенденция.</seg>
        <seg id="97">Ещё одно важное замечание об этом графике. Посмотрим ниже: Швеция и Япония: страны разные буквально во всём.</seg>
        <seg id="98">Положение женщин, насколько тесно они связаны с семьёй, прямо противоположны, в условиях развитых стран.</seg>
        <seg id="99">Другая очень важная разница — как они добиваются большего равенства.</seg>
        <seg id="100">В Швеции разницы в доходах огромны, но они уменьшаются через налогообложение, через социальные программы, щедрые льготы и т.д.</seg>
        <seg id="101">в Японии же всё иначе.</seg>
        <seg id="102">Разница в зарплатах изначально мала.</seg>
        <seg id="103">Налоги ниже.</seg>
        <seg id="104">Социальных программ меньше.</seg>
        <seg id="105">А в нашем анализе американских штатов мы находим тот же контраст.</seg>
        <seg id="106">Некоторые штаты преуспевают за счёт перераспределения доходов, другие — за счёт меньшей разницы в чистых доходах до вычета налогов.</seg>
        <seg id="107">Мы считаем, что не имеет значения, какими средствами достигается равенство, до тех пор, пока оно достигается.</seg>
        <seg id="108">Я говорю не о полном равенстве, а о том, которое есть в богатых и развитых рыночных демократиях.</seg>
        <seg id="109">Другое удивительное наблюдение, что не только бедные подвержены влиянию этого неравенства.</seg>
        <seg id="110">Кажется, есть доля правды в словах Джона Донна: «Человек — не остров».</seg>
        <seg id="111">В ряде исследований можно сравнить, как преуспевают люди в более и менее равных странах на каждой ступеньке социальной лестницы.</seg>
        <seg id="112">Один из таких примеров:</seg>
        <seg id="113">Смертность среди новорождённых.</seg>
        <seg id="114">Группа шведов классифицировала множество случаев младенческой смертности в соответствии с британским реестром общей социально-экономической классификации.</seg>
        <seg id="115">Это скорее анахроничная классификация согласно профессии отцов, так что родители-одиночки не учитываются.</seg>
        <seg id="116">И под «низким социальным уровнем» имеются в виду неквалифицированные профессии.</seg>
        <seg id="117">Дальше — квалифицированные работники ручного труда, затем — белые воротнички низшего звена и до высшего уровня с высококвалифицированными профессиями: врачи, адвокаты, директора крупных компаний.</seg>
        <seg id="118">Вы видите, в Швеции дела идут лучше, чем в Великобритании во всех слоях общества.</seg>
        <seg id="119">Наибольшая разница на низших уровнях,</seg>
        <seg id="120">но даже для высших звеньев есть выгоды от более равного общества.</seg>
        <seg id="121">Мы показали это на пяти разных подборках данных, затрагивающих образовательные результаты и здоровье в США и на международном уровне.</seg>
        <seg id="122">И это, кажется, общая картина: большее равенство сильнее меняет ситуацию внизу, но полезно и для верхушки.</seg>
        <seg id="123">Но я должен все-таки пояснить, что происходит.</seg>
        <seg id="124">Мне кажется, речь тут везде идёт о психосоциальных последствиях неравенства.</seg>
        <seg id="125">О чувстве превосходства и неполноценности, об ощущении своей ценности и наоборот, об ощущении уважения к себе и наоборот.</seg>
        <seg id="126">И, конечно, то ощущение конкуренции, которое рождается этими чувствами, разжигает потребительство в нашем обществе.</seg>
        <seg id="127">Это также приводит к страху за свой статус.</seg>
        <seg id="128">Мы больше переживаем о том, как о нас думают окружающие, считают ли нас привлекательными, умными — это нас беспокоит.</seg>
        <seg id="129">Чем больше общественных оценок, тем больший страх перед ними.</seg>
        <seg id="130">Интересно, что параллельная работа ведётся в социальной психологии: были рассмотрены 208 различных исследований с участием волонтёров, которых в психологических лабораториях проверяли на гормоны стресса, на реакцию на стрессовые задачи.</seg>
        <seg id="131">В целом, они хотели пронаблюдать виды стресса, которые повышают уровень кортизола, главного гормона стресса.</seg>
        <seg id="132">В результате, такими факторами оказались ситуации, включавшие потенциальную угрозу социальной оценки, угрозу самооценке или социальному статусу, ситуации, когда другие люди могли дать негативную оценку.</seg>
        <seg id="133">Как раз такие стрессовые факторы имеют особенное влияние на физиологию стресса.</seg>
        <seg id="134">Не обошлось и без критики в наш адрес.</seg>
        <seg id="135">Конечно, найдутся несогласные или люди, которые считают это удивительным.</seg>
        <seg id="136">Я должен вам сказать, в ответ на критику за подборку данных, что мы эти данные не выбираем.</seg>
        <seg id="137">Наше главное правило — если источник данных имеет необходимые показатели для одной из анализируемых стран, мы включаем его в наш анализ.</seg>
        <seg id="138">Это источник информации решает, реальные ли эти данные, но не мы.</seg>
        <seg id="139">В противном случае мы бы создали систематическую ошибку.</seg>
        <seg id="140">Что же с другими странами?</seg>
        <seg id="141">В академических журналах есть 200 исследований здоровья по отношению к доходам и равенству.</seg>
        <seg id="142">И они не ограничиваются вот этими странами но мы исключили прочие для наглядности.</seg>
        <seg id="143">Те же страны, те же измерения неравенства, проблема за проблемой.</seg>
        <seg id="144">Почему мы не контролируем другие факторы?</seg>
        <seg id="145">Ну, мы же показали вам, что ВНП на душу населения не имеет никакого значения.</seg>
        <seg id="146">И, конечно, другие, используя более сложные методы, контролировали и бедность, и уровень образования, и так далее.</seg>
        <seg id="147">А что на счёт причинности?</seg>
        <seg id="148">Корреляция сама по себе не доказывает причинности.</seg>
        <seg id="149">Мы потратили немало времени на это.</seg>
        <seg id="150">И в самом деле, для некоторых из этих ситуаций причинно-следственные связи хорошо известны.</seg>
        <seg id="151">Большой переменой в нашем понимании причин хронических воздействий на здоровье в развитом мире стало то, насколько значим хронический стресс социальной природы и его влияние на иммунную и сердечнососудистую системы.</seg>
        <seg id="152">Например, насилие становится всё более распространённым явлением в неравных обществах, потому что люди более чувствительны к презрению.</seg>
        <seg id="153">Надо сказать, что для решения этой проблемы нам следует работать над доходами до вычета налогов и после.</seg>
        <seg id="154">Мы должны ограничить доходы и дополнительные бонусы высших звеньев.</seg>
        <seg id="155">Я думаю, что необходимо всеми возможными способами заставить наших боссов нести ответственность за сотрудников.</seg>
        <seg id="156">Я хочу, чтобы вы ушли отсюда с осознанием того, что мы можем улучшить реальное качество жизни человека, снижая разницу в доходах между нами.</seg>
        <seg id="157">Вот теперь мы имеем точку опоры для влияния на психологическое благосостояние целых обществ, и это действительно невероятно.</seg>
        <seg id="158">Спасибо.</seg>

    <ref lang="en" translator="A">
      <p>
        <seg id="1">You all know the truth of what I'm going to say.</seg>
        <seg id="2">I think the intuition that inequality is divisive and socially corrosive has been around since before the French Revolution.</seg>
        <seg id="3">What's changed is we now can look at the evidence, we can compare societies, more and less equal societies, and see what inequality does.</seg>
        <seg id="4">I'm going to take you through that data and then explain why the links I'm going to be showing you exist.</seg>
        <seg id="5">But first, see what a miserable lot we are.</seg>
        <seg id="6">(Laughter) I want to start though with a paradox.</seg>
        <seg id="7">This shows you life expectancy against gross national income -- how rich countries are on average.</seg>
        <seg id="8">And you see the countries on the right, like Norway and the USA, are twice as rich as Israel, Greece, Portugal on the left.</seg>
        <seg id="9">And it makes no difference to their life expectancy at all.</seg>
        <seg id="10">There's no suggestion of a relationship there.</seg>
        <seg id="11">But if we look within our societies, there are extraordinary social gradients in health running right across society.</seg>
        <seg id="12">This, again, is life expectancy.</seg>
        <seg id="13">These are small areas of England and Wales -- the poorest on the right, the richest on the left.</seg>
        <seg id="14">A lot of difference between the poor and the rest of us.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Even the people just below the top have less good health than the people at the top.</seg>
        <seg id="16">So income means something very important within our societies, and nothing between them.</seg>
        <seg id="17">The explanation of that paradox is that, within our societies, we're looking at relative income or social position, social status -- where we are in relation to each other and the size of the gaps between us.</seg>
        <seg id="18">And as soon as you've got that idea, you should immediately wonder: what happens if we widen the differences, or compress them, make the income differences bigger or smaller?</seg>
        <seg id="19">And that's what I'm going to show you.</seg>
        <seg id="20">I'm not using any hypothetical data.</seg>
        <seg id="21">I'm taking data from the U.N. -- it's the same as the World Bank has -- on the scale of income differences in these rich developed market democracies.</seg>
        <seg id="22">The measure we've used, because it's easy to understand and you can download it, is how much richer the top 20 percent than the bottom 20 percent in each country.</seg>
        <seg id="23">And you see in the more equal countries on the left -- Japan, Finland, Norway, Sweden -- the top 20 percent are about three and a half, four times as rich as the bottom 20 percent.</seg>
        <seg id="24">But on the more unequal end -- U.K., Portugal, USA, Singapore -- the differences are twice as big.</seg>
        <seg id="25">On that measure, we are twice as unequal as some of the other successful market democracies.</seg>
        <seg id="26">Now I'm going to show you what that does to our societies.</seg>
        <seg id="27">We collected data on problems with social gradients, the kind of problems that are more common at the bottom of the social ladder.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Internationally comparable data on life expectancy, on kids' maths and literacy scores, on infant mortality rates, homicide rates, proportion of the population in prison, teenage birthrates, levels of trust, obesity, mental illness -- which in standard diagnostic classification includes drug and alcohol addiction -- and social mobility.</seg>
        <seg id="29">We put them all in one index.</seg>
        <seg id="30">They're all weighted equally.</seg>
        <seg id="31">Where a country is is a sort of average score on these things.</seg>
        <seg id="32">And there, you see it in relation to the measure of inequality I've just shown you, which I shall use over and over again in the data.</seg>
        <seg id="33">The more unequal countries are doing worse on all these kinds of social problems.</seg>
        <seg id="34">It's an extraordinarily close correlation.</seg>
        <seg id="35">But if you look at that same index of health and social problems in relation to GNP per capita, gross national income, there's nothing there, no correlation anymore.</seg>
        <seg id="36">We were a little bit worried that people might think we'd been choosing problems to suit our argument and just manufactured this evidence, so we also did a paper in the British Medical Journal on the UNICEF index of child well-being.</seg>
        <seg id="37">It has 40 different components put together by other people.</seg>
        <seg id="38">It contains whether kids can talk to their parents, whether they have books at home, what immunization rates are like, whether there's bullying at school.</seg>
        <seg id="39">Everything goes into it.</seg>
        <seg id="40">Here it is in relation to that same measure of inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="41">Kids do worse in the more unequal societies.</seg>
        <seg id="42">Highly significant relationship.</seg>
        <seg id="43">But once again, if you look at that measure of child well-being, in relation to national income per person, there's no relationship, no suggestion of a relationship.</seg>
        <seg id="44">What all the data I've shown you so far says is the same thing.</seg>
        <seg id="45">The average well-being of our societies is not dependent any longer on national income and economic growth.</seg>
        <seg id="46">That's very important in poorer countries, but not in the rich developed world.</seg>
        <seg id="47">But the differences between us and where we are in relation to each other now matter very much.</seg>
        <seg id="48">I'm going to show you some of the separate bits of our index.</seg>
        <seg id="49">Here, for instance, is trust.</seg>
        <seg id="50">It's simply the proportion of the population who agree most people can be trusted.</seg>
        <seg id="51">It comes from the World Values Survey.</seg>
        <seg id="52">You see, at the more unequal end, it's about 15 percent of the population who feel they can trust others.</seg>
        <seg id="53">But in the more equal societies, it rises to 60 or 65 percent.</seg>
        <seg id="54">And if you look at measures of involvement in community life or social capital, very similar relationships closely related to inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="55">I may say, we did all this work twice.</seg>
        <seg id="56">We did it first on these rich, developed countries, and then as a separate test bed, we repeated it all on the 50 American states -- asking just the same question: do the more unequal states do worse on all these kinds of measures?</seg>
        <seg id="57">So here is trust from a general social survey of the federal government related to inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="58">Very similar scatter over a similar range of levels of trust.</seg>
        <seg id="59">Same thing is going on.</seg>
        <seg id="60">Basically we found that almost anything that's related to trust internationally is related to trust amongst the 50 states in that separate test bed.</seg>
        <seg id="61">We're not just talking about a fluke.</seg>
        <seg id="62">This is mental illness.</seg>
        <seg id="63">WHO put together figures using the same diagnostic interviews on random samples of the population to allow us to compare rates of mental illness in each society.</seg>
        <seg id="64">This is the percent of the population with any mental illness in the preceding year.</seg>
        <seg id="65">And it goes from about eight percent up to three times that -- whole societies with three times the level of mental illness of others.</seg>
        <seg id="66">And again, closely related to inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="67">This is violence.</seg>
        <seg id="68">These red dots are American states, and the blue triangles are Canadian provinces.</seg>
        <seg id="69">But look at the scale of the differences.</seg>
        <seg id="70">It goes from 15 homicides per million up to 150.</seg>
        <seg id="71">This is the proportion of the population in prison.</seg>
        <seg id="72">There's a about a tenfold difference there, log scale up the side.</seg>
        <seg id="73">But it goes from about 40 to 400 people in prison.</seg>
        <seg id="74">That relationship is not mainly driven by more crime.</seg>
        <seg id="75">In some places, that's part of it.</seg>
        <seg id="76">But most of it is about more punitive sentencing, harsher sentencing.</seg>
        <seg id="77">And the more unequal societies are more likely also to retain the death penalty.</seg>
        <seg id="78">Here we have children dropping out of high school.</seg>
        <seg id="79">Again, quite big differences.</seg>
        <seg id="80">Extraordinarily damaging, if you're talking about using the talents of the population.</seg>
        <seg id="81">This is social mobility.</seg>
        <seg id="82">It's actually a measure of mobility based on income.</seg>
        <seg id="83">Basically, it's asking: do rich fathers have rich sons and poor fathers have poor sons, or is there no relationship between the two?</seg>
        <seg id="84">And at the more unequal end, fathers' income is much more important -- in the U.K., USA.</seg>
        <seg id="85">And in Scandinavian countries, fathers' income is much less important.</seg>
        <seg id="86">There's more social mobility.</seg>
        <seg id="87">And as we like to say -- and I know there are a lot of Americans in the audience here -- if Americans want to live the American dream, they should go to Denmark.</seg>
        <seg id="88">(Laughter) (Applause) I've shown you just a few things in italics here.</seg>
        <seg id="89">I could have shown a number of other problems.</seg>
        <seg id="90">They're all problems that tend to be more common at the bottom of the social gradient.</seg>
        <seg id="91">But there are endless problems with social gradients that are worse in more unequal countries -- not just a little bit worse, but anything from twice as common to 10 times as common.</seg>
        <seg id="92">Think of the expense, the human cost of that.</seg>
        <seg id="93">I want to go back though to this graph that I showed you earlier where we put it all together to make two points.</seg>
        <seg id="94">One is that, in graph after graph, we find the countries that do worse, whatever the outcome, seem to be the more unequal ones, and the ones that do well seem to be the Nordic countries and Japan.</seg>
        <seg id="95">So what we're looking at is general social disfunction related to inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="96">It's not just one or two things that go wrong, it's most things.</seg>
        <seg id="97">The other really important point I want to make on this graph is that, if you look at the bottom, Sweden and Japan, they're very different countries in all sorts of ways.</seg>
        <seg id="98">The position of women, how closely they keep to the nuclear family, are on opposite ends of the poles in terms of the rich developed world.</seg>
        <seg id="99">But another really important difference is how they get their greater equality.</seg>
        <seg id="100">Sweden has huge differences in earnings, and it narrows the gap through taxation, general welfare state, generous benefits and so on.</seg>
        <seg id="101">Japan is rather different though.</seg>
        <seg id="102">It starts off with much smaller differences in earnings before tax.</seg>
        <seg id="103">It has lower taxes.</seg>
        <seg id="104">It has a smaller welfare state.</seg>
        <seg id="105">And in our analysis of the American states, we find rather the same contrast.</seg>
        <seg id="106">There are some states that do well through redistribution, some states that do well because they have smaller income differences before tax.</seg>
        <seg id="107">So we conclude that it doesn't much matter how you get your greater equality, as long as you get there somehow.</seg>
        <seg id="108">I am not talking about perfect equality, I'm talking about what exists in rich developed market democracies.</seg>
        <seg id="109">Another really surprising part of this picture is that it's not just the poor who are affected by inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="110">There seems to be some truth in John Donne's "No man is an island."</seg>
        <seg id="111">And in a number of studies, it's possible to compare how people do in more and less equal countries at each level in the social hierarchy.</seg>
        <seg id="112">This is just one example.</seg>
        <seg id="113">It's infant mortality.</seg>
        <seg id="114">Some Swedes very kindly classified a lot of their infant deaths according to the British register of general socioeconomic classification.</seg>
        <seg id="115">And so it's anachronistically a classification by fathers' occupations, so single parents go on their own.</seg>
        <seg id="116">But then where it says "low social class," that's unskilled manual occupations.</seg>
        <seg id="117">It goes through towards the skilled manual occupations in the middle, then the junior non-manual, going up high to the professional occupations -- doctors, lawyers, directors of larger companies.</seg>
        <seg id="118">You see there that Sweden does better than Britain all the way across the social hierarchy.</seg>
        <seg id="119">The biggest differences are at the bottom of society.</seg>
        <seg id="120">But even at the top, there seems to be a small benefit to being in a more equal society.</seg>
        <seg id="121">We show that on about five different sets of data covering educational outcomes and health in the United States and internationally.</seg>
        <seg id="122">And that seems to be the general picture -- that greater equality makes most difference at the bottom, but has some benefits even at the top.</seg>
        <seg id="123">But I should say a few words about what's going on.</seg>
        <seg id="124">I think I'm looking and talking about the psychosocial effects of inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="125">More to do with feelings of superiority and inferiority, of being valued and devalued, respected and disrespected.</seg>
        <seg id="126">And of course, those feelings of the status competition that comes out of that drives the consumerism in our society.</seg>
        <seg id="127">It also leads to status insecurity.</seg>
        <seg id="128">We worry more about how we're judged and seen by others, whether we're regarded as attractive, clever, all that kind of thing.</seg>
        <seg id="129">The social-evaluative judgments increase, the fear of those social-evaluative judgments.</seg>
        <seg id="130">Interestingly, some parallel work going on in social psychology: some people reviewed 208 different studies in which volunteers had been invited into a psychological laboratory and had their stress hormones, their responses to doing stressful tasks, measured.</seg>
        <seg id="131">And in the review, what they were interested in seeing is what kind of stresses most reliably raise levels of cortisol, the central stress hormone.</seg>
        <seg id="132">And the conclusion was it was tasks that included social-evaluative threat -- threats to self-esteem or social status in which others can negatively judge your performance.</seg>
        <seg id="133">Those kind of stresses have a very particular effect on the physiology of stress.</seg>
        <seg id="134">Now we have been criticized.</seg>
        <seg id="135">Of course, there are people who dislike this stuff and people who find it very surprising.</seg>
        <seg id="136">I should tell you though that when people criticize us for picking and choosing data, we never pick and choose data.</seg>
        <seg id="137">We have an absolute rule that if our data source has data for one of the countries we're looking at, it goes into the analysis.</seg>
        <seg id="138">Our data source decides whether it's reliable data, we don't.</seg>
        <seg id="139">Otherwise that would introduce bias.</seg>
        <seg id="140">What about other countries?</seg>
        <seg id="141">There are 200 studies of health in relation to income and equality in the academic peer-reviewed journals.</seg>
        <seg id="142">This isn't confined to these countries here, hiding a very simple demonstration.</seg>
        <seg id="143">The same countries, the same measure of inequality, one problem after another.</seg>
        <seg id="144">Why don't we control for other factors?</seg>
        <seg id="145">Well we've shown you that GNP per capita doesn't make any difference.</seg>
        <seg id="146">And of course, others using more sophisticated methods in the literature have controlled for poverty and education and so on.</seg>
        <seg id="147">What about causality?</seg>
        <seg id="148">Correlation in itself doesn't prove causality.</seg>
        <seg id="149">We spend a good bit of time.</seg>
        <seg id="150">And indeed, people know the causal links quite well in some of these outcomes.</seg>
        <seg id="151">The big change in our understanding of drivers of chronic health in the rich developed world is how important chronic stress from social sources is affecting the immune system, the cardiovascular system.</seg>
        <seg id="152">Or for instance, the reason why violence becomes more common in more unequal societies is because people are sensitive to being looked down on.</seg>
        <seg id="153">I should say that to deal with this, we've got to deal with the post-tax things and the pre-tax things.</seg>
        <seg id="154">We've got to constrain income, the bonus culture incomes at the top.</seg>
        <seg id="155">I think we must make our bosses accountable to their employees in any way we can.</seg>
        <seg id="156">I think the take-home message though is that we can improve the real quality of human life by reducing the differences in incomes between us.</seg>
        <seg id="157">Suddenly we have a handle on the psychosocial well-being of whole societies, and that's exciting.</seg>
        <seg id="158">Thank you.</seg>
        <seg id="159">(Applause)</seg>

  <hyp system="Facebook-AI" lang="en">
      <p>
        <seg id="1">You are all well aware of the truth that will be discussed today.</seg>
        <seg id="2">I think the idea of inequality as a divider and destroyer of society was in the air even before the French Revolution.</seg>
        <seg id="3">But now we can see the evidence by comparing the most and least similar societies, and observing the effects of inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="4">I'm going to show you the data and explain why the relationships that I'm going to talk about exist.</seg>
        <seg id="5">But first, look at how dull we are.</seg>
        <seg id="6">(Laughter) I'll start with a paradox.</seg>
        <seg id="7">This shows life expectancy as a function of GNI, or the average wealth of countries.</seg>
        <seg id="8">You can see that countries on the right, like Norway and the US, are twice as rich as Israel, Greece and Portugal on the left.</seg>
        <seg id="9">But it doesn't affect life expectancy at all.</seg>
        <seg id="10">There is no suggestion of a link.</seg>
        <seg id="11">But within societies there are strong gradations in health status, affecting all social strata.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Average life expectancy again.</seg>
        <seg id="13">The graph refers to small areas of England and Wales, with the poorest on the right and the richest on the left.</seg>
        <seg id="14">A huge difference between the poor and everyone else.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Even those slightly poorer than the richest are already less healthy than the very top.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Thus, income is very important within our societies, but not between them.</seg>
        <seg id="17">The explanation for this paradox is that within our societies we look at relative income or social position, status - at what level we are in relation to others, and what are the distances between us.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Once you understand this idea, you immediately think: what happens when you increase the difference or compress it, in other words, make the income difference bigger or smaller?</seg>
        <seg id="19">I'll show it to you now.</seg>
        <seg id="20">All the data used is absolutely real.</seg>
        <seg id="21">I take the information from the UN, the World Bank has the same information: the scale of income disparities in these rich and developed market democracies.</seg>
        <seg id="22">The indicator used by our team is very simple, you can download it. We calculate the difference between the richest 20% and the poorest 20% of citizens in each country.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Look, in the equal countries on the left, Japan, Finland, Norway and Sweden, the rich 20% are 3.5-4 times richer than the poor 20%.</seg>
        <seg id="24">But in unequal countries, in the UK, Portugal, the US and Singapore, the difference is twice as big!</seg>
        <seg id="25">By these measures, we are less than half as equal as other successful democracies.</seg>
        <seg id="26">And now you see the impact it has on society.</seg>
        <seg id="27">We have collected statistics on social problems that are more common among the poor.</seg>
        <seg id="28">These are internationally comparable data on life expectancy, children's literacy and numeracy, infant mortality, homicide rates, incarceration rates, teenage pregnancy, levels of trust, obesity, mental illness - which, according to the standard diagnostic classification, includes drug and alcohol addiction - and, finally, social mobility data.</seg>
        <seg id="29">We put it all in one index.</seg>
        <seg id="30">They are all of equal importance.</seg>
        <seg id="31">The country is, in a way, an average of these data.</seg>
        <seg id="32">You see the countries in relation to the inequality indicator that was shown at the very beginning. I will come back to it again and again in the course of the presentation.</seg>
        <seg id="33">Unequal countries generally have more problems with all these social problems.</seg>
        <seg id="34">This is an unusually close relationship. You can see that the correlation is unusually high.</seg>
        <seg id="35">But if you look at the same index of health and social problems in relation to GNP per capita, Gross National Income, there is no correlation.</seg>
        <seg id="36">We were a bit worried that people would think we were cherry-picking issues to suit our argument and just "fitting" the evidence, so we also wrote an article in the British Medical Journal about the UNICEF Child Wellbeing Index.</seg>
        <seg id="37">The index is made up of 40 different parts put together by different people.</seg>
        <seg id="38">Among the criteria: the availability of books at home, the ability of children to talk to their parents, the level of immunization, and the presence of bullying at school.</seg>
        <seg id="39">Everything goes in there.</seg>
        <seg id="40">But this is all against the background of the same indicator of inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="41">Children fare worse in unequal societies.</seg>
        <seg id="42">And this is a statistically significant relationship.</seg>
        <seg id="43">But again, if you look at the level of child well-being in relation to national income per capita, there is no relationship, no hint.</seg>
        <seg id="44">All the evidence points to one thing:</seg>
        <seg id="45">on average, the well-being of our societies no longer depends on national income and economic growth.</seg>
        <seg id="46">They are extremely important in poor countries, but not in the developed world.</seg>
        <seg id="47">The difference between us, and where we stand compared to others, is what matters most.</seg>
        <seg id="48">I will show you the fragments of our index.</seg>
        <seg id="49">For example, trust.</seg>
        <seg id="50">This is the portion of the population that agrees that most people can be trusted.</seg>
        <seg id="51">The data comes from the World Values Survey.</seg>
        <seg id="52">Look, in unequal countries only 15% of the population trusts others.</seg>
        <seg id="53">In equal societies, the figure is 60-65%.</seg>
        <seg id="54">If you look at measures of social activity, or social capital, you see very similar ratios, closely related to inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="55">You could say we did the work twice.</seg>
        <seg id="56">First, we analyzed developed countries, and then, as a control study, we repeated the procedure on 50 American states, asking one question: are things worse for all our indicators in the most unequal states?</seg>
        <seg id="57">Here's trust versus inequality, according to the federal government's General Social Survey.</seg>
        <seg id="58">Very similar dispersion, compared to a similar range of confidence levels.</seg>
        <seg id="59">Same story.</seg>
        <seg id="60">Overall, we found that almost everything related to trust at the international level shows up the same way in our control study.</seg>
        <seg id="61">It's not just a coincidence.</seg>
        <seg id="62">Here is a timeline of mental illness.</seg>
        <seg id="63">WHO, through identical diagnostic interviews conducted on random samples of the population, collected results that allow us to compare the level of mental illness in each of the societies.</seg>
        <seg id="64">Here is the percentage of the population that suffered from a mental illness in the past year.</seg>
        <seg id="65">The numbers start at about 8% and go up to almost 24%; whole societies with three times the rate of mental illness.</seg>
        <seg id="66">Again, this is closely related to inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="67">And then there are the crimes.</seg>
        <seg id="68">These red dots represent American states, and the blue triangles represent Canadian provinces.</seg>
        <seg id="69">But look at the scale of the difference.</seg>
        <seg id="70">It starts at 15 murders per million and goes up to 150.</seg>
        <seg id="71">This is the proportion of prisoners.</seg>
        <seg id="72">This is a tenfold difference, expressed on a logarithmic scale.</seg>
        <seg id="73">The figures rise from 40 to 400 for the prison population.</seg>
        <seg id="74">These correlations are not explained simply by higher crime.</seg>
        <seg id="75">Yes, in some cases this is partly true.</seg>
        <seg id="76">But most of them are associated with harsher sentences.</seg>
        <seg id="77">Unequal societies are more likely to support the death penalty.</seg>
        <seg id="78">The dropout rate is shown here.</seg>
        <seg id="79">Again, quite a difference.</seg>
        <seg id="80">It is incredibly damaging when it comes to the use of talent.</seg>
        <seg id="81">And here is social mobility.</seg>
        <seg id="82">It's a measurement of mobility by income.</seg>
        <seg id="83">Basically it comes down to this: do rich fathers have rich sons and poor fathers have poor sons, or is there no relationship?</seg>
        <seg id="84">Among unequal countries, in the UK and the US, the father's income is many times more important.</seg>
        <seg id="85">And in the Scandinavian countries, income is much less important.</seg>
        <seg id="86">The result is greater social mobility.</seg>
        <seg id="87">And as we often like to say - and I know there are a lot of Americans in the audience - if Americans want the American dream, they should go to Denmark.</seg>
        <seg id="88">(Laughter) (Applause) I just showed you a couple of things in italics.</seg>
        <seg id="89">A number of other problems could be demonstrated.</seg>
        <seg id="90">All sorts of problems that become more significant among the lower social strata.</seg>
        <seg id="91">But there are endless problems with social gradients, which are much worse in unequal countries; not just a little bit, but 2, 10 times worse.</seg>
        <seg id="92">Think about the cost, what it costs people.</seg>
        <seg id="93">Let me go back to the graph I showed earlier, where all the data is put together, and draw two conclusions.</seg>
        <seg id="94">First, chart by chart, the less successful countries, regardless of the result, turn out to be unequal, while the Scandinavian countries and Japan are doing well.</seg>
        <seg id="95">Thus, we see before us a general social dysfunction on the background of inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="96">This is not one or two separate problems. This is a trend.</seg>
        <seg id="97">Another important note about this graph. See below: Sweden and Japan: the countries are different in literally everything.</seg>
        <seg id="98">The situation of women, how closely they are connected with the family, is exactly the opposite in the conditions of developed countries.</seg>
        <seg id="99">Another very important difference is how they achieve greater equality.</seg>
        <seg id="100">In Sweden, income differences are huge, but they are reduced through taxation, through social programs, generous benefits, etc.</seg>
        <seg id="101">In Japan, things are different.</seg>
        <seg id="102">The wage gap is small to begin with.</seg>
        <seg id="103">Taxes are lower.</seg>
        <seg id="104">There are fewer social programs.</seg>
        <seg id="105">And in our analysis of American states, we find the same contrast.</seg>
        <seg id="106">Some states thrive on income redistribution, others on smaller differences in net pretax income.</seg>
        <seg id="107">We believe that it does not matter by what means equality is achieved, as long as it is achieved.</seg>
        <seg id="108">I am not talking about full equality, but the kind of equality that exists in rich and developed market democracies.</seg>
        <seg id="109">Another surprising observation is that it is not only the poor who are affected by this inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="110">There seems to be some truth in the words of John Donne: "No man is an island."</seg>
        <seg id="111">A number of studies can compare how well people in more and less equal countries do at each rung of the social ladder.</seg>
        <seg id="112">One such example:</seg>
        <seg id="113">Neonatal mortality.</seg>
        <seg id="114">A group of Swedes classified many cases of infant mortality according to the British register of general socioeconomic classification.</seg>
        <seg id="115">This is rather an anachronistic classification according to the profession of the fathers, so that single parents are not included.</seg>
        <seg id="116">And by "low social level" we mean unskilled occupations.</seg>
        <seg id="117">Next are skilled manual workers, then lower-level white-collar workers and up to the highest level with highly skilled professions: doctors, lawyers, directors of large companies.</seg>
        <seg id="118">You see, Sweden is doing better than the UK at all levels of society.</seg>
        <seg id="119">The biggest difference is at the lower levels,</seg>
        <seg id="120">But even at the top, there are benefits to a more equal society.</seg>
        <seg id="121">We have shown this in five different data sets covering educational outcomes and health in the US and internationally.</seg>
        <seg id="122">And that seems to be the general picture: greater equality makes a bigger difference at the bottom, but is also good for the top.</seg>
        <seg id="123">But I still have to explain what is going on.</seg>
        <seg id="124">I think it's all about the psychosocial effects of inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="125">About feelings of superiority and inferiority, about feelings of self-worth and vice versa, about feelings of self-respect and vice versa.</seg>
        <seg id="126">And, of course, the sense of competition that is born of these feelings fuels consumerism in our society.</seg>
        <seg id="127">It also leads to status anxiety.</seg>
        <seg id="128">We worry more about what other people think of us, whether they think we're attractive, whether they think we're smart.</seg>
        <seg id="129">The more public assessments, the greater the fear of them.</seg>
        <seg id="130">Interestingly, parallel work is being done in social psychology: 208 different studies were reviewed involving volunteers who were tested in psychological laboratories for stress hormones and reactions to stressful tasks.</seg>
        <seg id="131">Overall, they wanted to observe the types of stress that increase levels of cortisol, the main stress hormone.</seg>
        <seg id="132">As a result, these factors were situations that included a potential threat of social evaluation, a threat to self-esteem or social status, situations where other people could give a negative assessment.</seg>
        <seg id="133">Such stressors have a particular impact on the physiology of stress.</seg>
        <seg id="134">We were not without our critics.</seg>
        <seg id="135">Of course, there will be those who disagree or find it surprising.</seg>
        <seg id="136">I have to tell you, in response to criticism for cherry-picking data, that we don't cherry-pick data.</seg>
        <seg id="137">Our main rule is that if the data source has the necessary indicators for one of the analyzed countries, we include it in our analysis.</seg>
        <seg id="138">It's the source that decides if the data is real, not us.</seg>
        <seg id="139">Otherwise, we would have created a systematic error.</seg>
        <seg id="140">What about other countries?</seg>
        <seg id="141">There are 200 studies of health in relation to income and equality in academic journals.</seg>
        <seg id="142">And they are not limited to these countries but we have excluded others for clarity.</seg>
        <seg id="143">The same countries, the same measures of inequality, problem after problem.</seg>
        <seg id="144">Why don't we control for other factors?</seg>
        <seg id="145">Well, we have shown you that GNP per capita does not matter.</seg>
        <seg id="146">And, of course, others, using more sophisticated methods, controlled for poverty, education level, and so on.</seg>
        <seg id="147">What about causality?</seg>
        <seg id="148">Correlation alone does not prove causation.</seg>
        <seg id="149">We spent a lot of time on this.</seg>
        <seg id="150">Indeed, for some of these situations, the causal relationships are well known.</seg>
        <seg id="151">A major change in our understanding of the causes of chronic health effects in the developed world has been the significance of chronic stress of a social nature and its impact on the immune and cardiovascular systems.</seg>
        <seg id="152">For example, violence becomes more common in unequal societies because people are more sensitive to contempt.</seg>
        <seg id="153">I must say that to solve this problem, we should work on pre-tax and post-tax income.</seg>
        <seg id="154">We must limit the income and additional bonuses of the highest ranks.</seg>
        <seg id="155">I think we need to hold our bosses accountable for their employees in every way possible.</seg>
        <seg id="156">I want you to leave here with the knowledge that we can improve the real quality of human life by reducing the income gap between us.</seg>
        <seg id="157">So now we have a foothold to influence the psychological well-being of entire societies, and this is really incredible.</seg>
        <seg id="158">Thank you.</seg>

  <hyp system="Online-Y" lang="en">
      <p>
        <seg id="1">You all know the truth that will be talked about today.</seg>
        <seg id="2">I think the thought of inequality as a divider and destroyer of society was in the air before the French Revolution.</seg>
        <seg id="3">But now we can see evidence by comparing the most and least similar societies, and observing the effects of inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="4">I'll show you this data and explain why there are relationships that are going to talk about.</seg>
        <seg id="5">But first, look at how much we are — a squalid mass.</seg>
        <seg id="6">(Laughter) I'll start with a paradox.</seg>
        <seg id="7">It shows life expectancy depending on GNI, or the average wealth of countries.</seg>
        <seg id="8">It can be seen that countries on the right, such as Norway and the US, are twice as rich as Israel, Greece and Portugal on the left.</seg>
        <seg id="9">But it has absolutely no effect on life expectancy.</seg>
        <seg id="10">There is no indication of the relationship.</seg>
        <seg id="11">But within societies, strong gradations in health are noticeable, affecting all social strata.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Average life expectancy again.</seg>
        <seg id="13">The graph refers to small areas of England and Wales: the poorest on the right, the richest on the left.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Huge difference between the poor and everyone else.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Even those slightly poorer than the wealthiest are already less healthy than the very top.</seg>
        <seg id="16">So income is very important within our societies, but not between them.</seg>
        <seg id="17">The explanation for this paradox is: within our societies, we look at relative income or social position, status — at what level we are in relation to those around us, and what distances are between us.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Once you understand this idea, what happens when the difference is increased or squeezed, in other words, making the difference in income bigger or smaller?</seg>
        <seg id="19">Now I'll show you that.</seg>
        <seg id="20">All the data used is absolutely real.</seg>
        <seg id="21">I take UN information, the same from the World Bank: the scale of income disparities in these rich and developed market democracies.</seg>
        <seg id="22">The indicator used by our team is very simple, you can download it. We count the difference between the 20% richest and 20% of the poorest citizens in each country.</seg>
        <seg id="23">See, in equal countries on the left, in Japan, Finland, Norway and Sweden, the rich 20% are 3.5-4 times richer than the 20% of the poor.</seg>
        <seg id="24">But in unequal countries, in the UK, Portugal, the US and Singapore, the difference is twice the difference!</seg>
        <seg id="25">According to these measurements, we are twice as equal against the background of other successful democracies.</seg>
        <seg id="26">And now you'll see the impact it has on society.</seg>
        <seg id="27">We have compiled statistics on social problems that are more frequent among the poor.</seg>
        <seg id="28">This is internationally comparable data for life expectancy, literacy and mathematical training of children, mortality of newborn, murder rate, number of prisoners, adolescent pregnancy, trust, obesity, mental illness, which, according to the standard diagnostic classification, include drug and alcohol dependencies, and finally, data on social mobility.</seg>
        <seg id="29">We put that all in one index.</seg>
        <seg id="30">All of them are of equal importance.</seg>
        <seg id="31">The country is, of course, the average value of this data.</seg>
        <seg id="32">You see countries with regard to the measure of inequality that was shown at the beginning. I will come back to it again and again as the presentation progresses.</seg>
        <seg id="33">Unequal countries in general have more complexities with all these social problems.</seg>
        <seg id="34">It's an unusually close bond. You see the correlation is unusually high.</seg>
        <seg id="35">But if you look at the same index of health and social problems relative to GNP per capita, Gross National Income, there is no correlation anymore.</seg>
        <seg id="36">We were a little worried that people would think we were picking up problems to our arguments and just “fit” the evidence. So we also wrote an article to the British Medical Journal about the UNICEF Child Wellbeing Index.</seg>
        <seg id="37">The index consists of 40 different parts, put together by different people.</seg>
        <seg id="38">Among the criteria:, the availability of books at home, the ability of children to talk to parents, the level of immunization, the availability of bullying in school.</seg>
        <seg id="39">That's where everything goes.</seg>
        <seg id="40">And this is all against the same measure of inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="41">The situation in children is worse in unequal societies.</seg>
        <seg id="42">And that's a statistically significant relationship.</seg>
        <seg id="43">But again, if you look at the level of child welfare in relation to national income per capita, there is no relationship, no hint.</seg>
        <seg id="44">All the demonstrated data says one thing:</seg>
        <seg id="45">on average, the welfare of our societies is no longer dependent on national income and economic growth.</seg>
        <seg id="46">They are extremely important in poor countries, but not in the developed world.</seg>
        <seg id="47">The difference between us, and our position against the background of others, is what makes a huge difference.</seg>
        <seg id="48">I'll show you snippets of our index.</seg>
        <seg id="49">Here, for example, is trust.</seg>
        <seg id="50">It's the part of the population that agrees that most people can be trusted.</seg>
        <seg id="51">The data is from the World Values Study.</seg>
        <seg id="52">Here, look, in unequal countries, only 15% of the population trusts others.</seg>
        <seg id="53">And in equal societies, that figure reaches 60-65%.</seg>
        <seg id="54">If you look at the measurements of social activity activity, or social capital, you'll notice very similar ratios closely related to inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="55">We could say we've done the job twice.</seg>
        <seg id="56">First we analyzed developed countries, and then as a control study we repeated the procedure in 50 American states, asking one question: whether things are worse for all of our to indicators in the most unequal states?</seg>
        <seg id="57">Here's trust in relation to inequality, according to the federal government's general social study.</seg>
        <seg id="58">Very similar spread, compared to a similar range of confidence levels.</seg>
        <seg id="59">Same story.</seg>
        <seg id="60">In general, we found that almost everything related to trust internationally appears as well in our control study.</seg>
        <seg id="61">It's not just a coincidence.</seg>
        <seg id="62">Here's a graph of mental illness.</seg>
        <seg id="63">WHO, through identical diagnostic interviews conducted on random samples of the population, collected results that allow us to compare the level of mental illness in each of the societies.</seg>
        <seg id="64">This shows the percentage of the population who suffered from a mental illness in the past year.</seg>
        <seg id="65">The numbers start at about 8% and rise to nearly 24%; entire societies with three times the level of psychological illness.</seg>
        <seg id="66">And again, this is closely related to inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="67">And here's the crimes.</seg>
        <seg id="68">These red dots show American states, and the blue triangles show Canadian provinces.</seg>
        <seg id="69">But look at the scale of the differences.</seg>
        <seg id="70">It starts at 15 kills per million and gets to 150.</seg>
        <seg id="71">This is the proportion of prisoners.</seg>
        <seg id="72">This is a tenfold difference expressed on a logarithmic scale.</seg>
        <seg id="73">The numbers rise from 40 to 400 in terms of prison inmates.</seg>
        <seg id="74">These relationships are not explained simply by higher crime.</seg>
        <seg id="75">Yes, in some cases this is partly the case.</seg>
        <seg id="76">But most of them involve more stronger sentences.</seg>
        <seg id="77">Unequal societies were more likely to favor the continuation of the death penalty.</seg>
        <seg id="78">The percentage of children dropping out of school is shown here.</seg>
        <seg id="79">Again, a pretty big difference.</seg>
        <seg id="80">It's incredibly malicious when it comes to using talent.</seg>
        <seg id="81">And here is social mobility.</seg>
        <seg id="82">It's a measurement of mobility according to income.</seg>
        <seg id="83">The main thing is: Do rich fathers have rich sons and poor sons, or are there no dependency here?</seg>
        <seg id="84">Among unequal countries, in the UK and the US, his father's income is repeatedly more important.</seg>
        <seg id="85">And in Scandinavian countries, income is already much less meaningful.</seg>
        <seg id="86">As a bottom line — Greater social mobility.</seg>
        <seg id="87">And as we often like to say — I know there are many Americans among listeners — if Americans want to fulfill the American dream, they should go to Denmark.</seg>
        <seg id="88">(Laughter) (Applause) I showed only a couple of italicized moments.</seg>
        <seg id="89">A number of other problems could be demonstrated.</seg>
        <seg id="90">All kinds of problems that are becoming more significant among the lower social strata.</seg>
        <seg id="91">But there are endless problems with social gradients that are much worse in unequal countries; and not a little bit, but 2, 10 times worse.</seg>
        <seg id="92">Think about the costs, what it costs people to do.</seg>
        <seg id="93">Let me go back to the previously shown graph where all the data is put together. Let's make two conclusions.</seg>
        <seg id="94">The first one. Chart by chart, less successful countries, regardless of the outcome, are out of unequal terms, and the successful countries are Scandinavian and Japan.</seg>
        <seg id="95">Thus, we see a general social dysfunction against the background of inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="96">These are not one, not two separate problems. It's a trend.</seg>
        <seg id="97">Another important point about this graph. Let's see below: Sweden and Japan: countries are different literally in everything.</seg>
        <seg id="98">The situation of women, how closely related to the family, is exactly the opposite in developed countries.</seg>
        <seg id="99">The other very important difference is how they achieve greater equality.</seg>
        <seg id="100">In Sweden, income differences are huge, but they decrease through taxation, through social programs, generous benefits, etc.</seg>
        <seg id="101">it's different in Japan.</seg>
        <seg id="102">The difference in salaries is initially small.</seg>
        <seg id="103">Taxes are lower.</seg>
        <seg id="104">There are fewer social programs.</seg>
        <seg id="105">And in our analysis of American states, we find the same contrast.</seg>
        <seg id="106">Some states succeed by redistributing income, others by a smaller difference in net income before tax.</seg>
        <seg id="107">We believe it does not matter by what means equality is achieved, as long as it is achieved.</seg>
        <seg id="108">I'm not talking about full equality, but the one in rich and developed market democracies.</seg>
        <seg id="109">Another amazing observation is that it's not just the poor who are influenced by this disparity.</seg>
        <seg id="110">There seems to be a share of truth in John Donne's words: “Man is not an island.”</seg>
        <seg id="111">A number of studies can compare how people in more and less equal countries succeed at every rung of the social ladder.</seg>
        <seg id="112">One such example:</seg>
        <seg id="113">Newborn deaths.</seg>
        <seg id="114">A group of Swedes classified many infant deaths according to the British Register of General Socio-Economic Classification.</seg>
        <seg id="115">This is more of an anachronistic classification according to the profession of fathers, so that single parents are not counted.</seg>
        <seg id="116">And by “low social level” means unskilled professions.</seg>
        <seg id="117">Then there are skilled manual workers, then lower-level white collar workers and up to the top level with highly skilled occupations: doctors, lawyers, directors of large companies.</seg>
        <seg id="118">You see things are going better in Sweden than in the UK in every section of society.</seg>
        <seg id="119">The biggest difference at the lower levels,</seg>
        <seg id="120">but even for the higher ranks there are benefits from a more equal society.</seg>
        <seg id="121">We've shown this on five different data sets affecting educational outcomes and health in the U.S. and internationally.</seg>
        <seg id="122">And that seems to be the big picture: greater equality more strongly changes things at the bottom, but useful for the top too.</seg>
        <seg id="123">But I must still explain what's going on.</seg>
        <seg id="124">I think it's talking everywhere about the psychosocial effects of inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="125">About feeling superior and inferiority, feeling worth and vice versa, feeling respect for oneself and vice versa.</seg>
        <seg id="126">And, of course, that sense of competition that is born of these feelings inflames consumerism in our society.</seg>
        <seg id="127">It also leads to fear for one's status.</seg>
        <seg id="128">We are more worried about how people around us think about us, whether we find us attractive, smart — that worries us.</seg>
        <seg id="129">The more public assessments, the greater the fear of them.</seg>
        <seg id="130">Interestingly, parallel work is being done in social psychology: 208 different studies involving volunteers who were tested for stress hormones in psychological laboratories, to respond to stressful tasks.</seg>
        <seg id="131">Overall, they wanted to observe the kinds of stress that increase levels of cortisol, the main stress hormone.</seg>
        <seg id="132">As a result, situations that included the potential threat of social assessment, the threat of self-esteem or social status, and situations where other people might have given a negative assessment.</seg>
        <seg id="133">Such stressors have a special effect on the physiology of stress.</seg>
        <seg id="134">Nor was it without criticism of us.</seg>
        <seg id="135">Of course, there will be dissenters or people who find it amazing.</seg>
        <seg id="136">I have to tell you, in response to criticism for a collection of data, that we don't choose this data.</seg>
        <seg id="137">Our main rule is if the data source has the necessary indicators for one of the countries being analyzed, we include it in our analysis.</seg>
        <seg id="138">It's the source of information deciding whether this data is real, but not us.</seg>
        <seg id="139">Otherwise we would have created a systematic error.</seg>
        <seg id="140">What is it with other countries?</seg>
        <seg id="141">There are 200 health studies in academic journals in relation to income and equality.</seg>
        <seg id="142">And they are not limited to these countries, but we have excluded others for visibility.</seg>
        <seg id="143">Same countries, same dimensions of inequality, problem after problem.</seg>
        <seg id="144">Why aren't we in control of other factors?</seg>
        <seg id="145">Well, we've shown you that GNP per capita doesn't make any difference.</seg>
        <seg id="146">And, of course, others, using more sophisticated methods, controlled both poverty and educational attainment, and so on.</seg>
        <seg id="147">And what about causality?</seg>
        <seg id="148">Correlation alone does not prove causality.</seg>
        <seg id="149">We spent quite a bit of time doing it.</seg>
        <seg id="150">And indeed, for some of these situations, causation is well known.</seg>
        <seg id="151">A big change in our understanding of the causes of chronic health impacts in the developed world has been how significant the chronic stress of social nature and its effects on immune and cardiovascular system.</seg>
        <seg id="152">For example, violence is becoming more common in unequal societies because people are more sensitive to contempt.</seg>
        <seg id="153">It must be said that to address this problem, we should work on earnings before tax and after.</seg>
        <seg id="154">We need to limit the revenues and extra bonuses of the higher ranks.</seg>
        <seg id="155">I think it is necessary in every way possible to make our bosses responsible for employees.</seg>
        <seg id="156">I want you to leave here with the knowledge that we can improve a person's real quality of life by reducing the income difference between us.</seg>
        <seg id="157">Now we have a foothold point for influencing the psychological welfare of whole societies, and it's really incredible.</seg>

        <seg id="8">You can see that countries on the right, such as Norway and the United States, are twice as rich as Israel, Greece and Portugal on the left.</seg>

        <seg id="23">See, in the equal countries on the left, Japan, Finland, Norway, and Sweden, the rich 20% are 3.5-4 times richer than the poor 20%.</seg>
        <seg id="24">But in unequal countries, in the UK, Portugal, the US and Singapore, the difference is twice as big!</seg>
        <seg id="25">According to these measurements, we are half as equal as other successful democracies.</seg>
        <seg id="26">And now you will see what impact this has on society.</seg>
        <seg id="27">We have collected statistics on social problems that are more common among the poor.</seg>
        <seg id="28">These are internationally comparable data on life expectancy, children's literacy and math skills, infant mortality, homicide rates, incarceration rates, teenage pregnancy, confidence levels, obesity, mental illness, which, according to the standard diagnostic classification, includes drug and alcohol addiction, and finally, data on social mobility.</seg>
        <seg id="29">We put it all in one index.</seg>
        <seg id="30">They are all of equal importance.</seg>
        <seg id="31">The country is, in a way, the average value of this data.</seg>
        <seg id="32">You see the countries in relation to the inequality indicator that was shown at the very beginning. I will return to it again and again as the presentation progresses.</seg>
        <seg id="33">Unequal countries in general have more difficulties with all these social problems.</seg>
        <seg id="34">It's an unusually close relationship. You can see that the correlation is unusually high.</seg>
        <seg id="35">But if you look at the same index of health and social problems in relation to GNP per capita, on Gross National Income, there is no correlation.</seg>
        <seg id="36">We were a little worried that people would think that we were fitting problems to our arguments and just "fitting" the evidence. So we also wrote an article in the British Medical Journal about the UNICEF child well-being index.</seg>
        <seg id="37">The index consists of 40 different parts put together by different people.</seg>
        <seg id="38">Among the criteria:, the presence of books at home, the ability of children to talk to their parents, the level of immunization, the presence of bullying in school.</seg>
        <seg id="39">It includes everything.</seg>
        <seg id="40">And this is all against the background of the same indicator of inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="41">The situation for children is worse in unequal societies.</seg>
        <seg id="42">And this is a statistically significant relationship.</seg>
        <seg id="43">But again, if you look at the level of child well-being in relation to national income per capita, there is no relationship, no hint.</seg>
        <seg id="44">All the data demonstrated shows one thing:</seg>
        <seg id="45">on average, the well-being of our societies no longer depends on national income and economic growth.</seg>
        <seg id="46">They are extremely important in poor countries, but not in the developed world.</seg>
        <seg id="47">The difference between us, and our position in the background of others-that's what makes a huge difference.</seg>
        <seg id="48">I'll show you the fragments of our index.</seg>
        <seg id="49">Here, for example, is trust.</seg>
        <seg id="50">This is the part of the population that agrees that most people can be trusted.</seg>
        <seg id="51">The data is taken from the World Values Survey.</seg>
        <seg id="52">Look, in unequal countries, only 15% of the population trusts others.</seg>
        <seg id="53">And in equal societies, this figure reaches 60-65%.</seg>
        <seg id="54">If you look at the dimensions of the activity of social activity, or social capital, you will notice very similar ratios that are closely related to inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="55">You could say we did the job twice.</seg>
        <seg id="56">First, we analyzed the developed countries, and then, as a control study, we repeated the procedure in 50 American states, asking one question: are things worse on all our indicators in the most unequal states?</seg>
        <seg id="57">Here's the confidence in inequality, according to the federal government's general social survey.</seg>
        <seg id="58">A very similar spread, compared to a similar range of confidence levels.</seg>
        <seg id="59">Same story.</seg>
        <seg id="60">In general, we found that almost everything related to trust at the international level is also shown in our control study.</seg>
        <seg id="61">It's not just a coincidence.</seg>
        <seg id="62">Here is a graph of mental illness.</seg>
        <seg id="63">WHO, using identical diagnostic interviews conducted on random samples of the population, collected results that allow us to compare the level of mental illness in each of the societies.</seg>
        <seg id="64">Here is the percentage of the population who suffered from any mental illness in the past year.</seg>
        <seg id="65">The numbers start at about 8% and go up to almost 24%; whole societies with three times the rate of psychological illness.</seg>
        <seg id="66">Again, this is closely related to inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="67">And here are the crimes.</seg>
        <seg id="68">These red dots represent the American states, and the blue triangles represent the Canadian provinces.</seg>
        <seg id="69">But look at the scale of the differences.</seg>
        <seg id="70">It starts at 15 kills per million and goes up to 150.</seg>
        <seg id="71">This is the proportion of prisoners.</seg>
        <seg id="72">We are talking about a tenfold difference, expressed in a logarithmic scale.</seg>
        <seg id="73">The figures range from 40 to 400 for the number of prisoners in prisons.</seg>
        <seg id="74">These correlations are not simply explained by higher crime.</seg>
        <seg id="75">Yes, in some cases this is partly true.</seg>
        <seg id="76">But most of them involve harsher sentences.</seg>
        <seg id="77">Unequal societies are more likely to maintain the death penalty.</seg>
        <seg id="78">The percentage of children dropping out of school is shown here.</seg>
        <seg id="79">Again, quite a big difference.</seg>
        <seg id="80">It's incredibly malicious when it comes to using talent.</seg>
        <seg id="81">And here is social mobility.</seg>
        <seg id="82">This is a measure of mobility based on income.</seg>
        <seg id="83">Basically, the question is: do rich fathers have rich sons and poor fathers have poor sons, or is there no dependency here?</seg>
        <seg id="84">Among unequal countries, in the UK and the US, the father's income is much more important.</seg>
        <seg id="85">And in the Scandinavian countries, income is already much less significant.</seg>
        <seg id="86">As a result-greater social mobility.</seg>
        <seg id="87">And as we often like to say — I know there are many Americans in the audience — if Americans want to realize the American dream, they should go to Denmark.</seg>
        <seg id="88">(Laughter) (Applause) I have only shown a couple of points, indicated in italics.</seg>
        <seg id="89">A number of other problems could be demonstrated.</seg>
        <seg id="90">All kinds of problems that become more significant among the lower social strata.</seg>
        <seg id="91">But there are endless problems with social gradients that are much worse in unequal countries; and not just slightly, but 2, 10 times worse.</seg>
        <seg id="92">Think about the costs, what it costs people.</seg>
        <seg id="93">Let me go back to the graph shown earlier, where all the data is put together. Let's make two conclusions.</seg>
        <seg id="94">The first. Graph by graph, the less successful countries, and regardless of the result, are from the unequal, and the well-performing ones are the Scandinavian countries and Japan.</seg>
        <seg id="95">Thus, we see a general social dysfunction against the background of inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="96">These are not one or two separate problems. This is a trend.</seg>
        <seg id="97">One more important note about this chart. Let's see below: Sweden and Japan: the countries are different in literally everything.</seg>
        <seg id="98">The position of women, how closely they are connected with the family, is directly opposite, in the conditions of developed countries.</seg>
        <seg id="99">Another very important difference is how they achieve greater equality.</seg>
        <seg id="100">In Sweden, income differences are huge, but they are reduced through taxation, through social programs, generous benefits, etc.</seg>
        <seg id="101">in Japan, everything is different.</seg>
        <seg id="102">The difference in salaries is initially small.</seg>
        <seg id="103">Taxes are lower.</seg>
        <seg id="104">There are fewer social programs.</seg>
        <seg id="105">And in our analysis of the American states, we find the same contrast.</seg>
        <seg id="106">Some states thrive on income redistribution, while others thrive on a smaller difference in net income before taxes.</seg>
        <seg id="107">We believe that it does not matter by what means equality is achieved, as long as it is achieved.</seg>
        <seg id="108">I am not talking about full equality, but about the one that exists in rich and developed market democracies.</seg>
        <seg id="109">Another surprising observation is that it is not only the poor who are affected by this inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="110">There seems to be some truth in John Donne's words: "Man is not an island."</seg>
        <seg id="111">A number of studies compare how well people in more or less equal countries do at each rung of the social ladder.</seg>
        <seg id="112">One such example is:</seg>
        <seg id="113">Mortality among newborns.</seg>
        <seg id="114">A group of Swedes classified many cases of infant mortality according to the British register of general socio-economic classification.</seg>
        <seg id="115">This is rather an anachronistic classification according to the profession of fathers, so single parents are not taken into account.</seg>
        <seg id="116">And by "low social level" we mean unskilled professions.</seg>
        <seg id="117">Next — skilled manual workers, then-white-collar workers of the lowest level and up to the highest level with highly qualified professions: doctors, lawyers, directors of large companies.</seg>
        <seg id="118">You can see that Sweden is doing better than the UK in all sectors of society.</seg>
        <seg id="119">The biggest difference is at the lowest levels,</seg>
        <seg id="120">but even for the higher ranks, there are benefits from a more equal society.</seg>
        <seg id="121">We have shown this in five different data sets that affect educational outcomes and health in the US and internationally.</seg>
        <seg id="122">And this seems to be the general picture: greater equality makes a bigger difference at the bottom, but it is also useful for the top.</seg>
        <seg id="123">But I must still explain what is happening.</seg>
        <seg id="124">I think it's all about the psychosocial consequences of inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="125">About the feeling of superiority and inferiority, about the feeling of one's worth and vice versa, about the feeling of self-respect and vice versa.</seg>
        <seg id="126">And, of course, the sense of competition that is born of these feelings, fuels consumerism in our society.</seg>
        <seg id="127">This also leads to fear for your status.</seg>
        <seg id="128">We worry more about how others think of us, whether we are considered attractive, smart — this worries us.</seg>
        <seg id="129">The more public assessments, the greater the fear of them.</seg>
        <seg id="130">Interestingly, parallel work is being conducted in social psychology: 208 different studies were considered with the participation of volunteers who were tested in psychological laboratories for stress hormones, for reaction to stressful tasks.</seg>
        <seg id="131">In general, they wanted to observe the types of stress that increase the level of cortisol, the main stress hormone.</seg>
        <seg id="132">As a result, such factors were situations that included a potential threat to social assessment, a threat to self-esteem or social status, situations where other people could give a negative assessment.</seg>
        <seg id="133">Just such stressful factors have a special effect on the physiology of stress.</seg>
        <seg id="134">Not without criticism in our address.</seg>
        <seg id="135">Of course, there will be dissenters or people who find this amazing.</seg>
        <seg id="136">I have to tell you, in response to the criticism for the selection of data, that we do not select this data.</seg>
        <seg id="137">Our main rule is that if the data source has the necessary indicators for one of the analyzed countries, we include it in our analysis.</seg>
        <seg id="138">It is the source of the information that decides whether this data is real, but not us.</seg>
        <seg id="139">Otherwise, we would have created a systematic error.</seg>
        <seg id="140">What about other countries?</seg>
        <seg id="141">There are 200 studies of health in relation to income and equality in academic journals.</seg>
        <seg id="142">And they are not limited to these countries, but we have excluded the others for clarity.</seg>
        <seg id="143">Same countries, same dimensions of inequality, problem after problem.</seg>
        <seg id="144">Why don't we control other factors?</seg>
        <seg id="145">Well, we've shown you that GNP per capita doesn't matter.</seg>
        <seg id="146">And, of course, others, using more sophisticated methods, controlled both poverty, and the level of education, and so on.</seg>
        <seg id="147">What about causality?</seg>
        <seg id="148">Correlation alone does not prove causation.</seg>
        <seg id="149">We spent a lot of time on this.</seg>
        <seg id="150">Indeed, for some of these situations, the causal relationships are well known.</seg>
        <seg id="151">A major change in our understanding of the causes of chronic health impacts in the developed world has been the significance of chronic social stress and its impact on the immune and cardiovascular systems.</seg>
        <seg id="152">For example, violence is becoming more common in unequal societies because people are more sensitive to contempt.</seg>
        <seg id="153">I must say that to solve this problem, we should work on the income before and after taxes.</seg>
        <seg id="154">We must limit the income and additional bonuses of the higher ranks.</seg>
        <seg id="155">I think that it is necessary to make our bosses responsible for the employees in every possible way.</seg>
        <seg id="156">I want you to leave here with the knowledge that we can improve a person's real quality of life by reducing the income gap between us.</seg>
        <seg id="157">Now we have a fulcrum for influencing the psychological well-being of entire societies, and this is truly incredible.</seg>
        <seg id="158">Thanks.</seg>
        <seg id="159">(Applause)</seg>

    </hyp>
  <hyp system="Manifold" lang="en">
      <p>
        <seg id="1">You are all well aware of the truth that will be discussed today.</seg>
        <seg id="2">I think the idea of inequality as a divider and destroyer of society was in the air even before the French Revolution.</seg>
        <seg id="3">But now we can see the evidence by comparing the most and least similar societies, and by observing the consequences of inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="4">I will show you this data and explain why there are relationships that will be discussed.</seg>
        <seg id="5">But first look at how dull we are.</seg>
        <seg id="6">(Laughter) I'll start with a paradox.</seg>
        <seg id="7">This shows life expectancy, depending on GNI, or the average level of well-being of countries.</seg>
        <seg id="8">It can be seen that countries on the right, such as Norway and the United States, are twice as rich as Israel, Greece and Portugal on the left.</seg>
        <seg id="9">But this does not affect life expectancy at all.</seg>
        <seg id="10">There is no hint of a relationship.</seg>
        <seg id="11">But within societies, there are strong health gradations affecting all social strata.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Again, life expectancy.</seg>
        <seg id="13">The graph refers to small areas of England and Wales: the poorest on the right, the richest on the left.</seg>
        <seg id="14">There is a huge difference between the poor and everyone else.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Even those who are slightly poorer than the richest are already less healthy than the very top.</seg>
        <seg id="16">So income is very important within our societies, but not between them.</seg>
        <seg id="17">The explanation for this paradox is this: within our societies, we look at relative income or social position, status - at what level we are in relation to others, and what are the distances between us.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Having understood this idea, you will immediately think: what will happen if the difference increases or shrinks, in other words, making the difference in income bigger or smaller?</seg>
        <seg id="19">Now I'll show you that.</seg>
        <seg id="20">All the data used are absolutely real.</seg>
        <seg id="21">I take UN information, as does the World Bank: the scale of the income gap in these rich and developed market democracies.</seg>
        <seg id="22">The indicator used by our team is very simple, you can download it. We consider the difference between the 20% richest and the 20% poorest citizens in each country.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Look, in equal countries on the left, Japan, Finland, Norway, and Sweden, the rich 20% are 3.5-4 times richer than the poor 20%.</seg>
        <seg id="24">But in unequal countries, the UK, Portugal, the US, and Singapore, the difference is twice as big!</seg>
        <seg id="25">According to these measurements, we are half as equal as other successful democracies.</seg>
        <seg id="26">And now you will see what impact this has on society.</seg>
        <seg id="27">We have collected statistics on social problems that are more common among the poor.</seg>
        <seg id="28">These are internationally comparable data on life expectancy, the level of literacy and mathematical training of children, neonatal mortality, homicide rates, the number of prisoners, teenage pregnancy, confidence levels, obesity, mental illness, which, according to the standard diagnostic classification, include drug and alcohol addiction, and finally, data on social mobility.</seg>
        <seg id="29">We put it all in one index.</seg>
        <seg id="30">They are all equally important.</seg>
        <seg id="31">The country is, in a way, the average value of these data.</seg>
        <seg id="32">You see countries in relation to the inequality indicator that was shown at the very beginning. I will go back to it again and again during the presentation.</seg>
        <seg id="33">Unequal countries in general have more difficulty with all these social problems.</seg>
        <seg id="34">This is an unusually close relationship. You see that the correlation is unusually high.</seg>
        <seg id="35">But if you look at the same index of health and social problems in relation to GNP per capita, Gross National Income, there is no correlation anymore.</seg>

        <seg id="39">Everything comes in there.</seg>
        <seg id="40">But this is all against the backdrop of the same measure of inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="41">The situation of children is worse in unequal societies.</seg>
        <seg id="42">And this is a statistically significant relationship.</seg>
        <seg id="43">But again, if you look at the level of children's well-being in relation to national income per capita, there is no correlation, no hint.</seg>
        <seg id="44">All the evidence shows one thing:</seg>
        <seg id="45">On average, the well-being of our societies is no longer dependent on national income and economic growth.</seg>
        <seg id="46">They are essential in poor countries, but not in the developed world.</seg>
        <seg id="47">The difference between us, and our position against others, is what matters most.</seg>
        <seg id="48">I will show you fragments of our index.</seg>
        <seg id="49">Here, for example, is trust.</seg>

        <seg id="58">A very similar spread, compared to a similar range of confidence levels.</seg>
        <seg id="59">The same story.</seg>
        <seg id="60">Overall, we found that almost everything related to trust at the international level manifests itself in the same way in our control study.</seg>
        <seg id="61">It's not just a coincidence.</seg>
        <seg id="62">Here is a graph of mental illness.</seg>
        <seg id="63">The WHO, using identical diagnostic interviews conducted on random samples of the population, has collected results that allow us to compare the level of mental illness in each society.</seg>

        <seg id="66">Again, this is closely linked to inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="67">But here are the crimes.</seg>
        <seg id="68">These red dots show American states, and the blue triangles show Canadian provinces.</seg>
        <seg id="69">But look at the scale of the differences.</seg>
        <seg id="70">It starts with 15 murders per million and reaches 150.</seg>
        <seg id="71">This is the proportion of prisoners.</seg>
        <seg id="72">This is a tenfold difference expressed in the logarithmic scale.</seg>
        <seg id="73">The figures rise from 40 to 400 in terms of the number of prisoners in prisons.</seg>
        <seg id="74">These relationships are not simply explained by higher crime rates.</seg>
        <seg id="75">Yes, in some cases this is partly true.</seg>
        <seg id="76">But for the most part, they are associated with harsher sentences.</seg>
        <seg id="77">Unequal societies are more likely to favour retaining the death penalty.</seg>
        <seg id="78">This shows the percentage of children dropping out of school.</seg>
        <seg id="79">Again, quite a big difference.</seg>
        <seg id="80">It is incredibly harmful when it comes to using talents.</seg>
        <seg id="81">But social mobility.</seg>
        <seg id="82">This is a measure of income-related mobility.</seg>
        <seg id="83">The main question is: do the rich fathers have rich sons and the poor have poor sons, or is there no dependence?</seg>

        <seg id="89">A number of other problems could be demonstrated.</seg>
        <seg id="90">All sorts of problems that become more significant among the lower social strata.</seg>
        <seg id="91">But there are endless problems with social gradients, which are much worse in unequal countries; and not a little bit, but 2, 10 times worse.</seg>
        <seg id="92">Think about the costs, what it costs people.</seg>
        <seg id="93">Let me return to the previously shown graph, where all the data is collected together. Let's draw two conclusions.</seg>
        <seg id="94">First, schedule after schedule, the less prosperous countries, regardless of the result, are out of the equals, and the well-performing ones are the Scandinavian countries and Japan.</seg>
        <seg id="95">Thus, we see a general social dysfunction in the face of inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="96">It's not one, not two separate problems. It's a trend.</seg>
        <seg id="97">Another important point about this schedule. Let's look below: Sweden and Japan: countries are different in literally everything.</seg>
        <seg id="98">The situation of women, how closely they are connected with the family, is exactly the opposite, in the conditions of developed countries.</seg>
        <seg id="99">Another very important difference is how they achieve greater equality.</seg>
        <seg id="100">In Sweden, income differences are huge, but they are reduced through taxation, social programs, generous benefits, etc.</seg>
        <seg id="101">In Japan, however, things are different.</seg>
        <seg id="102">The difference in wages was initially small.</seg>
        <seg id="103">Taxes are lower.</seg>
        <seg id="104">There are fewer social programs.</seg>
        <seg id="105">And in our analysis of American states, we find the same contrast.</seg>
        <seg id="106">Some states thrive on income redistribution, others on a smaller difference in net income before taxes.</seg>
        <seg id="107">We believe that it does not matter by what means equality is achieved as long as it is achieved.</seg>
        <seg id="108">I am not talking about complete equality, but about what exists in rich and developed market democracies.</seg>
        <seg id="109">Another surprising observation is that not only the poor are affected by this inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="110">There seems to be some truth in John Donne's words: "Man is not an island."</seg>
        <seg id="111">A number of studies can compare how people in more or less equal countries succeed at every step of the social ladder.</seg>
        <seg id="112">One such example:</seg>
        <seg id="113">Mortality among newborns.</seg>
        <seg id="114">A group of Swedes classified many cases of infant mortality according to the British register of general socio-economic classification.</seg>
        <seg id="115">It is rather an anachronistic classification according to the profession of fathers, so that single parents are not counted.</seg>
        <seg id="116">And by "low social level" we mean unskilled professions.</seg>
        <seg id="117">Then there are skilled manual workers, then there are low-level white-collar workers and up to the highest level with highly qualified professions: doctors, lawyers, directors of large companies.</seg>
        <seg id="118">You see, things are going better in Sweden than in the UK in all walks of life.</seg>
        <seg id="119">The biggest difference at the lowest levels -</seg>
        <seg id="120">but even for the higher echelons there are benefits from a more equal society.</seg>
        <seg id="121">We showed this on five different sets of data affecting educational outcomes and health in the US and internationally.</seg>
        <seg id="122">And this seems to be the overall picture: greater equality makes a bigger difference at the bottom, but it is also good for the top.</seg>
        <seg id="123">But I still have to explain what is happening.</seg>
        <seg id="124">I think it's all about the psychosocial consequences of inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="125">About a sense of superiority and inferiority, about a sense of one's worth and vice versa, about a sense of self-respect and vice versa.</seg>
        <seg id="126">And, of course, the sense of competition that these feelings generate fuels consumerism in our society.</seg>
        <seg id="127">It also leads to fear for their status.</seg>
        <seg id="128">We are more worried about how others think about us, whether they consider us attractive, smart - this worries us.</seg>
        <seg id="129">The more public assessments, the greater the fear of them.</seg>
        <seg id="130">Interestingly, parallel work is underway in social psychology: 208 different studies involving volunteers who were tested in psychological laboratories for stress hormones, for reactions to stressful tasks, were considered.</seg>
        <seg id="131">In general, they wanted to observe the types of stress that raise levels of cortisol, the main stress hormone.</seg>
        <seg id="132">As a result, such factors turned out to be situations that included a potential threat to social assessment, a threat to self-esteem or social status, situations where other people could give a negative assessment.</seg>
        <seg id="133">Just such stressors have a special effect on the physiology of stress.</seg>
        <seg id="134">There was also criticism of us.</seg>
        <seg id="135">Of course, there will be dissenters or people who find it amazing.</seg>
        <seg id="136">I have to tell you, in response to criticism for the data collection, that we do not choose this data.</seg>
        <seg id="137">Our main rule is that if the data source has the necessary indicators for one of the analyzed countries, we include it in our analysis.</seg>
        <seg id="138">This source of information decides whether this data is real, but not us.</seg>
        <seg id="139">Otherwise, we would have created a systematic error.</seg>
        <seg id="140">What about other countries?</seg>
        <seg id="141">There are 200 studies of health in relation to income and equality in academic journals.</seg>
        <seg id="142">And they are not limited to these countries, but we have excluded others for clarity.</seg>
        <seg id="143">The same countries, the same dimensions of inequality, problem after problem.</seg>
        <seg id="144">Why don't we control other factors?</seg>
        <seg id="145">Well, we showed you that GNP per capita doesn't matter.</seg>
        <seg id="146">And, of course, others, using more sophisticated methods, controlled poverty, education, and so on.</seg>
        <seg id="147">And what about causation?</seg>
        <seg id="148">Correlation alone does not prove causation.</seg>
        <seg id="149">We spent a lot of time on it.</seg>
        <seg id="150">Indeed, for some of these situations, causality is well known.</seg>
        <seg id="151">A big change in our understanding of the causes of chronic health effects in the developed world has been how significant chronic stress of a social nature is and its impact on the immune and cardiovascular systems.</seg>
        <seg id="152">For example, violence is becoming more common in unequal societies because people are more sensitive to contempt.</seg>
        <seg id="153">I must say that in order to solve this problem, we should work on pre-tax and post-tax incomes.</seg>
        <seg id="154">We must limit the income and additional bonuses of the upper echelons.</seg>
        <seg id="155">I think that it is necessary to make our bosses responsible for employees in every possible way.</seg>
        <seg id="156">I want you to get out of here with the realization that we can improve a person's real quality of life by reducing the income gap between us.</seg>
        <seg id="157">Now we have a point of reference for influencing the psychological well-being of entire societies, and this is really incredible.</seg>
        <seg id="158">Thank you.</seg>
        <seg id="159">(Applause)</seg>
      </p>
    </hyp>
  <hyp system="Online-W" lang="en">
      <p>
        <seg id="1">You are all well aware of the truth of what we are going to talk about today.</seg>
        <seg id="2">I think the idea of inequality as a divider and destroyer of society has been in the air since before the French Revolution.</seg>
        <seg id="3">But now we can see the evidence by comparing the most and least similar societies, and by observing the consequences of inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="4">I will show you this evidence and explain why there are correlations that will be discussed.</seg>
        <seg id="5">But first, take a look at how dull the masses we are.</seg>
        <seg id="6">(Laughter) I'll start with a paradox.</seg>
        <seg id="7">It shows life expectancy as a function of GNI, or the average wealth of countries.</seg>
        <seg id="8">You can see that the countries on the right, such as Norway and the United States, are twice as rich as Israel, Greece and Portugal on the left.</seg>
        <seg id="9">But this has absolutely no effect on life expectancy.</seg>
        <seg id="10">There is no hint of a correlation.</seg>
        <seg id="11">But within societies, strong gradations in health, affecting all social strata, are noticeable.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Life expectancy again.</seg>
        <seg id="13">The graph refers to the small areas of England and Wales: the poorest on the right, the richest on the left.</seg>
        <seg id="14">There is a huge difference between the poor and everyone else.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Even those slightly poorer than the richest are already less healthy than the very top.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Thus, income is very important within our societies, but not between them.</seg>
        <seg id="17">The explanation for this paradox is this: Within our societies we look at relative income or social position, status - what level we are in relation to those around us, and what the distances are between us.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Once you understand this idea, you will immediately wonder: what happens when you increase the difference or compress it, in other words, by making the income difference larger or smaller?</seg>
        <seg id="19">I'll show you that in a moment.</seg>
        <seg id="20">All of the data used is absolutely real.</seg>
        <seg id="21">I'm taking UN information, the World Bank has the same information: the scale of the income gap in these rich and developed market democracies.</seg>
        <seg id="22">The indicator used by our team is very simple, you can download it. We count the difference between the richest 20% and the poorest 20% of citizens in each country.</seg>
        <seg id="23">See, in the equal countries on the left, Japan, Finland, Norway, and Sweden, the rich 20% are 3.5-4 times richer than the poor 20%.</seg>
        <seg id="24">But in the unequal countries, the UK, Portugal, the US, and Singapore, the difference is more than double!</seg>
        <seg id="25">According to these measurements, we are half as equal as other successful democracies.</seg>
        <seg id="26">And now you will see what effect this has on society.</seg>
        <seg id="27">We have collected statistics on social problems that are more frequent among the poor.</seg>
        <seg id="28">These are internationally comparable data on life expectancy, children's literacy and math skills, infant mortality, homicide rates, incarceration rates, teen pregnancy rates, trust rates, obesity, mental illnesses, which, according to the standard diagnostic classification, include drug and alcohol addiction, and finally, data on social mobility.</seg>
        <seg id="29">We put it all into one index.</seg>
        <seg id="30">They are all of equal importance.</seg>
        <seg id="31">The country, on the other hand, is sort of the average of these data.</seg>
        <seg id="32">You see countries in relation to the inequality indicator that was shown at the beginning. I'll come back to it again and again as I go through the presentation.</seg>
        <seg id="33">Unequal countries in general have more difficulty with all these social problems.</seg>
        <seg id="34">It's an unusually strong correlation. You can see that the correlation is unusually high.</seg>
        <seg id="35">But if you look at the same index of health and social problems in relation to GNP per capita, Gross National Income, there's no correlation anymore.</seg>
        <seg id="36">We were a little worried that people would think that we were tailoring the problems to our arguments and just "fitting" the evidence. So we also wrote an article in the British Medical Journal about the UNICEF Child Welfare Index.</seg>
        <seg id="37">The index consists of 40 different pieces put together by different people.</seg>
        <seg id="38">Among the criteria are:, having books at home, children being able to talk to their parents, immunization rates, bullying in school.</seg>
        <seg id="39">That includes everything.</seg>
        <seg id="40">And that's all on top of the same inequality index.</seg>
        <seg id="41">Children are worse off in unequal societies.</seg>
        <seg id="42">And it's a statistically significant relationship.</seg>
        <seg id="43">But again, if you look at child well-being in relation to national per capita income, there is no correlation, no hint.</seg>
        <seg id="44">All of the data shown tell us one thing:</seg>
        <seg id="45">On average, the well-being of our societies no longer depends on national income and economic growth.</seg>
        <seg id="46">They are extremely important in poor countries, but not in the developed world.</seg>
        <seg id="47">The difference between us, and our position in relation to others, is what matters most.</seg>
        <seg id="48">Let me show you fragments of our index.</seg>
        <seg id="49">Here, for example, is trust.</seg>
        <seg id="50">This is the part of the population that agrees that most people can be trusted.</seg>
        <seg id="51">The data comes from the World Values Survey.</seg>
        <seg id="52">Here, look, in unequal countries only 15% of the population trusts others.</seg>
        <seg id="53">But in equal societies, that number is as high as 60-65%.</seg>
        <seg id="54">If you look at measures of social activity, or social capital, you notice very similar ratios, closely related to inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="55">You could say we have done the work twice.</seg>
        <seg id="56">First we analyzed developed countries, and then as a control study we repeated the procedure on 50 American states, asking one question: are the most unequal states doing worse on all of our measures?</seg>
        <seg id="57">Here's the confidence in relation to inequality, according to the federal government's General Social Survey.</seg>
        <seg id="58">A very similar spread, compared to a similar range of confidence levels.</seg>
        <seg id="59">Same story.</seg>
        <seg id="60">In general, we find that almost everything about trust at the international level shows up the same way in our control study.</seg>
        <seg id="61">It's not just a coincidence.</seg>
        <seg id="62">Here's a graph of mental illness.</seg>
        <seg id="63">The WHO, using identical diagnostic interviews conducted on random samples of the population, collected results that allow us to compare the level of mental illness in each of the societies.</seg>
        <seg id="64">Here is the percentage of the population who suffered from a mental illness in the past year.</seg>
        <seg id="65">The numbers start at about 8% and go up to almost 24%; whole societies with three times the rate of psychological illness.</seg>
        <seg id="66">Again, this is closely tied to inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="67">And then there's crime.</seg>
        <seg id="68">These red dots show American states and the blue triangles show Canadian provinces.</seg>
        <seg id="69">But look at the scale of the differences.</seg>
        <seg id="70">It starts at 15 murders per million and goes up to 150.</seg>
        <seg id="71">That's the proportion of prisoners.</seg>
        <seg id="72">We are talking about a tenfold difference, expressed on a logarithmic scale.</seg>
        <seg id="73">The numbers increase from 40 to 400 by the number of inmates in prisons.</seg>
        <seg id="74">These correlations are not simply due to higher crime rates.</seg>
        <seg id="75">Yes, in some cases they are, in part.</seg>
        <seg id="76">But for the most part, they are related to harsher sentences.</seg>
        <seg id="77">Unequal societies are more likely to be in favor of retaining the death penalty.</seg>
        <seg id="78">Shown here is the percentage of children dropping out of school.</seg>
        <seg id="79">Again, a pretty big difference.</seg>
        <seg id="80">It's incredibly damaging when it comes to the use of talent.</seg>
        <seg id="81">And here is social mobility.</seg>
        <seg id="82">It's a measure of mobility based on income.</seg>
        <seg id="83">It's basically this: do rich fathers have rich sons and poor fathers have poor sons, or is there no correlation here?</seg>
        <seg id="84">Among unequal countries, in Britain and the United States, the father's income is many times more important.</seg>
        <seg id="85">And in Scandinavian countries, income is much less important.</seg>
        <seg id="86">As a result, there is more social mobility.</seg>
        <seg id="87">And as we often like to say - I know there are a lot of Americans among our listeners - if Americans want to pursue the American dream, they should go to Denmark.</seg>
        <seg id="88">(Laughter) (Applause) I only showed a couple of points in italics.</seg>
        <seg id="89">A number of other problems could have been demonstrated.</seg>
        <seg id="90">All kinds of problems that become more significant among the lower social classes.</seg>
        <seg id="91">But there are endless problems with social gradients that are much worse in unequal countries; and not just a little bit, but 2, 10 times worse.</seg>
        <seg id="92">Think about the costs, what it's costing people.</seg>
        <seg id="93">Let me go back to the graph shown earlier, where all the data is put together. Let's make two conclusions.</seg>
        <seg id="94">One. Graph after graph, the less-successful countries, regardless of the outcome, turn out to be from unequal countries, and the well-successful ones are the Scandinavian countries and Japan.</seg>
        <seg id="95">Thus we see before us a general social dysfunction on the background of inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="96">This is not one or two separate problems. It is a trend.</seg>
        <seg id="97">One more important observation about this graph. Let's look below: Sweden and Japan: the countries are different in literally everything.</seg>
        <seg id="98">The position of women, how closely they are connected to the family, are just the opposite, in the context of developed countries.</seg>
        <seg id="99">Another very important difference is how they achieve more equality.</seg>
        <seg id="100">In Sweden the differences in income are huge, but they are reduced through taxation, through social programs, generous benefits, etc.</seg>
        <seg id="101">It's different in Japan.</seg>
        <seg id="102">The difference in wages is initially small.</seg>
        <seg id="103">Taxes are lower.</seg>
        <seg id="104">There are fewer social programs.</seg>
        <seg id="105">And in our analysis of American states, we find the same contrast.</seg>
        <seg id="106">Some states thrive on income redistribution, while others thrive on a smaller pre-tax net income differential.</seg>
        <seg id="107">We believe that it does not matter by what means equality is achieved as long as it is achieved.</seg>
        <seg id="108">I'm not talking about full equality, but the kind found in rich and advanced market democracies.</seg>
        <seg id="109">Another surprising observation is that the poor are not the only ones affected by this inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="110">There seems to be some truth in John Donne's words, "Man is not an island."</seg>
        <seg id="111">A number of studies compare how people in more and less equal countries succeed at each rung of the social ladder.</seg>
        <seg id="112">One such example:</seg>
        <seg id="113">Infant mortality.</seg>
        <seg id="114">A group of Swedes classified many infant deaths according to the British registry of general socio-economic classification.</seg>
        <seg id="115">This is more of an anachronistic classification according to the occupation of the fathers, so single parents are not counted.</seg>
        <seg id="116">And by "low social level" we mean unskilled occupations.</seg>
        <seg id="117">Next are skilled manual workers, then lower level white collar workers and up to the top level with highly skilled occupations: doctors, lawyers, directors of large companies.</seg>
        <seg id="118">You see, Sweden is doing better than the UK in all walks of life.</seg>
        <seg id="119">The biggest difference is at the lower levels,</seg>
        <seg id="120">but even for the higher ranks there are benefits of a more equal society.</seg>
        <seg id="121">We've shown this in five different sets of data touching on educational outcomes and health in the U.S. and internationally.</seg>
        <seg id="122">And that seems to be the general picture: more equality makes a bigger difference at the bottom, but it's also good for the top.</seg>
        <seg id="123">But I should clarify what's going on.</seg>
        <seg id="124">It seems to me that it is all about the psychosocial consequences of inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="125">About feelings of superiority and inferiority, about feelings of worth and vice versa, about feelings of respect for oneself and vice versa.</seg>
        <seg id="126">And, of course, the sense of competition that these feelings engender fuels consumerism in our society.</seg>
        <seg id="127">It also leads to a fear of one's status.</seg>
        <seg id="128">We worry more about how the people around us think of us, whether they think we're attractive, smart-it worries us.</seg>
        <seg id="129">The more societal evaluations, the greater the fear of them.</seg>
        <seg id="130">Interestingly, parallel work is being done in social psychology: 208 different studies were looked at involving volunteers who were tested in psychological laboratories for stress hormones, for their reaction to stressful tasks.</seg>

        <seg id="135">Of course, there will be dissenters or people who think this is surprising.</seg>
        <seg id="136">I have to tell you, in response to the criticism for the data selection, that we don't choose the data.</seg>
        <seg id="137">Our main rule is that if a data source has the necessary indicators for one of the countries being analyzed, we include it in our analysis.</seg>
        <seg id="138">It is the data source that decides if the data is real, not us.</seg>
        <seg id="139">Otherwise we would create a systematic error.</seg>
        <seg id="140">What about other countries?</seg>
        <seg id="141">There are 200 studies in academic journals of health in relation to income and equity.</seg>
        <seg id="142">And they're not limited to these countries, but we've excluded the others for clarity.</seg>
        <seg id="143">Same countries, same measures of inequality, problem after problem.</seg>
        <seg id="144">Why aren't we controlling for other factors?</seg>
        <seg id="145">Well, we showed you that GNP per capita is irrelevant.</seg>
        <seg id="146">And, of course, others, using more sophisticated methods, have controlled for poverty, education, and so on.</seg>
        <seg id="147">What about causality?</seg>
        <seg id="148">Correlation alone does not prove causality.</seg>
        <seg id="149">We've spent quite a bit of time on this.</seg>
        <seg id="150">Indeed, for some of these situations, causality is well known.</seg>

        <seg id="152">For example, violence is becoming more common in unequal societies because people are more sensitive to contempt.</seg>
        <seg id="153">It must be said that we should work on pre-tax and post-tax income to address this problem.</seg>
        <seg id="154">We need to limit the income and fringe benefits of the upper echelons.</seg>
        <seg id="155">I think we need to hold our bosses accountable for employees in every way possible.</seg>
        <seg id="156">I want you to leave here with the realization that we can improve the real quality of human life by reducing the income differential between us.</seg>
        <seg id="157">Here we are now with a fulcrum to influence the psychological well-being of entire societies, and that's really incredible.</seg>
        <seg id="158">Thank you.</seg>

  <hyp system="NiuTrans" lang="en">
      <p>
        <seg id="1">You all know very well the truth that will be discussed today.</seg>
        <seg id="2">I think the idea of inequality as a separator and destroyer of society was in the air even before the French Revolution.</seg>
        <seg id="3">But now we can see evidence by comparing the most and least similar societies, and by observing the consequences of inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="4">I will show you this data and explain why there are relationships in question.</seg>
        <seg id="5">But first, look at how dull we are.</seg>
        <seg id="6">(Laughter) I'll start with a paradox.</seg>
        <seg id="7">It shows life expectancy depending on GND, or the average level of welfare of countries.</seg>
        <seg id="8">It can be seen that countries on the right, such as Norway and the United States, are twice as rich as Israel, Greece and Portugal on the left.</seg>
        <seg id="9">But this has absolutely no impact on life expectancy.</seg>
        <seg id="10">There is no hint of a relationship.</seg>
        <seg id="11">But within societies, strong gradations in the state of health are noticeable, affecting all social strata.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Again, the average life expectancy.</seg>
        <seg id="13">The chart refers to small areas of England and Wales: the poorest on the right, the richest on the left.</seg>
        <seg id="14">There's a huge difference between the poor and everyone else.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Even those slightly poorer than the richest are already less healthy than the very top.</seg>
        <seg id="16">So income is very important within our societies, but not between them.</seg>
        <seg id="17">The explanation for this paradox is this: within our societies, we look at relative income or social position, status - at what level we are in relation to others, and what are the distances between us.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Having understood this idea, you will immediately think: what will happen when the difference increases or shrinks, in other words, making the difference in income greater or less?</seg>
        <seg id="19">Now I'll show you that.</seg>
        <seg id="20">All the data used is absolutely real.</seg>
        <seg id="21">I take information from the UN, the World Bank has the same: the scale of income differences in these rich and developed market democracies.</seg>
        <seg id="22">We count the difference between 20% of the richest and 20% of the poorest citizens in each country.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Look, in equal countries on the left, in Japan, Finland, Norway, and Sweden, the rich 20% are 3.5-4 times richer than the 20% of the poor.</seg>
        <seg id="24">But in unequal countries, in Great Britain, Portugal, USA and Singapore, the difference is twice as big!</seg>
        <seg id="25">According to these measurements, we are twice as equal as other successful democratic states.</seg>
        <seg id="26">And now you will see what impact this has on society.</seg>
        <seg id="27">We have collected statistics on social issues that are more common among the poor.</seg>
        <seg id="28">These are internationally comparable data on life expectancy, level of literacy and mathematical training of children, mortality of newborns, murder rate, number of prisoners, teenage pregnancy, level of trust, obesity, mental illness, which, according to the standard diagnostic classification, include drug and alcohol addiction, and finally, data on social mobility.</seg>
        <seg id="29">We put it all in one index.</seg>
        <seg id="30">They all have the same importance.</seg>
        <seg id="31">The country is a kind of average value of this data.</seg>
        <seg id="32">You see countries in relation to the inequality indicator that was shown at the very beginning. I will return to it again and again during the presentation.</seg>
        <seg id="33">Unequal countries as a whole have more difficulties with all these social problems.</seg>
        <seg id="34">You see that the correlation is unusually high.</seg>
        <seg id="35">But if you look at the same index of health and social problems in relation to GNP per capita, the Gross National Income, there is no correlation.</seg>
        <seg id="36">We were a bit worried that people would think that we were selecting problems according to our arguments and just "fitting" the evidence. So we also wrote an article in the British Medical Journal about the UNICEF Child Wellbeing Index.</seg>
        <seg id="37">The index consists of 40 different parts, put together by different people.</seg>
        <seg id="38">Among the criteria: the presence of books at home, the ability of children to talk to their parents, the level of immunization, the presence of bullying at school.</seg>
        <seg id="39">Everything is included there.</seg>
        <seg id="40">But this is against the background of the same indicator of inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="41">The situation for children is worse in unequal societies.</seg>
        <seg id="42">And this is a statistically significant relationship.</seg>
        <seg id="43">But again, if you look at the level of children's well-being in relation to national income per capita, there is no relationship, no hint.</seg>
        <seg id="44">All the data demonstrated suggests one thing:</seg>
        <seg id="45">On average, the welfare of our societies no longer depends on national income and economic growth.</seg>
        <seg id="46">They are extremely important in poor countries, but not in the developed world.</seg>
        <seg id="47">The difference between us and our position against others is what makes a huge difference.</seg>
        <seg id="48">I will show you fragments of our index.</seg>
        <seg id="49">For example, trust.</seg>
        <seg id="50">It's a part of the population that agrees that most people can be trusted.</seg>
        <seg id="51">The data is taken from the World Values Study.</seg>
        <seg id="52">Look, in unequal countries, only 15% of the population trusts others.</seg>
        <seg id="53">And in equal societies this figure reaches 60-65%.</seg>
        <seg id="54">If you look at the measurements of social activity, or social capital, you will notice very similar ratios, closely related to inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="55">We did the work twice.</seg>
        <seg id="56">First we analyzed developed countries, and then, as a control study, we repeated the procedure in 50 US states, asking one question: is things worse by all our indicators in the most unequal states?</seg>
        <seg id="57">Here's trust in inequality, according to a general social survey of the federal government.</seg>
        <seg id="58">A very similar spread compared to the same range of confidence levels.</seg>
        <seg id="59">It's the same story.</seg>
        <seg id="60">Overall, we found that almost everything related to trust internationally manifests itself in the same way in our control study.</seg>
        <seg id="61">It's not just a coincidence.</seg>
        <seg id="62">Here is a chart of mental illness.</seg>
        <seg id="63">WHO, using identical diagnostic interviews conducted on random samples of the population, collected results that allow us to compare the level of mental illness in each society.</seg>
        <seg id="64">Here you can see the percentage of the population who suffered from any mental illness last year.</seg>
        <seg id="65">The figures start at around 8% and rise to almost 24%; entire societies with three times the level of psychological illness.</seg>
        <seg id="66">Once again, this is closely linked to inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="67">But here are the crimes.</seg>
        <seg id="68">These red dots show American states, and the blue triangles show Canadian provinces.</seg>
        <seg id="69">But look at the scale of the differences.</seg>
        <seg id="70">It starts at 15 murders per million and reaches 150.</seg>
        <seg id="71">This is the proportion of prisoners.</seg>
        <seg id="72">We are talking about a tenfold difference expressed on a logarithmic scale.</seg>
        <seg id="73">The figures are rising from 40 to 400 in terms of the number of prisoners in prisons.</seg>
        <seg id="74">These relationships are not explained simply by higher crime.</seg>
        <seg id="75">Yes, in some cases it is partly so.</seg>
        <seg id="76">But for the most part, they involve tougher sentences.</seg>
        <seg id="77">Unequal societies are more likely to advocate preserving the death penalty.</seg>
        <seg id="78">The percentage of children dropping out of school is shown here.</seg>
        <seg id="79">Again, quite a big difference.</seg>
        <seg id="80">It is incredibly harmful when it comes to using talents.</seg>
        <seg id="81">But social mobility.</seg>
        <seg id="82">This is a measurement of mobility depending on income.</seg>
        <seg id="83">Basically, the question is: do the rich fathers have rich sons and the poor have poor sons, or is there no dependence here?</seg>
        <seg id="84">Among unequal countries, in Great Britain and the United States, the father's income is many times more important.</seg>
        <seg id="85">And in Scandinavian countries, income is already much less significant.</seg>
        <seg id="86">The result is greater social mobility.</seg>
        <seg id="87">And as we often like to say - I know there are many Americans among the audience - if Americans want to realize the American dream, they should go to Denmark.</seg>
        <seg id="88">(Laughter) (Applause) I showed only a couple of moments marked in italics.</seg>
        <seg id="89">A number of other problems could be demonstrated.</seg>
        <seg id="90">All sorts of problems that become more significant among the lower social strata.</seg>
        <seg id="91">But there are endless problems with social gradients, which are much worse in unequal countries; and not a little bit, but 2, 10 times worse.</seg>
        <seg id="92">Think about the costs, what it costs people.</seg>
        <seg id="93">Let me return to the previously shown chart, where all the data is collected together.</seg>
        <seg id="94">First, schedule after schedule, the less successful countries, regardless of the result, turn out to be unequal, while the Scandinavian countries and Japan are doing well.</seg>
        <seg id="95">Thus, we see a general social dysfunction against the background of inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="96">This is not one or two separate problems.</seg>
        <seg id="97">Let's see below: Sweden and Japan: the countries are different in literally everything.</seg>
        <seg id="98">The situation of women, how closely they are connected with the family, is exactly the opposite, in the conditions of developed countries.</seg>
        <seg id="99">Another very important difference is how they achieve greater equality.</seg>
        <seg id="100">In Sweden, income differences are huge, but they are reduced through taxation, through social programs, generous benefits, etc.</seg>
        <seg id="101">In Japan, however, everything is different.</seg>
        <seg id="102">The difference in salaries is initially small.</seg>
        <seg id="103">Taxes are lower.</seg>
        <seg id="104">There are fewer social programs.</seg>
        <seg id="105">And in our analysis of US states we find the same contrast.</seg>
        <seg id="106">Some states succeed by redistributing income, others by making less difference in net income before tax.</seg>
        <seg id="107">We believe that it doesn't matter by what means equality is achieved, as long as it is achieved.</seg>
        <seg id="108">I am not talking about full equality, but about what exists in rich and developed market democracies.</seg>
        <seg id="109">Another surprising observation is that it's not just the poor who are affected by this inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="110">There seems to be some truth in John Donna's words: "Man is not an island."</seg>
        <seg id="111">A number of studies compare how people succeed in more or less equal countries at each step of the social ladder.</seg>
        <seg id="112">One such example:</seg>
        <seg id="113">Deaths among newborns.</seg>
        <seg id="114">A group of Swedes classified many infant mortality cases according to the British register of general socio-economic classification.</seg>
        <seg id="115">This is rather an anachronistic classification according to the profession of fathers, so that single parents are not counted.</seg>
        <seg id="116">And by "low social level" we mean unqualified professions.</seg>
        <seg id="117">Then there are skilled manual workers, then lower-level white-collar workers up to the highest level with highly qualified professions: doctors, lawyers, directors of large companies.</seg>
        <seg id="118">You see, things are going better in Sweden than in Great Britain in all segments of society.</seg>
        <seg id="119">The biggest difference is at lower levels,</seg>
        <seg id="120">But even for the higher levels there are benefits from a more equal society.</seg>
        <seg id="121">We showed this in five different collections of data affecting educational outcomes and health in the United States and internationally.</seg>
        <seg id="122">And this seems to be the overall picture: greater equality changes things more at the bottom, but is also beneficial for the top.</seg>
        <seg id="123">But I still have to explain what is happening.</seg>
        <seg id="124">It seems to me that everywhere we are talking about the psychosocial consequences of inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="125">A sense of superiority and inferiority, a sense of one's value and vice versa, a sense of self-respect and vice versa.</seg>
        <seg id="126">And, of course, the sense of competition that is born of these feelings inflames consumerism in our society.</seg>
        <seg id="127">It also leads to fear for one's status.</seg>
        <seg id="128">We are more worried about how others think about us, whether they consider us attractive, smart - this worries us.</seg>
        <seg id="129">The more public assessments, the greater the fear of them.</seg>
        <seg id="130">Interestingly, parallel work is being conducted in social psychology: 208 different studies were considered with the participation of volunteers, who were tested in psychological laboratories for stress hormones, for reaction to stress tasks.</seg>
        <seg id="131">Overall, they wanted to observe types of stress that increase levels of cortisol, the main stress hormone.</seg>
        <seg id="132">As a result, such factors turned out to be situations that included a potential threat to social assessment, a threat to self-esteem or social status, and situations where other people could give a negative assessment.</seg>
        <seg id="133">Just such stress factors have a special effect on the physiology of stress.</seg>
        <seg id="134">There was criticism against us.</seg>
        <seg id="135">Of course, there will be dissenters or people who find it surprising.</seg>
        <seg id="136">I must tell you, in response to criticism for the selection of data, that we do not choose this data.</seg>
        <seg id="137">Our main rule is that if a data source has the necessary indicators for one of the countries analyzed, we include it in our analysis.</seg>
        <seg id="138">This source of information decides whether this data is real, but not us.</seg>
        <seg id="139">Otherwise we would have created a systematic error.</seg>
        <seg id="140">What about other countries?</seg>
        <seg id="141">There are 200 studies of health in relation to income and equality in academic journals.</seg>
        <seg id="142">And they are not limited to these countries, but we have excluded other ones for clarity.</seg>
        <seg id="143">The same countries, the same dimensions of inequality, problem after problem.</seg>
        <seg id="144">Why don't we control other factors?</seg>
        <seg id="145">Well, we showed you that GNP per capita does not matter.</seg>
        <seg id="146">And, of course, others, using more complex methods, controlled poverty, the level of education, and so on.</seg>
        <seg id="147">And what about causality?</seg>
        <seg id="148">Correlation itself does not prove causality.</seg>
        <seg id="149">We spent a lot of time doing this.</seg>
        <seg id="150">Indeed, for some of these situations, causal relationships are well known.</seg>
        <seg id="151">A big change in our understanding of the causes of chronic health effects in the developed world was how significant chronic stress of a social nature and its impact on the immune and cardiovascular systems is.</seg>
        <seg id="152">For example, violence is becoming more common in unequal societies, because people are more sensitive to contempt.</seg>
        <seg id="153">I must say that to solve this problem, we need to work on income before and after tax deduction.</seg>
        <seg id="154">We must limit the income and additional bonuses of senior executives.</seg>
        <seg id="155">I think it's necessary to make our bosses responsible for employees in every possible way.</seg>
        <seg id="156">I want you to leave here with the realization that we can improve a person's real quality of life by reducing the income difference between us.</seg>
        <seg id="157">Now we have a foothold to influence the psychological well-being of entire societies, and this is really incredible.</seg>
        <seg id="158">Thank you.</seg>

        <seg id="7">It shows life expectancy depending on GNI, or the average level of wealth of countries.</seg>
        <seg id="8">It can be seen that countries on the right, such as Norway and the United States, are twice as rich as Israel, Greece and Portugal on the left.</seg>
        <seg id="9">But this does not affect life expectancy at all.</seg>
        <seg id="10">There is no hint of a relationship.</seg>
        <seg id="11">But within societies, strong gradations in health are noticeable, affecting all social strata.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Life expectancy again.</seg>
        <seg id="13">The graph refers to small areas in England and Wales, with the poorest on the right and the richest on the left.</seg>
        <seg id="14">There is a huge difference between the poor and everyone else.</seg>

        <seg id="19">I'll show you this now.</seg>
        <seg id="20">All data used is absolutely real.</seg>
        <seg id="21">I take information from the UN, the same is from the World Bank: the scale of income disparities in these rich and developed market democracies.</seg>
        <seg id="22">The metric used by our team is very simple, you can download it. We count the difference between the richest 20% and the poorest 20% in each country.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Look, in the equal countries on the left, in Japan, Finland, Norway and Sweden, the rich 20% are 3.5-4 times richer than the poor 20%.</seg>
        <seg id="24">But in unequal countries, in the UK, Portugal, USA and Singapore, the difference is twice as large!</seg>
        <seg id="25">According to these measurements, we are half as equal compared to other successful democracies.</seg>
        <seg id="26">Now you will see what impact this has on society.</seg>
        <seg id="27">We have collected statistics on social problems that are more common among the poor.</seg>
        <seg id="28">These are internationally comparable data on life expectancy, literacy and mathematical education of children, newborn mortality, homicide rate, number of prisoners, teenage pregnancy, confidence level, obesity, mental illness, which, according to the standard diagnostic classification, include drugs and alcohol. dependencies, and finally, data on social mobility.</seg>
        <seg id="29">We put it all in one index.</seg>
        <seg id="30">They are all of the same importance.</seg>
        <seg id="31">The country is, in a way, the average of these data.</seg>
        <seg id="32">You see countries in terms of the inequality score that was shown at the very beginning. I will come back to it again and again throughout the presentation.</seg>
        <seg id="33">Unequal countries in general have more difficulty with all of these social problems.</seg>
        <seg id="34">This is an unusually close bond. You can see that the correlation is unusually high.</seg>
        <seg id="35">But if you look at the same index of health and social problems in relation to GNP per capita, to Gross National Income, there is no longer any correlation.</seg>

        <seg id="47">The difference between us and our position against the background of others is what is of great importance.</seg>
        <seg id="48">I will show you fragments of our index.</seg>
        <seg id="49">Take trust, for example.</seg>
        <seg id="50">This is the segment of the population that agrees that most people can be trusted.</seg>
        <seg id="51">Data taken from the World Values Survey.</seg>

        <seg id="57">Here is the credibility of inequality, according to the federal government's general social survey.</seg>
        <seg id="58">A very similar range compared to a similar range of confidence levels.</seg>
        <seg id="59">The same story.</seg>
        <seg id="60">Overall, we found that almost everything related to international trust shows up in the same way in our follow-up study.</seg>
        <seg id="61">This is not just a coincidence.</seg>
        <seg id="62">Here is a graph of mental illness.</seg>
        <seg id="63">WHO, using identical diagnostic interviews conducted on random samples of the population, has collected results that allow us to compare the incidence of mental illness in each of the societies.</seg>
        <seg id="64">Shown here is the percentage of the population that suffered from some kind of mental illness in the past year.</seg>
        <seg id="65">The numbers start at around 8% and go up to almost 24%; whole societies with three times the level of psychological illness.</seg>
        <seg id="66">Again, this is closely related to inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="67">And here is the crime.</seg>
        <seg id="68">These red dots represent the American states and the blue triangles represent the Canadian provinces.</seg>
        <seg id="69">But look at the scale of the difference.</seg>
        <seg id="70">It starts at 15 kills per million and goes up to 150.</seg>
        <seg id="71">This is the proportion of prisoners.</seg>
        <seg id="72">This is a tenfold difference expressed on a logarithmic scale.</seg>
        <seg id="73">The numbers rise from 40 to 400 for the number of inmates in prisons.</seg>
        <seg id="74">These relationships are not simply explained by higher crime rates.</seg>
        <seg id="75">Yes, in some cases this is partly true.</seg>
        <seg id="76">But for the most part they are associated with harsher sentences.</seg>
        <seg id="77">Unequal societies are more often in favor of retaining the death penalty.</seg>
        <seg id="78">Shown here is the percentage of children dropping out of school.</seg>
        <seg id="79">Again, quite a big difference.</seg>
        <seg id="80">It's incredibly harmful when it comes to talent use.</seg>
        <seg id="81">And here is social mobility.</seg>
        <seg id="82">It is a measure of mobility based on income.</seg>
        <seg id="83">Basically, we are talking about the following: do rich fathers have rich sons, and poor fathers have poor sons, or is there no dependence?</seg>
        <seg id="84">Among unequal countries, in the UK and the USA, the father's income is many times more important.</seg>
        <seg id="85">And in the Scandinavian countries, income is already much less significant.</seg>
        <seg id="86">As a result, greater social mobility.</seg>
        <seg id="87">And as we often like to say - I know there are many Americans in the audience - if Americans want to fulfill the American Dream, they should go to Denmark.</seg>
        <seg id="88">(Laughter) (Applause) I've only shown a couple of points in italics.</seg>
        <seg id="89">A number of other problems could be demonstrated.</seg>
        <seg id="90">All kinds of problems that become more significant among the lower social strata.</seg>
        <seg id="91">But there are endless problems with social gradients, which are much worse in unequal countries; and not just a little, but 2, 10 times worse.</seg>
        <seg id="92">Think about the cost, what it costs people.</seg>
        <seg id="93">Let me go back to the graph shown earlier, where all the data is brought together. Let's draw two conclusions.</seg>
        <seg id="94">First. Graph by graph, the less successful countries, and regardless of the result, turn out to be unequal, and the Scandinavian countries and Japan that do well.</seg>
        <seg id="95">Thus, we see before us a general social dysfunction against the background of inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="96">These are not one, not two separate problems. This is a trend.</seg>
        <seg id="97">Another important note about this graph. Let's see below: Sweden and Japan: countries are different in literally everything.</seg>
        <seg id="98">The position of women, how closely they are connected with the family, is exactly the opposite, in the conditions of developed countries.</seg>
        <seg id="99">Another very important difference is how they achieve greater equality.</seg>
        <seg id="100">In Sweden, income gaps are huge, but they are reduced through taxation, social programs, generous benefits, etc.</seg>
        <seg id="101">in Japan, it's different.</seg>
        <seg id="102">The salary gap is initially small.</seg>
        <seg id="103">Taxes below.</seg>
        <seg id="104">There are fewer social programs.</seg>
        <seg id="105">And in our analysis of the American states, we find the same contrast.</seg>
        <seg id="106">Some states do well with income redistribution, others do better with smaller differences in net income before tax.</seg>
        <seg id="107">We believe that it does not matter by what means equality is achieved, as long as it is achieved.</seg>
        <seg id="108">I'm not talking about full equality, but about that which exists in rich and developed market democracies.</seg>
        <seg id="109">Another surprising observation is that it is not only the poor who are affected by this inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="110">There seems to be some truth in John Donne's words: "Man is not an island."</seg>
        <seg id="111">A number of studies can compare how people in more and less equal countries do well at every rung of the social ladder.</seg>
        <seg id="112">One such example:</seg>
        <seg id="113">Mortality among newborns.</seg>
        <seg id="114">A group of Swedes have classified many of the infant mortality cases according to the British register of general socio-economic classification.</seg>
        <seg id="115">This is rather an anachronistic classification according to the profession of fathers, so single parents are not counted.</seg>
        <seg id="116">And “low social level” means unskilled professions.</seg>
        <seg id="117">Further - skilled manual workers, then - white collars of the lower level and up to the highest level with highly qualified professions: doctors, lawyers, directors of large companies.</seg>
        <seg id="118">You see, Sweden is doing better than the UK in all walks of life.</seg>
        <seg id="119">The biggest difference is at the lower levels,</seg>
        <seg id="120">but even for the upper echelons there are benefits from a more equal society.</seg>
        <seg id="121">We have shown this in five different datasets affecting educational outcomes and health in the United States and internationally.</seg>
        <seg id="122">And this seems to be the big picture: more equality changes the situation at the bottom more, but it is also useful for the top.</seg>
        <seg id="123">But I still have to explain what is happening.</seg>
        <seg id="124">It seems to me that we are talking everywhere about the psychosocial consequences of inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="125">About the feeling of superiority and inferiority, about the feeling of one's worth and vice versa, about the feeling of respect for oneself and vice versa.</seg>
        <seg id="126">And, of course, the sense of competition that is born of these feelings fuels consumerism in our society.</seg>
        <seg id="127">It also leads to fear for your status.</seg>
        <seg id="128">We worry more about how others think of us, whether they consider us attractive, smart - this worries us.</seg>
        <seg id="129">The more public assessments, the greater the fear of them.</seg>
        <seg id="130">Interestingly, parallel work is underway in social psychology: 208 different studies with the participation of volunteers were reviewed, who were tested in psychological laboratories for stress hormones, for reaction to stressful tasks.</seg>
        <seg id="131">Overall, they wanted to observe the types of stress that increase levels of cortisol, the main stress hormone.</seg>
        <seg id="132">As a result, such factors turned out to be situations that included a potential threat to social assessment, a threat to self-esteem or social status, situations where other people could give a negative assessment.</seg>
        <seg id="133">It is these stress factors that have a particular influence on the physiology of stress.</seg>
        <seg id="134">Not without criticism addressed to us.</seg>
        <seg id="135">Of course, there are disagreements or people who find this amazing.</seg>
        <seg id="136">I have to tell you, in response to criticism for the data collection, that we do not select this data.</seg>
        <seg id="137">Our main rule is that if the data source has the necessary indicators for one of the analyzed countries, we include it in our analysis.</seg>
        <seg id="138">It is the source of information that decides if this data is real, but not us.</seg>
        <seg id="139">Otherwise, we would create a systematic error.</seg>
        <seg id="140">What about other countries?</seg>
        <seg id="141">There are 200 health studies in relation to income and equity in academic journals.</seg>
        <seg id="142">And they are not limited to these countries, but we have excluded others for clarity.</seg>
        <seg id="143">The same countries, the same dimensions of inequality, problem after problem.</seg>
        <seg id="144">Why don't we control other factors?</seg>
        <seg id="145">Well, we showed you that GNP per capita doesn't matter.</seg>
        <seg id="146">And, of course, others, using more sophisticated methods, controlled both poverty and the level of education, and so on.</seg>
        <seg id="147">What about causality?</seg>
        <seg id="148">Correlation by itself does not prove causality.</seg>
        <seg id="149">We spent a lot of time on this.</seg>
        <seg id="150">Indeed, for some of these situations, causation is well known.</seg>
        <seg id="151">A big change in our understanding of the causes of chronic health effects in the developed world has been how significant chronic social stress and its effects on the immune and cardiovascular systems are.</seg>
        <seg id="152">For example, violence is becoming more common in unequal societies because people are more sensitive to contempt.</seg>
        <seg id="153">I must say that in order to solve this problem, we need to work on income before and after taxes.</seg>
        <seg id="154">We need to limit income and additional bonuses for senior executives.</seg>
        <seg id="155">I think it is necessary to make our bosses responsible for employees in every possible way.</seg>
        <seg id="156">I want you to leave here knowing that we can improve the real quality of human life by reducing the difference in income between us.</seg>
        <seg id="157">Now we have a foothold for influencing the psychological well-being of entire societies, and this is truly incredible.</seg>
        <seg id="158">Thank you.</seg>
        <seg id="159">(Applause)</seg>

    </hyp>
  <hyp system="Online-A" lang="en">
      <p>
        <seg id="1">You are all well aware of the truth that will be discussed today.</seg>
        <seg id="2">I think the idea of inequality as a divider and destroyer of society was in the air even before the French Revolution.</seg>
        <seg id="3">But now we can see the evidence by comparing the most and least similar societies, and by observing the consequences of inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="4">I'll show you this data and explain why there are relationships that will be discussed.</seg>
        <seg id="5">But first, look at how dull we are.</seg>
        <seg id="6">(Laughter) I'll start with a paradox.</seg>
        <seg id="7">It shows life expectancy depending on GNI, or the average level of well-being of countries.</seg>
        <seg id="8">It can be seen that countries on the right, such as Norway and the United States, are twice as rich as Israel, Greece and Portugal on the left.</seg>
        <seg id="9">But this does not affect life expectancy at all.</seg>
        <seg id="10">There is no hint of interconnection.</seg>
        <seg id="11">But within societies, there are strong gradations in the state of health, affecting all social strata.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Again, average life expectancy.</seg>
        <seg id="13">The graph refers to small areas of England and Wales: the poorest on the right, the richest on the left.</seg>
        <seg id="14">There's a huge difference between the poor and everyone else.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Even those who are slightly poorer than the richest are already less healthy than the very top.</seg>
        <seg id="16">So income is very important within our societies, but not between them.</seg>
        <seg id="17">The explanation for this paradox is that within our societies we look at relative income or social position, status — at what level we are in relation to others, and what are the distances between us.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Once you understand this idea, you will immediately think: what will happen if the difference increases or shrinks, in other words, making the difference in income more or less?</seg>
        <seg id="19">I'll show you that now.</seg>
        <seg id="20">All the data used is absolutely real.</seg>
        <seg id="21">I take the UN information, the World Bank has the same: the scale of income disparities in these rich and developed market democracies.</seg>
        <seg id="22">The indicator used by our team is very simple, you can download it. We count the difference between the richest 20% and the poorest 20% in each country.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Look, in equal countries on the left, Japan, Finland, Norway and Sweden, the rich 20% are 3.5-4 times richer than the poor 20%.</seg>
        <seg id="24">But in unequal countries, in the UK, Portugal, USA and Singapore, the difference is more than twice!</seg>
        <seg id="25">According to these dimensions, we are half as equal as other successful democracies.</seg>
        <seg id="26">And now you will see the impact this has on society.</seg>
        <seg id="27">We have collected statistics on social problems that are more frequent among the poor.</seg>
        <seg id="28">These are internationally comparable data on life expectancy, literacy and mathematical training of children, newborn mortality, homicide rate, number of prisoners, teenage pregnancy, trust level, obesity, mental illness, which, according to the standard diagnostic classification, include drug and alcohol dependence, and finally, data on social mobility.</seg>
        <seg id="29">We put it all in one index.</seg>
        <seg id="30">They are all equally important.</seg>
        <seg id="31">The country is, in a way, the average value of these data.</seg>
        <seg id="32">You see countries in terms of the inequality indicator that was shown at the very beginning. I'll come back to it again and again as the presentation progresses.</seg>
        <seg id="33">Unequal countries in general have more difficulties with all these social problems.</seg>
        <seg id="34">It's an unusually close connection. You can see that the correlation is unusually high.</seg>
        <seg id="35">But if you look at the same index of health and social problems in relation to GNP per capita, gross national income, there is no correlation.</seg>
        <seg id="36">We were a little worried that people would think that we were matching the problems to our arguments and just "fitting" the evidence. So we also wrote an article in the British Medical Journal about the UNICEF Child Wellbeing Index.</seg>
        <seg id="37">The index consists of 40 different parts put together by different people.</seg>
        <seg id="38">Among the criteria: the availability of books at home, the ability of children to talk to their parents, the level of immunization, the presence of bullying at school.</seg>
        <seg id="39">Everything goes in.</seg>
        <seg id="40">But this is all against the background of the same indicator of inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="41">Children's situation is worse in unequal societies.</seg>
        <seg id="42">And that's a statistically significant relationship.</seg>
        <seg id="43">But again, if you look at the level of child well-being in relation to national per capita income, there is no correlation, no hint.</seg>
        <seg id="44">All the data demonstrated say one thing:</seg>
        <seg id="45">on average, the well-being of our societies is no longer dependent on national income and economic growth.</seg>
        <seg id="46">They are extremely important in poor countries, but not in the developed world.</seg>
        <seg id="47">The difference between us and our position against the background of others is what makes a huge difference.</seg>
        <seg id="48">I'll show you snippets of our index.</seg>
        <seg id="49">That's trust, for example.</seg>
        <seg id="50">It's a part of the population that agrees that most people can be trusted.</seg>
        <seg id="51">The data is from the World Values Survey.</seg>
        <seg id="52">Look, in unequal countries, only 15% of the population trusts others.</seg>
        <seg id="53">And in equal societies, this figure reaches 60-65%.</seg>
        <seg id="54">If you look at the measurements of social activity, or social capital, you will notice very similar relationships closely related to inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="55">You could say we've done the job twice.</seg>
        <seg id="56">First, we analyzed developed countries, and then as a control study, we repeated the procedure in 50 American states, asking one question: are things worse for all our indicators in the most unequal states?</seg>
        <seg id="57">Here's trust in relation to inequality, according to the federal government's general social research.</seg>
        <seg id="58">Very similar spread, compared to the same range of trust levels.</seg>
        <seg id="59">Same story.</seg>
        <seg id="60">Overall, we found that almost everything related to trust at the international level is also manifested in our control study.</seg>
        <seg id="61">It's not just a coincidence.</seg>
        <seg id="62">Here's a graph of mental illness.</seg>
        <seg id="63">WHO, using identical diagnostic interviews conducted on random samples of the population, has collected results that allow us to compare the rate of mental illness in each of the societies.</seg>
        <seg id="64">Here is the percentage of the population who suffered from any mental illness in the past year.</seg>
        <seg id="65">The numbers start at about 8% and rise to almost 24%; entire societies with triple levels of psychological illness.</seg>
        <seg id="66">And again, this is closely related to inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="67">And here are the crimes.</seg>
        <seg id="68">These red dots show the American states, and the blue triangles represent the Canadian provinces.</seg>
        <seg id="69">But look at the scale of the differences.</seg>
        <seg id="70">It starts with 15 murders per million and reaches 150.</seg>
        <seg id="71">This is the proportion of prisoners.</seg>
        <seg id="72">We are talking about a tenfold difference, expressed in a logarithmic scale.</seg>
        <seg id="73">The numbers rise from 40 to 400 in prisons.</seg>
        <seg id="74">These relationships are not simply explained by higher crime.</seg>
        <seg id="75">Yes, in some cases this is partly true.</seg>
        <seg id="76">But for the most part, they are associated with harsher sentences.</seg>
        <seg id="77">Unequal societies are more likely to advocate retaining the death penalty.</seg>
        <seg id="78">It shows the drop-out rate.</seg>
        <seg id="79">Again, quite a big difference.</seg>
        <seg id="80">It's incredibly harmful when it comes to using talent.</seg>
        <seg id="81">And here's social mobility.</seg>
        <seg id="82">It's a measurement of mobility based on income.</seg>
        <seg id="83">Basically, it's about the following: Do rich fathers have rich sons and poor fathers have poor sons, or is there no addiction here?</seg>
        <seg id="84">Among unequal countries, in the UK and the US, the father's income is much more important.</seg>
        <seg id="85">And in the Scandinavian countries, income is much less significant.</seg>

        <seg id="87">And as we often like to say — I know there are a lot of Americans in the audience — if Americans want to pursue the American dream, they should go to Denmark.</seg>

        <seg id="89">A number of other problems could be demonstrated.</seg>
        <seg id="90">All sorts of problems that become more significant among the lower social strata.</seg>
        <seg id="91">But there are endless problems with social gradients that are much worse in unequal countries; and not a little bit, but 2, 10 times worse.</seg>
        <seg id="92">Think about the costs, what it costs people.</seg>
        <seg id="93">Let me go back to the graph shown earlier, where all the data is put together. Let's draw two conclusions.</seg>
        <seg id="94">first. Schedule after schedule, less prosperous countries, regardless of the result, are from unequal, and the Scandinavian countries and Japan are doing well.</seg>

        <seg id="96">These are not one, not two separate problems. It's a trend.</seg>

        <seg id="103">Taxes are lower.</seg>

        <seg id="130">Interestingly, parallel work is carried out in social psychology: 208 different studies were considered with the participation of volunteers who were tested in psychological laboratories for stress hormones, for a reaction to stressful tasks.</seg>
        <seg id="131">Overall, they wanted to observe types of stress that increase levels of cortisol, the main stress hormone.</seg>
        <seg id="132">As a result, such factors were situations that included a potential threat to social assessment, a threat to self-esteem or social status, situations where other people could give a negative assessment.</seg>
        <seg id="133">Just such stress factors have a special effect on the physiology of stress.</seg>
        <seg id="134">Not without criticism in our address.</seg>
        <seg id="135">Of course, there will be dissenters or people who find this surprising.</seg>
        <seg id="136">I have to tell you, in response to criticism for the compilation of data, that we don't choose that data.</seg>
        <seg id="137">Our main rule is that if the data source has the necessary indicators for one of the analyzed countries, we include it in our analysis.</seg>
        <seg id="138">It's the source of the information that decides whether that data is real, but not us.</seg>
        <seg id="139">Otherwise, we would have created a systematic error.</seg>
        <seg id="140">What about other countries?</seg>
        <seg id="141">There are 200 studies of health in relation to income and equality in academic journals.</seg>
        <seg id="142">And they are not limited to these countries, but we have excluded others for clarity.</seg>
        <seg id="143">The same countries, the same dimensions of inequality, problem after problem.</seg>
        <seg id="144">Why don't we control other factors?</seg>
        <seg id="145">Well, we've shown you that GNP per capita doesn't matter.</seg>
        <seg id="146">And, of course, others, using more sophisticated methods, controlled poverty, educational attained levels, and so on.</seg>
        <seg id="147">What about causality?</seg>
        <seg id="148">Correlation alone does not prove causality.</seg>
        <seg id="149">We spent a lot of time doing that.</seg>
        <seg id="150">Indeed, for some of these situations, causal relationships are well known.</seg>
        <seg id="151">A big change in our understanding of the causes of chronic health effects in the developed world has been how significant chronic social stress and its impact on the immune and cardiovascular systems is.</seg>
        <seg id="152">For example, violence is becoming more common in unequal societies because people are more sensitive to contempt.</seg>
        <seg id="153">I must say that to solve this problem, we should work on pre-tax and post-tax revenues.</seg>
        <seg id="154">We must limit the income and additional bonuses of the top levels.</seg>
        <seg id="155">I think we need to get our bosses to be responsible for employees in every way possible.</seg>
        <seg id="156">I want you to leave here with the realization that we can improve a person's real quality of life by reducing the income gap between us.</seg>
        <seg id="157">Now we have a foothold for influencing the psychological well-being of entire societies, and this is really incredible.</seg>

  <hyp system="AFRL" lang="en">
      <p>
        <seg id="1">You all know well the truth that will be discussed today.</seg>
        <seg id="2">I think the idea of inequality as a divider and destroyer of society was in the air even before the French Revolution.</seg>
        <seg id="3">But we can now see evidence comparing the most and least similar societies, and seeing the consequences of inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="4">I will show you this data and explain why there are the relationships that will be discussed.</seg>
        <seg id="5">But first look at how we are a despondent mass.</seg>
        <seg id="6">(Laughter) I'll start with a paradox.</seg>
        <seg id="7">It shows life expectancy according to GNI, or the average level of well-being of countries.</seg>
        <seg id="8">It is clear that countries on the right, such as Norway and the US, are twice as rich as Israel, Greece and Portugal on the left.</seg>
        <seg id="9">But it has absolutely no effect on life expectancy.</seg>
        <seg id="10">There is no hint of a relationship.</seg>
        <seg id="11">But within societies, strong health gradations affecting all social strata are noticeable.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Again, life expectancy.</seg>
        <seg id="13">The chart refers to small areas of England and Wales: the poorest on the right, the richest on the left.</seg>
        <seg id="14">A huge difference between the poor and everyone else.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Even those slightly poorer than the richest are already less healthy than the top.</seg>
        <seg id="16">So income is very important within our societies, but not between them.</seg>
        <seg id="17">The explanation for this paradox is this: within our societies we look at relative income or social position, status - at what level we are relative to others, and what are the distances between us.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Having understood this idea, you will immediately think: what happens when the difference increases or shrinks, in other words, making the difference in income bigger or smaller?</seg>
        <seg id="19">Now I will show you this.</seg>
        <seg id="20">All the data used is absolutely real.</seg>
        <seg id="21">I take the UN's information, and the World Bank has the same: the scale of the income gap in these rich and advanced market democracies.</seg>
        <seg id="22">The indicator used by our team is very simple, you can download it. We consider the difference between the 20% richest and the 20% poorest citizens in each country.</seg>
        <seg id="23">See, in equal countries on the left, Japan, Finland, Norway, and Sweden, the rich 20% is 3.5-4 times richer than the poor 20%.</seg>
        <seg id="24">But in unequal countries, in the UK, Portugal, the US and Singapore, the difference is twice as big!</seg>
        <seg id="25">According to these measurements, we are twice as unequal as other successful democracies.</seg>
        <seg id="26">And now you will see what impact this has on society.</seg>
        <seg id="27">We collected statistics on social problems that are more frequent among the poor.</seg>
        <seg id="28">These are internationally comparable data on life expectancy, literacy and mathematical training of children, infant mortality, homicide rate, number of prisoners, teenage pregnancy, level of confidence, etc.</seg>
        <seg id="29">We put it all in one index.</seg>
        <seg id="30">They are all of equal importance.</seg>
        <seg id="31">The country is, of a kind, the average value of these data.</seg>
        <seg id="32">You see the countries in terms of the inequality figure that was shown at the beginning. I will revisit it again and again as the presentation progresses.</seg>
        <seg id="33">Unequal countries in general have more difficulty with all these social problems.</seg>
        <seg id="34">You see that the correlation is unusually high.</seg>
        <seg id="35">But if you look at the same index of health and social problems in relation to per capita GNP and Gross National Income, there is no correlation.</seg>
        <seg id="36">We were a bit worried that people would think we were picking up problems for our arguments and just "fitted" the evidence.</seg>
        <seg id="37">The index consists of 40 different parts, collected by different people together.</seg>
        <seg id="38">Among the criteria: the presence of books at home, the ability of children to talk to parents, the level of immunization, the presence of bullying in school.</seg>
        <seg id="39">It includes everything.</seg>
        <seg id="40">But it's all against the same indicator of inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="41">The situation for children is worse in unequal societies.</seg>
        <seg id="42">And this is a statistically significant relationship.</seg>
        <seg id="43">But again, if you look at the level of child welfare in relation to national income per capita, there is no correlation, no hint.</seg>
        <seg id="44">All the data demonstrated suggest one thing:</seg>
        <seg id="45">On average, the well-being of our societies no longer depends on national income and economic growth.</seg>
        <seg id="46">They are essential in poor countries, but not in the developed world.</seg>
        <seg id="47">The difference between us and our position against the background of others is what matters most.</seg>
        <seg id="48">I will show you fragments of our index.</seg>
        <seg id="49">For example, trust.</seg>
        <seg id="50">This is a part of the population that agrees that most people can be trusted.</seg>
        <seg id="51">Data taken from the World Values Survey.</seg>
        <seg id="52">Look, in unequal countries, only 15% of the population trusts others.</seg>
        <seg id="53">And in equal societies, this figure reaches 60-65%.</seg>
        <seg id="54">If you look at measures of social activity, or social capital, you will notice very similar ratios closely related to inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="55">We have done the work twice.</seg>
        <seg id="56">First, we analyzed developed countries, and then, as a benchmark study, we repeated the procedure in 50 U.S. states, asking one question: Are things worse for all our indicators in the most unequal states?</seg>
        <seg id="57">Here's the credibility of inequality, according to a general social study by the federal government.</seg>
        <seg id="58">A very similar spread, compared to a similar range of confidence levels.</seg>
        <seg id="59">The same story.</seg>
        <seg id="60">Overall, we found that almost everything related to trust at the international level manifests itself similarly in our benchmark study.</seg>
        <seg id="61">It's not just a coincidence.</seg>
        <seg id="62">Here is a timeline of mental illness.</seg>
        <seg id="63">WHO, through identical diagnostic interviews conducted on random samples of the population, collected results that allow us to compare the level of mental illness in each of the societies.</seg>
        <seg id="64">This shows the percentage of the population who suffered from some kind of mental illness last year.</seg>
        <seg id="65">The numbers start at around 8% and rise to almost 24%; entire societies with triple the rate of psychological illness.</seg>
        <seg id="66">Again, this is closely linked to inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="67">But here are the crimes.</seg>
        <seg id="68">These red dots show the US states, and the blue triangles show the Canadian provinces.</seg>
        <seg id="69">But look at the scale of the differences.</seg>
        <seg id="70">It starts with 15 murders per million and reaches 150.</seg>
        <seg id="71">This is the proportion of prisoners.</seg>
        <seg id="72">This is a tenfold difference, expressed in a logarithmic scale.</seg>
        <seg id="73">The figures rise from 40 to 400 in terms of the number of inmates in prisons.</seg>
        <seg id="74">These connections are not simply explained by higher crime.</seg>
        <seg id="75">Yes, in some cases this is partly true.</seg>
        <seg id="76">But they are mostly associated with harsher sentences.</seg>
        <seg id="77">Unequal societies are more often in favour of retaining the death penalty.</seg>
        <seg id="78">This shows the percentage of children dropping out.</seg>
        <seg id="79">Again, a pretty big difference.</seg>
        <seg id="80">It's incredibly malicious when it comes to using talent.</seg>
        <seg id="81">But social mobility.</seg>
        <seg id="82">This is a measure of income-based mobility.</seg>
        <seg id="83">Basically, the question is: do rich fathers have rich sons, and poor ones have poor sons, or is there no dependence?</seg>
        <seg id="84">Among unequal countries, in the UK and the US, the father's income is many times more important.</seg>
        <seg id="85">And in Scandinavian countries, income is already much less important.</seg>
        <seg id="86">As a result, there is greater social mobility.</seg>
        <seg id="87">And as we often like to say  ⁇  I know there are many Americans among the audience  ⁇  if Americans want to realize the American dream, they should go to Denmark.</seg>
        <seg id="88">(Laughter) (Applause) I showed only a couple of italics.</seg>
        <seg id="89">A number of other problems could be demonstrated.</seg>
        <seg id="90">Any kind of problem that becomes more significant among the lower social strata.</seg>
        <seg id="91">But there are endless problems with social gradients that are much worse in unequal countries; and not just a little bit, but 2, 10 times worse.</seg>
        <seg id="92">Think about the costs, what it costs people.</seg>
        <seg id="93">Let me go back to the previously shown chart, where all the data is put together.</seg>
        <seg id="94">First, graph by graph, the less successful countries, regardless of the result, are out of the unequal, and the well-performing ones are the Scandinavian countries and Japan.</seg>
        <seg id="95">So we see a general social dysfunction against the backdrop of inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="96">This is not one or two separate problems. It is a trend.</seg>
        <seg id="97">Let's take a look below: Sweden and Japan: countries are different literally in everything.</seg>
        <seg id="98">The situation of women, how closely they are connected with the family, is exactly the opposite in the conditions of developed countries.</seg>
        <seg id="99">Another very important difference is how they achieve greater equality.</seg>
        <seg id="100">In Sweden, the differences in income are huge, but they are reduced through taxation, through social programs, generous benefits, etc.</seg>
        <seg id="101">In Japan, things are different.</seg>
        <seg id="102">The wage gap is initially small.</seg>
        <seg id="103">Taxes are lower.</seg>
        <seg id="104">There are fewer social programmes.</seg>
        <seg id="105">And in our analysis of American states, we find the same contrast.</seg>
        <seg id="106">Some states succeed by redistributing revenue, others by making a smaller difference in net income before taxes.</seg>
        <seg id="107">We believe that it does not matter by what means equality is achieved as long as it is achieved.</seg>
        <seg id="108">I am not talking about full equality, but about what exists in rich and developed market democracies.</seg>
        <seg id="109">Another surprising observation is that not only the poor are affected by this inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="110">There seems to be some truth in John Donn's words: "Man is not an island."</seg>
        <seg id="111">A number of studies compare how people in more and less equal countries excel at every step of the social ladder.</seg>
        <seg id="112">One such example:</seg>
        <seg id="113">Mortality among newborns.</seg>
        <seg id="114">A group of Swedes classified many infant deaths according to the British Register of General Socio-Economic Classification.</seg>
        <seg id="115">It is rather anachronistic classification according to the profession of fathers, so single parents are not counted.</seg>
        <seg id="116">And by "low social level" there are unskilled professions.</seg>
        <seg id="117">Next  ⁇  skilled manual workers, then  ⁇  low-level white collar workers and up to the top level with highly qualified professions: doctors, lawyers, directors of large companies.</seg>
        <seg id="118">You see, things are going better in Sweden than in the UK in all walks of life.</seg>
        <seg id="119">The biggest difference at lower levels,</seg>
        <seg id="120">But even at the top, there are benefits from a more equal society.</seg>
        <seg id="121">We have shown this on five different data sets affecting educational outcomes and health in the US and internationally.</seg>
        <seg id="122">And this seems to be the overall picture: greater equality makes a bigger difference at the bottom, but it is also useful for the top.</seg>
        <seg id="123">But I still have to explain what is happening.</seg>
        <seg id="124">I think the psychosocial consequences of inequality are everywhere.</seg>
        <seg id="125">About feeling superior and inferior, about feeling valued and vice versa, about feeling respected for yourself and vice versa.</seg>
        <seg id="126">And, of course, the sense of competition that these feelings create fuels consumerism in our society.</seg>
        <seg id="127">It also leads to fear for one's status.</seg>
        <seg id="128">We are more concerned about how people around us think about us, whether they consider us attractive, smart - this worries us.</seg>
        <seg id="129">The more public assessments, the greater the fear.</seg>
        <seg id="130">Interestingly, parallel work is underway in social psychology: 208 different studies involving volunteers, who were tested in psychological laboratories for stress hormones, for reactions to stress, were considered.</seg>
        <seg id="131">Overall, they wanted to observe the types of stress that raise levels of cortisol, the main stress hormone.</seg>
        <seg id="132">As a result, such factors turned out to be situations that included a potential threat to social assessment, a threat to self-esteem or social status, situations where other people could give a negative assessment.</seg>
        <seg id="133">Just such stressors have a special impact on the physiology of stress.</seg>
        <seg id="134">There was also no criticism of us.</seg>
        <seg id="135">Of course, there will be dissenters or people who find this surprising.</seg>
        <seg id="136">I have to tell you, in response to the criticism over the data set, that we don't choose this data.</seg>
        <seg id="137">Our main rule is that if a data source has the necessary indicators for one of the analyzed countries, we include it in our analysis.</seg>
        <seg id="138">This source of information decides whether this data is real, but not us.</seg>
        <seg id="139">Otherwise we would have created a systematic error.</seg>
        <seg id="140">What about other countries?</seg>
        <seg id="141">Academic journals have 200 studies on health in relation to income and equality.</seg>
        <seg id="142">And they are not limited to these countries, but we have excluded others for illustrative purposes.</seg>
        <seg id="143">Same countries, same dimensions of inequality, problem after problem.</seg>
        <seg id="144">Why don't we control other factors?</seg>
        <seg id="145">Well, we have shown you that GNP per capita is irrelevant.</seg>
        <seg id="146">And, of course, others, using more sophisticated methods, controlled poverty, education, and so on.</seg>
        <seg id="147">What about causality?</seg>
        <seg id="148">The correlation alone does not prove causation.</seg>
        <seg id="149">We spent a lot of time on this.</seg>
        <seg id="150">Indeed, for some of these situations, cause and effect are well known.</seg>
        <seg id="151">A big change in our understanding of the causes of chronic health impacts in the developed world has been the significance of chronic social stress and its impact on the immune and cardiovascular systems.</seg>
        <seg id="152">For example, violence is becoming more common in unequal societies because people are more sensitive to contempt.</seg>
        <seg id="153">To address this, we should work on pre-tax and post-tax revenues.</seg>
        <seg id="154">We need to limit the income and additional bonuses of the top ranks.</seg>
        <seg id="155">I think it is necessary to make our bosses responsible for employees in every possible way.</seg>
        <seg id="156">I want you to go away with the realization that we can improve a person's real quality of life by reducing the income gap between us.</seg>
        <seg id="157">Now we have a point of reference for influencing the psychological well-being of entire societies, and that's really incredible.</seg>

        <seg id="26">And now you will see the impact this has on society.</seg>
        <seg id="27">We have collected statistics on social problems that are more common among the poor.</seg>
        <seg id="28">These are internationally comparable data on life expectancy, child literacy and numeracy, infant mortality, homicide rates, incarceration rates, teenage pregnancies, confidence levels, obesity, mental illness, which, according to the standard diagnostic classification, includes drug and alcohol addiction, and finally, data on social mobility.</seg>

        <seg id="38">Among the criteria are: the presence of books at home, the ability of children to talk to their parents, the level of immunization, the presence of bullying at school.</seg>
        <seg id="39">That includes everything.</seg>
        <seg id="40">But this is all against the background of the same indicator of inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="41">Children are worse off in unequal societies.</seg>
        <seg id="42">And this is a statistically significant relationship.</seg>
        <seg id="43">But again, if you look at the level of child welfare in relation to national income per capita, there is no correlation, no hint.</seg>
        <seg id="44">All of the demonstrated data suggest one thing:</seg>
        <seg id="45">On average, the well-being of our societies is no longer dependent on national income and economic growth.</seg>
        <seg id="46">They are extremely important in poor countries, but not in the developed world.</seg>
        <seg id="47">The difference between us, and our position in comparison with others, is what matters.</seg>
        <seg id="48">I will show you fragments of our index.</seg>
        <seg id="49">Here, for example, is trust.</seg>
        <seg id="50">This is the part of the population that agrees that most people can be trusted.</seg>
        <seg id="51">The data comes from the World Values Survey.</seg>
        <seg id="52">Look, in unequal countries, only 15 of the population trusts others.</seg>
        <seg id="53">And in equal societies, this figure reaches 60-65.</seg>
        <seg id="54">If you look at the measurements of social activity, or social capital, you will notice very similar ratios, closely related to inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="55">You can say we did the job twice.</seg>
        <seg id="56">First, we analyzed the developed countries, and then, as a benchmark study, we repeated the procedure in the 50 American states, asking one question: Are things worse on all of our indicators in the most unequal states?</seg>
        <seg id="57">That's the credibility of inequality, according to the federal government's overall social study.</seg>
        <seg id="58">Very similar spread, compared to a similar range of confidence levels.</seg>
        <seg id="59">The same story.</seg>
        <seg id="60">Overall, we found that almost everything related to trust at the international level is manifested in the same way in our benchmark study.</seg>
        <seg id="61">This is not just a coincidence.</seg>
        <seg id="62">Here is a chart of mental illness.</seg>
        <seg id="63">The WHO, using identical diagnostic interviews conducted on random samples of the population, has collected results that allow us to compare the level of mental illness in each of the societies.</seg>
        <seg id="64">Here is the percentage of the population that suffered from any mental illness last year.</seg>
        <seg id="65">Figures start at around 8 and rise to almost 24; entire societies with a threefold rate of psychological illness.</seg>
        <seg id="66">Again, this is closely related to inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="67">But here are the crimes.</seg>
        <seg id="68">These red dots show the American states, and the blue triangles show the Canadian provinces.</seg>
        <seg id="69">But look at the scale of the differences.</seg>
        <seg id="70">It starts at 15 murders per million and goes up to 150.</seg>
        <seg id="71">This is the proportion of prisoners.</seg>
        <seg id="72">This is a tenfold difference expressed on a logarithmic scale.</seg>
        <seg id="73">The numbers rise from 40 to 400 in terms of the number of prisoners in prisons.</seg>
        <seg id="74">These connections are not simply explained by higher crime.</seg>
        <seg id="75">Yes, in some cases this is partly true.</seg>
        <seg id="76">But for the most part, they are associated with tougher sentences.</seg>
        <seg id="77">Unequal societies are more likely to support the retention of the death penalty.</seg>
        <seg id="78">It shows the percentage of children dropping out of school.</seg>
        <seg id="79">Again, a pretty big difference.</seg>
        <seg id="80">It is incredibly harmful when it comes to the use of talents.</seg>
        <seg id="81">But here is social mobility.</seg>
        <seg id="82">This is a measure of mobility based on income.</seg>
        <seg id="83">Basically, the question is: do rich fathers have rich sons, and poor fathers have poor sons, or is there no dependency?</seg>
        <seg id="84">Among unequal countries, in the UK and the US, the father's income is many times more important.</seg>
        <seg id="85">And in the Scandinavian countries, income is already much less significant.</seg>
        <seg id="86">As a result, there is greater social mobility.</seg>
        <seg id="87">And as we often like to say - I know there are many Americans in the audience - if Americans want to realize the American dream, they should go to Denmark.</seg>
        <seg id="88">(Laughter) (Applause) I showed just a couple of things in italics.</seg>
        <seg id="89">A number of other problems could be demonstrated.</seg>
        <seg id="90">All kinds of problems that become more significant among the lower social classes.</seg>
        <seg id="91">But there are endless problems with social gradients, which are much worse in unequal countries; and not just a little, but 2, 10 times worse.</seg>
        <seg id="92">Think about the costs, about what it costs people.</seg>
        <seg id="93">Let me go back to the previously shown chart, where all the data are put together.</seg>
        <seg id="94">First, chart by chart, the less prosperous countries, regardless of the outcome, end up being unequal, while the better performing countries are the Scandinavian countries and Japan.</seg>
        <seg id="95">Thus, we see a general social dysfunction against the backdrop of inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="96">This is not one, not two separate problems. It is a trend.</seg>
        <seg id="97">Another important note about this chart: Let's take a look below: Sweden and Japan: countries are literally different in everything.</seg>
        <seg id="98">The situation of women, how closely they are connected to the family, is directly opposite, in the context of developed countries.</seg>
        <seg id="99">Another very important difference is how they achieve greater equality.</seg>
        <seg id="100">In Sweden, income gaps are huge, but they are narrowing through taxation, social programs, generous benefits, etc.</seg>
        <seg id="101">In Japan, things are different.</seg>
        <seg id="102">The wage gap is initially small.</seg>
        <seg id="103">Taxes are lower.</seg>
        <seg id="104">There are fewer social programs.</seg>
        <seg id="105">And in our analysis of American states, we find the same contrast.</seg>
        <seg id="106">Some states thrive on income redistribution, others on smaller differences in net income before taxes.</seg>
        <seg id="107">We believe that it does not matter by what means equality is achieved, as long as it is achieved.</seg>
        <seg id="108">I am not talking about full equality, but about the one that exists in rich and developed market democracies.</seg>
        <seg id="109">Another surprising observation is that it is not just the poor who are affected by this inequality.</seg>
        <seg id="110">There seems to be some truth in the words of John Donne: "Man is not an island."</seg>
        <seg id="111">A number of studies compare how people in more and less equal countries do well at every step of the social ladder.</seg>
        <seg id="112">One such example is:</seg>
        <seg id="113">Mortality among newborns.</seg>
        <seg id="114">A group of Swedes have classified many cases of infant mortality according to the British General Socio-Economic Classification Register.</seg>
        <seg id="115">Rather, it is an anachronistic classification according to the father's profession, so that single parents are not counted.</seg>
        <seg id="116">And by "low social level" we mean unskilled professions.</seg>
        <seg id="117">Then there are skilled manual workers, then white-collar workers of the lowest level and up to the highest level with highly qualified professions: doctors, lawyers, directors of large companies.</seg>
        <seg id="118">You see, things are doing better in Sweden than in Britain at all levels of society.</seg>
        <seg id="119">The biggest difference at the lower levels,</seg>
        <seg id="120">but even for the higher levels there are benefits from a more equal society.</seg>
        <seg id="121">We have shown this in five different sets of data affecting educational outcomes and health in the U.S. and internationally.</seg>
        <seg id="122">And this seems to be the big picture: greater equality makes a big difference at the bottom, but it is also good for the top.</seg>
        <seg id="123">But I still have to explain what is happening.</seg>
        <seg id="124">I think we are talking about the psychosocial consequences of inequality everywhere.</seg>
        <seg id="125">About the feeling of superiority and inferiority, about the feeling of one's worth and vice versa, about the feeling of self-respect and vice versa.</seg>
        <seg id="126">And, of course, the sense of competition that these feelings generate is fueling consumerism in our society.</seg>
        <seg id="127">It also leads to fear for your status.</seg>
        <seg id="128">We are more concerned about how others think about us, whether they think we are attractive, intelligent - this is what worries us.</seg>
        <seg id="129">The more public assessments, the greater the fear of them.</seg>
        <seg id="130">Interestingly, parallel work is being carried out in social psychology: 208 different studies were reviewed with the participation of volunteers, who were tested in psychological laboratories for stress hormones, for reactions to stressful tasks.</seg>
        <seg id="131">Overall, they wanted to observe the types of stress that raise levels of cortisol, the main stress hormone.</seg>
        <seg id="132">As a result, these factors turned out to be situations that included a potential threat to social evaluation, a threat to self-esteem or social status, and situations where other people could give a negative assessment.</seg>
        <seg id="133">It is these stressors that have a particular impact on the physiology of stress.</seg>
        <seg id="134">There has also been criticism of us.</seg>
        <seg id="135">Of course, there will be dissenters or people who find it surprising.</seg>
        <seg id="136">I have to tell you, in response to the criticism over the collection of data, that we do not choose this data.</seg>
        <seg id="137">Our main rule is that if the data source has the necessary indicators for one of the analyzed countries, we include it in our analysis.</seg>
        <seg id="138">It is the source of information that decides whether the data is real, but not us.</seg>
        <seg id="139">Otherwise, we would have created a systematic error.</seg>
        <seg id="140">What about other countries?</seg>
        <seg id="141">There are 200 studies of health in relation to income and equality in academic journals.</seg>
        <seg id="142">And they are not limited to these countries, but we have excluded others for the sake of clarity.</seg>
        <seg id="143">The same countries, the same dimensions of inequality, problem after problem.</seg>
        <seg id="144">Why do we not control other factors?</seg>
        <seg id="145">Well, we have shown you that GDP per capita does not matter.</seg>
        <seg id="146">And, of course, others, using more sophisticated methods, controlled poverty, the level of education, and so on.</seg>
        <seg id="147">And what about causality?</seg>
        <seg id="148">Correlation alone does not prove causality.</seg>
        <seg id="149">We spent a lot of time on it.</seg>
        <seg id="150">Indeed, for some of these situations, the cause-and-effect relationship is well known.</seg>
        <seg id="151">A big change in our understanding of the causes of chronic health effects in the developed world has been the significance of chronic social stress and its effects on the immune and cardiovascular systems.</seg>
        <seg id="152">For example, violence is becoming more common in unequal societies because people are more sensitive to contempt.</seg>
        <seg id="153">It must be said that in order to solve this problem, we need to work on pre-tax and post-tax revenues.</seg>
        <seg id="154">We need to limit the earnings and additional bonuses of the top ranks.</seg>
        <seg id="155">I think it is necessary to make our bosses take responsibility for employees in every possible way.</seg>
        <seg id="156">I want you to leave here with the knowledge that we can improve the real quality of human life by reducing the income gap between us.</seg>
        <seg id="157">Now we have a foothold to influence the psychological wellbeing of entire societies, and this is truly incredible.</seg>
        <seg id="158">Thank you.</seg>
        <seg id="159">(Applause)</seg>

        <seg id="3">Российский хоккеист "Вашингтон Кэпиталз" Александр Овечкин рассказал о подготовке клуба к предстоящему возобновлению сезона в НХЛ.</seg>

        <seg id="8">Тем не менее, Овечкин также признал, что ему и его партнерам еще предстоит вспомнить часть тактических комбинаций: "У нас есть не так много времени, чтобы наиграть большинство и вспомнить мартовские наработки, как двигать шайбу в таких ситуациях.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Но время все же еще есть: уверен, что в Торонто часть тренировок мы этому еще посвятим.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Большинство и меньшинство важны в плей-офф.</seg>

        <seg id="1">В последнее время участились кибератаки на деловой мир.</seg>
        <seg id="2">Доступ к данным таких компаний, как JP Morgan, Yahoo, Home Depot и Target, причинил им убытки в сотни миллионов, а в некоторых случаях даже в миллиарды долларов.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Чтобы нанести ущерб мировой экономике, не требуется слишком много подобных атак.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Государственный сектор также не защищён от подобных проблем.</seg>
        <seg id="5">С 2012 года по 2014 год произошла значительная утечка данных в Управлении кадровой службы США.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Был нарушен доступ к данным по проверке благонадёжности и отпечатков пальцев 22 миллионов сотрудников.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Известны попытки хакеров, спонсируемых государственными органами, повлиять на результаты выборов в ряде стран с помощью украденных данных.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Два последних случая раскрытия большого объёма данных касаются Бундестага, федерального парламента Германии, и кража имейлов Демократического национального комитета США.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Киберугроза затрагивает наши демократические процессы.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Ситуация даже ухудшается.</seg>
        <seg id="11">По мере развития компьютерной технологии системы защиты данных становятся всё более уязвимыми.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Вызывает озабоченность и новый вид компьютерной технологии — вычисления на квантовых компьютерах, которые используют микроскопические свойства природы для колоссального увеличения вычислительной мощности.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Он настолько мощный, что сможет взломать многие современные системы шифрования.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Неужели ситуация настолько безнадёжна?</seg>
        <seg id="15">Может, уже пора паковать наши жизненно необходимые данные и готовиться к скорому цифровому апокалипсису?</seg>
        <seg id="16">Я бы сказал: «Ещё не время».</seg>
        <seg id="17">Квантовые компьютеры пока ещё находятся в разработке, и потребуется много лет, прежде чем они будут применены на практике.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Важнее тот факт, что происходят крупные прорывы в области шифрования.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Для меня это особенно захватывающее время в истории защищённых коммуникаций.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Около 15 лет назад, когда я узнал о новой возможности создания квантовых эффектов, которых не существует в природе, я очень воодушевился.</seg>
        <seg id="21">Меня заинтриговала идея применения фундаментальных законов физики для создания более защищённого шифрования.</seg>
        <seg id="22">Сегодня ряд компаний и лабораторий по всему миру, включая и мою, работают над этими технологиями для применения их на практике.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Верно.</seg>
        <seg id="24">Сейчас мы готовимся бороться с квантом при помощи кванта.</seg>
        <seg id="25">Так как же это всё работает?</seg>
        <seg id="26">Во-первых, давайте сделаем небольшой экскурс в мир шифрования.</seg>
        <seg id="27">Для этого нам понадобится портфель, некоторые важные документы, которые хотим отправить нашему другу, Джеймсу Бонду, и замок, чтобы всё сохранить в безопасности.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Так как наши сведения совершенно секретны, нам нужен особенный портфель.</seg>
        <seg id="29">У него специальный кодовый замóк: когда он закрыт, преобразовывает весь текст в документах в случайные числа.</seg>
        <seg id="30">Вы кладёте документы в портфель, закрываете замóк — в этот самый момент все документы преобразуются в случайные числа — и отправляете портфель Джеймсу.</seg>
        <seg id="31">Пока портфель в пути, вы звоните Джеймсу, чтобы сообщить код.</seg>
        <seg id="32">Получив портфель, он вводит код, документы расшифровываются, и вуаля — вы только что отправили зашифрованное сообщение Джеймсу Бонду.</seg>
        <seg id="33">(Смех) Забавный пример, но он иллюстрирует три важных элемента кодирования.</seg>
        <seg id="34">Код — мы называем его «ключ шифрования».</seg>
        <seg id="35">Это как пароль.</seg>
        <seg id="36">Звонок Джеймсу для сообщения ему кода комбинации замкá.</seg>
        <seg id="37">Это называется «обмен ключами» —</seg>
        <seg id="38">гарантия того, что вы безопасно получите ключ шифрования от нужного места.</seg>
        <seg id="39">И замóк, который кодирует и декодирует документ.</seg>
        <seg id="40">Это называется «алгоритмом кодирования».</seg>
        <seg id="41">Используя ключ, он преобразовывает текст в документах в случайные числа.</seg>
        <seg id="42">Хороший алгоритм будет кодировать таким образом, что без ключа документ очень трудно расшифровать.</seg>
        <seg id="43">Важность шифрования в том, что если кто-то завладеет портфелем и взломает его без помощи ключа шифрования и алгоритма кодирования, он всё равно не сможет прочитать его содержимое.</seg>
        <seg id="44">Информация будет выглядеть как набор случайных чисел.</seg>
        <seg id="45">Большинство систем безопасности полагаются на безопасный способ обмена ключами для передачи ключа шифрования к нужному месту.</seg>
        <seg id="46">Однако быстрое развитие вычислительной мощности ставит под угрозу целый ряд современных методов обмена ключами.</seg>
        <seg id="47">Рассмотрим одну из самых широко используемых сегодня систем — RSA.</seg>
        <seg id="48">Когда она была изобретена в 1977 году, предполагалось, что для того, чтобы взломать 426-битный ключ RSA, потребуется 40 квадриллионов лет.</seg>
        <seg id="49">В 1994 году, всего лишь 17 лет спустя, код был взломан.</seg>
        <seg id="50">По мере того, как компьютеры становились мощнее, нам приходилось использовать более сложные коды.</seg>
        <seg id="51">Сегодня мы обычно используем 2 048 или 4 096 бит.</seg>
        <seg id="52">Как видите, создатели кода и хакеры участвуют в непрекращающейся битве, пытаясь перехитрить друг друга.</seg>
        <seg id="53">И когда квантовые компьютеры появятся в ближайшие 10–15 лет, они смогут ещё быстрее взломать сложную математику, которая лежит в основе многих современных систем шифрования.</seg>
        <seg id="54">Квантовый компьютер, скорее всего,  превратит нашу нынешнюю надёжную крепость в простой карточный домик.</seg>
        <seg id="55">Мы должны найти способ защитить нашу крепость.</seg>
        <seg id="56">В последние годы увеличивается количество исследований в сфере использования квантовых эффектов для усиления криптозащиты.</seg>
        <seg id="57">Были сделаны некоторые интересные открытия.</seg>
        <seg id="58">Помните три главных элемента шифрования: высококачественные ключи, безопасный обмен ключами и сложный алгоритм?</seg>
        <seg id="59">Достижения в науке и технике ставят под угрозу два из этих трёх элементов.</seg>
        <seg id="60">Во-первых, сами ключи.</seg>
        <seg id="61">Случайные числа являются основополагающими строительными блоками ключей шифрования.</seg>
        <seg id="62">Но на сегодняшний день они не совсем случайные.</seg>
        <seg id="63">Сегодня мы создаём ключи шифрования из последовательностей случайных чисел, генерируемых из программного обеспечения, так называемых псевдослучайных чисел.</seg>
        <seg id="64">В числах, сгенерированных программой или математической формулой, так или иначе присутствует некая закономерность.</seg>
        <seg id="65">Чем менее случайны числа — в научной терминологии:  чем меньше энтропии они содержат, — тем легче их предсказать.</seg>
        <seg id="66">Недавно несколько казино стали жертвами изобретательной атаки.</seg>
        <seg id="67">Комбинации на выходе игровых автоматов записывались в течение некоторого времени, после чего подвергались анализу.</seg>
        <seg id="68">Это позволило киберпреступникам перепроектировать генератор псевдослучайных чисел, управляющий барабанами.</seg>
        <seg id="69">Что, в свою очередь, позволило с высокой точностью предсказать вращения барабанов и получить большой выигрыш.</seg>
        <seg id="70">Аналогичным рискам могут подвергаться и ключи шифрования.</seg>
        <seg id="71">Для безопасного шифрования необходим генератор по-настоящему случайных чисел.</seg>
        <seg id="72">Уже долгие годы учёные ищут возможность создания такого генератора.</seg>
        <seg id="73">Но большинство попыток на сегодня либо недостаточно случайны, недостаточно быстры, либо их сложно повторить.</seg>
        <seg id="74">Но квантовый мир основан на случайности.</seg>
        <seg id="75">Поэтому имеет смысл воспользоваться этим фактом.</seg>
        <seg id="76">Устройства, которые могут измерять квантовые эффекты, могут также создавать бесконечный поток случайных чисел на высокой скорости,</seg>
        <seg id="77">что помешает всем этим потенциальным преступникам в казино.</seg>
        <seg id="78">Ряд лучших университетов и компаний по всему миру занимаются созданием генераторов по-настоящему случайных чисел.</seg>
        <seg id="79">Первый квантовый генератор, созданный в моей компании, был размером один на два метра и помещался на оптическом столе.</seg>
        <seg id="80">Позже мы смогли уменьшить его до размера коробки сервера.</seg>
        <seg id="81">Сегодня он размером с PCI-карту, подключаемую к стандартному компьютеру.</seg>
        <seg id="82">Это самый быстрый в мире генератор по-настоящему случайных чисел.</seg>
        <seg id="83">Его производительность составляет миллиард случайных чисел в секунду.</seg>
        <seg id="84">Сегодня его используют для усиления системы безопасности облачные провайдеры, банки, государственные органы по всему миру.</seg>
        <seg id="85">(Аплодисменты) Но даже с таким генератором остаётся нерешённой вторая большая проблема: угроза безопасному обмену ключами.</seg>
        <seg id="86">Современные методы обмена ключами не совместимы с квантовым компьютером.</seg>
        <seg id="87">Квантовое решение этой задачи называется «квантовым распределением ключей» или QKD, в основе которого лежит фундаментальная, парадоксальная характеристика квантовой механики.</seg>
        <seg id="88">Квантовая частица меняется в зависимости от её наблюдения.</seg>
        <seg id="89">Приведу пример того, как это работает.</seg>
        <seg id="90">Давайте вернёмся к обмену кодами для замкá с Джеймсом Бондом.</seg>
        <seg id="91">Только в этот раз вместо звонка Джеймсу с сообщением кода мы будем использовать квантовые эффекты на лазере, чтобы создать код и отправить его Джеймсу по обычному оптическому волокну.</seg>
        <seg id="92">Полагаем, что Доктор Ноу попытается взломать доступ к обмену данными.</seg>
        <seg id="93">К счастью, его попытки поймать квантовые ключи в пути оставят отпечатки пальцев, которые Джеймс и вы сможете обнаружить.</seg>
        <seg id="94">Это позволит исключить перехваченные ключи.</seg>
        <seg id="95">А оставшиеся ключи можно использовать для усиленной защиты данных.</seg>
        <seg id="96">Поскольку такая безопасность основана на фундаментальных законах физики, квантовый компьютер или даже любой суперкомпьютер будущего не смогут её взломать.</seg>
        <seg id="97">Моя команда и я работаем с ведущими университетами, а также с оборонным сектором, с целью развития этой многообещающей технологии в средства безопасности следующего поколения.</seg>
        <seg id="98">Интернет вещей предвещает эпоху, когда будут взаимодействовать 25–30 миллиардов устройств, которые по прогнозам появятся к 2020 году.</seg>
        <seg id="99">Для правильного функционирования нашего общества в мире Интернета вещей жизненно важно доверие к системам, которые поддерживают эти устройства.</seg>
        <seg id="100">Готов поспорить, что квантовые технологии смогут обеспечить это доверие, позволив нам в полной мере воспользоваться удивительными инновациями, которые обогатят нашу жизнь.</seg>
        <seg id="101">Спасибо.</seg>

        <seg id="1">Recently, we've seen the effects of cyber attacks on the business world.</seg>
        <seg id="2">Data breaches at companies like JP Morgan, Yahoo, Home Depot and Target have caused losses of hundreds of millions and in some cases, billions of dollars.</seg>
        <seg id="3">It wouldn't take many large attacks to ravage the world economy.</seg>
        <seg id="4">And the public sector has not been immune, either.</seg>
        <seg id="5">In 2012 to 2014, there was a significant data breach at the US Office of Personnel Management.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Security clearance and fingerprint data was compromised, affecting 22 million employees.</seg>
        <seg id="7">And you may have heard of the attempt by state-sponsored hackers to use stolen data to influence election outcomes in a number of countries.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Two recent examples are the compromise of a large amount of data from the Bundestag, the national Parliament of Germany, and the theft of emails from the US Democratic National Committee.</seg>
        <seg id="9">The cyber threat is now affecting our democratic processes.</seg>
        <seg id="10">And it's likely to get worse.</seg>
        <seg id="11">As computer technology is becoming more powerful, the systems we use to protect our data are becoming more vulnerable.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Adding to the concern is a new type of computing technology, called quantum computing, which leverages microscopic properties of nature to deliver unimaginable increases in computational power.</seg>
        <seg id="13">It's so powerful that it will crack many of the encryption systems that we use today.</seg>
        <seg id="14">So is the situation hopeless?</seg>
        <seg id="15">Should we start packing our digital survival gear and prepare for an upcoming data apocalypse?</seg>
        <seg id="16">I would say, not yet.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Quantum computing is still in the labs, and it will take a few years until it's put to practical applications.</seg>
        <seg id="18">More important, there have been major breakthroughs in the field of encryption.</seg>
        <seg id="19">For me, this is a particularly exciting time in the history of secure communications.</seg>
        <seg id="20">About 15 years ago, when I learned of our new-found ability to create quantum effects that don't exist in nature, I was excited.</seg>
        <seg id="21">The idea of applying the fundamental laws of physics to make encryption stronger really intrigued me.</seg>
        <seg id="22">Today, a select groups of companies and labs around the world, including mine, are maturing this technology for practical applications.</seg>
        <seg id="23">That's right.</seg>
        <seg id="24">We are now preparing to fight quantum with quantum.</seg>
        <seg id="25">So how does this all work?</seg>
        <seg id="26">Well, first, let's take a quick tour of the world of encryption.</seg>
        <seg id="27">For that, you'll need a briefcase, some important documents that you want to send your friend, James Bond, and a lock to keep it all safe.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Because the documents are top secret, we're going to use an advanced briefcase.</seg>
        <seg id="29">It has a special combination lock which, when closed, converts all the text in the documents to random numbers.</seg>
        <seg id="30">So you put your documents inside, close the lock -- at which point in time the documents get converted to random numbers -- and you send the briefcase to James.</seg>
        <seg id="31">While it's on its way, you call him to give him the code.</seg>
        <seg id="32">When he gets the briefcase, he enters the code, the documents get unscrambled, and voilà, you've just sent an encoded message to James Bond.</seg>
        <seg id="33">(Laughter) A fun example, but it does illustrate three things important for encryption.</seg>
        <seg id="34">The code -- we call this an encryption key.</seg>
        <seg id="35">You can think of it as a password.</seg>
        <seg id="36">The call to James to give him the code for the combination lock.</seg>
        <seg id="37">We call this key exchange.</seg>
        <seg id="38">This is how you ensure you get the encryption key securely to the right place.</seg>
        <seg id="39">And the lock, which encodes and decodes the document.</seg>
        <seg id="40">We call this an encryption algorithm.</seg>
        <seg id="41">Using the key, it encodes the text in the documents to random numbers.</seg>
        <seg id="42">A good algorithm will encode in such a way that without the key it's very difficult to unscramble.</seg>
        <seg id="43">What makes encryption so important is that if someone were to capture the briefcase and cut it open without the encryption key and the encryption algorithm, they wouldn't be able to read the documents.</seg>
        <seg id="44">They would look like nothing more than a bunch of random numbers.</seg>
        <seg id="45">Most security systems rely on a secure method for key exchange to communicate the encryption key to the right place.</seg>
        <seg id="46">However, rapid increases in computational power are putting at risk a number of the key exchange methods we have today.</seg>
        <seg id="47">Consider one of the very widely used systems today -- RSA.</seg>
        <seg id="48">When it was invented, in 1977, it was estimated that it would take 40 quadrillion years to break a 426-bit RSA key.</seg>
        <seg id="49">In 1994, just 17 years later, the code was broken.</seg>
        <seg id="50">As computers have become more and more powerful, we've had to use larger and larger codes.</seg>
        <seg id="51">Today we routinely use 2048 or 4096 bits.</seg>
        <seg id="52">As you can see, code makers and breakers are engaged in an ongoing battle to outwit each other.</seg>
        <seg id="53">And when quantum computers arrive in the next 10 to 15 years, they will even more rapidly crack the complex mathematics that underlies many of our encryption systems today.</seg>
        <seg id="54">Indeed, the quantum computer is likely to turn our present security castle into a mere house of cards.</seg>
        <seg id="55">We have to find a way to defend our castle.</seg>
        <seg id="56">There's been a growing body of research in recent years looking at using quantum effects to make encryption stronger.</seg>
        <seg id="57">And there have been some exciting breakthroughs.</seg>
        <seg id="58">Remember those three things important for encryption -- high-quality keys, secure key exchange and a strong algorithm?</seg>
        <seg id="59">Well, advances in science and engineering are putting two of those three elements at risk.</seg>
        <seg id="60">First of all, those keys.</seg>
        <seg id="61">Random numbers are the foundational building blocks of encryption keys.</seg>
        <seg id="62">But today, they're not truly random.</seg>
        <seg id="63">Currently, we construct encryption keys from sequences of random numbers generated from software, so-called pseudo-random numbers.</seg>
        <seg id="64">Numbers generated by a program or a mathematical recipe will have some, perhaps subtle, pattern to them.</seg>
        <seg id="65">The less random the numbers are, or in scientific terms, the less entropy they contain, the easier they are to predict.</seg>
        <seg id="66">Recently, several casinos have been victims of a creative attack.</seg>
        <seg id="67">The output of slot machines was recorded over a period of time and then analyzed.</seg>
        <seg id="68">This allowed the cyber criminals to reverse engineer the pseudo-random number generator behind the spinning wheels.</seg>
        <seg id="69">And allowed them, with high accuracy, to predict the spins of the wheels, enabling them to make big financial gains.</seg>
        <seg id="70">Similar risks apply to encryption keys.</seg>
        <seg id="71">So having a true random number generator is essential for secure encryption.</seg>
        <seg id="72">For years, researchers have been looking at building true random number generators.</seg>
        <seg id="73">But most designs to date are either not random enough, fast enough or aren't easily repeatable.</seg>
        <seg id="74">But the quantum world is truly random.</seg>
        <seg id="75">So it makes sense to take advantage of this intrinsic randomness.</seg>
        <seg id="76">Devices that can measure quantum effects can produce an endless stream of random numbers at high speed.</seg>
        <seg id="77">Foiling all those would-be casino criminals.</seg>
        <seg id="78">A select group of universities and companies around the world are focused on building true random number generators.</seg>
        <seg id="79">At my company, our quantum random number generator started life on a two meter by one meter optic table.</seg>
        <seg id="80">We were then able to reduce it to a server-size box.</seg>
        <seg id="81">Today, it's miniaturized into a PCI card that plugs into a standard computer.</seg>
        <seg id="82">This is the world's fastest true random number generator.</seg>
        <seg id="83">It measures quantum effects to produce a billion random numbers per second.</seg>
        <seg id="84">And it's in use today to improve security at cloud providers, banks and government agencies around the world.</seg>
        <seg id="85">(Applause) But even with a true random number generator, we've still got the second big cyber threat: the problem of secure key exchange.</seg>
        <seg id="86">Current key exchange techniques will not stand up to a quantum computer.</seg>
        <seg id="87">The quantum solution to this problem is called quantum key distribution or QKD, which leverages a fundamental, counterintuitive characteristic of quantum mechanics.</seg>
        <seg id="88">The very act of looking at a quantum particle changes it.</seg>
        <seg id="89">Let me give you an example of how this works.</seg>
        <seg id="90">Consider again exchanging the code for the lock with James Bond.</seg>
        <seg id="91">Except this time, instead of a call to give James the code, we're going to use quantum effects on a laser to carry the code and send it over standard optic fiber to James.</seg>
        <seg id="92">We assume that Dr. No is trying to hack the exchange.</seg>
        <seg id="93">Luckily, Dr. No's attempt to intercept the quantum keys while in transit will leave fingerprints that James and you can detect.</seg>
        <seg id="94">This allows those intercepted keys to be discarded.</seg>
        <seg id="95">The keys which are then retained can be used to provide very strong data protection.</seg>
        <seg id="96">And because the security is based on the fundamental laws of physics, a quantum computer, or indeed any future supercomputer will not be able to break it.</seg>
        <seg id="97">My team and I are collaborating with leading universities and the defense sector to mature this exciting technology into the next generation of security products.</seg>
        <seg id="98">The internet of things is heralding a hyperconnected era with 25 to 30 billion connected devices forecast by 2020.</seg>
        <seg id="99">For the correct functioning of our society in an IoT world, trust in the systems that support these connected devices is vital.</seg>
        <seg id="100">We're betting that quantum technologies will be essential in providing this trust, enabling us to fully benefit from the amazing innovations that are going to so enrich our lives.</seg>

        <seg id="1">Cyber attacks on the business world have become more frequent recently.</seg>
        <seg id="2">Access to data from companies such as JP Morgan, Yahoo, Home Depot and Target has cost them hundreds of millions and in some cases billions of dollars.</seg>
        <seg id="3">It doesn't take too many of these attacks to damage the global economy.</seg>
        <seg id="4">The public sector is not immune to these problems either.</seg>
        <seg id="5">From 2012 to 2014, there was a significant data breach at the US Office of Personnel Management.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Access to the security clearance and fingerprint data of 22 million employees was compromised.</seg>
        <seg id="7">State-sponsored hackers have been known to attempt to influence the outcome of elections in a number of countries using stolen data.</seg>
        <seg id="8">The two most recent big data breaches involve the Bundestag, Germany's federal parliament, and the theft of emails from the US Democratic National Committee.</seg>
        <seg id="9">The cyber threat affects our democratic processes.</seg>
        <seg id="10">The situation is getting even worse.</seg>
        <seg id="11">As computer technology advances, data protection systems become more vulnerable.</seg>
        <seg id="12">A new type of computer technology is also causing concern - computing on quantum computers, which use the microscopic properties of nature to vastly increase computing power.</seg>
        <seg id="13">It is so powerful that it can crack many modern encryption systems.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Is the situation really so hopeless?</seg>
        <seg id="15">Maybe it's time to pack up our vital data and prepare for the imminent digital apocalypse?</seg>
        <seg id="16">I would say, "It's not time yet."</seg>
        <seg id="17">Quantum computers are still in development, and it will be many years before they are put to practical use.</seg>
        <seg id="18">More important is the fact that major breakthroughs in encryption are taking place.</seg>
        <seg id="19">For me, this is a particularly exciting time in the history of secure communications.</seg>
        <seg id="20">About 15 years ago, when I learned about the new possibility of creating quantum effects that do not exist in nature, I became very excited.</seg>
        <seg id="21">I was intrigued by the idea of applying the fundamental laws of physics to create more secure encryption.</seg>
        <seg id="22">Today, a number of companies and labs around the world, including my own, are working on these technologies for practical applications.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Right.</seg>
        <seg id="24">Now we are preparing to fight quantum with quantum.</seg>
        <seg id="25">So how does it all work?</seg>
        <seg id="26">First, let's take a brief detour into the world of encryption.</seg>
        <seg id="27">To do this, we'll need a briefcase, some important documents to send to our friend, James Bond, and a lock to keep everything safe.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Because our information is top secret, we need a special briefcase.</seg>
        <seg id="29">It has a special code lock: when it is closed, it converts all the text in the documents into random numbers.</seg>
        <seg id="30">You put the documents in the briefcase, close the lock - at that very moment all the documents are converted into random numbers - and send the briefcase to James.</seg>
        <seg id="31">While the briefcase is in transit, you call James to give him the code.</seg>
        <seg id="32">After receiving the briefcase, he enters the code, the documents are decrypted, and voila - you've just sent an encrypted message to James Bond.</seg>
        <seg id="33">(Laughter) It's a funny example, but it illustrates three important elements of coding.</seg>
        <seg id="34">Code - we call it an "encryption key."</seg>
        <seg id="35">It's like a password.</seg>
        <seg id="36">A call to James to tell him the combination lock code.</seg>
        <seg id="37">This is called "key exchange" -</seg>
        <seg id="38">guarantee that you will securely receive the encryption key from the right place.</seg>
        <seg id="39">And a lock that encrypts and decrypts the document.</seg>
        <seg id="40">This is called an "encoding algorithm."</seg>
        <seg id="41">Using the key, it converts the text in the documents into random numbers.</seg>
        <seg id="42">A good algorithm will encode in such a way that without the key the document is very difficult to decipher.</seg>
        <seg id="43">The importance of encryption is that if someone gets hold of the briefcase and breaks into it without the help of the encryption key and the encryption algorithm, they still won't be able to read its contents.</seg>
        <seg id="44">The information will look like a set of random numbers.</seg>
        <seg id="45">Most security systems rely on a secure key exchange method to transmit the encryption key to the desired location.</seg>
        <seg id="46">However, the rapid development of computing power threatens a number of modern methods of key exchange.</seg>
        <seg id="47">Consider one of the most widely used systems today, RSA.</seg>
        <seg id="48">When it was invented in 1977, it was estimated that it would take 40 quadrillion years to crack a 426-bit RSA key.</seg>
        <seg id="49">In 1994, just 17 years later, the code was cracked.</seg>
        <seg id="50">As computers became more powerful, we had to use more complex codes.</seg>
        <seg id="51">Today, we usually use 2048 or 4096 bits.</seg>
        <seg id="52">As you can see, coders and hackers are engaged in an ongoing battle to outsmart each other.</seg>
        <seg id="53">And when quantum computers arrive in the next 10 to 15 years, they will be able to crack the complex math that underlies many modern encryption systems even faster.</seg>
        <seg id="54">A quantum computer is likely to turn our current secure fortress into a simple house of cards.</seg>
        <seg id="55">We must find a way to defend our fortress.</seg>
        <seg id="56">In recent years, there has been an increasing amount of research into the use of quantum effects to enhance cryptography.</seg>
        <seg id="57">Some interesting discoveries were made.</seg>
        <seg id="58">Remember the three main elements of encryption: high-quality keys, secure key exchange, and a complex algorithm?</seg>
        <seg id="59">Advances in science and technology are putting two of these three elements at risk.</seg>
        <seg id="60">First, the keys themselves.</seg>
        <seg id="61">Random numbers are the fundamental building blocks of encryption keys.</seg>
        <seg id="62">But today they are not entirely random.</seg>
        <seg id="63">Today, we create encryption keys from sequences of random numbers generated from software, so-called pseudo-random numbers.</seg>
        <seg id="64">There is a certain pattern in the numbers generated by a program or a mathematical formula.</seg>
        <seg id="65">The less random the numbers are - in scientific terminology: the less entropy they contain - the easier they are to predict.</seg>
        <seg id="66">Recently, several casinos have fallen victim to an ingenious attack.</seg>
        <seg id="67">The combinations on the output of the slot machines were recorded for some time and then analyzed.</seg>
        <seg id="68">This allowed cybercriminals to reverse engineer the pseudo-random number generator that controls the reels.</seg>
        <seg id="69">That, in turn, made it possible to accurately predict the spins of the reels and get a big win.</seg>
        <seg id="70">Encryption keys can be subject to similar risks.</seg>
        <seg id="71">A truly random number generator is needed for secure encryption.</seg>
        <seg id="72">For years, scientists have been looking for a way to create such a generator.</seg>
        <seg id="73">But most attempts to date are either not random enough, not fast enough, or difficult to replicate.</seg>
        <seg id="74">But the quantum world is based on randomness.</seg>
        <seg id="75">So it makes sense to take advantage of this fact.</seg>
        <seg id="76">Devices that can measure quantum effects can also generate an infinite stream of random numbers at high speed,</seg>
        <seg id="77">that will keep all those potential criminals out of the casino.</seg>
        <seg id="78">A number of top universities and companies around the world are building truly random number generators.</seg>
        <seg id="79">The first quantum generator created in my company was one meter by two meters and was placed on an optical table.</seg>
        <seg id="80">We were later able to shrink it down to the size of a server box.</seg>
        <seg id="81">Today it is the size of a PCI card connected to a standard computer.</seg>
        <seg id="82">It is the fastest truly random number generator in the world.</seg>
        <seg id="83">Its capacity is one billion random numbers per second.</seg>
        <seg id="84">Today, it is used by cloud providers, banks, and government agencies around the world to strengthen security.</seg>
        <seg id="85">(Applause) But even with this generator, the second big problem remains unsolved: the threat to the secure exchange of keys.</seg>
        <seg id="86">Current methods of exchanging keys are not compatible with a quantum computer.</seg>
        <seg id="87">The quantum solution to this problem is called "quantum key distribution" or QKD, which is based on a fundamental, paradoxical characteristic of quantum mechanics.</seg>
        <seg id="88">A quantum particle changes depending on its observation.</seg>
        <seg id="89">Let me give you an example of how this works.</seg>
        <seg id="90">Let's go back to exchanging lock codes with James Bond.</seg>
        <seg id="91">Only this time, instead of calling James with a code message, we will use quantum effects on the laser to create a code and send it to James over a conventional optical fiber.</seg>
        <seg id="92">We believe that Dr. No will try to hack access to the data exchange.</seg>
        <seg id="93">Fortunately, his attempts to catch quantum keys in transit will leave fingerprints that James and you will be able to detect.</seg>
        <seg id="94">This will eliminate intercepted keys.</seg>
        <seg id="95">And the remaining keys can be used for enhanced data protection.</seg>
        <seg id="96">Since this security is based on the fundamental laws of physics, a quantum computer or even any supercomputer of the future will not be able to break it.</seg>
        <seg id="97">My team and I are working with leading universities, as well as the defense sector, to develop this promising technology into next-generation security tools.</seg>
        <seg id="98">The Internet of Things heralds an era where 25-30 billion devices are expected to be connected by 2020.</seg>

        <seg id="1">Recently, cyber attacks on the business world have become more frequent.</seg>
        <seg id="2">Access to data from companies such as JP Morgan, Yahoo, Home Depot, and Target has caused them losses of hundreds of millions, and in some cases even billions of dollars.</seg>
        <seg id="3">It doesn't take too many such attacks to damage the global economy.</seg>
        <seg id="4">The public sector is also not immune to such problems.</seg>
        <seg id="5">From 2012 to 2014, there was a significant data leak in the US Office of Personnel Management.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Access to the security and fingerprint verification data of 22 million employees was compromised.</seg>
        <seg id="7">There are known attempts by hackers sponsored by government agencies to influence the results of elections in a number of countries with the help of stolen data.</seg>
        <seg id="8">The two most recent disclosures involve the Bundestag, the German Federal Parliament, and the theft of emails from the US Democratic National Committee.</seg>
        <seg id="9">The cyber threat affects our democratic processes.</seg>
        <seg id="10">The situation is even getting worse.</seg>
        <seg id="11">As computer technology evolves, data protection systems become increasingly vulnerable.</seg>
        <seg id="12">A new type of computer technology is also of concern — computing on quantum computers, which use the microscopic properties of nature to enormously increase computing power.</seg>
        <seg id="13">It is so powerful that it can crack many modern encryption systems.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Is the situation so hopeless?</seg>
        <seg id="15">Maybe it's time to pack up our vital data and prepare for the coming digital apocalypse.</seg>
        <seg id="16">I would say, " Not yet."</seg>
        <seg id="17">Quantum computers are still in development, and it will take many years before they are put into practice.</seg>
        <seg id="18">More important is the fact that there are major breakthroughs in the field of encryption.</seg>
        <seg id="19">For me, this is a particularly exciting time in the history of secure communications.</seg>
        <seg id="20">About 15 years ago, when I learned about the new possibility of creating quantum effects that do not exist in nature, I was very excited.</seg>
        <seg id="21">I was intrigued by the idea of applying the fundamental laws of physics to create more secure encryption.</seg>
        <seg id="22">Today, a number of companies and laboratories around the world, including mine, are working on these technologies to put them into practice.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Right.</seg>
        <seg id="24">Now we are preparing to fight the quantum with the help of the quantum.</seg>
        <seg id="25">So how does it all work?</seg>
        <seg id="26">First, let's take a quick look at the world of encryption.</seg>
        <seg id="27">To do this, we will need a briefcase, some important documents that we want to send to our friend, James Bond, and a lock to keep everything safe.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Since our information is top secret, we need a special briefcase.</seg>
        <seg id="29">It has a special combination lock: when it is closed, it converts all the text in the documents to random numbers.</seg>
        <seg id="30">You put the documents in the briefcase, close the lock — at this very moment all the documents are converted to random numbers — and send the briefcase to James.</seg>
        <seg id="31">While the briefcase is on its way, you call James to tell him the code.</seg>
        <seg id="32">After receiving the briefcase, he enters the code, the documents are decrypted, and voila — you just sent an encrypted message to James Bond.</seg>
        <seg id="33">(Laughter) A funny example, but it illustrates three important coding elements.</seg>
        <seg id="34">The code — we call it the "encryption key".</seg>
        <seg id="35">It's like a password.</seg>
        <seg id="36">Call James to tell him the combination code of the lock.</seg>
        <seg id="37">This is called " key exchange» —</seg>
        <seg id="38">guarantee that you will safely get the encryption key from the right place.</seg>
        <seg id="39">And a lock that encodes and decodes the document.</seg>
        <seg id="40">This is called the "encoding algorithm".</seg>
        <seg id="41">Using the key, it converts the text in the documents to random numbers.</seg>
        <seg id="42">A good algorithm will encode in such a way that without a key, the document is very difficult to decipher.</seg>
        <seg id="43">The importance of encryption is that if someone gets hold of a briefcase and breaks it without using the encryption key and the encoding algorithm, they still won't be able to read its contents.</seg>
        <seg id="44">The information will look like a set of random numbers.</seg>
        <seg id="45">Most security systems rely on a secure way to exchange keys to transfer the encryption key to the desired location.</seg>
        <seg id="46">However, the rapid development of computing power threatens a number of modern methods of key exchange.</seg>
        <seg id="47">Consider one of the most widely used systems today — RSA.</seg>
        <seg id="48">When it was invented in 1977, it was estimated that it would take 40 quadrillion years to crack a 426-bit RSA key.</seg>
        <seg id="49">In 1994, just 17 years later, the code was cracked.</seg>
        <seg id="50">As computers became more powerful, we had to use more complex codes.</seg>
        <seg id="51">Today we usually use 2,048 or 4,096 bits.</seg>
        <seg id="52">As you can see, the creators of the code and the hackers are engaged in an ongoing battle, trying to outsmart each other.</seg>
        <seg id="53">And when quantum computers appear in the next 10-15 years, they will be able to crack the complex mathematics that underlies many modern encryption systems even faster.</seg>
        <seg id="54">A quantum computer is likely to turn our current secure fortress into a simple house of cards.</seg>
        <seg id="55">We must find a way to defend our fortress.</seg>
        <seg id="56">In recent years, there has been an increasing amount of research into the use of quantum effects to enhance cryptographic protection.</seg>
        <seg id="57">Some interesting discoveries have been made.</seg>
        <seg id="58">Remember the three main elements of encryption: high-quality keys, secure key exchange, and a complex algorithm?</seg>
        <seg id="59">Advances in science and technology threaten two of these three elements.</seg>
        <seg id="60">First, the keys themselves.</seg>
        <seg id="61">Random numbers are the fundamental building blocks of encryption keys.</seg>
        <seg id="62">But to date, they are not entirely random.</seg>
        <seg id="63">Today, we create encryption keys from sequences of random numbers generated from software, so-called pseudo-random numbers.</seg>
        <seg id="64">In the numbers generated by a program or a mathematical formula, one way or another, there is a certain pattern.</seg>
        <seg id="65">The less random numbers are — in scientific terms, the less entropy they contain — the easier it is to predict them.</seg>
        <seg id="66">Recently, several casinos have been the victims of an ingenious attack.</seg>
        <seg id="67">Combinations at the output of slot machines were recorded for some time, after which they were analyzed.</seg>
        <seg id="68">This allowed cybercriminals to redesign the pseudo-random number generator that controls the reels.</seg>
        <seg id="69">This, in turn, made it possible to predict the spin of the reels with high accuracy and get a big win.</seg>
        <seg id="70">Encryption keys can also be exposed to similar risks.</seg>
        <seg id="71">Secure encryption requires a truly random number generator.</seg>
        <seg id="72">For many years, scientists have been looking for the possibility of creating such a generator.</seg>
        <seg id="73">But most attempts today are either not random enough, not fast enough, or difficult to repeat.</seg>
        <seg id="74">But the quantum world is based on randomness.</seg>
        <seg id="75">Therefore, it makes sense to take advantage of this fact.</seg>
        <seg id="76">Devices that can measure quantum effects can also create an infinite stream of random numbers at high speed,</seg>
        <seg id="77">which will prevent all these potential criminals from entering the casino.</seg>
        <seg id="78">A number of top universities and companies around the world are engaged in creating truly random number generators.</seg>
        <seg id="79">The first quantum generator created in my company was one meter by two meters and placed on an optical table.</seg>
        <seg id="80">Later, we were able to reduce it to the size of a server box.</seg>
        <seg id="81">Today, it's the size of a PCI card plugged into a standard computer.</seg>
        <seg id="82">This is the world's fastest truly random number generator.</seg>
        <seg id="83">Its performance is a billion random numbers per second.</seg>
        <seg id="84">Today, it is used to strengthen the security system by cloud providers, banks, and government agencies around the world.</seg>
        <seg id="85">(Applause) But even with such a generator, the second big problem remains unsolved: the threat to secure key exchange.</seg>
        <seg id="86">Modern methods of key exchange are not compatible with a quantum computer.</seg>
        <seg id="87">The quantum solution to this problem is called "quantum key distribution" or QKD, which is based on a fundamental, paradoxical characteristic of quantum mechanics.</seg>
        <seg id="88">A quantum particle changes depending on its observation.</seg>
        <seg id="89">Here is an example of how it works.</seg>
        <seg id="90">Let's go back to exchanging the codes for the lock with James Bond.</seg>
        <seg id="91">Only this time, instead of calling James with the code message, we'll use quantum effects on the laser to create the code and send it to James over a conventional optical fiber.</seg>
        <seg id="92">We believe that Dr. Know will try to hack access to the data exchange.</seg>
        <seg id="93">Fortunately, his attempts to catch the quantum keys in transit will leave fingerprints that James and you will be able to detect.</seg>
        <seg id="94">This will eliminate the intercepted keys.</seg>
        <seg id="95">And the remaining keys can be used for enhanced data protection.</seg>
        <seg id="96">Since such security is based on the fundamental laws of physics, a quantum computer or even any supercomputer of the future will not be able to crack it.</seg>
        <seg id="97">My team and I are working with leading universities, as well as the defense sector, to develop this promising technology into next-generation security tools.</seg>

        <seg id="13">It is so powerful that it will be able to break many modern encryption systems.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Is the situation really that hopeless?</seg>
        <seg id="15">Isn't it already time to pack up our vital data and prepare for the imminent digital apocalypse?</seg>
        <seg id="16">I would say: "Not yet."</seg>
        <seg id="17">Quantum computers are still in development, and it will take many years before they are put into practice.</seg>
        <seg id="18">More importantly, there are major breakthroughs in encryption.</seg>
        <seg id="19">For me, this is a particularly exciting time in the history of secure communications.</seg>
        <seg id="20">About 15 years ago, when I learned about the new possibility of creating quantum effects that do not exist in nature, I was very excited.</seg>
        <seg id="21">I was intrigued by the idea of applying the fundamental laws of physics to create more secure encryption.</seg>
        <seg id="22">Today a number of companies and laboratories around the world, including mine, are working on these technologies to put them into practice.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Right.</seg>
        <seg id="24">Now we're getting ready to fight the quantum with the quantum.</seg>
        <seg id="25">So how does all this work?</seg>
        <seg id="26">First, let's do a little excursion into the world of encryption.</seg>
        <seg id="27">We'll need a briefcase, some important documents that we want to send to our friend, James Bond, and a lock to keep everything safe.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Since our information is top secret, we need a special briefcase.</seg>
        <seg id="29">It has a special code lock: when it's closed, it converts all the text in the documents into random numbers.</seg>
        <seg id="30">You put the documents in the briefcase, close the lock - at which point all the documents are converted to random numbers - and send the briefcase to James.</seg>
        <seg id="31">While the briefcase is in transit, you call James to give him the code.</seg>
        <seg id="32">Upon receiving the briefcase, he enters the code, the documents are decrypted, and voila - you've just sent an encrypted message to James Bond.</seg>
        <seg id="33">(Laughter) It's a funny example, but it illustrates three important elements of coding.</seg>
        <seg id="34">The code - we call it the "encryption key."</seg>
        <seg id="35">It's like a password.</seg>
        <seg id="36">Calling James to tell him the code for the combination locká.</seg>
        <seg id="37">It's called a "key exchange"-</seg>
        <seg id="38">a guarantee that you will securely get the encryption key from the right place.</seg>
        <seg id="39">And the lock that encrypts and decrypts the document.</seg>
        <seg id="40">This is called an "encryption algorithm."</seg>
        <seg id="41">Using the key, it converts the text in the documents to random numbers.</seg>
        <seg id="42">A good algorithm will encode in such a way that without the key, the document is very difficult to decrypt.</seg>
        <seg id="43">The importance of encryption is that if someone gets hold of a briefcase and hacks it without the help of an encryption key and encryption algorithm, they still won't be able to read its contents.</seg>
        <seg id="44">The information will look like a set of random numbers.</seg>
        <seg id="45">Most security systems rely on a secure method of key exchange to send the encryption key to the right place.</seg>
        <seg id="46">However, the rapid development of computing power is compromising a number of current methods of key exchange.</seg>
        <seg id="47">Consider one of the most widely used systems today, RSA.</seg>
        <seg id="48">When it was invented in 1977, it was estimated to take 40 quadrillion years to crack RSA's 426-bit key.</seg>
        <seg id="49">In 1994, just 17 years later, the code was cracked.</seg>
        <seg id="50">As computers became more powerful, we had to use more complex codes.</seg>
        <seg id="51">Today we typically use 2,048 or 4,096 bits.</seg>
        <seg id="52">As you can see, code creators and hackers are engaged in an ongoing battle, trying to outsmart each other.</seg>
        <seg id="53">And when quantum computers appear in the next 10-15 years, they will be able to crack even faster the complex mathematics that underlie many of today's encryption systems.</seg>
        <seg id="54">A quantum computer is likely to turn our current secure fortress into a simple house of cards.</seg>
        <seg id="55">We must find a way to protect our fortress.</seg>
        <seg id="56">In recent years, research into the use of quantum effects to enhance cryptocurrencies has been increasing.</seg>
        <seg id="57">Some interesting discoveries have been made.</seg>
        <seg id="58">Remember the three main elements of encryption: high-quality keys, secure key exchange, and a sophisticated algorithm?</seg>
        <seg id="59">Advances in science and technology have compromised two of these three elements.</seg>
        <seg id="60">First, the keys themselves.</seg>
        <seg id="61">Random numbers are the fundamental building blocks of encryption keys.</seg>
        <seg id="62">But as of today, they are not exactly random.</seg>
        <seg id="63">Today we create encryption keys from sequences of random numbers generated from software, so-called pseudo-random numbers.</seg>
        <seg id="64">The numbers generated by software or a mathematical formula have some sort of regularity to them in one way or another.</seg>
        <seg id="65">The less random the numbers are - in scientific terminology: the less entropy they contain - the easier it is to predict them.</seg>
        <seg id="66">Recently, several casinos have fallen victim to an inventive attack.</seg>
        <seg id="67">The combinations on the output of slot machines were recorded for a period of time and then analyzed.</seg>
        <seg id="68">This allowed the cybercriminals to reverse engineer the pseudo-random number generator that controls the reels.</seg>
        <seg id="69">That, in turn, made it possible to predict the spins of the reels with high accuracy and generate large winnings.</seg>
        <seg id="70">Encryption keys may be subject to similar risks.</seg>
        <seg id="71">Secure encryption requires a truly random number generator.</seg>
        <seg id="72">Scientists have been searching for such a generator for years.</seg>
        <seg id="73">But most attempts to date are either not random enough, not fast enough, or difficult to replicate.</seg>
        <seg id="74">But quantum world is based on randomness.</seg>
        <seg id="75">So it makes sense to take advantage of this fact.</seg>
        <seg id="76">Devices that can measure quantum effects can also create an infinite stream of random numbers at high speed,</seg>
        <seg id="77">which would prevent all those potential criminals in the casino.</seg>
        <seg id="78">A number of top universities and companies around the world are working to create truly random number generators.</seg>
        <seg id="79">The first quantum generator created at my company was one meter by two meters and fit on an optical table.</seg>
        <seg id="80">Later we were able to shrink it down to the size of a server box.</seg>
        <seg id="81">Today it is the size of a PCI card plugged into a standard computer.</seg>
        <seg id="82">It is the world's fastest truly random number generator.</seg>
        <seg id="83">Its performance is a billion random numbers per second.</seg>
        <seg id="84">It's being used today to enhance security by cloud providers, banks, government agencies around the world.</seg>
        <seg id="85">(Applause) But even with such a generator, the second big problem remains unsolved: the threat to secure key exchange.</seg>
        <seg id="86">Current methods of key exchange are not compatible with the quantum computer.</seg>
        <seg id="87">A quantum solution to this problem is called "quantum key distribution" or QKD, which is based on a fundamental, paradoxical characteristic of quantum mechanics.</seg>
        <seg id="88">Quantum particle changes depending on its observation.</seg>
        <seg id="89">Here is an example of how it works.</seg>
        <seg id="90">Let's go back to the code exchange for the lock with James Bond.</seg>
        <seg id="91">Only this time, instead of calling James with the code message, we will use quantum effects on the laser to create the code and send it to James over a normal optical fiber.</seg>
        <seg id="92">We assume that Dr. No will try to hack access to the data exchange.</seg>
        <seg id="93">Fortunately, his attempts to catch the quantum keys in transit will leave fingerprints that James and you can detect.</seg>
        <seg id="94">This will eliminate intercepted keys.</seg>
        <seg id="95">And the remaining keys can be used for enhanced data security.</seg>
        <seg id="96">Since this security is based on the fundamental laws of physics, a quantum computer or even any supercomputer of the future won't be able to hack it.</seg>
        <seg id="97">My team and I are working with leading universities, as well as the defense sector, to develop this promising technology into the next generation of security.</seg>
        <seg id="98">The Internet of Things heralds an era of 25 to 30 billion devices that are projected to be interoperable by 2020.</seg>
        <seg id="99">Trust in the systems that support these devices is vital to the proper functioning of our society in an IoT world.</seg>
        <seg id="100">I'm willing to bet that quantum technologies can provide that trust, allowing us to take full advantage of the amazing innovations that will enrich our lives.</seg>
        <seg id="101">Thank you.</seg>

        <seg id="37">This is called "key exchange" -</seg>
        <seg id="38">ensuring that you securely get the encryption key from the right place.</seg>
        <seg id="39">And a lock that encodes and decodes the document.</seg>
        <seg id="40">This is called the "coding algorithm".</seg>
        <seg id="41">Using a key, it converts text in documents to random numbers.</seg>
        <seg id="42">A good algorithm will encode in such a way that without the key, the document is very difficult to decrypt.</seg>
        <seg id="43">The importance of encryption is that if someone takes possession of a briefcase and breaks it without using the encryption key and encryption algorithm, they will still not be able to read its contents.</seg>
        <seg id="44">The information will look like a bunch of random numbers.</seg>
        <seg id="45">Most security systems rely on a secure key exchange method to transfer the encryption key to the right place.</seg>
        <seg id="46">However, the rapid development of computing power is jeopardizing a number of modern key exchange methods.</seg>
        <seg id="47">Consider one of the most widely used systems today - RSA.</seg>
        <seg id="48">When it was invented in 1977, it was estimated that it would take 40 quadrillion years to crack a 426-bit RSA key.</seg>
        <seg id="49">In 1994, just 17 years later, the code was cracked.</seg>
        <seg id="50">As computers got more powerful, we had to use more complex codes.</seg>
        <seg id="51">Today we usually use 2,048 or 4,096 bits.</seg>
        <seg id="52">As you can see, code creators and hackers are engaged in an ongoing battle trying to outsmart each other.</seg>
        <seg id="53">And when quantum computers arrive in the next 10-15 years, they will be able to break even faster the complex mathematics that underlies many modern encryption systems.</seg>
        <seg id="54">The quantum computer is likely to transform our current rugged fortress into a simple house of cards.</seg>
        <seg id="55">We must find a way to protect our fortress.</seg>
        <seg id="56">In recent years, there has been an increasing amount of research into the use of quantum effects to enhance crypto security.</seg>
        <seg id="57">Some interesting discoveries have been made.</seg>
        <seg id="58">Remember the three main elements of encryption: high quality keys, secure key exchange, and a sophisticated algorithm?</seg>
        <seg id="59">Advances in science and technology are jeopardizing two of these three elements.</seg>
        <seg id="60">First, the keys themselves.</seg>
        <seg id="61">Random numbers are the fundamental building blocks of encryption keys.</seg>
        <seg id="62">But today they are not entirely random.</seg>
        <seg id="63">Today we create encryption keys from sequences of random numbers generated from software, so-called pseudo-random numbers.</seg>
        <seg id="64">In the numbers generated by a program or a mathematical formula, one way or another, there is a certain pattern.</seg>
        <seg id="65">The less random the numbers - in scientific terminology: the less entropy they contain - the easier it is to predict them.</seg>
        <seg id="66">Several casinos have recently fallen victim to an ingenious attack.</seg>
        <seg id="67">The combinations at the output of the slot machines were recorded for some time, after which they were analyzed.</seg>
        <seg id="68">This allowed cybercriminals to redesign the pseudo-random number generator that drives the reels.</seg>
        <seg id="69">This, in turn, made it possible to predict the spins of the reels with high accuracy and get a big win.</seg>
        <seg id="70">Encryption keys can be subject to similar risks.</seg>
        <seg id="71">A truly random number generator is required for secure encryption.</seg>
        <seg id="72">For many years, scientists have been looking for the possibility of creating such a generator.</seg>
        <seg id="73">But most of the attempts today are either not random enough, not fast enough, or difficult to repeat.</seg>
        <seg id="74">But the quantum world is based on chance.</seg>
        <seg id="75">Therefore, it makes sense to take advantage of this fact.</seg>
        <seg id="76">Devices that can measure quantum effects can also generate an endless stream of random numbers at high speed,</seg>
        <seg id="77">which will stop all these potential casino criminals.</seg>
        <seg id="78">Some of the best universities and companies around the world are creating truly random number generators.</seg>
        <seg id="79">The first quantum generator I built was one meter by two meters and fit on an optical table.</seg>
        <seg id="80">Later we were able to shrink it down to the size of a server box.</seg>
        <seg id="81">Today it is about the size of a PCI card plugged into a standard computer.</seg>
        <seg id="82">It is the world's fastest truly random number generator.</seg>
        <seg id="83">Its performance is one billion random numbers per second.</seg>
        <seg id="84">Today it is used to strengthen the security system by cloud providers, banks, government agencies around the world.</seg>
        <seg id="85">(Applause) But even with such a generator, the second big problem remains unresolved: the threat to secure key exchange.</seg>
        <seg id="86">Modern key exchange methods are not compatible with a quantum computer.</seg>
        <seg id="87">The quantum solution to this problem is called "quantum key distribution" or QKD, which is based on a fundamental, paradoxical characteristic of quantum mechanics.</seg>
        <seg id="88">A quantum particle changes depending on its observation.</seg>
        <seg id="89">Let me give you an example of how it works.</seg>
        <seg id="90">Let's go back to exchanging the lock codes with James Bond.</seg>
        <seg id="91">Only this time, instead of calling James with the code, we'll use quantum effects on the laser to create the code and send it to James over a regular optical fiber.</seg>
        <seg id="92">We believe that Dr. No will try to hack access to data exchange.</seg>
        <seg id="93">Luckily, his attempts to trap the quantum keys along the way will leave fingerprints that James and you can find.</seg>
        <seg id="94">This will eliminate intercepted keys.</seg>
        <seg id="95">And the remaining keys can be used for enhanced data protection.</seg>
        <seg id="96">Since such security is based on fundamental laws of physics, a quantum computer or even any supercomputer of the future cannot break it.</seg>
        <seg id="97">My team and I are working with leading universities as well as the defense sector to develop this promising technology into the next generation of security.</seg>
        <seg id="98">The Internet of Things heralds an era of 25–30 billion devices projected to arrive by 2020.</seg>
        <seg id="99">Trust in the systems that support these devices is vital to the proper functioning of our society in the world of the Internet of Things.</seg>
        <seg id="100">I bet quantum technology can provide this trust, allowing us to take full advantage of the amazing innovations that will enrich our lives.</seg>

        <seg id="13">It is so powerful that it will be able to crack many modern encryption systems.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Is the situation so hopeless?</seg>

        <seg id="16">I'd say, "It's not time yet."</seg>
        <seg id="17">Quantum computers are still in development, and it will take many years before they are put into practice.</seg>
        <seg id="18">More importantly, there are major breakthroughs in encryption.</seg>
        <seg id="19">For me, this is a particularly exciting time in the history of secure communications.</seg>
        <seg id="20">About 15 years ago, when I learned about the new possibility of creating quantum effects that do not exist in nature, I was very excited.</seg>
        <seg id="21">I was intrigued by the idea of applying the fundamental laws of physics to create more secure encryption.</seg>
        <seg id="22">Today, a number of companies and laboratories around the world, including mine, are working on these technologies to put them into practice.</seg>
        <seg id="23">faithfully.</seg>
        <seg id="24">Now we are preparing to fight the quantum with the help of the quantum.</seg>
        <seg id="25">So how does it all work?</seg>
        <seg id="26">First, let's take a little digression into the world of encryption.</seg>
        <seg id="27">To do this, we will need a briefcase, some important documents that we want to send to our friend, James Bond, and a castle to keep everything safe.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Since our information is top secret, we need a special portfolio.</seg>
        <seg id="29">It has a special code lock: when it is closed, it converts all the text in documents into random numbers.</seg>
        <seg id="30">You put the documents in the briefcase, close the lock — at this very moment all the documents are converted to random numbers — and send the briefcase to James.</seg>
        <seg id="31">While the briefcase is on the way, you call James to tell him the code.</seg>
        <seg id="32">When he receives the briefcase, he enters the code, the documents are decrypted, and voil – you just sent an encrypted message to James Bond.</seg>
        <seg id="33">(Laughter) It's a funny example, but it illustrates three important elements of coding.</seg>
        <seg id="34">Code – we call it an "encryption key.</seg>
        <seg id="35">It's like a password.</seg>
        <seg id="36">Call James to tell him the lock combination code.</seg>
        <seg id="37">It's called "key exchange" —</seg>
        <seg id="38">Ensure that you securely receive the encryption key from the right location.</seg>
        <seg id="39">And the lock that encodes and decodes the document.</seg>
        <seg id="40">This is called a "coding algorithm."</seg>
        <seg id="41">Using a key, it converts text in documents to random numbers.</seg>
        <seg id="42">A good algorithm will encode in such a way that without a key, the document is very difficult to decipher.</seg>

        <seg id="44">The information will look like a set of random numbers.</seg>
        <seg id="45">Most security systems rely on a secure way to exchange keys to pass the encryption key to the right place.</seg>

        <seg id="59">Advances in science and technology put two of these three elements at risk.</seg>
        <seg id="60">First, the keys themselves.</seg>
        <seg id="61">Random numbers are the fundamental building blocks of encryption keys.</seg>
        <seg id="62">But to date, they are not entirely random.</seg>
        <seg id="63">Today we create encryption keys from random number sequences generated from software, so-called pseudorandom numbers.</seg>
        <seg id="64">In the numbers generated by the program or mathematical formula, in one way or another there is a certain regularity.</seg>
        <seg id="65">The less random the numbers  ⁇  in scientific terminology: the less entropy they contain  ⁇  the easier it is to predict them.</seg>
        <seg id="66">Recently, several casinos have been the victims of an inventive attack.</seg>
        <seg id="67">Combinations at the output of slot machines were recorded for some time, after which they were analyzed.</seg>
        <seg id="68">This allowed cyber criminals to redesign the pseudorandom number generator that controls the drums.</seg>
        <seg id="69">This, in turn, made it possible to predict the spin of the reels with high accuracy and to get a big win.</seg>
        <seg id="70">Encryption keys can also be subject to similar risks.</seg>
        <seg id="71">A truly random number generator is needed for secure encryption.</seg>
        <seg id="72">For years, scientists have been looking for the possibility of creating such a generator.</seg>
        <seg id="73">But most attempts today are either not random enough, not fast enough, or they are difficult to repeat.</seg>
        <seg id="74">But the quantum world is based on chance.</seg>
        <seg id="75">So it makes sense to take advantage of this fact.</seg>
        <seg id="76">Devices that can measure quantum effects can also create an infinite stream of random numbers at high speed,</seg>
        <seg id="77">which will prevent all these potential criminals from entering the casino.</seg>
        <seg id="78">A number of top universities and companies around the world are creating truly random number generators.</seg>
        <seg id="79">The first quantum generator created in my company was one by two meters in size and placed on an optical table.</seg>
        <seg id="80">Later we were able to reduce it to the size of a server box.</seg>
        <seg id="81">Today, it is the size of a PCI card that connects to a standard computer.</seg>
        <seg id="82">It is the world's fastest truly random number generator.</seg>
        <seg id="83">Its performance is a billion random numbers per second.</seg>
        <seg id="84">Today, it is used to enhance security by cloud providers, banks, government agencies around the world.</seg>
        <seg id="85">(Applause) But even with such a generator, the second big problem remains unresolved: the threat to secure key exchange.</seg>
        <seg id="86">Modern key exchange methods are not compatible with a quantum computer.</seg>
        <seg id="87">A quantum solution to this problem is called a "quantum key distribution," or QKD, based on a fundamental, paradoxical characteristic of quantum mechanics.</seg>
        <seg id="88">The quantum particle changes depending on its observation.</seg>
        <seg id="89">Let me give you an example of how this works.</seg>
        <seg id="90">Let's get back to sharing the codes for the castle with James Bond.</seg>
        <seg id="91">Only this time, instead of calling James with a code message, we will use quantum effects on the laser to create the code and send it to James via conventional optical fiber.</seg>
        <seg id="92">We believe Dr. Know will attempt to hack access to data sharing.</seg>
        <seg id="93">Luckily, his attempts to catch quantum keys along the way will leave fingerprints that James and you will be able to detect.</seg>
        <seg id="94">This will eliminate intercepted keys.</seg>
        <seg id="95">And the remaining keys can be used for enhanced data protection.</seg>
        <seg id="96">Because such security is based on the fundamental laws of physics, a quantum computer, or even any future supercomputer, will not be able to crack it.</seg>
        <seg id="97">My team and I are working with leading universities, as well as the defense sector, to develop this promising technology into the next generation security tools.</seg>
        <seg id="98">The Internet of Things heralds an era in which 25 to 30 billion devices are expected to interact by 2020.</seg>
        <seg id="99">Trust in the systems that support these devices is vital to the proper functioning of our society in the world of the Internet of Things.</seg>
        <seg id="100">I am ready to argue that quantum technologies will be able to provide this confidence, allowing us to take full advantage of the amazing innovations that will enrich our lives.</seg>

        <seg id="1">Recently, cyber attacks on the business world have become more frequent.</seg>
        <seg id="2">Access to data from companies such as JP Morgan, Yahoo, Home Depot and Target has cost them hundreds of millions and, in some cases, billions of dollars.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Too many such attacks are not needed to damage the global economy.</seg>
        <seg id="4">The public sector is also not immune to such problems.</seg>
        <seg id="5">From 2012 to 2014, there was a significant data leak at the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Access to security and fingerprint data for 22 million employees was compromised.</seg>
        <seg id="7">There are known attempts by government-sponsored hackers to influence election results in a number of countries using stolen data.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Two recent cases of large amounts of data disclosure concern the Bundestag, Germany's federal parliament, and the theft of US Democratic National Committee emails.</seg>
        <seg id="9">The cyber threat affects our democratic processes.</seg>
        <seg id="10">The situation is even getting worse.</seg>
        <seg id="11">As computer technology advances, data protection systems are becoming increasingly vulnerable.</seg>
        <seg id="12">There is also concern about a new kind of computer technology - computing on quantum computers, which use the microscopic properties of nature to vastly increase computing power.</seg>
        <seg id="13">It is so powerful that it will be able to crack many modern encryption systems.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Is the situation so hopeless?</seg>
        <seg id="15">Maybe it's time to pack our vital data and prepare for an imminent digital apocalypse?</seg>
        <seg id="16">I would say, "It's not the time yet."</seg>
        <seg id="17">uantum computers are still in development, and it will take many years before they can be put into practice.</seg>
        <seg id="18">More importantly, major breakthroughs are taking place in the area of encryption.</seg>
        <seg id="19">For me, this is a particularly exciting time in the history of secure communications.</seg>
        <seg id="20">About 15 years ago, when I learned about the new possibility of creating quantum effects that do not exist in nature, I was very excited.</seg>
        <seg id="21">I was intrigued by the idea of using the fundamental laws of physics to create more secure encryption.</seg>
        <seg id="22">Today, a number of companies and laboratories around the world, including mine, are working on these technologies to put them into practice.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Right.</seg>
        <seg id="24">Now we are preparing to fight quantum with the help of quantum.</seg>
        <seg id="25">So how does it all work?</seg>
        <seg id="26">First, let's take a short tour of the world of encryption.</seg>
        <seg id="27">To do this, we will need a briefcase, some important documents we want to send to our friend, James Bond, and a lock to keep everything safe.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Since our information is top secret, we need a special portfolio.</seg>
        <seg id="29">It has a special code lock: when it is closed, it converts all text in documents into random numbers.</seg>
        <seg id="30">You put the documents in the briefcase, close the lock - at this very moment all the documents are converted to random numbers - and send the briefcase to James.</seg>
        <seg id="31">While the briefcase is on its way, you call James to provide the code.</seg>
        <seg id="32">After receiving the briefcase, he enters the code, the documents are decrypted, and voila - you just sent an encrypted message to James Bond.</seg>
        <seg id="33">(Laughter) A funny example, but it illustrates three important elements of coding.</seg>
        <seg id="34">Code - we call it the "encryption key."</seg>
        <seg id="35">It is like a password.</seg>
        <seg id="36">Call James to tell him the lock combination code.</seg>
        <seg id="37">This is called a "key exchange" -</seg>
        <seg id="38">guarantee that you securely get the encryption key from the right place.</seg>
        <seg id="39">And a lock that encodes and decodes a document.</seg>
        <seg id="40">This is called a "coding algorithm."</seg>
        <seg id="41">Using a key, it converts text in documents into random numbers.</seg>
        <seg id="42">A good algorithm will encode in such a way that without a key, a document is very difficult to decrypt.</seg>
        <seg id="43">The importance of encryption is that if someone takes possession of a portfolio and hacks it without the help of an encryption key and encoding algorithm, they will still not be able to read its contents.</seg>
        <seg id="44">The information will look like a set of random numbers.</seg>
        <seg id="45">Most security systems rely on a secure key exchange method to transfer the encryption key to the right place.</seg>
        <seg id="46">However, the rapid development of computing power threatens a number of modern methods of key exchange.</seg>
        <seg id="47">Consider one of the most widely used systems today - RSA.</seg>
        <seg id="48">When it was invented in 1977, it was estimated that it would take 40 quadrillion years to hack the 426-bit RSA key.</seg>
        <seg id="49">In 1994, just 17 years later, the code was hacked.</seg>
        <seg id="50">As computers became more powerful, we had to use more complex codes.</seg>
        <seg id="51">Today, we usually use 2,048 or 4,096 bits.</seg>
        <seg id="52">As you can see, code creators and hackers are engaged in an ongoing battle, trying to outwit each other.</seg>
        <seg id="53">And when quantum computers appear in the next 10-15 years, they will be able to hack even faster the complex mathematics that underlies many modern encryption systems.</seg>
        <seg id="54">The quantum computer is likely to turn our current reliable fortress into a simple house of cards.</seg>
        <seg id="55">We have to find a way to defend our fortress.</seg>
        <seg id="56">In recent years, there has been an increasing amount of research into the use of quantum effects to enhance cryptosecurity.</seg>
        <seg id="57">Some interesting discoveries have been made.</seg>
        <seg id="58">Remember the three main elements of encryption: high-quality keys, secure key exchange, and a sophisticated algorithm?</seg>
        <seg id="59">Advances in science and technology threaten two of these three elements.</seg>

        <seg id="1">Как повлияет на экономику решение ЦБ о снижении ключевой ставки</seg>
        <seg id="2">Банк России ожидаемо снова снизил ключевую ставку.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Она опустилась еще на 0,25 процентного пункта, до 4,25% годовых - формально очередного исторического минимума.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Судя по возвращению короткого шага снижения ставки, а также тональности заявлений ЦБ и обновленным прогнозам по российской экономике, регулятор смотрит на экономические перспективы более оптимистично, чем раньше.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Это означает, что нынешний цикл смягчения денежно-кредитной политики вскоре может остановиться.</seg>
        <seg id="6">"Мы продолжили смягчение денежно-кредитной политики, в первую очередь учитывая, что все еще сохраняются риски отклонения инфляции вниз от 4% в 2021 году", - сообщила глава Банка России Эльвира Набиуллина.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Они связаны со значительным снижением экономической активности, падением внутреннего и внешнего спроса.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Восстановление экономики, по словам Набиуллиной, займет более полутора лет.</seg>
        <seg id="9">При этом она отметила, что после снятия ограничений из-за пандемии экономические процессы оживились: восстанавливались энергопотребление, потребительский и инвестиционный спрос, расширялись строительство и выпуск потребительских товаров, замедлились годовые темпы снижения грузооборота транспорта, промпроизводства.</seg>
        <seg id="10">По уточненному прогнозу ЦБ, в 2020 году сокращение экономики составит 4,5-5,5% (до этого ожидалось 4-6%), а восстановительный рост экономики в 2021 году составит 3,5-4,5%, в 2022 году - 2,5-3,5%.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Кроме того, Банк России пересмотрел прогноз по годовым ценам на нефть до 38 и 40 долларов за баррель Urals в 2020 и 2021 году соответственно.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Ранее ЦБ ожидал 27 и 35 долларов за баррель.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Наконец, прогноз Банка России по инфляции на 2020 год составил 3,7-4,2% против ранее ожидавшихся 3,8-4,8%.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Взгляд Банка России на ситуацию в экономике становится более оптимистичным, что приближает нас к концу цикла смягчения, считают экономисты по России и СНГ "Ренессанс Капитала" Софья Донец и Андрей Мелащенко.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Так, Банк России последовательно снижает ключевую ставку больше года, с начала прошлого лета она опустилась уже на 3,5 процентного пункта.</seg>
        <seg id="16">А на прошлом заседании в июне ЦБ понизил ее сразу на один процентный пункт из-за низких темпов инфляции в связи с подавленным спросом и необходимости стимулировать затормозившую из-за пандемии и связанных с ней ограничений экономику.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Шансы на донастройку денежно-кредитной политики сохраняются (на следующем заседании 18 сентября и до конца года), но предел уже близок, соглашается главный аналитик Росбанка Евгений Кошелев.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Совокупность проинфляционных рисков также указывает на близость паузы в смягчении процентной политики - нарушенные цепи поставок, возможный рост издержек из-за мер предотвращения эпидемии и более быстрое (по сравнению с ожиданиями) восстановление спроса, говорит он.</seg>
        <seg id="19">В довершение последующие действия Банка России потребуют большего внимания к инфляционным процессам в ходе сезона сбора урожая, а также внешней волатильности, возросшей на фоне геополитических конфликтов, указывает Кошелев.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Так или иначе снижение ключевой ставки приведет к дальнейшему снижению ставок для наиболее надежных заемщиков, а также, возможно, по ипотеке, говорит старший экономист аналитического управления банка "Открытие" Максим Петроневич.</seg>
        <seg id="21">Коррекция ставок будет носить менее выраженный характер, чем снижение ключевой ставки, уточняет он.</seg>
        <seg id="22">Ставки по потребкредитам могут упасть еще на 0,3-0,6 процентного пункта в течение второго полугодия, ставки по ипотеке могут завершить год в диапазоне 6,2-7%, не исключает экономист "БКС Премьер" Антон Покатович.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Средние ставки по вкладам, по его мнению, тоже будут падать - в ближайшие месяцы они могут опуститься к 4,2-4,5% (сейчас едва выше 4,5%).</seg>
        <seg id="24">Далее они могут опуститься и до 4%, если ЦБ снизит ключевую ставку осенью, считает Покатович.</seg>

        <seg id="2">The Bank of Russia has again lowered the key rate, as expected.</seg>
        <seg id="3">It dropped by another 0.25 of a percentage point, to 4.25% per annum – formally another historical low.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Judging by the return of the short-step rate cut, and also the Central Bank's tone and the updated forecasts for the Russian economy, the regulator sees the economic outlook more optimistically than before.</seg>
        <seg id="5">This means that the current cycle of monetary policy easing may soon be over.</seg>
        <seg id="6">"We continued easing monetary policy, above all considering that there are still risks of inflation fluctuating down from 4% in 2021," said Bank of Russia head Elvira Nabiullina.</seg>
        <seg id="7">They are associated with a significant reduction in economic activity, a fall in internal and external demand.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Economic recovery, according to Nabiullina, will take more than one-and-a-half years.</seg>
        <seg id="9">At the same time, she noted that after the lifting of the restrictions due to the pandemic, economic processes came back to life: energy consumption rebounded, consumer and investor demand, construction and consumer goods output expanded, there was a slowing in the annual pace of decline of cargo transport turnover, industrial production.</seg>
        <seg id="10">According to the Central Bank's updated forecast, economic contraction in 2020 will be 4.5%-5.5% (previously 4%-6% was expected), and recovery economic growth in 2021 will be 3.5%-4.5%, and in 2022 – 2.5%-3.5%.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Also, the Central Bank revised the oil price forecast to 38 and 40 dollars per barrel of Urals in 2020 and 2021 respectively.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Previously the Central Bank expected 27 and 35 dollars a barrel.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Finally, the Bank of Russia's inflation forecast for 2020 was 3.7%-4.2% against the previously expected 3.8%-4.8%.</seg>
        <seg id="14">The Bank of Russia's view on the economic situation is becoming more optimistic, which brings us toward the end of the easing cycle, Renaissance Capital Russia and CIS economists Sofya Donets and Andrei Melashchenko believe.</seg>
        <seg id="15">As such, the Bank of Russia has been progressively lowering the key rate for more than a year, since the start of last year it has already dropped by 3.5 percentage points.</seg>
        <seg id="16">At the last meeting in June, the Central Bank lowered it by one percentage point in one fell swoop due to the slow pace of inflation connected with flat demand and the need to stimulate the economy, which had slowed because of the pandemic and related restrictions.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Chances of further monetary policy adjustments remain (at the next meeting on September 18 and before the end of the year), but the limit is already close, agrees Rosbank chief analyst Yevgeny Koshelev.</seg>
        <seg id="18">A combination of inflationary risks also indicates that a pause in interest rate policy is near – supply chain breakdowns, possible rising costs due to anti-epidemic measures and more rapid (compared with expectations) recovery in demand, he says.</seg>
        <seg id="19">On top of that, subsequent Bank of Russia actions will require more attention to inflationary processes during the harvest season, and also external volatility, which has grown on the backdrop of geopolitical conflicts, Koshelev indicates.</seg>
        <seg id="20">In any case, lowering of the key rate will lead to further reduction in rates for the most reliable borrowers, and also, possibly, in mortgages, says the senior economist for analytical management at Otkritie bank, Maxim Petronevich.</seg>
        <seg id="21">The rates correction will have a less pronounced character than the reduction in the key rate, he clarifies.</seg>
        <seg id="22">BKS Premier economist Anton Pokatovich does not rule out that consumer credit rates may fall by another 0.3-0.6 of a percentage point in the course of the second half-year, and mortgage rates may end the year in the range of 6.2%-7%.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Average rates for deposits, in his opinion, will also fall – in the coming months they may drop to 4.2%-4.5% (currently slightly above 4.5%).</seg>
        <seg id="24">They even may drop further to 4% if the Central Bank lowers the key rate in autumn, Pokatovich believes.</seg>

        <seg id="10">According to the updated forecast of the Central Bank, in 2020 the economy will shrink by 4.5-5.5% (previously 4-6% was expected), and the economic recovery in 2021 will amount to 3.5-4.5%, in 2022 - 2.5-3.5%.</seg>
        <seg id="11">In addition, the Bank of Russia revised its forecast for annual oil prices to $38 and $40 per barrel of Urals in 2020 and 2021, respectively.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Previously, the Central Bank expected $27 and $35 per barrel.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Finally, the Bank of Russia's inflation forecast for 2020 amounted to 3.7-4.2% against the previously expected 3.8-4.8%.</seg>

        <seg id="15">Thus, the Bank of Russia has been consistently reducing the key rate for more than a year, since the beginning of last summer it has already fallen by 3.5 percentage points.</seg>
        <seg id="16">And at the last meeting in June, the Central Bank lowered it immediately by one percentage point due to low inflation rates due to depressed demand and the need to stimulate the economy, which slowed down due to the pandemic and related restrictions.</seg>
        <seg id="17">The chances of fine-tuning monetary policy remain (at the next meeting on September 18 and until the end of the year), but the limit is already close, agrees the chief analyst of Rosbank, Evgeny Koshelev.</seg>
        <seg id="18">The combination of pro-inflationary risks also points to the proximity of a pause in easing interest rate policy - disrupted supply chains, possible cost increases due to epidemic prevention measures and a faster (than expected) recovery in demand, he says.</seg>
        <seg id="19">To top it off, the Bank of Russia's subsequent actions will require greater attention to inflationary processes during the harvest season, as well as external volatility, which has increased amid geopolitical conflicts, Koshelev points out.</seg>
        <seg id="20">One way or another, a reduction in the key rate will lead to a further reduction in rates for the most reliable borrowers, as well as, possibly, on mortgages, says Maxim Petronevich, senior economist at the analytical department of Otkritie Bank.</seg>

        <seg id="22">Rates on consumer loans could fall by another 0.3-0.6 percentage points during the second half of the year, mortgage rates could end the year in the range of 6.2-7%, BKS Premier economist Anton Pokatovich does not rule out.</seg>

        <seg id="9">At the same time, she noted that after the lifting of restrictions due to the pandemic, economic processes have revived: energy consumption, consumer and investment demand have recovered, construction and production of consumer goods have expanded, and the annual rate of decline in the turnover of transport and industrial production has slowed.</seg>
        <seg id="10">According to the updated forecast of the Central Bank, in 2020 the economy will shrink by 4.5-5.5 (previously it was expected to be 4-6), and the recovery growth of the economy in 2021 will be 3.5-4.5, and in 2022 - 2.5-3.5.</seg>
        <seg id="11">In addition, the Bank of Russia has revised its forecast for annual oil prices to 38 and 40 per barrel of Urals in 2020 and 2021, respectively.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Previously, the Central Bank expected 27 and 35 dollars per barrel.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Finally, the Bank of Russia's inflation forecast for 2020 was 3.7-4.2, compared to the previously expected 3.8-4.8.</seg>
        <seg id="14">The Bank of Russia's view of the situation in the economy is becoming more optimistic, which brings us closer to the end of the cycle of easing, according to Renaissance Capital economists for Russia and the CIS, Sofia Donets and Andrei Melashchenko.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Thus, the Bank of Russia has been consistently lowering its key rate for more than a year; since the beginning of last summer, it has already dropped by 3.5 percentage points.</seg>
        <seg id="16">And at the last meeting in June, the Central Bank lowered it by one percentage point at once because of low inflation rates due to depressed demand and the need to stimulate the economy, which has been slowing down due to the pandemic and related restrictions.</seg>
        <seg id="17">The chances of fine-tuning the monetary policy remain (at the next meeting on September 18 and before the end of the year), but the limit is already close, agrees the chief analyst of Rosbank, Evgeny Koshelev.</seg>
        <seg id="18">The combination of pro-inflationary risks also points to a near pause in interest rate policy easing - disrupted supply chains, possible cost increases due to epidemic prevention measures, and a faster-than-expected recovery in demand, he says.</seg>
        <seg id="19">On top of that, the Bank of Russia's subsequent actions will require greater attention to inflationary processes during the harvest season, as well as external volatility, which has increased amid geopolitical conflicts, points out Koshelev.</seg>
        <seg id="20">One way or another, a reduction in the key rate will lead to a further reduction in rates for the most reliable borrowers, as well as, possibly, on mortgages, says Maksim Petronevich, senior economist at the analytical department of Otkritie Bank.</seg>
        <seg id="21">The adjustment of rates will be less pronounced than the reduction of the key rate, he clarifies.</seg>
        <seg id="22">Rates on consumer loans could fall by another 0.3-0.6 percentage points during the second half of the year, mortgage rates could end the year in the range of 6.2-7, says Anton Pokatovich, an economist at BKS Premier.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Average interest rates on deposits, in his opinion, will also fall - in the coming months they could fall to 4.2-4.5 (now barely above 4.5).</seg>
        <seg id="24">Further, they could drop to 4 if the Central Bank lowers the key rate in the autumn, believes Pokatovich.</seg>

        <seg id="2">Украинские военные начали подготовку к прекращению огня на линии разграничения в Донбассе, контроль над выполнением договоренностей будут осуществлять военнослужащие с опытом миротворческих миссий, сообщает штаб Объединенных сил в "Фейсбуке".</seg>
        <seg id="3">"Подразделения из состава Объединенных сил начали подготовку к полному и всеобъемлющему прекращению огня на линии разграничения, которое вступает в действие с 27 июля 2020 года", - говорится в сообщении.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Отмечается, что, начиная с 00:01 27 июля, на каждой из украинских позиций дополнительный контроль за прекращением огня будут осуществлять специально командированные украинские военнослужащие, большинство из которых имеют боевой опыт и непосредственно занимались профильными вопросами во время участия в миротворческих миссиях под эгидой ООН.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Такой шаг позволит "не отвлекать личный состав подразделений Объединенных сил от выполнения боевых задач и предупредить возможные провокации", говорится в сообщении.</seg>
        <seg id="6">На прошедшем в среду заседании контактной группы по Донбассу стороны согласовали комплекс дополнительных мер по контролю перемирия, который кроме прочего включает в себя запрет на деятельность диверсионно-разведывательных групп и запрет на ведение огня, в том числе снайперского.</seg>

        <seg id="2">Последним клубом Прозы была тартуская "Таммека", за которую он выступал в прошлом сезоне.</seg>
        <seg id="3">"Из-за травмы я был вне футбола больше года.</seg>
        <seg id="4">30 апреля перенес операцию.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Но теперь все в порядке - снова готов играть.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Правда, пока моя форма далека от оптимальной.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Когда дебютирую за "Легион"?</seg>
        <seg id="8">Вполне возможно, что 29 июля я сыграю какое-то количество времени на Кубок Эстонии, а 1 августа попаду в заявку на матч чемпионата против "Пайде".</seg>
        <seg id="9">Но все зависит от решения тренера, он будет решать, готов я или нет.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Сам же я считаю, что мне достаточно много еще нужно набирать", - сказал Альберт Проза в воскресенье в интервью ERR.</seg>
        <seg id="11">В текущем чемпионате Эстонии по футболу "Легион" после 14 туров занимает в турнирной таблице девятое место, набрав 10 очков.</seg>
        <seg id="12">"На данный момент, если посмотреть на таблицу, то мы не можем рассуждать о борьбе за высокие места, но "Легион" - амбициозная команда, у нас достаточно хороший состав.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Думаю, что в следующем году результаты у нас будут лучше.</seg>
        <seg id="14">А задача на этот год - сохранить место в высшей лиге и играть более уверенно", - добавил Проза.</seg>
        <seg id="15">"Каких-то личных целей перед собой не ставлю.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Возвращаться в футбол после такой большой паузы нелегко.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Сейчас моя главная задача - помочь команде остаться в высшей лиге и подняться в таблице как можно выше", - сказал нападающий.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Ранее Проза также играл за столичные "Флору" и "Инфонет", финские РоПС и ТПС, мальтийскую "Валетту".</seg>

        <seg id="8">It is quite possible that on July 29 I will play a certain amount of time for the Estonian Cup, and on August 1 I will be included in the squad for the championship match against Paide.</seg>
        <seg id="9">But everything depends on the decision of the coach, he will decide whether I am ready or not.</seg>
        <seg id="10">I myself believe that I still have a lot to recruit, "Albert Proza said in an interview with ERR on Sunday.</seg>
        <seg id="11">In the current Estonian football championship, Legion, after 14 rounds, occupies ninth place in the standings with 10 points.</seg>
        <seg id="12">"At the moment, if you look at the table, we can't talk about the fight for high places, but Legion is an ambitious team, we have a fairly good squad.</seg>
        <seg id="13">I think that next year we will have better results.</seg>
        <seg id="14">And the goal for this year is to maintain a place in the top league and play more confidently, "added Proza.</seg>
        <seg id="15">"I do not set any personal goals for myself.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Returning to football after such a long pause is not easy.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Now my main task is to help the team stay in the top league and climb the table as high as possible, "said the striker.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Previously, Proza also played for the capital's Flora and Infonet, the Finnish RoPS and TPS, and the Maltese Valletta.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Proza played 7 matches for the Estonian national team.</seg>

        <seg id="2">На Главном военно-морском параде в Санкт-Петербурге была применена новая технология съемки: видеокамера "прошла" под одним из кораблей, показав его "с изнанки".</seg>
        <seg id="3">В таком ракурсе был снят проход новейшего серийного малого ракетного корабля "Советск" вдоль Адмиралтейской набережной.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Главный военно-морской парад транслировали телеканал "Россия 1" и сайт Russia.tv.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Ранее, 24 июня, на параде в честь 75-летия Великой Победы камера при переходе с одного плана на другой "прошла" через дуло танка внутрь бронированной машины, а во время полета истребителей пилотажных групп "Русские витязи" и "Стрижи" камера "вылетела" из сопла двигателя самолета.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Главный военно-морской парад в составе 46 боевых кораблей, катеров и подводных лодок, 41 самолета и вертолета морской авиации и более 4 тысяч военнослужащих завершился в акватории Кронштадта.</seg>
        <seg id="7">В параде, в частности, участвовали большой противолодочный корабль "Вице-адмирал Кулаков", корвет "Стойкий", большие десантные корабли "Минск" и "Патриот", атомный подводный ракетоносный крейсер "Орел", подводная лодка "Петропавловск-Камчатский", патрульный корабль "Василий Быков", малые противолодочные корабли "Казанец" и "Уренгой", малые ракетные корабли "Ливень" и "Пассат", ракетный катер "Чувашия".</seg>
        <seg id="8">На рейде Кронштадта в Финском заливе можно было впервые увидеть большой десантный корабль "Петр Моргунов", построенный по проекту 11711 Невского ПКБ на прибалтийском заводе "Янтарь".</seg>
        <seg id="9">Головной корабль этой серии "Иван Грен" уже служит на Северном флоте, передает ТАСС.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Среди других новичков, поступивших недавно на вооружение ВМФ, был первый серийный фрегат "Адмирал флота Касатонов", построенный по проекту 22350 на заводе "Северная верфь".</seg>
        <seg id="11">Еще один новичок ВМФ - дизель-электрическая подводная лодка "Петропавловск-Камчатский" проекта 636.3 ЦКБ морской техники "Рубин", построенная на "Адмиралтейских верфях".</seg>
        <seg id="12">Она пополнила Тихоокеанский флот России в декабре 2019 года.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Другие новейшие корабли, вошедшие недавно в состав ВМФ - малые ракетные корабли "Советск" и "Мытищи" проекта 22800 ("Каракурт"), разработанные ЦМКБ "Алмаз".</seg>
        <seg id="14">В параде на Неве также участвовали малые ракетные корабли "Великий Устюг" и "Серпухов" проекта 21631 "Буян-М".</seg>
        <seg id="15">А самыми крупными участниками стали атомный подводный ракетный крейсер "Орел" и большой противолодочный корабль "Вице-адмирал Кулаков" - их можно было увидеть в Финском заливе.</seg>
        <seg id="16">В знак признания большого вклада российского флота в исследования Мирового океана вместе с боевыми кораблями по Неве прошли два новейших гидрографических катера "Георгий Зима" и "Михаил Казанский". А на Кронштадтском рейде встало океанографическое исследовательское судно "Адмирал Владимирский", завершившее в июне совместную с Русским географическим обществом научную кругосветную экспедицию к берегам Антарктиды в честь 200-летия ее открытия российскими мореплавателями Фаддеем Беллинсгаузеном и Михаилом Лазаревым.</seg>
        <seg id="17">А у Дворцового моста можно было увидеть воссозданный на исторической верфи первый российский линейный корабль XVI века "Полтава".</seg>
        <seg id="18">Этот 54-пушечный парусник был спущен на воду 1712 году, участвовал в войне со шведами, а в 1717 году обеспечивал высадку десанта на остров Готланд.</seg>
        <seg id="19">В 1725 году этот корабль был выведен из состава Балтфлота, а после своего воссоздания - спущен на воду в Санкт-Петербурге 27 мая 2018 года.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Проезд в Кронштадт в этом году был ограничен на время прохождения парада в связи с профилактикой распространения коронавируса COVID-19, передает РИА Новости.</seg>

        <seg id="18">The 54-cannon sailing ship first took to the waters in 1712, participated in the war with the Swedes, and in 1717 landed marines on the island of Gotland.</seg>
        <seg id="19">In 1725, the ship was decommissioned from the Baltic Fleet, and after its recreation, took to the waters again on May 27, 2018.</seg>

        <seg id="7">Последний опрос показал: если бы парламентские выборы проходили сегодня, то за крестьян проголосовали бы 17,6 процентов избирателей, а за консерваторов - 17,2 процента.</seg>
        <seg id="8">По словами директора Vilmorus Владаса Гайдиса, отрыв - в пределах погрешности, и тем не менее правящие перестали отставать от консерваторов.</seg>
        <seg id="9">По мнению Гайдиса, социологическому успеху "крестьян" способствовала новость о том, что их избирательный список возглавит премьер-министр Саулюс Сквернялис.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Этот политик был первым в списке "крестьян" и на выборах 2016 года.</seg>
        <seg id="11">На третьем месте - Социал-демократическая партия, за которую сейчас готовы голосовать 7,1 процента респондентов.</seg>
        <seg id="12">За меся она неожиданно потеряла 2 процента.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Четвертая - Партия труда, возглавляемая бизнесменом русского происхождения Виктором Успасских (6,2 процента).</seg>

        <seg id="7">The latest poll showed that if parliamentary elections were held today, 17.6 percent of voters would vote for the peasants and 17.2 percent for the Conservatives.</seg>
        <seg id="8">According to the director of Vilmorus, Vladas Gaidis, the gap is within the margin of error, and yet the ruling party has stopped lagging behind the conservatives.</seg>
        <seg id="9">According to Gaidis, the news that Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis will head their electoral list contributed to the sociological success of the "peasants."</seg>
        <seg id="10">This politician was also the first on the list of "peasants" in the 2016 elections.</seg>
        <seg id="11">In third place is the Social Democratic Party, for which 7.1 percent of respondents are now ready to vote.</seg>
        <seg id="12">In a month, it unexpectedly lost 2 percent.</seg>
        <seg id="13">The fourth is the Labour Party, headed by a Russian-born businessman, Viktor Uspaskikh (6.2 percent).</seg>
        <seg id="14">According to the poll, other political organizations will not be able to overcome the 5 per cent electoral threshold.</seg>

      <p>
        <seg id="1">Как художнику для меня очень важна взаимосвязь.</seg>
        <seg id="2">В своих работах я пытаюсь показать, что люди неотделимы от природы и что все взаимосвязано.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Впервые я побывала в Антарктиде почти 10 лет назад, там я и увидела айсберги.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Я испытала благоговейный трепет.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Моё сердце забилось быстрее, голова закружилась, пытаясь понять то, что открылось передо мной.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Айсберги вокруг выплывали из воды почти на 200 футов. И я не могла не удивляться тому, что это одна снежинка поверх другой, год за годом.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Айсберги рождаются, когда они откалываются от глетчерных льдов или отламываются от шельфовых ледников.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Каждый айсберг имеет собственную индивидуальность.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Каждый по-своему взаимодействует с окружающей средой и накапливает свой опыт.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Некоторые отказываются сдаваться и держатся до самого горького конца, а другие больше не могут бороться и гибнут в приступе яркой страсти.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Смотря на айсберг, легко подумать, что он изолирован, что он замкнут и одинок, подобно тому, как мы, люди, зачастую видим себя.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Но в жизни всё совсем иначе.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Когда тает айсберг, я вдыхаю его древнюю атмосферу.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Когда тает айсберг, он выделяет пресную, обогащенную минералами, воду, которая питает многие формы жизни.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Я подхожу к фотографированию этих айсбергов, как к созданию портретов своих предков, зная, что в эти индивидуальные моменты они существуют именно в таком образе, и что он уже никогда не повторится.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Они не умирают, когда тают; это не конец, а продолжение их пути в цикле жизни.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Иногда лед в айсбергах, которые я фотографирую, очень молод — ему всего пара тысяч лет.</seg>
        <seg id="18">А некоторые айсберги старше 100 000 лет.</seg>
        <seg id="19">На последних фотографиях, которые я хочу вам показать, запечатлён айсберг, сфотографированный мною в Киртартиватзиаке, в Гренландии.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Очень редкий случай, когда удается увидеть, как айсберг вращается.</seg>
        <seg id="21">So here it is.</seg>
        <seg id="22">Слева видно маленькую лодку.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Длиной примерно 4,5 метра.</seg>
        <seg id="24">Обратите, пожалуйста, внимание на форму айсберга и место его соприкосновения с водой.</seg>
        <seg id="25">Здесь видно, как он начинает вращаться, а лодка переплыла на другую сторону, и там стоит человек.</seg>
        <seg id="26">Это гренландский айсберг среднего размера.</seg>
        <seg id="27">Он выступает из воды примерно на 120 футов или 40 метров.</seg>
        <seg id="28">А вот эта запись в реальном времени.</seg>
        <seg id="29">(Музыка) И так вот просто, айсберг показывает нам другую сторону своей личности.</seg>
        <seg id="30">Спасибо.</seg>

        <seg id="1">As an artist, connection is very important to me.</seg>
        <seg id="2">Through my work I'm trying to articulate that humans are not separate from nature and that everything is interconnected.</seg>
        <seg id="3">I first went to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, where I saw my first icebergs.</seg>
        <seg id="4">I was in awe.</seg>
        <seg id="5">My heart beat fast, my head was dizzy, trying to comprehend what it was that stood in front of me.</seg>
        <seg id="6">The icebergs around me were almost 200 feet out of the water, and I could only help but wonder that this was one snowflake on top of another snowflake, year after year.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Icebergs are born when they calve off of glaciers or break off of ice shelves.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Each iceberg has its own individual personality.</seg>
        <seg id="9">They have a distinct way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Some refuse to give up and hold on to the bitter end, while others can't take it anymore and crumble in a fit of dramatic passion.</seg>
        <seg id="11">It's easy to think, when you look at an iceberg, that they're isolated, that they're separate and alone, much like we as humans sometimes view ourselves.</seg>
        <seg id="12">But the reality is far from it.</seg>
        <seg id="13">As an iceberg melts, I am breathing in its ancient atmosphere.</seg>
        <seg id="14">As the iceberg melts, it is releasing mineral-rich fresh water that nourishes many forms of life.</seg>
        <seg id="15">I approach photographing these icebergs as if I'm making portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these individual moments they exist in that way and will never exist that way again.</seg>
        <seg id="16">It is not a death when they melt; it is not an end, but a continuation of their path through the cycle of life.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Some of the ice in the icebergs that I photograph is very young -- a couple thousand years old.</seg>
        <seg id="18">And some of the ice is over 100,000 years old.</seg>
        <seg id="19">The last pictures I'd like to show you are of an iceberg that I photographed in Qeqetarsuaq, Greenland.</seg>
        <seg id="20">It's a very rare occasion that you get to actually witness an iceberg rolling.</seg>
        <seg id="21">So here it is.</seg>
        <seg id="22">You can see on the left side a small boat.</seg>
        <seg id="23">That's about a 15-foot boat.</seg>
        <seg id="24">And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and where it is at the waterline.</seg>
        <seg id="25">You can see here, it begins to roll, and the boat has moved to the other side, and the man is standing there.</seg>
        <seg id="26">This is an average-size Greenlandic iceberg.</seg>
        <seg id="27">It's about 120 feet above the water, or 40 meters.</seg>
        <seg id="28">And this video is real time.</seg>
        <seg id="29">(Music) And just like that, the iceberg shows you a different side of its personality.</seg>
        <seg id="30">Thank you.</seg>

        <seg id="19">The last pictures I want to show you are of an iceberg that I photographed in Kirtartiwatsiaq, Greenland.</seg>

        <seg id="22">A small boat can be seen on the left.</seg>
        <seg id="23">It is about 4.5 meters long.</seg>
        <seg id="24">Please pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and where it touches the water.</seg>
        <seg id="25">Here you can see how it starts to rotate, and the boat has crossed to the other side, and there is a man standing there.</seg>
        <seg id="26">This is a medium-sized Greenland iceberg.</seg>
        <seg id="27">It juts out of the water about 120 feet or 40 meters.</seg>
        <seg id="28">And here is the recording in real time.</seg>

        <seg id="1">Однажды зимним утром несколько лет назад я ехал на работу в Йоханнесбурге, Южная Африка, и заметил нависающий над городом туман.</seg>
        <seg id="2">Я езжу там почти каждый день, поэтому вряд ли бы я не обратил на это внимание раньше.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Йоханнесбург известен своими особыми горизонтами, которые я едва мог увидеть тем утром.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Вскоре я понял, что это было огромное облако загрязнённого воздуха.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Контраст между привычной для меня живописной средой и тем небом, окутанным смогом, всколыхнуло во мне что-то.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Я был в ужасе от того, что этот город красочных и живописных закатов будет поглощён мглой.</seg>
        <seg id="7">В тот момент у меня возникло сильное желание что-то предпринять, но я не знал что.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Я знал лишь то, что не могу остаться в стороне.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Основная сложность заключалась в том, что я не очень разбирался в экологии, управлении качеством воздуха или химии атмосферы.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Я компьютерный инженер, и я был уверен, что мне не справиться с этой проблемой с помощью кода.</seg>
        <seg id="11">(Смех) Кто я такой, чтобы как-то изменить ситуацию?</seg>
        <seg id="12">Но я был жителем этого города.</seg>
        <seg id="13">В последующие годы я вынес один очень важный урок — урок, к которому нужно отнестись серьёзно, если мы стремимся к лучшему будущему.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Даже если вы не эксперт в какой-либо области, ваш опыт извне может стать ключом к решению сложных проблем в этой сфере.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Иногда ваше уникальное видение может вылиться в неординарную идею, которая сдвинет всё с мёртвой точки, но вы должны быть достаточно смелым, чтобы попытаться это сделать.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Это единственный выход.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Ещё тогда я понял, что для того, чтобы хотя бы попытаться изменить ситуацию к лучшему, для начала мне придётся разобраться в загрязнении воздуха, так я снова стал студентом.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Уже в самом начале моего исследования я узнал, что загрязнение воздуха является главнейшей опасностью для состояния окружающей среды.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Согласно Всемирной организации здравоохранения почти 14 процентов смертей во всём мире в 2012 году были вызваны загрязнением воздуха в домах и загрязнением окружающего воздуха, что особенно распространено в странах с низким и средним уровнем дохода.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Одно лишь загрязнение воздуха приводит к большему количеству смертей ежегодно, чем малярия или ВИЧ/СПИД.</seg>
        <seg id="21">В Африке количество преждевременных смертей из-за небезопасных санитарных условий или недоедания среди детей не идёт ни в какое сравнение с количеством смертей из-за загрязнения воздуха, и это обходится огромными экономическими издержками: более 400 миллиардов долларов США по состоянию на 2013 год, согласно исследованию Организации экономического сотрудничества и развития.</seg>
        <seg id="22">Сейчас в своей работе я изучаю новые возможности в области искусственного интеллекта, где симбиотическая связь между человеком и машиной поможет найти благоприятную основу для принятия правильных решений.</seg>
        <seg id="23">В процессе изучения проблемы загрязнения воздуха стало понятно, что нам необходимо найти способ принятия более верных решений для осуществления контроля за загрязнением воздуха, а учитывая масштабы этой проблемы, необходимо сделать это совместными усилиями.</seg>
        <seg id="24">Поэтому я решил познакомиться с людьми, которые работают в этой области.</seg>
        <seg id="25">Я начал встречаться с должностными лицами Йоханнесбурга и других близлежащих городов, я привлёк также местное научное сообщество, а также сделал несколько холодных звонков.</seg>
        <seg id="26">Процесс налаживания контактов, которым я занялся, помог мне получить более глубокое представление о проблеме.</seg>
        <seg id="27">Это также помогло мне не попасть в ловушку, в которую мои коллеги часто попадают, пытаясь внедрить новшества, когда мы быстро применяем технологию, прежде чем ясно осознаём имеющуюся проблему.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Я начал думать о том, что я могу сделать, чтобы улучшить ситуацию.</seg>
        <seg id="29">Я просто начал спрашивать себя, как я могу эффективно объединить все мои навыки в сфере программирования и искусственного интеллекта с опытом людей, с которыми я познакомился.</seg>
        <seg id="30">Я захотел создать онлайн платформу по регулированию качества воздуха, которая выявит закономерности в загрязнении, заглянет в будущее и определит, чего нам следует ожидать.</seg>
        <seg id="31">Я был намерен реализовать свою идею на практике, но столкнулся с неопределённостью, у меня не было никаких гарантий успеха.</seg>
        <seg id="32">У меня был только определённый набор инженерных навыков, навыков, которые я приобрёл в своей профессии (Смех) и которых не было у людей, занимающихся проблемой загрязнения воздуха в течение долгих лет.</seg>
        <seg id="33">Я понял, что иногда всего лишь один свежий взгляд, какие-то новые навыки создают условия для появления чего-то выдающегося.</seg>
        <seg id="34">Сила воли и воображение являются нашей путеводной звездой, наделяя нас способностью находить новые пути и обходить сложности.</seg>
        <seg id="35">Вооружившись глубоким пониманием проблемы загрязнения воздуха и изучив накопленную десятилетиями информацию о концентрации загрязнителей и метеорологических условиях в Йоханнесбурге и за его пределами, мы со моими коллегами из Южной Африки и Китая создали систему поддержки по принятию решений о воздухе, которая находится в облаке.</seg>
        <seg id="36">Система ПО анализирует исторические данные и данные в режиме реального времени, чтобы выявить пространственные и временные тенденции.</seg>
        <seg id="37">Затем мы использовали новую технологию машинного обучения, чтобы предсказать уровень загрязнения для разных загрязнителей на несколько дней заранее.</seg>
        <seg id="38">Это значит, что жители могут принимать более правильные решения относительно своих перемещений и выбора места жительства для своих семей.</seg>
        <seg id="39">Мы сможем заблаговременно предсказывать случаи загрязнения, вычислять виновников загрязнения, которые по распоряжению властей будут вынуждены сократить масштабы своей деятельности.</seg>
        <seg id="40">С помощью планирования сценариев градостроители смогут принимать правильные решения в развитии инфраструктуры, такой как жилые поселения, промышленные зоны.</seg>
        <seg id="41">Мы завершили тестирование нашей технологии, которое длилось около 120 дней, охватив всю Южную Африку.</seg>
        <seg id="42">Полученные результаты были одобрены, когда мы продемонстрировали тесную взаимосвязь между данными прогноза и данными, которые мы получили на месте.</seg>
        <seg id="43">Благодаря нашему лидерству мы создали передовые, новаторские технологии, которые смогут прогнозировать качество воздуха с беспрецедентной точностью, улучшая город, по которому не так давно я ехал одним зимним утром и думал: «Что-то здесь не так. Что же можно предпринять?»</seg>
        <seg id="44">И вот мой вывод: что, если бы я тогда не стал изучать проблему загрязнения воздуха?</seg>
        <seg id="45">Что, если бы я не выразил обеспокоенность состоянием окружающей среды и просто понадеялся, что кто-то где-то уже занимается этой проблемой?</seg>
        <seg id="46">Вот чему я научился: когда мы решаемся на сложное предприятие, которое способствует тому, во что мы твёрдо верим, важно фокусироваться на успехе и учитывать последствия бездействия.</seg>
        <seg id="47">Мы не должны сходить с пути перед лицом препятствий и трудностей, это должно ещё больше мотивировать нас.</seg>
        <seg id="48">Где бы вы ни находились, когда вы поймёте, что ваше природное любопытство чем-то возбуждено и это то, что вас волнует, и у вас есть сумасшедшие и смелые идеи, и, возможно, это находится вне вашей компетенции, спросите себя: почему бы нет?</seg>
        <seg id="49">Почему бы не начать действовать и не решить проблему, как можешь, своим путём?</seg>
        <seg id="50">И, возможно, вы будете приятно удивлены.</seg>
        <seg id="51">Спасибо.</seg>

      <p>
        <seg id="1">One winter morning, a couple of years ago, I was driving to work in Johannesburg, South Africa, and noticed a haze hanging over the city.</seg>
        <seg id="2">I make that drive on most days, so it was unusual that I hadn't noticed this before.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Johannesburg is known for its distinctive skyline, which I could barely see that morning.</seg>
        <seg id="4">It didn't take long for me to realize that I was looking at an enormous cloud of air pollution.</seg>
        <seg id="5">The contrast between the scenic environment I knew and this smog-covered skyline stirred up something within me.</seg>
        <seg id="6">I was appalled by the possibility of this city of bright and vivid sunsets being overrun by a dull haze.</seg>
        <seg id="7">At that moment, I felt an urge to do something about it, but I didn't know what.</seg>
        <seg id="8">All I knew was I couldn't just stand idly by.</seg>
        <seg id="9">The main challenge was, I didn't know much about environmental science air-quality management or atmospheric chemistry.</seg>
        <seg id="10">I am a computer engineer, and I was pretty sure I couldn't code my way out of this air pollution problem.</seg>
        <seg id="11">(Laughter) Who was I to do anything about this issue?</seg>
        <seg id="12">I was but a citizen.</seg>
        <seg id="13">In the following years, I learned a very important lesson, a lesson we all need to take to heart if we are to work towards a better future.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Even if you're not an expert in a particular domain, your outside expertise may hold the key to solving big problems within that domain.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Sometimes the unique perspective you have can result in unconventional thinking that can move the needle, but you need to be bold enough to try.</seg>
        <seg id="16">That's the only way you'll ever know.</seg>
        <seg id="17">What I knew back then was that if I was even going to try to make a difference, I had to get smart about air pollution first, and so I became a student again.</seg>
        <seg id="18">I did a bit of basic research and soon learned that air pollution is the world's biggest environmental health risk.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Data from the World Health Organization shows that almost 14 percent of all deaths worldwide in 2012 were attributable to household and ambient air pollution, with most occurring in low- and middle-income countries.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Ambient air pollution alone causes more deaths each year than malaria and HIV/AIDS.</seg>
        <seg id="21">In Africa, premature deaths from unsafe sanitation or childhood malnutrition pale in comparison to deaths due to air pollution, and it comes at a huge economic cost: over 400 billion US dollars as of 2013, according to a study by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.</seg>
        <seg id="22">Now, in my work, I explore new frontiers for artificial intelligence, where the symbiotic relationship between man and machine can find a beneficial footing and help us to make better decisions.</seg>
        <seg id="23">As I thought about the air pollution problem, it became clear that we needed to find a way to make better decisions about how we manage air pollution, and given the scale of the problem, it was necessary to do it in a collaborative way.</seg>
        <seg id="24">So I decided I'd better get to know some people working within the field.</seg>
        <seg id="25">I started to speak to officials from the City of Johannesburg and other surrounding cities, and I engaged the local scientific community, and I also made a few cold calls.</seg>
        <seg id="26">The process of engagement I embarked upon helped me to develop a deeper understanding of the problem.</seg>
        <seg id="27">It also helped me to avoid the trap people in my profession sometimes fall into when trying to innovate, where we are quick to apply a technology before we've firmly grasped the problem at hand.</seg>
        <seg id="28">I began to develop an idea about what I could do to improve the situation.</seg>
        <seg id="29">I started by simply asking myself how I could bring together in some meaningful way my skills in software engineering and artificial intelligence and the expertise of the people I'd reached out to.</seg>
        <seg id="30">I wanted to create an online air-quality management platform that would uncover trends in pollution and project into the future to determine what outcomes can be expected.</seg>
        <seg id="31">I was determined to see my idea translate into a practical solution, but I faced uncertainty and had no guarantee of success.</seg>
        <seg id="32">What I had was a very particular set of engineering skills, skills I'd acquired over my career (Laughter) that were new to people who had been working on the air pollution problem for so many years.</seg>
        <seg id="33">What I have come to realize is that sometimes just one fresh perspective, one new skill set, can make the conditions right for something remarkable to happen.</seg>
        <seg id="34">Our willpower and imagination are a guiding light, enabling us to chart new paths and navigate through obstacles.</seg>
        <seg id="35">Armed with a firmer understanding of the air pollution problem, and having managed to source over a decade's worth of data on air pollutant levels and the meteorological conditions for in and around Johannesburg, my colleagues from South Africa and China and myself created an air-quality decision support system that lives in the cloud.</seg>
        <seg id="36">This software system analyzes historical and real-time data to uncover the spatial-temporal trends in pollution.</seg>
        <seg id="37">We then used new machine learning technology to predict future levels of pollution for several different pollutants days in advance.</seg>
        <seg id="38">This means that citizens can make better decisions about their daily movements and about where to settle their families.</seg>
        <seg id="39">We can predict adverse pollution events ahead of time, identify heavy polluters, and they can be ordered by the relevant authorities to scale back their operations.</seg>
        <seg id="40">Through assisted scenario planning, city planners can also make better decisions about how to extend infrastructure, such as human settlements or industrial zones.</seg>
        <seg id="41">We completed a pilot of our technology that was run over a period of 120 days, covering all of South Africa.</seg>
        <seg id="42">Our results were confirmed when we demonstrated a tight correlation between the forecasting data and the data we were getting on the ground.</seg>
        <seg id="43">Through our leadership, we have brought cutting-edge, world-leading assets that can perform air-quality forecasting at an unprecedented resolution and accuracy, benefiting the city that I drove into one winter morning not very long ago, and thought to myself, "Something is wrong here. I wonder what can be done?"</seg>
        <seg id="44">So here is the point: What if I'd not investigated the problem of air pollution further?</seg>
        <seg id="45">What if I'd not shown some concern for the state of the environment and just hoped that someone, somewhere, was taking care of the matter?</seg>
        <seg id="46">What I have learned is that, when embarking on a challenging endeavor that advances a cause that we firmly believe in, it is important to focus on the possibility of success and consider the consequence of not acting.</seg>
        <seg id="47">We should not get distracted by resistance and opposition, but this should motivate us further.</seg>
        <seg id="48">So wherever you are in the world, the next time you find that there's some natural curiosity you have that is being piqued, and it's about something you care about, and you have some crazy or bold ideas, and perhaps it's outside the realm of your expertise, ask yourself this: Why not?</seg>
        <seg id="49">Why not just go ahead and tackle the problem as best as you can, in your own way?</seg>
        <seg id="50">You may be pleasantly surprised.</seg>
        <seg id="51">Thank you.</seg>
        <seg id="52">(Applause)</seg>

        <seg id="31">I was going to put my idea into practice, but faced uncertainty, I had no guarantee of success.</seg>
        <seg id="32">I only had a certain set of engineering skills, skills that I had learned in my profession (Laughter) and that people who had not had in the air pollution problem for many years.</seg>

      <p>
        <seg id="1">One winter morning a few years ago, I was driving to work in Johannesburg, South Africa, when I noticed a fog hanging over the city.</seg>
        <seg id="2">I drive there almost every day, so I probably wouldn't have noticed it before.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Johannesburg is known for its special horizons, which I could barely see that morning.</seg>
        <seg id="4">I soon realized that it was a huge cloud of polluted air.</seg>
        <seg id="5">The contrast between my usual picturesque surroundings and that smog-shrouded sky stirred something in me.</seg>
        <seg id="6">I was terrified that this city of colorful and picturesque sunsets would be swallowed up in the mist.</seg>
        <seg id="7">At that moment, I had a strong desire to do something, but I didn't know what.</seg>
        <seg id="8">All I knew was that I couldn't stay away.</seg>
        <seg id="9">The main difficulty was that I didn't know much about ecology, air quality management, or atmospheric chemistry.</seg>
        <seg id="10">I'm a computer engineer, and I was pretty sure I couldn't handle this problem with code.</seg>
        <seg id="11">(Laughter) Who am I to make a difference?</seg>
        <seg id="12">But I was a resident of this city.</seg>
        <seg id="13">In the years that followed, I learned one very important lesson — a lesson that must be taken seriously if we are to strive for a better future.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Even if you are not an expert in any field, your experience from outside can be the key to solving complex problems in this area.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Sometimes your unique vision can lead to an extraordinary idea that will move everything from the dead end, but you must be brave enough to try to do it.</seg>
        <seg id="16">It's the only way out.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Even then I realized that in order to at least try to change the situation for the better, first I would have to understand air pollution, so I became a student again.</seg>
        <seg id="18">At the very beginning of my research, I learned that air pollution is the main danger to the environment.</seg>
        <seg id="19">According to the World Health Organization, almost 14 percent of deaths worldwide in 2012 were caused by home air pollution and ambient air pollution, which is particularly common in low-and middle-income countries.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Air pollution alone causes more deaths each year than malaria or HIV/AIDS.</seg>
        <seg id="21">In Africa, the number of premature deaths due to unsafe sanitation or malnutrition among children is nothing compared to the number of deaths due to air pollution, and this comes at a huge economic cost: more than $ 400 billion as of 2013, according to a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.</seg>
        <seg id="22">Now in my work, I am exploring new opportunities in the field of artificial intelligence, where the symbiotic relationship between man and machine will help to find a favorable basis for making the right decisions.</seg>
        <seg id="23">In the process of studying the problem of air pollution, it became clear that we need to find a way to make better decisions to control air pollution, and given the scale of this problem, it is necessary to do this together.</seg>
        <seg id="24">So I decided to meet people who work in this field.</seg>
        <seg id="25">I started meeting with officials from Johannesburg and other nearby cities, I also engaged the local scientific community, and I also made some cold calls.</seg>
        <seg id="26">The contact-building process I went through helped me gain a deeper understanding of the problem.</seg>
        <seg id="27">It also helped me avoid falling into the trap that my colleagues often fall into when trying to innovate, where we quickly apply the technology before we clearly recognize the problem.</seg>
        <seg id="28">I started thinking about what I could do to improve the situation.</seg>
        <seg id="29">I just started asking myself how I could effectively combine all my programming and artificial intelligence skills with the experiences of the people I met.</seg>
        <seg id="30">I wanted to create an online air quality management platform that would identify patterns in pollution, look into the future, and determine what we should expect.</seg>
        <seg id="31">I was determined to put my idea into practice, but faced with uncertainty, I had no guarantees of success.</seg>
        <seg id="32">I only had a certain set of engineering skills, skills that I had acquired in my profession (Laughter) and that people who have been dealing with air pollution for many years have not had.</seg>
        <seg id="33">I realized that sometimes just one fresh look, some new skills create the conditions for the appearance of something outstanding.</seg>
        <seg id="34">Willpower and imagination are our guiding stars, giving us the ability to find new ways and avoid difficulties.</seg>
        <seg id="35">Armed with a deep understanding of air pollution and decades of accumulated information on pollutant concentrations and meteorological conditions in Johannesburg and beyond, my colleagues from South Africa and China and I have created a cloud-based air decision support system.</seg>
        <seg id="36">The software system analyzes historical data and real-time data to identify spatial and temporal trends.</seg>
        <seg id="37">We then used a new machine learning technology to predict the level of pollution for different pollutants several days in advance.</seg>
        <seg id="38">This means that residents can make better decisions about their movements and where to live for their families.</seg>
        <seg id="39">We will be able to predict cases of pollution in advance, to calculate the culprits of pollution, who, by order of the authorities, will be forced to reduce the scale of their activities.</seg>
        <seg id="40">With the help of scenario planning, urban planners will be able to make the right decisions in the development of infrastructure, such as residential settlements, industrial zones.</seg>
        <seg id="41">We completed testing of our technology, which lasted about 120 days, covering the whole of South Africa.</seg>
        <seg id="42">The results were welcomed when we demonstrated a close relationship between the forecast data and the data we received on-site.</seg>
        <seg id="43">Thanks to our leadership, we have created cutting-edge, groundbreaking technologies that can predict air quality with unprecedented accuracy, improving a city that not so long ago I was driving through one winter morning and thought, " Something is wrong here. What can be done?»</seg>
        <seg id="44">And here's my conclusion: what if I hadn't studied the problem of air pollution back then?</seg>
        <seg id="45">What if I hadn't expressed concern about the state of the environment and just hoped that someone, somewhere, was already dealing with this problem?</seg>
        <seg id="46">Here's what I've learned: when we embark on a challenging venture that promotes what we firmly believe in, it's important to focus on success and consider the consequences of inaction.</seg>
        <seg id="47">We should not go astray in the face of obstacles and difficulties, this should motivate us even more.</seg>

        <seg id="10">I am a computer engineer and I was sure that I could not deal with this problem using code.</seg>
        <seg id="11">(Laughter) Who am I to somehow make a difference?</seg>
        <seg id="12">But I was a resident of this city.</seg>
        <seg id="13">In the following years, I learned one very important lesson: a lesson that needs to be taken seriously if we are to achieve a better future.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Even if you are not an expert in any field, your experience from the outside can be the key to solving complex problems in this area.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Sometimes your unique vision can result in an extraordinary idea that will move everything from a dead point, but you have to be brave enough to try to do it.</seg>
        <seg id="16">This is the only way out.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Back then, I realized that in order to at least try to make a difference, first I would have to understand air pollution, so I became a student again.</seg>
        <seg id="18">At the very beginning of my research, I learned that air pollution is the most important danger to the state of the environment.</seg>
        <seg id="19">According to the World Health Organization, almost 14 percent of deaths worldwide in 2012 were caused by air pollution in homes and air pollution, which is especially common in low- and middle-income countries.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Air pollution alone causes more deaths each year than malaria or HIV / AIDS.</seg>
        <seg id="21">In Africa, the number of premature deaths due to unsafe sanitary conditions or malnutrition among children cannot be compared to the number of deaths due to air pollution, and this costs huge economic costs: more than 400 billion US dollars as of 2013, according to a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.</seg>
        <seg id="22">Now, in my work, I am exploring new opportunities in the field of artificial intelligence, where the symbiotic relationship between man and machine will help to find a favorable basis for making the right decisions.</seg>
        <seg id="23">In the process of studying the problem of air pollution, it became clear that we need to find a way to make more correct decisions to control air pollution, and given the scale of this problem, we need to do it through joint efforts.</seg>
        <seg id="24">So I decided to meet people who work in this field.</seg>
        <seg id="25">I started meeting with officials from Johannesburg and other nearby cities, I also got involved with the local scientific community, and also made some cold calls.</seg>
        <seg id="26">The process of establishing contacts that I started helped me get a deeper understanding of the problem.</seg>
        <seg id="27">It also helped me not to fall into the trap that my colleagues often fall into when trying to innovate, when we quickly apply technology before we clearly realize the problem.</seg>
        <seg id="28">I started thinking about what I could do to improve the situation.</seg>
        <seg id="29">I just started asking myself how I could effectively combine all my programming and artificial intelligence skills with the experience of the people I met.</seg>
        <seg id="30">I wanted to create an online platform to regulate air quality, which will identify patterns in pollution, look to the future and determine what we should expect.</seg>
        <seg id="31">I intended to put my idea into practice, but faced with uncertainty, I had no guarantees of success.</seg>
        <seg id="32">I only had a certain set of engineering skills, skills that I had acquired in my profession (Laughter) and that people dealing with air pollution for many years did not have.</seg>
        <seg id="33">I realized that sometimes just one fresh look, some new skills create the conditions for the emergence of something outstanding.</seg>
        <seg id="34">Willpower and imagination are our guiding star, giving us the ability to find new ways and bypass difficulties.</seg>
        <seg id="35">Armed with a deep understanding of the problem of air pollution and studying information accumulated for decades about the concentration of pollutants and meteorological conditions in Johannesburg and beyond, my colleagues from South Africa and China and I created a support system for making decisions about the air that is in the cloud.</seg>
        <seg id="36">The software system analyzes historical data and data in real time to identify spatial and temporal trends.</seg>
        <seg id="37">We then used new machine learning technology to predict pollution levels for different pollutants several days in advance.</seg>
        <seg id="38">This means that residents can make better decisions about their movements and their choice of residence for their families.</seg>
        <seg id="39">We will be able to predict cases of pollution in advance, to calculate the culprits of pollution, who, by order of the authorities, will be forced to reduce the scale of their activities.</seg>
        <seg id="40">With the help of scenario planning, urban planners will be able to make the right decisions in the development of infrastructure, such as residential settlements and industrial zones.</seg>
        <seg id="41">We completed testing of our technology, which lasted about 120 days, covering all of South Africa.</seg>
        <seg id="42">The results were approved when we demonstrated a close relationship between forecast data and on-site data.</seg>
        <seg id="43">Thanks to our leadership, we have created advanced, innovative technologies that can predict air quality with unprecedented accuracy, improving the city, which not so long ago I was driving one winter morning and thought: "Something is wrong here.</seg>
        <seg id="44">And here's my conclusion: what if I hadn't studied the problem of air pollution then?</seg>
        <seg id="45">What if I hadn't expressed concern about the state of the environment and just hoped that someone somewhere is already dealing with this problem?</seg>
        <seg id="46">Here's what I learned: when we embark on a complex enterprise that promotes something we firmly believe in, it's important to focus on success and take into account the consequences of inaction.</seg>
        <seg id="47">We should not go out of the way in the face of obstacles and difficulties, it should motivate us even more.</seg>
        <seg id="48">Wherever you are, when you realize that your natural curiosity is excited by something and that's what excites you, and you have crazy and bold ideas, and perhaps that's beyond your competence, ask yourself: why not?</seg>
        <seg id="49">Why not start acting and solve the problem, as you can, in your own way?</seg>
        <seg id="50">And, perhaps, you will be pleasantly surprised.</seg>

      <p>
        <seg id="1">One winter morning a few years ago, I was driving to work in Johannesburg, South Africa, and noticed a fog looming over the city.</seg>
        <seg id="2">I drive there almost every day, so I wouldn't have noticed it before.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Johannesburg is known for its special horizons, which I could barely see that morning.</seg>
        <seg id="4">I soon realised it was a huge cloud of polluted air.</seg>
        <seg id="5">The contrast between my usual scenic environment and the smog-shrouded sky stirred something in me.</seg>
        <seg id="6">I was terrified that this city of colorful and picturesque sunsets would be swallowed up by the darkness.</seg>
        <seg id="7">At that moment, I had a strong desire to do something, but I did not know what.</seg>
        <seg id="8">What I knew was that I could not stand aside.</seg>
        <seg id="9">The main difficulty was that I was not very familiar with ecology, air quality management or atmospheric chemistry.</seg>
        <seg id="10">I am a computer engineer and I was sure I couldn't handle this problem with code.</seg>
        <seg id="11">(Laughter) Who am I to make a difference?</seg>
        <seg id="12">But I was a resident of this city.</seg>
        <seg id="13">In the years that followed, I learned one very important lesson - a lesson that needs to be taken seriously if we want a better future.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Even if you are not an expert in any field, your outside experience can be the key to solving complex problems in this area.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Sometimes your unique vision can turn into an extraordinary idea that will get things off the ground, but you have to be brave enough to try it.</seg>
        <seg id="16">This is the only way out.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Even then, I realised that in order to even try to make a difference, I would first have to deal with air pollution, so I became a student again.</seg>
        <seg id="18">At the very beginning of my research, I learned that air pollution is a major environmental hazard.</seg>
        <seg id="19">According to the World Health Organization, nearly 14 per cent of deaths worldwide in 2012 were caused by indoor air pollution and ambient air pollution, which is particularly prevalent in low- and middle-income countries.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Air pollution alone causes more deaths each year than malaria or HIV / AIDS.</seg>
        <seg id="21">In Africa, the number of premature deaths due to unsafe sanitation or malnutrition among children does not match the number of deaths due to air pollution, and it costs a huge economic cost: more than 400 billion as of 2013, according to a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.</seg>
        <seg id="22">Now, in my work, I am exploring new possibilities in the field of artificial intelligence, where the symbiotic relationship between man and machine will help find a favorable basis for making the right decisions.</seg>
        <seg id="23">In the process of studying the problem of air pollution, it has become clear that we need to find a way to make better decisions to control air pollution, and given the magnitude of the problem, we need to do it together.</seg>
        <seg id="24">So I decided to meet people who work in this area.</seg>
        <seg id="25">I started to meet with officials from Johannesburg and other nearby cities, I also engaged the local scientific community, and also made some cold calls.</seg>
        <seg id="26">The networking process that I took on helped me gain a deeper understanding of the problem.</seg>
        <seg id="27">It also helped me avoid the trap that my colleagues often fall into when trying to innovate, when we quickly apply the technology before we clearly understand the problem.</seg>
        <seg id="28">I started thinking about what I could do to improve the situation.</seg>
        <seg id="29">I just started asking myself how I could effectively combine all my programming and artificial intelligence skills with the experiences of the people I met.</seg>
        <seg id="30">I wanted to create an online air quality management platform that would identify patterns in pollution, look to the future and determine what we should expect.</seg>
        <seg id="31">I was determined to put my idea into practice, but faced uncertainty, I had no guarantee of success.</seg>
        <seg id="32">I only had a certain set of engineering skills, skills that I had acquired in my profession (Laughter) and that people dealing with air pollution have not had for years.</seg>
        <seg id="33">I realized that sometimes just one fresh look, some new skills create the conditions for the emergence of something outstanding.</seg>
        <seg id="34">Willpower and imagination are our guiding light, giving us the ability to find new paths and overcome challenges.</seg>
        <seg id="35">Armed with a deep understanding of the problem of air pollution and having studied decades of information on pollutant concentrations and meteorological conditions in Johannesburg and beyond, my colleagues from South Africa and China and I have created a decision support system for air that is in the cloud.</seg>
        <seg id="36">The software system analyzes historical data and data in real time to identify spatial and temporal trends.</seg>
        <seg id="37">We then used new machine learning technology to predict pollution levels for different pollutants several days in advance.</seg>
        <seg id="38">This means that residents can make better decisions about their movements and the choice of residence for their families.</seg>
        <seg id="39">We will be able to predict pollution events in advance, and we will be able to identify those responsible for pollution, who will be forced to reduce their activities by order of the authorities.</seg>
        <seg id="40">With the help of scenario planning, urban planners will be able to make the right decisions in the development of infrastructure, such as residential settlements, industrial zones.</seg>
        <seg id="41">We have completed testing of our technology, which lasted about 120 days, covering the whole of South Africa.</seg>
        <seg id="42">The results were approved when we demonstrated a close relationship between the forecast data and the data we received on the ground.</seg>
        <seg id="43">Thanks to our leadership, we have created cutting-edge, groundbreaking technologies that will be able to predict air quality with unprecedented accuracy, improving a city that, not so long ago, I drove through one winter morning and thought: "Something is wrong here.</seg>
        <seg id="44">And here's my conclusion: what if I hadn't started to study the problem of air pollution then?</seg>
        <seg id="45">What if I didn't express concern about the state of the environment and just hoped that someone somewhere is already dealing with this problem?</seg>
        <seg id="46">That's what I've learned: when we embark on a complex venture that contributes to what we strongly believe in, it's important to focus on success and consider the consequences of inaction.</seg>
        <seg id="47">We must not lose our way in the face of obstacles and difficulties, and this should motivate us even more.</seg>
        <seg id="48">Wherever you are, when you realise that your natural curiosity is something that excites you and that's what you care about, and you have crazy and bold ideas, and maybe that's beyond your competence, ask yourself: why not?</seg>
        <seg id="49">Why not take action and solve the problem as you can in your own way?</seg>
        <seg id="50">And maybe you will be pleasantly surprised.</seg>

        <seg id="2">В "смертельном квартете" одним зи главных критериев оказалось превышение объема талии</seg>
        <seg id="3">Врач и телеведущий Александр Мясников рассказал о ключевых показателях, по которым можно определить здоровье человека.</seg>
        <seg id="4">В его так называемый "смертельный квартет" вошли четыре критерия - это повышение давления, холестерина, сахара и объема талии, рассказал доктор в эфире телеканала "Россия 1".</seg>
        <seg id="5">Мясников призвал каждого обращать внимание на эти факторы.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Причем по его словам, контролировать объем талии даже важнее, чем вес.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Для мужчин этот параметр не должен превышать 102 сантиметра, для женщин - 88 сантиметров.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Превышение этих норм может говорить о том, что здоровье находится под угрозой.</seg>
        <seg id="9">В первую очередь речь идет о состоянии сердца - объем талии выше нормы является фактором риска возникновения инсульта, инфаркта, а также рака и диабета.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Напомним, ранее Мясников рассказал, почему можно на ночь съесть конфету.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Врач пояснил, что сахар сам по себе не опасен для здоровья, вредными десерт станет только когда есть такую пищу в большом количестве, а конфета на ночь, по его словам, не самый худший перекус.</seg>

        <seg id="4">His so-called “deadly quartet” included four criteria – increased blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar, and waist size, the doctor said on the channel Russia 1.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Myasnikov encouraged everyone to be attentive to these factors.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Moreover, according to him, controlling waist size is even more important than weight.</seg>
        <seg id="7">For men, this parameter should be no more than 102 centimeters, for women – 88 centimeters.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Exceeding these standards could mean health is at risk.</seg>

        <seg id="2">Эксперты по международным делам Аарон Дэвид Миллер и Ричард Сокольский назвали Майка Помпео худшим государственным секретарем в истории Соединенных Штатов.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Материал с их мнением 23 июля опубликовал CNN.</seg>
        <seg id="4">"Всего за два коротких года Майк Помпео - с прицелом на президентский пост в 2024 году и поддержку президента Дональда Трампа - стал не только худшим госсекретарем в истории США, но и самым политически предвзятым", - говорится в тексте.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Специалисты обвинили Помпео в том, что он "политизировал должность госсекретаря и осквернил учреждение, которым он руководит", ради продвижения своей личной политической программы и защиты Трампа "от ответственности и верховенства закона".</seg>
        <seg id="6">По их словам, госсекретарь, в частности, прикрывает "трамповский шантаж Украины" и готов подставлять сотрудников американского внешнеполитического ведомства за их сотрудничество с конгрессом по данному делу.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Кроме того, Помпео припомнили, что он был изрядно приветлив с наследным принцем Саудовской Аравии Мухаммедом бен Салманом, который взял на себя частичную ответственность за убийство обозревателя The Washington Post Джамаля Хашкаджи.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Трамп объявил о решении назначить Майка Помпео главой Госдепа 13 марта 2018 года после увольнения бывшего госсекретаря Рекса Тиллерсона.</seg>
        <seg id="9">До этого Помпео возглавлял Центральное разведывательное управление (ЦРУ).</seg>

      <p>
        <seg id="1">Знаете ли вы, сколько существует видов цветковых растений?</seg>
        <seg id="2">Четверть миллиона — по крайней мере, тех, которые нам известны — четверть миллиона видов цветковых растений.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Цветы – это настоящая проблема для растений:</seg>
        <seg id="4">их тяжело создавать,</seg>
        <seg id="5">они требуют огромного количества энергии и ресурсов.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Почему же растения идут на такие сложности?</seg>
        <seg id="7">Ответ на этот, как и на многие другие вопросы, - секс.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Я знаю, о чём вы думаете, когда смотрите на эти картинки.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Причина, по которой половое размножение так важно – есть много других способов размножения растений.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Их можно размножать черенками; они могут сами себя оплодотворять или сами себя опылять.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Но им очень важно распространять свои гены, чтобы смешать их с генами других растений - так они смогут приспособиться к природным нишам.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Так работает эволюция.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Растения передают генетическую информацию через пыльцу.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Некоторые из вас могли видеть какие-то из этих изображений ранее.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Как я люблю говорить, в каждом доме должен быть растровый электронный микроскоп, чтобы смотреть на эти вещи.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Существует столько же разных типов пыльцы, сколько цветковых растений.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Кстати, это можно применить в криминалистике и не только.</seg>
        <seg id="18">В основном, пыльца, которая вызывает аллергию - это пыльца растений, использующих ветер для её распространения. Это очень неэффективный процесс, вот поэтому-то она так сильно забивается в наши носы.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Растениям приходится выбрасывать огромные массы пыльцы, в надежде, что половые клетки, мужские половые клетки, которые содержатся в пыльце, как-нибудь случайно доберутся до другого цветка, абсолютно случайно.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Пыльца всех трав, а значит, и всех зерновых культур, и пыльца большей части деревьев, переносится ветром.</seg>
        <seg id="21">Однако большая часть видов использует для этого насекомых. В некоторой степени, это более разумно, потому что требуется меньше пыльцы.</seg>
        <seg id="22">Насекомые и другие виды могут брать пыльцу и переносить её туда, где она нужна.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Понятно, что нам известны взаимоотношения между насекомыми и растениями.</seg>
        <seg id="24">Это симбиотические отношения: будь то мухи, птицы или пчёлы - все они что-то получают взамен, и это что-то обычно является нектаром.</seg>
        <seg id="25">В некоторых случаях этот симбиоз привёл к изумительным адаптациям — так, колибри ястреб-моль прекрасна в своей адаптации.</seg>
        <seg id="26">Растение получает своё - ястребиная моль распространяет пыльцу в другом месте.</seg>
        <seg id="27">Растения эволюционировали так, что создали маленькие посадочные полосы в разных местах для пчёл, чтобы те не потерялись.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Многие растения имеют окраску, делающую их похожими на насекомых.</seg>
        <seg id="29">Это — пыльники лилии, умно сделанные так, что когда ничего не подозревающее насекомое садится на них, пыльник переворачивается и ударяет его по спине, осыпая большим количеством пыльцы, с которым насекомое потом отправляется к другому растению.</seg>
        <seg id="30">А вот орхидея, которая выглядит так, как будто у неё есть челюсти. В каком-то смысле, они у неё есть, что принуждает насекомое выползать, покрываясь пыльцой, которую оно потом распространит.</seg>
        <seg id="31">Существует как минимум 20 тысяч видов орхидей — и все они удивительно разнообразны.</seg>
        <seg id="32">Они идут на самые разные хитрости.</seg>
        <seg id="33">Они вынуждены привлекать опылителей, чтобы размножаться.</seg>
        <seg id="34">Эта орхидея, известная как орхидея Дарвина, потому что именно он её изучал и сделал поразительное предсказание, когда её увидел. Можно видеть очень длинную трубочку с нектаром, которая ниспадает из орхидеи.</seg>
        <seg id="35">Вы видите середину цветка: насекомое должно засунуть хоботок прямо в середину и добраться до самого дна этой трубочки, чтобы получить нектар.</seg>
        <seg id="36">Дарвин утверждал, глядя на этот цветок: «Я предполагаю кое-что эволюционировало совместно с ним».</seg>
        <seg id="37">И действительно, вот и насекомое.</seg>
        <seg id="38">Обычно его хоботок в свёрнутом состоянии, но в его выпрямленной форме он выглядит вот так.</seg>
        <seg id="39">Можно подумать, что если нектар — настолько ценный и дорогой в производстве - привлекает столько внимания опылителей, то, как и с сексом у людей, могут начаться обманы.</seg>
        <seg id="40">Цветок может сказать: «У меня есть немного нектара.</seg>
        <seg id="41">Заглянешь?» Вот растение.</seg>
        <seg id="42">Вот это растение, которое обожают насекомые в Южной Африке. В процессе эволюции они приобрели длинный хоботок, чтобы доставать нектар со дна.</seg>
        <seg id="43">А это — подражание.</seg>
        <seg id="44">Это растение подражает предыдущему.</seg>
        <seg id="45">А вот и длиннохоботковая муха, которой не досталось ни капли нектара от подделки. Потому что подражающее растение не дало ей нисколько. Она думала, что ей что-то достанется.</seg>
        <seg id="46">Но муха не только не получила нектара от растения-подделки, но и — если приблизить - в районе нижней части головы, прихватила немного пыльцы, которую она перенесёт на другое растение, если только не появится какой-нибудь ботаник и не приколет её на голубенькую картонку.</seg>
        <seg id="47">(Смех) Обман распространяется и в царстве растений.</seg>
        <seg id="48">У этого цветка есть чёрные точки: нам они кажутся чёрными, но для мужских особей насекомых определённого вида, они похожи на двух самок, готовых на всё.</seg>
        <seg id="49">(Смех) Когда насекомое добирается до этого цветка и приземляется на него, оно окунает себя в пыльцу, которую, конечно, перенесёт на другое растение. Если посмотреть в тот самый растровый электронный микроскоп, который должен быть в каждом доме, можно наблюдать здесь определённую трёхмерную компоновку узора.</seg>
        <seg id="50">Так что это, наверное, даже приносит приятные ощущения насекомому, кроме того, что выглядит привлекательно.</seg>
        <seg id="51">На картинке из электронного микроскопа — вот орхидея подражающая насекомому — видно, что разные части этой структуры обладают разными цветами и текстурами, однако насекомые могут воспринимать их совершенно по-другому.</seg>
        <seg id="52">Вот это растение приспособилось подражать блестящей металлической поверхности тела некоторых жуков.</seg>
        <seg id="53">Под растровым электронным микроскопом видно, что поверхность сильно отличается от тех поверхностей, на которые мы смотрели.</seg>
        <seg id="54">Иногда всё растение целиком имитирует насекомое, даже с нашей точки зрения.</seg>
        <seg id="55">Я думаю, что это похоже на какую-то летающую тварь.</seg>
        <seg id="56">Это поразительный, удивительный цветок.</seg>
        <seg id="57">И умный. Он называется обсидиан.</seg>
        <seg id="58">Я называю его хитродиан.</seg>
        <seg id="59">Для пчелы определённого вида он напоминает другую очень агрессивную пчелу, и она подлетает и ударяет его головой много раз, чтобы отогнать «пчелу», и, конечно, покрывается пыльцой.</seg>
        <seg id="60">Это растение также подражает другой орхидее, у которой есть чудесный склад пищи для насекомых.</seg>
        <seg id="61">А у этой ничего для них нет.</seg>
        <seg id="62">Так что она обманывает на двух уровнях — просто неслыханно.</seg>
        <seg id="63">(Смех) Вот иланг-иланг, компонент многих парфюмерных изделий.</seg>
        <seg id="64">Я недавно унюхал кого-то, кто им надушился.</seg>
        <seg id="65">Цветам в принципе не нужно быть настолько благоухающими.</seg>
        <seg id="66">Они испускают поразительный спектр запахов для любых насекомых с обонянием.</seg>
        <seg id="67">А вот это пахнет не так уж хорошо.</seg>
        <seg id="68">Это цветок, который пахнет очень, очень дурно, и эволюционировал он, чтобы выглядеть как падаль.</seg>
        <seg id="69">Это очень нравится мухам.</seg>
        <seg id="70">Они залетают и опыляют.</seg>
        <seg id="71">Вот этот, геликодицерос, также известный под названием «лилия мертвой лошади».</seg>
        <seg id="72">Я не знаю, как действительно пахнет мертвая лошадь, но этот определённо пахнет очень похоже.</seg>
        <seg id="73">Это действительно ужасно.</seg>
        <seg id="74">И мясные мухи просто не могут устоять.</seg>
        <seg id="75">Они залетают внутрь и долетают до самого дна.</seg>
        <seg id="76">Там они откладывают яйца, думая, что это отличный кусок падали, и не понимая, что тут нет пищи для личинок и личинки погибнут, однако тем временем растение получило выгоду, потому что щетинки расслабляются, и муха улетает опылять следующий цветок. Это потрясающе.</seg>
        <seg id="77">Вот арум, арум макулатум, или же в США – аронник пятнистый.</seg>
        <seg id="78">Я сфотографировал его на предыдущей неделе в Дорсете.</seg>
        <seg id="79">Он разогревается примерно на 15 градусов выше температуры окружающей среды — поразительно.</seg>
        <seg id="80">Если заглянуть в него сверху, то за початком видно нечто, похожее на плотину. Мух привлекает жар — испарение летучих соединений — и они застревают внизу в этом контейнере.</seg>
        <seg id="81">Они пьют божественный нектар и становятся липкими.</seg>
        <seg id="82">За ночь они покрываются пыльцой, обтекающей их сверху, а затем щетинки, которые мы видели выше, ослабляются и выпускают мушек, покрытых пыльцой. Потрясающая вещь.</seg>
        <seg id="83">Если вы думаете, что это поразительно, то вот один из моих любимчиков.</seg>
        <seg id="84">Филодендрон Селло.</seg>
        <seg id="85">Те, кто из Бразилии, должны знать об этом растении.</seg>
        <seg id="86">Это самая поразительная вещь.</seg>
        <seg id="87">Вот эта фаллическая штука примерно 30 сантиметров длиной.</seg>
        <seg id="88">Оно делает кое-что, что не делает ни одно другое известное мне растение: когда оно цветёт — вот в середине початок — на протяжении примерно двух дней, его обмен веществ похож на обмен веществ млекопитающих.</seg>
        <seg id="89">Вместо крахмала, являющегося пищей для растений, оно берёт что-то похожее на бурый жир и сжигает его с такой скоростью, переваривает так же, как небольшого размера кот.</seg>
        <seg id="90">Эта отдача энергии, в эквивалентном весе, в два раза выше, чем у колибри — совершенно поразительно.</seg>
        <seg id="91">А ещё оно делает кое-что другое, тоже необычное.</seg>
        <seg id="92">Оно не только разогревает себя до 115 по Фаренгейту, или 43-44 по Цельсию, в течение двух дней, но и поддерживает температуру постоянной.</seg>
        <seg id="93">У него есть механизм терморегуляции, который поддерживает постоянную температуру.</seg>
        <seg id="94">Вы спросите: «Почему же он это делает?»</seg>
        <seg id="95">Ну как будто вы не знали, что есть жуки, которые просто обожают заниматься любовью при этой температуре.</seg>
        <seg id="96">Они забираются внутрь, и там такое начинается.</seg>
        <seg id="97">(Смех) А растение осыпает их пыльцой, и они отправляются опылять.</seg>
        <seg id="98">Удивительно придумано.</seg>
        <seg id="99">Большинство известных нам опылителей - насекомые, но в тропиках также многие птицы и бабочки опыляют.</seg>
        <seg id="100">Многие тропические цветы красные, и нам кажется, что всё это потому, что что у бабочек и птиц зрение похоже на наше, и что они видят красный цвет очень хорошо.</seg>
        <seg id="101">Но если взглянуть на спектр, то человек и птица видят красный, зелёный и синий - они видят этот спектр.</seg>
        <seg id="102">Насекомые же видят зеленый, синий и ультрафиолет, причем они различают разные оттенки ультрафиолета,</seg>
        <seg id="103">которые находятся на этом конце спектра.</seg>
        <seg id="104">Наверняка вы думаете: «Было бы здорово, если бы мы могли увидеть их».</seg>
        <seg id="105">Да, мы можем.</seg>
        <seg id="106">Так что же видит насекомое?</seg>
        <seg id="107">На прошлой неделе я снял вот эти фотографии cолнцецвета, семейство ладанниковые, в Дорсете.</seg>
        <seg id="108">Это те самые маленькие жёлтые цветочки, которые мы наблюдаем повсеместно.</seg>
        <seg id="109">Так это выглядит при дневном свете.</seg>
        <seg id="110">А вот так это выглядит, если убрать красный.</seg>
        <seg id="111">Большинство пчел не видят красный.</seg>
        <seg id="112">Затем я надел на камеру ультрафиолетовые фильтры и сделал очень, очень длинную выдержку с определёнными частотами ультрафиолета, и вот что получилось.</seg>
        <seg id="113">Самое что ни на есть «яблочко».</seg>
        <seg id="114">Конечно, мы знаем, что именно видят пчелы, не более чем вы знаете, что вижу я, когда я называю вот это красным.</seg>
        <seg id="115">Мы не можем сказать, что происходит в уме соседа, не говорят уже о насекомом.</seg>
        <seg id="116">Но картинка будет примерно такой же контрастной, сильно выделяющейся на заднем фоне.</seg>
        <seg id="117">Вот ещё один маленький цветок — иной диапазон частот ультрафиолета, другие фильтры, для совпадения с опылителями.</seg>
        <seg id="118">Они будут видеть примерно вот это.</seg>
        <seg id="119">На случай, если вы подумаете, что это относится ко всем желтым цветам — ни один цветок в процессе съёмки не пострадал, этот был просто прикреплен к штативу, а не сорван - когда они в ультрафиолетовом свете, то взгляните на этот.</seg>
        <seg id="120">Кстати, он мог послужить основой солнцезащитного крема, потому что такие кремы работают за счет поглощения ультрафиолета.</seg>
        <seg id="121">Может быть, это соединение было бы полезным.</seg>
        <seg id="122">Наконец, вот одна из энотер, которые Бьорн Рорслетт из Норвегии прислал мне — фантастический скрытый узор.</seg>
        <seg id="123">Мне нравится идея чего-то скрытого.</seg>
        <seg id="124">Я думаю, в этом есть что-то поэтическое. Эти фотографии были сняты с ультрафиолетовым фильтром, который в основном используется астрономами для съёмки Венеры — на самом деле облаков Венеры.</seg>
        <seg id="125">Это основное назначение этого фильтра.</seg>
        <seg id="126">Венера, конечно, богиня любви и плодородия, а это созвучно с цветами.</seg>
        <seg id="127">Цветы не только тратят множество усилий на привлечение опылителей, они также как-то умудрились убедить нас высаживать целые поля цветов и дарить их друг другу в моменты рождения и смерти, и, в частности, на свадьбу, которая, если подумать, является моментом, олицетворяющим перенос генетического материала от одного организма другому.</seg>
        <seg id="128">Большое спасибо.</seg>

      <p>
        <seg id="1">Do you know how many species of flowering plants there are?</seg>
        <seg id="2">There are a quarter of a million -- at least those are the ones we know about -- a quarter of a million species of flowering plants.</seg>
        <seg id="3">And flowers are a real bugger.</seg>
        <seg id="4">They're really difficult for plants to produce.</seg>
        <seg id="5">They take an enormous amount of energy and a lot of resources.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Why would they go to that bother?</seg>
        <seg id="7">And the answer of course, like so many things in the world, is sex.</seg>
        <seg id="8">I know what's on your mind when you're looking at these pictures.</seg>
        <seg id="9">And the reason that sexual reproduction is so important -- there are lots of other things that plants can do to reproduce.</seg>
        <seg id="10">You can take cuttings; they can sort of have sex with themselves; they can pollinate themselves.</seg>
        <seg id="11">But they really need to spread their genes to mix with other genes so that they can adapt to environmental niches.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Evolution works that way.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Now the way that plants transmit that information is through pollen.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Some of you may have seen some of these pictures before.</seg>
        <seg id="15">As I say, every home should have a scanning electron microscope to be able to see these.</seg>
        <seg id="16">And there is as many different kinds of pollen as there are flowering plants.</seg>
        <seg id="17">And that's actually rather useful for forensics and so on.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Most pollen that causes hay fever for us is from plants that use the wind to disseminate the pollen, and that's a very inefficient process, which is why it gets up our noses so much.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Because you have to chuck out masses and masses of it, hoping that your sex cells, your male sex cells, which are held within the pollen, will somehow reach another flower just by chance.</seg>
        <seg id="20">So all the grasses, which means all of the cereal crops, and most of the trees have wind-borne pollen.</seg>
        <seg id="21">But most species actually use insects to do their bidding, and that's more intelligent in a way, because the pollen, they don't need so much of it.</seg>
        <seg id="22">The insects and other species can take the pollen, transfer it directly to where it's required.</seg>
        <seg id="23">So we're aware, obviously, of the relationship between insects and plants.</seg>
        <seg id="24">There's a symbiotic relationship there, whether it's flies or birds or bees, they're getting something in return, and that something in return is generally nectar.</seg>
        <seg id="25">Sometimes that symbiosis has led to wonderful adaptations -- the hummingbird hawk-moth is beautiful in its adaptation.</seg>
        <seg id="26">The plant gets something, and the hawk-moth spreads the pollen somewhere else.</seg>
        <seg id="27">Plants have evolved to create little landing strips here and there for bees that might have lost their way.</seg>
        <seg id="28">There are markings on many plants that look like other insects.</seg>
        <seg id="29">These are the anthers of a lily, cleverly done so that when the unsuspecting insect lands on it, the anther flips up and whops it on the back with a great load of pollen that it then goes to another plant with.</seg>
        <seg id="30">And there's an orchid that might look to you as if it's got jaws, and in a way, it has; it forces the insect to crawl out, getting covered in pollen that it takes somewhere else.</seg>
        <seg id="31">Orchids: there are 20,000, at least, species of orchids -- amazingly, amazingly diverse.</seg>
        <seg id="32">And they get up to all sorts of tricks.</seg>
        <seg id="33">They have to try and attract pollinators to do their bidding.</seg>
        <seg id="34">This orchid, known as Darwin's orchid, because it's one that he studied and made a wonderful prediction when he saw it -- you can see that there's a very long nectar tube that descends down from the orchid.</seg>
        <seg id="35">And basically what the insect has to do -- we're in the middle of the flower -- it has to stick its little proboscis right into the middle of that and all the way down that nectar tube to get to the nectar.</seg>
        <seg id="36">And Darwin said, looking at this flower, "I guess something has coevolved with this."</seg>
        <seg id="37">And sure enough, there's the insect.</seg>
        <seg id="38">And I mean, normally it kind of rolls it away, but in its erect form, that's what it looks like.</seg>
        <seg id="39">Now you can imagine that if nectar is such a valuable thing and expensive for the plant to produce and it attracts lots of pollinators, then, just as in human sex, people might start to deceive.</seg>
        <seg id="40">They might say, "I've got a bit of nectar. Do you want to come and get it?"</seg>
        <seg id="41">Now this is a plant.</seg>
        <seg id="42">This is a plant here that insects in South Africa just love, and they've evolved with a long proboscis to get the nectar at the bottom.</seg>
        <seg id="43">And this is the mimic.</seg>
        <seg id="44">So this is a plant that is mimicking the first plant.</seg>
        <seg id="45">And here is the long-probosced fly that has not gotten any nectar from the mimic, because the mimic doesn't give it any nectar. It thought it would get some.</seg>
        <seg id="46">So not only has the fly not got the nectar from the mimic plant, it's also -- if you look very closely just at the head end, you can see that it's got a bit of pollen that it would be transmitting to another plant, if only some botanist hadn't come along and stuck it to a blue piece of card.</seg>
        <seg id="47">(Laughter) Now deceit carries on through the plant kingdom.</seg>
        <seg id="48">This flower with its black dots: they might look like black dots to us, but if I tell you, to a male insect of the right species, that looks like two females who are really, really hot to trot.</seg>
        <seg id="49">(Laughter) And when the insect gets there and lands on it, dousing itself in pollen, of course, that it's going to take to another plant, if you look at the every-home-should-have-one scanning electron microscope picture, you can see that there are actually some patterning there, which is three-dimensional.</seg>
        <seg id="50">So it probably even feels good for the insect, as well as looking good.</seg>
        <seg id="51">And these electron microscope pictures -- here's one of an orchid mimicking an insect -- you can see that different parts of the structure have different colors and different textures to our eye, have very, very different textures to what an insect might perceive.</seg>
        <seg id="52">And this one is evolved to mimic a glossy metallic surface you see on some beetles.</seg>
        <seg id="53">And under the scanning electron microscope, you can see the surface there -- really quite different from the other surfaces we looked at.</seg>
        <seg id="54">Sometimes the whole plant mimics an insect, even to us.</seg>
        <seg id="55">I mean, I think that looks like some sort of flying animal or beast.</seg>
        <seg id="56">It's a wonderful, amazing thing.</seg>
        <seg id="57">This one's clever. It's called obsidian.</seg>
        <seg id="58">I think of it as insidium sometimes.</seg>
        <seg id="59">To the right species of bee, this looks like another very aggressive bee, and it goes and bonks it on the head lots and lots of times to try and drive it away, and, of course, covers itself with pollen.</seg>
        <seg id="60">The other thing it does is that this plant mimics another orchid that has a wonderful store of food for insects.</seg>
        <seg id="61">And this one doesn't have anything for them.</seg>
        <seg id="62">So it's deceiving on two levels -- fabulous.</seg>
        <seg id="63">(Laughter) Here we see ylang ylang, the component of many perfumes.</seg>
        <seg id="64">I actually smelt someone with some on earlier.</seg>
        <seg id="65">And the flowers don't really have to be that gaudy.</seg>
        <seg id="66">They're sending out a fantastic array of scent to any insect that'll have it.</seg>
        <seg id="67">This one doesn't smell so good.</seg>
        <seg id="68">This is a flower that really, really smells pretty nasty and is designed, again, evolved, to look like carrion.</seg>
        <seg id="69">So flies love this.</seg>
        <seg id="70">They fly in and they pollinate.</seg>
        <seg id="71">This, which is helicodiceros, is also known as dead horse arum.</seg>
        <seg id="72">I don't know what a dead horse actually smells like, but this one probably smells pretty much like it.</seg>
        <seg id="73">It's really horrible.</seg>
        <seg id="74">And blowflies just can't help themselves.</seg>
        <seg id="75">They fly into this thing, and they fly all the way down it.</seg>
        <seg id="76">They lay their eggs in it, thinking it's a nice bit of carrion, and not realizing that there's no food for the eggs, that the eggs are going to die, but the plant, meanwhile, has benefited, because the bristles release and the flies disappear to pollinate the next flower -- fantastic.</seg>
        <seg id="77">Here's arum, arum maculatum, "lords and ladies," or "cuckoo-pint" in this country.</seg>
        <seg id="78">I photographed this thing last week in Dorset.</seg>
        <seg id="79">This thing heats up by about 15 degrees above ambient temperature -- amazing.</seg>
        <seg id="80">And if you look down into it, there's this sort of dam past the spadix, flies get attracted by the heat -- which is boiling off volatile chemicals, little midges -- and they get trapped underneath in this container.</seg>
        <seg id="81">They drink this fabulous nectar and then they're all a bit sticky.</seg>
        <seg id="82">At night they get covered in pollen, which showers down over them, and then the bristles that we saw above, they sort of wilt and allow all these midges out, covered in pollen -- fabulous thing.</seg>
        <seg id="83">Now if you think that's fabulous, this is one of my great favorites.</seg>
        <seg id="84">This is the philodendron selloum.</seg>
        <seg id="85">For anyone here from Brazil, you'll know about this plant.</seg>
        <seg id="86">This is the most amazing thing.</seg>
        <seg id="87">That sort of phallic bit there is about a foot long.</seg>
        <seg id="88">And it does something that no other plant that I know of does, and that is that when it flowers -- that's the spadix in the middle there -- for a period of about two days, it metabolizes in a way which is rather similar to mammals.</seg>
        <seg id="89">So instead of having starch, which is the food of plants, it takes something rather similar to brown fat and burns it at such a rate that it's burning fat, metabolizing, about the rate of a small cat.</seg>
        <seg id="90">And that's twice the energy output, weight for weight, than a hummingbird -- absolutely astonishing.</seg>
        <seg id="91">This thing does something else which is unusual.</seg>
        <seg id="92">Not only will it raise itself to 115 Fahrenheit, 43 or 44 degrees Centigrade, for two days, but it keeps constant temperature.</seg>
        <seg id="93">There's a thermoregulation mechanism in there that keeps constant temperature.</seg>
        <seg id="94">Now why does it do this, I hear you ask.</seg>
        <seg id="95">Now wouldn't you know it, there's some beetles that just love to make love at that temperature.</seg>
        <seg id="96">And they get inside, and they get it all on.</seg>
        <seg id="97">(Laughter) And the plant showers them with pollen, and off they go and pollinate.</seg>
        <seg id="98">And what a wonderful thing it is.</seg>
        <seg id="99">Now most pollinators that we think about are insects, but actually in the tropics, many birds and butterflies pollinate.</seg>
        <seg id="100">And many of the tropical flowers are red, and that's because butterflies and birds see similarly to us, we think, and can see the color red very well.</seg>
        <seg id="101">But if you look at the spectrum, birds and us, we see red, green and blue and see that spectrum.</seg>
        <seg id="102">Insects see green, blue and ultraviolet, and they see various shades of ultraviolet.</seg>
        <seg id="103">So there's something that goes on off the end there.</seg>
        <seg id="104">And wouldn't it be great if we could somehow see what that is, I hear you ask.</seg>
        <seg id="105">Well yes we can.</seg>
        <seg id="106">So what is an insect seeing?</seg>
        <seg id="107">Last week I took these pictures of rock rose, helianthemum, in Dorset.</seg>
        <seg id="108">These are little yellow flowers like we all see, little yellow flowers all over the place.</seg>
        <seg id="109">And this is what it looks like with visible light.</seg>
        <seg id="110">This is what it looks like if you take out the red.</seg>
        <seg id="111">Most bees don't perceive red.</seg>
        <seg id="112">And then I put some ultraviolet filters on my camera and took a very, very long exposure with the particular frequencies of ultraviolet light and this is what I got.</seg>
        <seg id="113">And that's a real fantastic bull's eye.</seg>
        <seg id="114">Now we don't know exactly what a bee sees, any more than you know what I'm seeing when I call this red.</seg>
        <seg id="115">We can't know what's going on in -- let alone an insect's -- another human being's mind.</seg>
        <seg id="116">But the contrast will look something like that, so standing out a lot from the background.</seg>
        <seg id="117">Here's another little flower -- different range of ultraviolet frequencies, different filters to match the pollinators.</seg>
        <seg id="118">And that's the sort of thing that it would be seeing.</seg>
        <seg id="119">Just in case you think that all yellow flowers have this property -- no flower was damaged in the process of this shot; it was just attached to the tripod, not killed -- then under ultraviolet light, look at that.</seg>
        <seg id="120">And that could be the basis of a sunscreen because sunscreens work by absorbing ultraviolet light.</seg>
        <seg id="121">So maybe the chemical in that would be useful.</seg>
        <seg id="122">Finally, there's one of evening primrose that Bjorn Rorslett from Norway sent me -- fantastic hidden pattern.</seg>
        <seg id="123">And I love the idea of something hidden.</seg>
        <seg id="124">I think there's something poetic here, that these pictures taken with ultraviolet filter, the main use of that filter is for astronomers to take pictures of Venus -- actually the clouds of Venus.</seg>
        <seg id="125">That's the main use of that filter.</seg>
        <seg id="126">Venus, of course, is the god of love and fertility, which is the flower story.</seg>
        <seg id="127">And just as flowers spend a lot of effort trying to get pollinators to do their bidding, they've also somehow managed to persuade us to plant great fields full of them and give them to each other at times of birth and death, and particularly at marriage, which, when you think of it, is the moment that encapsulates the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another.</seg>
        <seg id="128">Thank you very much.</seg>

        <seg id="1">Do you know how many species of flowering plants there are?</seg>
        <seg id="2">A quarter of a million - at least that we know of - a quarter of a million species of flowering plants.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Flowers are a real problem for plants:</seg>
        <seg id="4">they are difficult to create,</seg>
        <seg id="5">they require a huge amount of energy and resources.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Why do plants go to such trouble?</seg>
        <seg id="7">The answer to this, as to many other questions, is sex.</seg>
        <seg id="8">I know what you're thinking when you look at these pictures.</seg>
        <seg id="9">The reason sexual reproduction is so important is that there are many other ways for plants to reproduce.</seg>
        <seg id="10">They can be propagated by cuttings; they can self-fertilize or self-pollinate.</seg>
        <seg id="11">But it is very important for them to spread their genes to mix them with the genes of other plants - so they can adapt to natural niches.</seg>
        <seg id="12">That's how evolution works.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Plants transmit genetic information through pollen.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Some of you may have seen some of these images before.</seg>
        <seg id="15">As I like to say, every home should have a scanning electron microscope to look at these things.</seg>
        <seg id="16">There are as many different types of pollen as there are flowering plants.</seg>
        <seg id="17">By the way, this can be applied to forensics and beyond.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Basically, the pollen that causes allergies is pollen from plants that use the wind to spread it. It's a very inefficient process, which is why it gets stuck in our noses so much.</seg>
        <seg id="19">The plants have to throw out huge masses of pollen, in the hope that the sex cells, the male sex cells, which are contained in the pollen, will somehow accidentally get to another flower, absolutely by chance.</seg>
        <seg id="20">The pollen of all grasses, and therefore of all cereals, and the pollen of most trees, is carried by the wind.</seg>
        <seg id="21">However, most species use insects to do this. To some extent, this is more sensible because less pollen is needed.</seg>
        <seg id="22">Insects and other species can take pollen and carry it to where it is needed.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Clearly, we know the relationship between insects and plants.</seg>
        <seg id="24">It's a symbiotic relationship: whether it's flies, birds or bees, they all get something in return, and that something is usually nectar.</seg>
        <seg id="25">In some cases, this symbiosis has led to amazing adaptations - for example, the hummingbird hawk-moth is beautiful in its adaptation.</seg>
        <seg id="26">The plant gets its way - the hawk moth spreads its pollen elsewhere.</seg>
        <seg id="27">Plants have evolved to create little landing strips in different places for bees so they don't get lost.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Many plants have coloring that makes them look like insects.</seg>
        <seg id="29">These are lily anthers, cleverly made so that when an unsuspecting insect lands on them, the anther flips over and hits it on the back, showering it with a large amount of pollen, with which the insect then travels to another plant.</seg>
        <seg id="30">Here's an orchid that looks like it has jaws. In a way, it does, which forces the insect to crawl out, covered in pollen, which it will then spread.</seg>
        <seg id="31">There are at least 20,000 species of orchids - and they are all amazingly diverse.</seg>
        <seg id="32">They are up to all sorts of tricks.</seg>
        <seg id="33">They have to attract pollinators in order to reproduce.</seg>
        <seg id="34">This orchid, known as Darwin's orchid because he was the one who studied it and made a startling prediction when he saw it, you can see a very long nectar tube coming down from the orchid.</seg>
        <seg id="35">You can see the middle of the flower: the insect has to stick its proboscis right in the middle and reach the very bottom of this tube to get the nectar.</seg>
        <seg id="36">Darwin stated, looking at this flower, "I suppose something has co-evolved with it."</seg>
        <seg id="37">And sure enough, here comes the insect.</seg>
        <seg id="38">Normally his proboscis is curled up, but in its straightened form it looks like this.</seg>
        <seg id="39">One might think that if nectar - so valuable and expensive to produce - attracts so much attention from pollinators, then, as with sex in humans, deceptions might ensue.</seg>
        <seg id="40">A flower might say, "I have some nectar.</seg>
        <seg id="41">Will you look in?" Here is the plant.</seg>
        <seg id="42">This is a plant that insects love in South Africa. They have evolved a long proboscis to get nectar from the bottom.</seg>
        <seg id="43">And this is imitation.</seg>
        <seg id="44">This plant mimics the previous one.</seg>
        <seg id="45">And here's a long-tongued fly that didn't get a drop of nectar from the fake. Because the mimicking plant didn't give it any. It thought it would get something.</seg>
        <seg id="46">But the fly not only did not get the nectar from the fake plant, but also - if you zoom in - in the area of the lower part of the head, picked up some pollen, which it will transfer to another plant, unless some botanist appears and pins it on a blue cardboard.</seg>
        <seg id="47">(Laughter) The deception extends to the vegetable kingdom.</seg>
        <seg id="48">This flower has black dots: they look black to us, but to the male insects of a certain species, they look like two females ready for anything.</seg>
        <seg id="49">(Laughter) When the insect gets to this flower and lands on it, it dips itself into the pollen, which of course it will transfer to another plant. If you look into the same scanning electron microscope, which should be in every home, you can observe a certain three-dimensional arrangement of the pattern here.</seg>
        <seg id="50">So it probably even feels good to the insect, in addition to looking attractive.</seg>
        <seg id="51">The picture from the electron microscope - here is an orchid imitating an insect - shows that different parts of this structure have different colors and textures, but insects can perceive them completely differently.</seg>
        <seg id="52">This plant has adapted to mimic the shiny metal surface of the body of some beetles.</seg>
        <seg id="53">Under a scanning electron microscope, you can see that the surface is very different from the surfaces we were looking at.</seg>
        <seg id="54">Sometimes the whole plant mimics an insect, even from our perspective.</seg>
        <seg id="55">I think it looks like some kind of flying creature.</seg>
        <seg id="56">It's an amazing, amazing flower.</seg>
        <seg id="57">And clever. It's called obsidian.</seg>
        <seg id="58">I call him Chitrodian.</seg>
        <seg id="59">To a bee of a certain species, he resembles another very aggressive bee, and it flies up and headbutts him many times to drive the "bee" away, and of course gets covered in pollen.</seg>
        <seg id="60">This plant also mimics another orchid that has a wonderful storehouse of food for insects.</seg>
        <seg id="61">And this one has nothing for them.</seg>
        <seg id="62">So she's cheating on two levels - just unheard of.</seg>
        <seg id="63">(Laughter) This is ylang-ylang, a component of many perfumes.</seg>
        <seg id="64">I recently smelled someone who had smelled it.</seg>
        <seg id="65">The flowers don't really need to be that fragrant.</seg>
        <seg id="66">They emit a startling array of odors for any insect with a sense of smell.</seg>
        <seg id="67">That doesn't smell so good.</seg>
        <seg id="68">It's a flower that smells really, really bad, and it's evolved to look like carrion.</seg>
        <seg id="69">The flies love it.</seg>
        <seg id="70">They fly in and pollinate.</seg>
        <seg id="71">This one, helicodiceros, is also known as the dead horse lily.</seg>
        <seg id="72">I don't know what a dead horse really smells like, but this sure smells a lot like it.</seg>
        <seg id="73">It's really terrible.</seg>
        <seg id="74">And meat flies just can't resist.</seg>
        <seg id="75">They fly inside and reach the very bottom.</seg>
        <seg id="76">There they lay their eggs, thinking that this is a great piece of carrion, and not realizing that there is no food for the larvae and the larvae will die, but in the meantime the plant has benefited because the bristles relax and the fly flies off to pollinate the next flower. It's amazing.</seg>
        <seg id="77">Here is an arum, an arum maculatum, or in the United States, a spotted arum.</seg>
        <seg id="78">I photographed him the previous week in Dorset.</seg>
        <seg id="79">It heats up to about 15 degrees above the ambient temperature - amazing.</seg>
        <seg id="80">If you look at it from above, you can see what looks like a dam behind the cob. The flies are attracted by the heat - the evaporation of volatile compounds - and they get stuck at the bottom of this container.</seg>
        <seg id="81">They drink the divine nectar and become sticky.</seg>
        <seg id="82">Overnight, they get covered in pollen flowing over the top of them, and then the bristles we saw above loosen and release the pollen-covered flies. Amazing stuff.</seg>
        <seg id="83">If you think that's amazing, here's one of my favorites.</seg>
        <seg id="84">Philodendron Sello.</seg>
        <seg id="85">Those from Brazil should know about this plant.</seg>
        <seg id="86">It's the most amazing thing.</seg>
        <seg id="87">This phallic thing is about a foot long.</seg>
        <seg id="88">It does something that no other plant I know of does: when it blooms - here in the middle of the cob - for about two days, its metabolism is similar to that of a mammal.</seg>
        <seg id="89">Instead of starch, which is plant food, it takes something that looks like brown fat and burns it at this rate, digesting it in the same way as a small cat.</seg>
        <seg id="90">This energy output, in equivalent weight, is twice that of a hummingbird - quite astounding.</seg>
        <seg id="91">And it does something else, also unusual.</seg>
        <seg id="92">Not only does it heat itself up to 115 Fahrenheit, or 43-44 Celsius, within two days, but it also keeps the temperature constant.</seg>
        <seg id="93">It has a thermoregulation mechanism that maintains a constant temperature.</seg>
        <seg id="94">You ask, "Why is he doing this?"</seg>
        <seg id="95">Well, as if you didn't know that there are beetles that just love to make love at this temperature.</seg>
        <seg id="96">They get inside and that's where it starts.</seg>
        <seg id="97">(Laughter) And the plant showers them with pollen, and they go off to pollinate.</seg>
        <seg id="98">Amazingly contrived.</seg>
        <seg id="99">Most pollinators that we know of are insects, but in the tropics many birds and butterflies also pollinate.</seg>
        <seg id="100">Many tropical flowers are red, and it seems to us that this is because butterflies and birds have vision similar to ours, and that they see red very well.</seg>
        <seg id="101">But if you look at the spectrum, humans and birds see red, green and blue - they see that spectrum.</seg>
        <seg id="102">Insects see green, blue and ultraviolet, and they distinguish different shades of ultraviolet,</seg>
        <seg id="103">who are at that end of the spectrum.</seg>
        <seg id="104">You're probably thinking, "It would be great if we could see them."</seg>
        <seg id="105">Yes, we can.</seg>
        <seg id="106">So what does an insect see?</seg>
        <seg id="107">Last week, I took these pictures of sunflowers, the frankincense family, in Dorset.</seg>
        <seg id="108">These are the same little yellow flowers that we see everywhere.</seg>
        <seg id="109">This is what it looks like in daylight.</seg>
        <seg id="110">And this is what it looks like when you take away the red.</seg>
        <seg id="111">Most bees can't see red.</seg>
        <seg id="112">Then I put ultraviolet filters on the camera and took a very, very long exposure with certain frequencies of ultraviolet, and this is what I got.</seg>
        <seg id="113">There is no such thing as an "apple."</seg>
        <seg id="114">Of course, we don't know what the bees see any more than you know what I see when I call this red.</seg>
        <seg id="115">We cannot tell what is going on in the mind of a neighbor, let alone an insect.</seg>
        <seg id="116">But the picture will have about the same contrast, standing out strongly against the background.</seg>
        <seg id="117">Here's another little flower - different range of ultraviolet frequencies, different filters to match the pollinators.</seg>
        <seg id="118">They will see something like this.</seg>
        <seg id="119">Just in case you think this applies to all yellow flowers - no flowers were harmed in the process, this one was just attached to a tripod, not plucked - when they're in UV light, take a look at this one.</seg>
        <seg id="120">By the way, it could serve as the basis of a sunscreen, because such creams work by absorbing ultraviolet radiation.</seg>
        <seg id="121">Maybe this connection would be useful.</seg>
        <seg id="122">Finally, here's one of the oenothers that Bjorn Rorslett from Norway sent me - a fantastic hidden pattern.</seg>
        <seg id="123">I like the idea of something hidden.</seg>
        <seg id="124">I think there's something poetic about it. These photos were taken with an ultraviolet filter, which is mostly used by astronomers to photograph Venus - actually the clouds of Venus.</seg>
        <seg id="125">This is the main purpose of this filter.</seg>
        <seg id="126">Venus, of course, is the goddess of love and fertility, which is consonant with flowers.</seg>
        <seg id="127">Flowers not only spend a lot of effort to attract pollinators, they also somehow managed to convince us to plant whole fields of flowers and give them to each other at the moments of birth and death, and, in particular, at the wedding, which, if you think about it, is a moment that represents the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another.</seg>
        <seg id="128">Thank you very much.</seg>

      <p>
        <seg id="1">Do you know how many species of flowering plants exist?</seg>
        <seg id="2">A quarter of a million — at least those we know — a quarter of a million species of flowering plants.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Flowers are a real problem for plants:</seg>
        <seg id="4">they are hard to create,</seg>
        <seg id="5">they require a huge amount of energy and resources.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Why do plants go for such complexities?</seg>
        <seg id="7">The answer to this, like many other questions, is sex.</seg>
        <seg id="8">I know what you're thinking when you look at these pictures.</seg>
        <seg id="9">The reason sexual reproduction is so important is there are many other ways plants reproduce.</seg>
        <seg id="10">They can be propagated with cuttings; they can fertilize themselves or pollinate themselves.</seg>
        <seg id="11">But it's very important for them to spread their genes to blend them with the genes of other plants - that's how they will be able to adjust to natural niches.</seg>
        <seg id="12">That's how evolution works.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Plants transmit genetic information through pollen.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Some of you may have seen some of these images earlier.</seg>
        <seg id="15">As I like to say, every house has to have a bitmap electron microscope to look at these things.</seg>
        <seg id="16">There are as many different types of pollen as flowering plants.</seg>
        <seg id="17">By the way, this can be used in forensics and not only.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Basically, pollen that causes allergies is pollen from plants that use wind to spread it. It's a very inefficient process, that's why it's crammed so hard into our noses.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Plants have to throw out huge masses of pollen, in the hope that sex cells, male sex cells that are contained in pollen, will somehow accidentally reach another flower, absolutely by accident.</seg>
        <seg id="20">The pollen of all grasses, and therefore all cereals, and pollen of most trees, is carried by the wind.</seg>
        <seg id="21">However, most of the species use insects for this. To some extent, it's more reasonable because less pollen is required.</seg>
        <seg id="22">Insects and other species can take pollen and carry it where they need it.</seg>
        <seg id="23">It is clear that we know the relationship between insects and plants.</seg>
        <seg id="24">It's a symbiotic relationship: whether it's flies, birds or bees - they all get something in return, and that something is usually nectar.</seg>
        <seg id="25">In some cases, this symbiosis has led to amazing adaptations — so, the hummingbird hawk-moth is beautiful in its adaptation.</seg>
        <seg id="26">The plant gets its own - the hawkish moth spreads pollen elsewhere.</seg>
        <seg id="27">Plants have evolved so that they created little landing strips in different places for bees so that those don't get lost.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Many plants have coloration making them look like insects.</seg>
        <seg id="29">These are lily anthers, cleverly made so that when an unsuspecting insect sits on them, the anther flips and strikes it on the back, showering with plenty of pollen with which the insect then goes to another plant.</seg>
        <seg id="30">And here's an orchid that looks like it has jaws. In a way, she has them, which makes the insect crawle, covered in pollen, which it will then spread.</seg>
        <seg id="31">There are at least 20,000 species of orchids — and all of them are remarkably diverse.</seg>
        <seg id="32">They go for a variety of tricks.</seg>
        <seg id="33">They are forced to attract pollinators to breed.</seg>
        <seg id="34">This orchid, known as Darwin's orchid, because he was the one who studied it and made a startling prediction when he saw it. You can see a very long nectar tube that comes out of the orchid.</seg>
        <seg id="35">You see the middle of the flower: the insect must stick the hobot right into the middle and get to the bottom of this tube to get the nectar.</seg>
        <seg id="36">Darwin claimed, looking at this flower, “I assume something evolved in conjunction with it.”</seg>
        <seg id="37">And indeed, here comes the insect.</seg>
        <seg id="38">Usually his hobo is in a curled state, but in its straightened form, it looks like this.</seg>
        <seg id="39">One might think that if nectar — so valuable and expensive to produce — attracts so much attention from pollinators, then, as with sex in humans, cheating can begin.</seg>
        <seg id="40">Flower might say, “I have a bit of nectar.</seg>
        <seg id="41">Will you look in?” Here's a plant.</seg>
        <seg id="42">This is a plant that insects adore in South Africa. In the process of evolution, they acquired a long hobo to get nectar from the bottom.</seg>
        <seg id="43">And this is imitation.</seg>
        <seg id="44">This plant emulates the previous one.</seg>
        <seg id="45">And here's the long-nosed fly, which didn't get a drop of nectar from the fake. Because the copycat plant didn't give her the bottom. She thought she was going to get something.</seg>
        <seg id="46">But not only did the fly not receive nectar from the fake plant, but also — if approximated — near the bottom of the head, snagged a bit of pollen, which it would transfer to another plant, unless There will be some nerd and not riveting it on a pigeon cardboard.</seg>
        <seg id="47">(Laughter) Deception spreads in the plant realm as well.</seg>
        <seg id="48">This flower has black dots: they seem black to us, but for male insects of a particular species, they look like two females ready for anything.</seg>
        <seg id="49">(Laughter) When an insect reaches this flower and lands on it, it dips itself in pollen, which of course it will transfer to another plant. If you look at the raster electron microscope that each house needs to be, you can observe a specific three-dimensional pattern layout here.</seg>
        <seg id="50">So it probably even brings nice sensations to the insect, other than what looks attractive.</seg>
        <seg id="51">The electron microscope image — an orchid imitating the insect — shows that different parts of this structure have different colors and textures, but insects can perceive them completely different.</seg>
        <seg id="52">This plant has adapted to emulate the shiny metallic surface of some beetles.</seg>
        <seg id="53">Under the raster electron microscope, it can be seen that the surface is very different from the surfaces we looked at.</seg>
        <seg id="54">Sometimes the whole plant mimics an insect entirely, even from our perspective.</seg>
        <seg id="55">I think it looks like some flying critter.</seg>
        <seg id="56">It's a striking, amazing flower.</seg>
        <seg id="57">And smart. It's called obsidian.</seg>
        <seg id="58">I call him hoodwdian.</seg>
        <seg id="59">For a bee of a certain species, it resembles another very aggressive bee, and it flies up and hits it's head many times to ward off the “bee”, and is of course covered in pollen.</seg>
        <seg id="60">This plant also imitates another orchid, which has a marvellous warehouse of food for insects.</seg>
        <seg id="61">And this one has nothing for them.</seg>
        <seg id="62">So she cheats on two levels — just unheard of.</seg>
        <seg id="63">(Laughter) Here's ylang ylang, a component of many perfumes.</seg>
        <seg id="64">I recently hunched someone who pouted them.</seg>
        <seg id="65">Flowers don't need to be so fragrant in principle.</seg>
        <seg id="66">They emit a striking range of smells for any insects with a sense of smell.</seg>
        <seg id="67">And this doesn't smell so good.</seg>
        <seg id="68">It's a flower that smells very, very dour, and has evolved to look like a fall.</seg>
        <seg id="69">Flies like it a lot.</seg>
        <seg id="70">They fly in and pollinate.</seg>
        <seg id="71">Here's this one, helicodyceros, also known by the name “dead horse lily.”</seg>
        <seg id="72">I don't know what a dead horse really smells like, but this one definitely smells very similar.</seg>
        <seg id="73">It's really awful.</seg>
        <seg id="74">And meat flies just can't resist.</seg>
        <seg id="75">They fly in and reach the bottom.</seg>
        <seg id="76">There they lay their eggs thinking it's a great piece of falling, and not realizing that there is no food for the larvae and the larvae will die, however, the plant has benefited because the bristles relax , and the fly flies away to pollinate the next flower. It's awesome.</seg>
        <seg id="77">Here is arum, arum maculatum, or in the US — aronnius spotted.</seg>
        <seg id="78">I took a picture of it the previous week in Dorset.</seg>
        <seg id="79">It warms up to about 15 degrees above ambient temperature — astounding.</seg>
        <seg id="80">If you look at it from above, there is something that looks like a dam behind the coB. Flies attract heat — evaporation of volatile compounds — and they get stuck at the bottom in that container.</seg>
        <seg id="81">They drink divine nectar and become sticky.</seg>
        <seg id="82">Overnight they are covered in pollen streaming them on top, and then the bristles we saw above loosen up and release the pollen-covered flies. Awesome thing.</seg>
        <seg id="83">If you think this is astounding, here's one of my favourites.</seg>
        <seg id="84">Philodendron Sello.</seg>
        <seg id="85">Those from Brazil should be aware of this plant.</seg>
        <seg id="86">That's the most striking thing.</seg>
        <seg id="87">Here's this phallic thing about 30 centimeters long.</seg>
        <seg id="88">It does something that no other plant known to me does: when it blooms — in the middle of the cob — for about two days, its metabolism is similar to mammalian metabolism .</seg>
        <seg id="89">Instead of starch, which is food for plants, it takes something similar to brown fat and burns it at such a rate, digest just like a small cat.</seg>
        <seg id="90">This recoil of energy, at equivalent weight, is twice as high as that of a hummingbird — utterly astounding.</seg>
        <seg id="91">And it's also doing something else that's unusual too.</seg>
        <seg id="92">Not only does it warm itself up to 115 Fahrenheit, or 43-44 Celsius, for two days, but it also keeps the temperature constant.</seg>
        <seg id="93">It has a thermoregulation mechanism that maintains a constant temperature.</seg>
        <seg id="94">You ask, “Why is he doing this?”</seg>
        <seg id="95">Well it's like you didn't know there were bugs that just adore making love at that temperature.</seg>
        <seg id="96">They get inside, and that's where it starts.</seg>
        <seg id="97">(Laughter) And the plant showers them with pollen, and they go to pollinate.</seg>
        <seg id="98">Amazingly made up.</seg>
        <seg id="99">Most of the pollinators we know are insects, but in the tropics also many birds and butterflies pollinate.</seg>
        <seg id="100">A lot of tropical flowers are red, and we feel like this is because butterflies and birds have their vision similar to ours, and that they see red very well.</seg>
        <seg id="101">But if you look at the spectrum, man and bird see red, green and blue - they see that spectrum.</seg>
        <seg id="102">Insects see green, blue and ultraviolet, and they distinguish between different hues of ultraviolet,</seg>
        <seg id="103">who are at that end of the spectrum.</seg>
        <seg id="104">Surely you think, “It would be great if we could see them.”</seg>
        <seg id="105">Yes, we can.</seg>
        <seg id="106">So what does the insect see?</seg>
        <seg id="107">Last week, I took these pictures of the colnce-blossom, a family of lapel, in Dorset.</seg>
        <seg id="108">These are the smallest yellow flowers that we see everywhere.</seg>
        <seg id="109">That's how it looks in daylight.</seg>
        <seg id="110">And that's what it looks like if you put the red away.</seg>
        <seg id="111">Most bees don't see red.</seg>
        <seg id="112">Then I put on the camera ultraviolet filters and did a very, very long excerpt with certain frequencies of ultraviolet, and that's what turned out.</seg>
        <seg id="113">The most thing about eating “bullseye”.</seg>
        <seg id="114">Of course, we know exactly what bees see, no more than you know what I see when I call it red.</seg>
        <seg id="115">We can't tell what's going on in our neighbor's mind, we don't talk about an insect already.</seg>
        <seg id="116">But the picture will be about as contrasting, standing out strongly in the background.</seg>
        <seg id="117">Here's another small flower — a different range of ultraviolet frequencies, other filters, to match pollinators.</seg>
        <seg id="118">They're going to see about this.</seg>
        <seg id="119">In case you think this applies to all yellows — no flower in the filming process was harmed, this one was just attached to a tripod rather than ripped off - when they're in ultraviolet light , then take a look at this one.</seg>
        <seg id="120">By the way, it could have served as the basis of sunscreen because such creams work by absorbing ultraviolet.</seg>
        <seg id="121">Maybe this connection would be useful.</seg>
        <seg id="122">Finally, here's one of the enoters that Bjorn Rohrslett of Norway sent me — a fantastic hidden pattern.</seg>

        <seg id="20">The pollen of all grasses, and therefore of all cereals, and the pollen of most trees, is carried by the wind.</seg>
        <seg id="21">However, most species use insects for this purpose. To some extent, this is more reasonable because it requires less pollen.</seg>
        <seg id="22">Insects and other species can take pollen and transfer it to where it is needed.</seg>
        <seg id="23">It is clear that we know the relationship between insects and plants.</seg>
        <seg id="24">It's a symbiotic relationship: whether it's flies, birds, or bees, they all get something in return, and that something is usually nectar.</seg>
        <seg id="25">In some cases, this symbiosis has led to amazing adaptations — for example, the hummingbird hawk moth is beautiful in its adaptation.</seg>
        <seg id="26">The plant gets its own way - the hawk moth spreads its pollen elsewhere.</seg>
        <seg id="27">The plants have evolved to create small landing strips in different places for the bees so that they don't get lost.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Many plants have a color that makes them look like insects.</seg>
        <seg id="29">These are the anthers of the lily, cleverly made so that when an unsuspecting insect lands on them, the anther turns over and hits it on the back, showering it with a large amount of pollen, with which the insect then goes to another plant.</seg>
        <seg id="30">And here's an orchid that looks like it has jaws. In a sense, it has them, which forces the insect to crawl out, covered with pollen, which it will then spread.</seg>
        <seg id="31">There are at least 20 thousand species of orchids-and all of them are surprisingly diverse.</seg>
        <seg id="32">They go to all sorts of tricks.</seg>
        <seg id="33">They are forced to attract pollinators to reproduce.</seg>
        <seg id="34">This orchid, known as Darwin's orchid because he was the one who studied it and made a startling prediction when he saw it. You can see a very long tube with nectar, which falls from the orchid.</seg>
        <seg id="35">You see the middle of the flower: the insect has to stick its proboscis right in the middle and get to the very bottom of this tube to get the nectar.</seg>
        <seg id="36">Darwin stated, looking at this flower: "I assume something evolved together with it."</seg>
        <seg id="37">And indeed, here is the insect.</seg>
        <seg id="38">Usually its proboscis is rolled up, but in its straightened form it looks like this.</seg>
        <seg id="39">One might think that if the nectar - so valuable and expensive to produce-attracts so much attention from pollinators, then, as with sex in humans, deceptions can begin.</seg>
        <seg id="40">The flower may say, " I have some nectar.</seg>
        <seg id="41">Will you come by?"» Here's a plant.</seg>
        <seg id="42">This is a plant that insects love in South Africa. In the process of evolution, they acquired a long proboscis to get nectar from the bottom.</seg>
        <seg id="43">And this is imitation.</seg>
        <seg id="44">This plant imitates the previous one.</seg>
        <seg id="45">And here is a long-lobed fly, which did not get a drop of nectar from the fake. Because the imitating plant didn't give her anything. She thought she was going to get something.</seg>
        <seg id="46">But not only did the fly not get any nectar from the fake plant, but-if you zoom in-near the bottom of the head, it picked up some pollen, which it will transfer to another plant, unless some botanist comes along and pins it on a blue cardboard box.</seg>
        <seg id="47">(Laughter) Deception is also spreading in the plant kingdom.</seg>
        <seg id="48">This flower has black dots: they look black to us, but for male insects of a certain species, they look like two females ready for anything.</seg>
        <seg id="49">(Laughter) When an insect gets to this flower and lands on it, it dips itself in pollen, which, of course, it will transfer to another plant. If you look through the same scanning electron microscope that should be in every house, you can observe a certain three-dimensional arrangement of the pattern here.</seg>
        <seg id="50">So it probably even brings a pleasant feeling to the insect, in addition to the fact that it looks attractive.</seg>
        <seg id="51">In the picture from the electron microscope-here is an orchid imitating an insect-you can see that different parts of this structure have different colors and textures, but insects can perceive them in a completely different way.</seg>
        <seg id="52">This plant has adapted to imitate the shiny metal surface of the body of some beetles.</seg>
        <seg id="53">Under a scanning electron microscope, you can see that the surface is very different from the surfaces we looked at.</seg>
        <seg id="54">Sometimes the whole plant imitates an insect, even from our point of view.</seg>
        <seg id="55">I think it looks like some kind of flying thing.</seg>
        <seg id="56">This is an amazing, amazing flower.</seg>
        <seg id="57">And smart. It's called obsidian.</seg>
        <seg id="58">I call it the Hythrodian.</seg>
        <seg id="59">For a bee of a certain species, it resembles another very aggressive bee, and it flies up and hits its head many times to drive the "bee" away, and of course gets covered in pollen.</seg>
        <seg id="60">This plant also mimics another orchid, which has a wonderful storehouse of food for insects.</seg>
        <seg id="61">And this one has nothing for them.</seg>
        <seg id="62">So it's cheating on two levels — just unheard of.</seg>
        <seg id="63">(Laughter) Here is ylang-ylang, a component of many perfumes.</seg>
        <seg id="64">I recently smelled someone wearing it.</seg>
        <seg id="65">Flowers in principle do not need to be so fragrant.</seg>
        <seg id="66">They emit a striking range of odors for any insects with a sense of smell.</seg>
        <seg id="67">This one doesn't smell so good.</seg>
        <seg id="68">It's a flower that smells really, really bad, and it's evolved to look like carrion.</seg>
        <seg id="69">This is very popular with flies.</seg>
        <seg id="70">They fly in and pollinate.</seg>
        <seg id="71">This one, the helicodiceros, also known as the"dead horse lily."</seg>
        <seg id="72">I don't know what a dead horse really smells like, but this one definitely smells a lot like it.</seg>
        <seg id="73">It's really awful.</seg>
        <seg id="74">And the meat flies just can't resist.</seg>
        <seg id="75">They fly in and fly all the way to the bottom.</seg>
        <seg id="76">There they lay their eggs, thinking that this is a great piece of carrion, and not realizing that there is no food for the larvae and the larvae will die, but in the meantime the plant has benefited, because the bristles relax, and the fly flies away to pollinate the next flower. It's amazing.</seg>
        <seg id="77">Here is arum, arum maculatum, or in the USA-arum mottled.</seg>
        <seg id="78">I photographed it the previous week in Dorset.</seg>
        <seg id="79">It warms up to about 15 degrees above ambient temperature-amazing.</seg>
        <seg id="80">If you look at it from above, you can see something like a dam behind the cob. The flies are attracted to the heat-the evaporation of volatile compounds - and they get stuck down in this container.</seg>
        <seg id="81">They drink the divine nectar and become sticky.</seg>
        <seg id="82">During the night, they are covered with pollen, flowing around them from above, and then the bristles, which we saw above, weaken and release the flies covered with pollen. An amazing thing.</seg>
        <seg id="83">If you think it's amazing, here's one of my favorites.</seg>
        <seg id="84">Philodendron Sello.</seg>
        <seg id="85">Those from Brazil should know about this plant.</seg>
        <seg id="86">This is the most amazing thing.</seg>
        <seg id="87">This phallic thing is about 30 centimeters long.</seg>
        <seg id="88">It does something that no other plant I know of does: when it blooms - there's an ear in the middle — for about two days, its metabolism is similar to that of a mammal.</seg>
        <seg id="89">Instead of starch, which is food for plants, it takes something similar to brown fat and burns it at such a speed, digesting it just like a small cat.</seg>
        <seg id="90">This energy output, in equivalent weight, is twice as high as that of a hummingbird — absolutely astounding.</seg>
        <seg id="91">And it also does something else, also unusual.</seg>
        <seg id="92">Not only does it heat itself up to 115 degrees Fahrenheit, or 43-44 degrees Celsius, for two days, but it also keeps the temperature constant.</seg>
        <seg id="93">It has a thermoregulation mechanism that maintains a constant temperature.</seg>
        <seg id="94">You may ask: "Why is he doing this?»</seg>
        <seg id="95">Well, as if you didn't know that there are bugs that just love to make love at this temperature.</seg>
        <seg id="96">They get inside, and that's where it starts.</seg>
        <seg id="97">(Laughter) And the plant showers them with pollen, and they go to pollinate.</seg>
        <seg id="98">Surprisingly well thought out.</seg>
        <seg id="99">Most of the pollinators we know are insects, but in the tropics, many birds and butterflies also pollinate.</seg>
        <seg id="100">Many tropical flowers are red, and it seems to us that all this is because butterflies and birds have vision similar to ours, and that they see red very well.</seg>
        <seg id="101">But if you look at the spectrum, the person and the bird see red, green and blue-they see this spectrum.</seg>
        <seg id="102">Insects also see green, blue and ultraviolet light, and they distinguish different shades of ultraviolet light,</seg>
        <seg id="103">which are at this end of the spectrum.</seg>
        <seg id="104">You probably think, " It would be great if we could see them."</seg>
        <seg id="105">Yes, we can.</seg>
        <seg id="106">So what does the insect see?</seg>
        <seg id="107">Last week, I took these photos of the sunflowers, the incense family, in Dorset.</seg>
        <seg id="108">These are the small yellow flowers that we see everywhere.</seg>
        <seg id="109">This is what it looks like in daylight.</seg>
        <seg id="110">And this is what it looks like if you remove the red one.</seg>
        <seg id="111">Most bees don't see red.</seg>
        <seg id="112">Then I put UV filters on the camera and took a very, very long exposure with certain UV frequencies, and this is what happened.</seg>
        <seg id="113">The most that neither is "bullseye".</seg>
        <seg id="114">Of course, we know exactly what the bees see, no more than you know what I see when I call this red.</seg>
        <seg id="115">We can't tell what's going on in a neighbor's mind, let alone an insect.</seg>
        <seg id="116">But the picture will be about the same contrast, strongly standing out in the background.</seg>
        <seg id="117">Here is another small flower — a different range of ultraviolet frequencies, different filters, to match the pollinators.</seg>
        <seg id="118">They'll see something like this.</seg>
        <seg id="119">In case you think this applies to all yellow flowers — no flowers were damaged during the shooting process, this one was just attached to a tripod, not torn off - when they are in ultraviolet light, then take a look at this one.</seg>
        <seg id="120">By the way, it could serve as the basis of a sunscreen, because such creams work by absorbing ultraviolet light.</seg>
        <seg id="121">Maybe this connection would be useful.</seg>
        <seg id="122">Finally, here is one of the oenothers that Bjorn Rorslett from Norway sent me — a fantastic hidden pattern.</seg>
        <seg id="123">I like the idea of something hidden.</seg>
        <seg id="124">I think there's something poetic about it. These photos were taken with an ultraviolet filter, which is mainly used by astronomers to photograph Venus — in fact, the clouds of Venus.</seg>
        <seg id="125">This is the main purpose of this filter.</seg>
        <seg id="126">Venus, of course, is the goddess of love and fertility, and this is in tune with flowers.</seg>
        <seg id="127">Not only do flowers spend a lot of effort attracting pollinators, they also somehow managed to convince us to plant whole fields of flowers and give them to each other at the moments of birth and death, and in particular at a wedding, which, if you think about it, is a moment that represents the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another.</seg>
        <seg id="128">Thank you very much.</seg>

        <seg id="1">Do you know how many species of flowering plants exist?</seg>
        <seg id="2">A quarter of a million - at least those we know - a quarter of a million species of flowering plants.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Flowers are a real problem for plants:</seg>
        <seg id="4">it's hard to create them -</seg>
        <seg id="5">they require huge amounts of energy and resources.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Why do plants go to such difficulties?</seg>
        <seg id="7">The answer to this, as to many other questions, is sex.</seg>
        <seg id="8">I know what you're thinking when you look at these pictures.</seg>
        <seg id="9">The reason why sexual reproduction is so important is that there are many other ways to reproduce plants.</seg>
        <seg id="10">They can be propagated by cuttings; they can fertilize themselves or pollinate themselves.</seg>
        <seg id="11">But it is very important for them to spread their genes in order to mix them with the genes of other plants - so they can adjust to natural niches.</seg>
        <seg id="12">This is how evolution works.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Plants transmit genetic information through pollen.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Some of you may have seen some of these images before.</seg>
        <seg id="15">As I like to say, every home should have a raster electron microscope to look at these things.</seg>
        <seg id="16">There are as many different types of pollen as flowering plants.</seg>
        <seg id="17">By the way, this can be applied in forensics and not only.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Basically, the pollen that causes allergies is the pollen of plants that use the wind to spread it. It's a very inefficient process, that's why it gets so hard into our noses.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Plants have to throw away huge masses of pollen, in the hope that the sex cells, the male sex cells that are contained in the pollen, somehow accidentally reach another flower, absolutely by accident.</seg>

        <seg id="21">However, most species use insects for this. To some extent, this is more reasonable because less pollen is required.</seg>
        <seg id="22">Insects and other species can take pollen and carry it where it is needed.</seg>
        <seg id="23">It is clear that we know the relationship between insects and plants.</seg>
        <seg id="24">It's a symbiotic relationship: whether it's flies, birds or bees - they all get something in return, and it's something that's usually nectar.</seg>
        <seg id="25">In some cases, this symbiosis has led to amazing adaptations - for example, the hummingbird hawk-moth is beautiful in its adaptation.</seg>
        <seg id="26">The plant gets its way - the hawk moth spreads pollen elsewhere.</seg>
        <seg id="27">Plants have evolved in such a way that they have created small landing strips in different places for bees, so that they are not lost.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Many plants have colours that make them look like insects.</seg>
        <seg id="29">These are lily pollen, cleverly made so that when an unsuspecting insect sits on them, the pollen flips over and hits it on the back, showered with a large amount of pollen, with which the insect then goes to another plant.</seg>
        <seg id="30">But an orchid that looks like it has jaws. In a sense, it has them, which forces the insect to crawl out, covered in pollen, which it will then spread.</seg>
        <seg id="31">There are at least 20,000 species of orchids - and they are all surprisingly diverse.</seg>
        <seg id="32">They go for a variety of tricks.</seg>
        <seg id="33">They are forced to attract pollinators to breed.</seg>
        <seg id="34">This orchid, known as the Darwin orchid, because it was he who studied it and made a startling prediction when he saw it. A very long tube of nectar can be seen descending from the orchid.</seg>
        <seg id="35">You see the middle of the flower: the insect must shove the proboscis directly into the middle and reach the very bottom of this tube to get nectar.</seg>
        <seg id="36">Darwin argued, looking at the flower: "I guess something has evolved with it."</seg>
        <seg id="37">And indeed, here is the insect.</seg>
        <seg id="38">Usually his proboscis is folded, but in its straightened shape it looks like this.</seg>
        <seg id="39">One might think that if nectar - so valuable and expensive in production - attracts so much attention from pollinators, then, as with sex in humans, deceptions can begin.</seg>
        <seg id="40">A flower might say, "I have a little nectar.</seg>
        <seg id="41">Will you take a look? "Here is a plant.</seg>
        <seg id="42">This is a plant that insects love in South Africa. In the process of evolution, they acquired a long proboscis to get nectar from the bottom.</seg>
        <seg id="43">And this is imitation.</seg>
        <seg id="44">This plant imitates the previous one.</seg>
        <seg id="45">And here's the long-proboscis fly, which didn't get a drop of nectar from the fake. Because the imitation plant didn't give her anything. She thought she'd get something.</seg>
        <seg id="46">But not only did the fly not receive nectar from the fake plant, but also - if you look closer - in the area of the lower part of the head, it grabbed a little pollen, which it will transfer to another plant, unless some botanist appears and pinches it on a blue cardboard.</seg>
        <seg id="47">(Laughter) The deception is spreading in the plant kingdom as well.</seg>
        <seg id="48">This flower has black dots: they seem black to us, but for male insects of a certain species, they look like two females ready for anything.</seg>

        <seg id="56">It's an amazing, amazing flower.</seg>
        <seg id="57">And smart. It's called obsidian.</seg>

        <seg id="66">They emit a striking range of smells for any insects with a sense of smell.</seg>

        <seg id="71">Here is this one, helicodiceros, also known as the "lily of a dead horse."</seg>
        <seg id="72">I don't know how a dead horse really smells, but this one definitely smells very similar.</seg>
        <seg id="73">It's really horrible.</seg>

        <seg id="103">which are at this end of the spectrum.</seg>
        <seg id="104">Surely you think, "It would be great if we could see them."</seg>
        <seg id="105">Yes, we can.</seg>
        <seg id="106">So what does the insect see?</seg>
        <seg id="107">Last week I took these pictures of the colourful sun flower family in Dorset.</seg>
        <seg id="108">These are the smallest yellow flowers we see everywhere.</seg>
        <seg id="109">This is what it looks like in daylight.</seg>
        <seg id="110">But this is what it looks like if you remove the red.</seg>
        <seg id="111">Most bees don't see red.</seg>
        <seg id="112">Then I put ultraviolet filters on the camera and did a very, very long exposure with certain ultraviolet frequencies, and that's what happened.</seg>
        <seg id="113">The most important thing is that there is no "apple."</seg>
        <seg id="114">Of course, we know exactly what bees see, no more than you know what I see when I call it red.</seg>
        <seg id="115">We can't say what's going on in the mind of a neighbor, they're not talking about an insect anymore.</seg>
        <seg id="116">But the picture will be about the same contrast, standing out strongly in the background.</seg>
        <seg id="117">Here is another small flower - a different range of ultraviolet frequencies, other filters, to match pollinators.</seg>
        <seg id="118">They will see something like this.</seg>
        <seg id="119">In case you think this applies to all yellow flowers - no flower was hurt during the shooting, this one was just attached to a tripod and not ripped off - when they are in ultraviolet light then take a look at this one.</seg>
        <seg id="120">By the way, it could serve as the basis of sunscreen, because such creams work by absorbing ultraviolet light.</seg>
        <seg id="121">Maybe this connection would be useful.</seg>
        <seg id="122">Finally, here is one of the enoters that Bjorn Rorslett from Norway sent me - a fantastic hidden pattern.</seg>
        <seg id="123">I like the idea of something hidden.</seg>
        <seg id="124">I think there's something poetic about it. These photos were taken with an ultraviolet filter, which is mainly used by astronomers to capture Venus - actually the clouds of Venus.</seg>
        <seg id="125">This is the main purpose of this filter.</seg>
        <seg id="126">Venus, of course, is the goddess of love and fertility, and this is in tune with flowers.</seg>
        <seg id="127">Flowers not only spend a lot of effort to attract pollinators, they also somehow managed to convince us to plant whole fields of flowers and give them to each other at the moments of birth and death, and in particular at a wedding, which, if you think about it, is a moment that represents the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another.</seg>
        <seg id="128">Thank you very much.</seg>

      <p>
        <seg id="1">Do you know how many species of flowering plants there are?</seg>
        <seg id="2">A quarter of a million - at least the ones we know of - a quarter of a million species of flowering plants.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Flowers are a real problem for plants:</seg>
        <seg id="4">they're hard to make,</seg>
        <seg id="5">they require enormous amounts of energy and resources.</seg>
        <seg id="6">So why do plants go to such trouble?</seg>
        <seg id="7">The answer to this, and many other questions, is sex.</seg>
        <seg id="8">I know what you're thinking when you look at these pictures.</seg>
        <seg id="9">The reason why sexual reproduction is so important is because there are many other ways to propagate plants.</seg>
        <seg id="10">They can be propagated by cuttings; they can fertilize themselves or pollinate themselves.</seg>
        <seg id="11">But it's very important for them to spread their genes to mix with the genes of other plants-so they can adapt to natural niches.</seg>
        <seg id="12">That's how evolution works.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Plants pass on genetic information through pollen.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Some of you may have seen some of these images before.</seg>
        <seg id="15">As I like to say, every home should have a scanning electron microscope to look at these things.</seg>
        <seg id="16">There are as many different types of pollen as there are flowering plants.</seg>
        <seg id="17">By the way, this can be applied to forensics and beyond.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Basically, the pollen that causes allergies is pollen from plants that use the wind to spread it. It's a very inefficient process, which is why it gets up our noses so much.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Plants have to throw out huge masses of pollen in the hope that the sex cells, the male sex cells that are in the pollen, will somehow accidentally get to another flower, completely by accident.</seg>
        <seg id="20">The pollen of all grasses, and thus of all crops, and the pollen of most trees, is carried by the wind.</seg>
        <seg id="21">Most species, however, use insects to do this. In some ways, this makes more sense because less pollen is needed.</seg>
        <seg id="22">Insects and other species can take the pollen and carry it to where it is needed.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Clearly, we know the relationship between insects and plants.</seg>
        <seg id="24">It is a symbiotic relationship: whether flies, birds or bees, they all receive something in return, and that something is usually nectar.</seg>
        <seg id="25">In some cases, this symbiosis has led to amazing adaptations - so the hummingbird hawk moth is beautiful in its adaptation.</seg>
        <seg id="26">The plant gets its own - the hawk moth spreads pollen elsewhere.</seg>
        <seg id="27">Plants have evolved to create little planting strips in different places for bees so they don't get lost.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Many plants have colors that make them look like insects.</seg>
        <seg id="29">These are lily anthers, cleverly made so that when an unsuspecting insect lands on them, the anther flips over and strikes it on the back, showering it with more pollen, with which the insect then travels to another plant.</seg>
        <seg id="30">And here's an orchid that looks like it has jaws. In a sense, it has them, which forces the insect to crawl out, covered in pollen, which it will then spread.</seg>
        <seg id="31">There are at least 20,000 species of orchids - and they are all amazingly diverse.</seg>
        <seg id="32">They go to all sorts of tricks.</seg>
        <seg id="33">They have to attract pollinators in order to reproduce.</seg>
        <seg id="34">This orchid, known as Darwin's orchid because he was the one who studied it and made a startling prediction when he saw it. You can see a very long tube of nectar that descends from the orchid.</seg>
        <seg id="35">You see the middle of the flower: the insect has to stick its proboscis right in the middle and get to the bottom of that tube to get the nectar.</seg>
        <seg id="36">Darwin asserted, looking at this flower, "I suppose something has evolved with it.</seg>
        <seg id="37">And indeed, here is the insect.</seg>
        <seg id="38">Usually its proboscis is in a coiled state, but in its straightened form it looks like this.</seg>
        <seg id="39">One would think that if nectar--so valuable and expensive to produce--captures so much attention from pollinators, then, as with sex in humans, deception can begin.</seg>
        <seg id="40">A flower might say, "I have some nectar.</seg>
        <seg id="41">Will you stop by?" Here's a plant.</seg>
        <seg id="42">This is the plant that insects in South Africa adore. In the process of evolution, they acquired a long proboscis to get nectar from the bottom.</seg>
        <seg id="43">And this one is a mimic.</seg>
        <seg id="44">This plant imitates the previous one.</seg>
        <seg id="45">And there's the long proboscis fly, which didn't get a drop of nectar from the imitation fly. Because the imitation plant didn't give her any. She thought she was going to get something.</seg>
        <seg id="46">But not only did the fly not get any nectar from the imitation plant, but - if you zoom in - near the bottom of its head, it grabbed some pollen, which it will transfer to another plant, unless some botanist shows up and pins it on a blue cardboard.</seg>
        <seg id="47">(Laughter) Deception spreads in the plant kingdom as well.</seg>
        <seg id="48">This flower has black dots: they appear black to us, but to male insects of a certain species, they look like two females ready for anything.</seg>
        <seg id="49">(Laughter) When the insect gets to this flower and lands on it, it dips itself in pollen, which, of course, it will transfer to another plant. If you look through that same scanning electron microscope that every home should have, you can see a definite three-dimensional pattern arrangement here.</seg>
        <seg id="50">So it probably even makes the insect feel good, besides looking attractive.</seg>
        <seg id="51">In the picture from the electron microscope - here is an orchid mimicking an insect - you can see that different parts of this structure have different colors and textures, but insects can perceive them quite differently.</seg>
        <seg id="52">This plant here has adapted to mimic the shiny metallic body surface of some beetles.</seg>
        <seg id="53">Under a scanning electron microscope, we can see that the surface is very different from the surfaces we were looking at.</seg>
        <seg id="54">Sometimes the entire plant entirely mimics the insect, even from our perspective.</seg>
        <seg id="55">I think it looks like some kind of flying creature.</seg>
        <seg id="56">It's a striking, amazing flower.</seg>
        <seg id="57">And it's smart. It's called obsidian.</seg>
        <seg id="58">I call it the cunningian.</seg>
        <seg id="59">To a certain kind of bee, it resembles another very aggressive bee, and it flies up and bangs its head many times to drive the "bee" away, and of course it gets covered in pollen.</seg>
        <seg id="60">This plant also imitates another orchid, which has a wonderful storehouse of food for insects.</seg>
        <seg id="61">This one has nothing for them.</seg>
        <seg id="62">So it cheats on two levels - just unheard of.</seg>
        <seg id="63">(Laughter) Here's ylang ylang, an ingredient in many perfumes.</seg>
        <seg id="64">I smelled someone wearing it recently.</seg>
        <seg id="65">Flowers basically don't need to be that fragrant.</seg>
        <seg id="66">They emit an astounding range of scents for any insects with a sense of smell.</seg>
        <seg id="67">And this one smells not so good.</seg>
        <seg id="68">It's a flower that smells really, really bad, and it's evolved to look like a scavenger.</seg>
        <seg id="69">The flies like it a lot.</seg>
        <seg id="70">They fly in and pollinate it.</seg>
        <seg id="71">This one here, helicodiceros, also known as the dead horse lily.</seg>
        <seg id="72">I don't know what a dead horse really smells like, but this one definitely smells a lot like it.</seg>
        <seg id="73">It's really horrible.</seg>
        <seg id="74">And the meat flies just can't resist.</seg>
        <seg id="75">They fly in and they go all the way to the bottom.</seg>
        <seg id="76">There they lay their eggs, thinking it's a great piece of fall and not realizing that there's no food for the larvae here and the larvae will die, but meanwhile the plant has benefited because the bristles loosen and the fly flies off to pollinate the next flower. It's amazing.</seg>
        <seg id="77">Here's the arum, arum maculatum, or in the U.S., spotted aronnikum.</seg>
        <seg id="78">I photographed it the previous week in Dorset.</seg>
        <seg id="79">It heats up about 15 degrees above ambient temperature - amazing.</seg>
        <seg id="80">If you look into it from above, you can see something that looks like a dam behind the cob. Flies are attracted by the heat - the evaporation of volatile compounds - and they get stuck down in this container.</seg>
        <seg id="81">They drink the divine nectar and become sticky.</seg>
        <seg id="82">Overnight, they become covered in pollen flowing around them from above, and then the bristles we saw above loosen and release the pollen-covered flies. It's an amazing thing.</seg>
        <seg id="83">If you think it's amazing, here's one of my favorites.</seg>
        <seg id="84">Philodendron sello.</seg>
        <seg id="85">Those of you from Brazil should know about this plant.</seg>
        <seg id="86">It is the most striking thing.</seg>
        <seg id="87">This phallic thing is about 30 centimeters long.</seg>
        <seg id="88">It does something that no other plant I know of does: when it blooms - here in the middle of the cob - for about two days, its metabolism is similar to that of mammals.</seg>
        <seg id="89">Instead of the starch that is plant food, it takes something akin to brown fat and burns it at this rate, digesting it just like a small-sized cat.</seg>
        <seg id="90">That energy output, in equivalent weight, is twice that of a hummingbird-absolutely astonishing.</seg>
        <seg id="91">It also does something else, also unusual.</seg>
        <seg id="92">Not only does it heat itself up to 115 Fahrenheit, or 43-44 Celsius, for two days, but it keeps its temperature constant.</seg>
        <seg id="93">It has a thermoregulatory mechanism that maintains a constant temperature.</seg>
        <seg id="94">You might ask, "So why does it do that?"</seg>
        <seg id="95">Well as if you didn't know there are bugs that just love to make love at that temperature.</seg>
        <seg id="96">They get inside, and that's where it starts.</seg>
        <seg id="97">(Laughter) And the plant sprinkles pollen on them, and they go off to pollinate.</seg>
        <seg id="98">That's an amazing thing to think of.</seg>
        <seg id="99">Most of the pollinators we know are insects, but in the tropics many birds and butterflies also pollinate.</seg>
        <seg id="100">Many tropical flowers are red, and we think it's all because butterflies and birds have eyesight similar to ours, and that they see red very well.</seg>
        <seg id="101">But if you look at the spectrum, humans and birds see red, green and blue-they see that spectrum.</seg>
        <seg id="102">Insects, on the other hand, see green, blue, and ultraviolet, and they distinguish different shades of ultraviolet</seg>
        <seg id="103">that are on that end of the spectrum.</seg>
        <seg id="104">You're probably thinking, "It would be great if we could see them."</seg>
        <seg id="105">Yes, we can.</seg>
        <seg id="106">So what does an insect see?</seg>
        <seg id="107">Last week I took these pictures of the sunflower, the frankincense family, in Dorset.</seg>
        <seg id="108">These are the same little yellow flowers we see everywhere.</seg>
        <seg id="109">This is what it looks like in daylight.</seg>
        <seg id="110">And this is what it looks like when you take away the red.</seg>
        <seg id="111">Most bees can't see red.</seg>
        <seg id="112">Then I put UV filters on the camera and did a very, very long shutter speed with certain UV frequencies, and this is what I got.</seg>
        <seg id="113">A bull's-eye.</seg>
        <seg id="114">Of course, we know exactly what bees see, no more than you know what I see when I call this one red.</seg>
        <seg id="115">We can't tell what's going on in our neighbor's mind, we don't talk about the insect anymore.</seg>
        <seg id="116">But the picture will be about the same contrast, standing out strongly in the background.</seg>
        <seg id="117">Here's another little flower, a different range of ultraviolet frequencies, different filters, to match the pollinators.</seg>
        <seg id="118">They'll see about this.</seg>
        <seg id="119">Just in case you think this applies to all yellow flowers - no flowers were harmed in the process of filming, this one was just attached to the tripod, not plucked - when they're in the UV light, take a look at this one.</seg>
        <seg id="120">By the way, it could have served as the base of a sunscreen, because such creams work by absorbing ultraviolet light.</seg>
        <seg id="121">Maybe this compound would be useful.</seg>
        <seg id="122">Finally, here's one of the enoters that Bjorn Rorslett from Norway sent me - a fantastic hidden pattern.</seg>
        <seg id="123">I like the idea of something hidden.</seg>
        <seg id="124">I think there's something poetic about it. These pictures were taken with an ultraviolet filter, which is mostly used by astronomers to take pictures of Venus - actually the clouds of Venus.</seg>
        <seg id="125">This is the primary purpose of this filter.</seg>
        <seg id="126">Venus, of course, is the goddess of love and fertility, and this is consonant with flowers.</seg>
        <seg id="127">Not only do flowers spend a lot of effort in attracting pollinators, they have also somehow managed to convince us to plant whole fields of flowers and give them to each other at moments of birth and death, and in particular at weddings, which, if you think about it, is the moment that represents the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another.</seg>

        <seg id="9">The reason sexual reproduction is so important is that there are many other ways plants breed.</seg>

        <seg id="14">Some of you may have seen some of these images before.</seg>
        <seg id="15">As I like to say, every house has to have a raster electron microscope to look at these things.</seg>
        <seg id="16">There are as many different types of pollen as flowering plants.</seg>
        <seg id="17">By the way, this can be applied in criminology and beyond.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Basically, the pollen that causes allergies is the pollen of plants that use the wind to spread it. It's a very inefficient process, that's why it gets so badly clogged in our noses.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Plants have to eject huge masses of pollen in the hope that the germ cells, the male germ cells contained in the pollen, somehow accidentally reach another flower, absolutely by accident.</seg>
        <seg id="20">The pollen of all herbs, and therefore all crops, and the pollen of most of the trees, is carried by the wind.</seg>
        <seg id="21">To some extent, this is more reasonable because less pollen is required.</seg>
        <seg id="22">Insects and other species can take pollen and transfer it to where it is needed.</seg>

        <seg id="26">The plant gets its own - the hawk moth spreads pollen elsewhere.</seg>
        <seg id="27">The plants evolved so that they created small landing strips in different places for the bees not to get lost.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Many plants have a colour that makes them look like insects.</seg>
        <seg id="29">These are lily dusters, cleverly made so that when an unsuspecting insect sits on them, the duster flips over and hits it on the back, showering with a large amount of pollen, with which the insect then goes to another plant.</seg>
        <seg id="30">In a sense, it has them, which forces the insect to crawl out, covered in pollen, which it will then spread.</seg>
        <seg id="31">There are at least 20 thousand species of orchids - and they are all surprisingly diverse.</seg>
        <seg id="32">They go for a variety of tricks.</seg>
        <seg id="33">They are forced to attract pollinators in order to multiply.</seg>
        <seg id="34">This orchid, known as Darwin's orchid, because it was he who studied it and made a startling prediction when he saw it. You can see a very long tube with nectar falling from the orchid.</seg>
        <seg id="35">You see the middle of a flower: the insect must stick its proboscis directly into the middle and reach the bottom of this tube to get nectar.</seg>
        <seg id="36">Darwin claimed, looking at this flower, "I assume something evolved with it."</seg>
        <seg id="37">Indeed, this is an insect.</seg>
        <seg id="38">Usually his proboscis is curled, but in its straightened shape it looks like this.</seg>
        <seg id="39">One might think that if nectar - so valuable and expensive to produce - attracts so much attention from pollinators, then, as with sex in humans, deceptions can begin.</seg>
        <seg id="40">A flower can say, "I have some nectar.</seg>
        <seg id="41">Take a look? "Here is a plant.</seg>
        <seg id="42">This is a plant that insects in South Africa adore. During evolution, they acquired a long proboscis to get nectar from the bottom.</seg>

        <seg id="45">And here's the long-proboscis fly, which didn't get a drop of nectar from the fake. Because the imitating plant didn't give it anything.</seg>
        <seg id="46">But the fly not only did not receive nectar from the fake plant, but also - if you bring it closer - in the area of the lower part of its head, took a little pollen, which it will transfer to another plant, unless some botanist appears and jokes it on pigeon cardboard.</seg>
        <seg id="47">(Laughter) Deception also spreads in the plant kingdom.</seg>
        <seg id="48">This flower has black dots: they seem black to us, but for male insects of a certain species, they look like two females ready for anything.</seg>
        <seg id="49">(Laughter) When an insect reaches this flower and lands on it, it dips itself into pollen, which, of course, it will transfer to another plant. If you look at the same raster electron microscope that should be in every house, you can observe here a certain three-dimensional pattern layout.</seg>
        <seg id="50">So it probably even brings a pleasant feeling to the insect, except that it looks attractive.</seg>
        <seg id="51">The picture from an electron microscope - an orchid imitating an insect - shows that different parts of this structure have different colors and textures, but insects can perceive them in a completely different way.</seg>

        <seg id="53">A raster electron microscope shows that the surface is very different from the surfaces we looked at.</seg>
        <seg id="54">Sometimes the whole plant imitates an insect, even from our point of view.</seg>
        <seg id="55">I think it looks like some kind of flying creature.</seg>
        <seg id="56">It's an amazing, amazing flower.</seg>

        <seg id="59">For a bee of a certain species it resembles another very aggressive bee, and it flies up and hits its head many times to drive away the "bee," and, of course, is covered in pollen.</seg>
        <seg id="60">This plant also imitates another orchid, which has a wonderful food depot for insects.</seg>
        <seg id="61">But this one has nothing for them.</seg>
        <seg id="62">So she's cheating on two levels - just unheard of.</seg>
        <seg id="63">(Laughter) Here is ylang-ylang, a component of many perfume products.</seg>
        <seg id="64">I recently sniffed at someone who scolded them.</seg>
        <seg id="65">In principle, flowers don't need to be so fragrant.</seg>
        <seg id="66">They emit a striking range of smells for any insect with a sense of smell.</seg>
        <seg id="67">But it doesn't smell so good.</seg>
        <seg id="68">It's a flower that smells very, very bad, and it evolved to look like a fall.</seg>
        <seg id="69">The flies really like it.</seg>
        <seg id="70">They fly in and pollinate.</seg>
        <seg id="71">This one, helicodiceros, also known as the "dead horse lily."</seg>
        <seg id="72">I don't know how a dead horse really smells, but this one definitely smells very similar.</seg>
        <seg id="73">It's really horrible.</seg>
        <seg id="74">And meat flies just can't resist.</seg>
        <seg id="75">They fly inside and reach the bottom.</seg>
        <seg id="76">There they lay eggs, thinking that this is a great piece fell, and not realizing that there is no food for the larvae and the larvae will die, but in the meantime the plant has benefited because the bristles relax and the fly flies away to pollinate the next flower.</seg>
        <seg id="77">Here is arum, arum waste paper, or in the United States - aronnik spotted.</seg>
        <seg id="78">I took a picture of him the previous week in Dorset.</seg>
        <seg id="79">It warms up about 15 degrees above ambient temperature - amazing.</seg>
        <seg id="80">If you look at it from above, you can see something similar to a dam behind the cob. The flies are attracted by the heat - the evaporation of volatile compounds - and they get stuck below in this container.</seg>
        <seg id="81">They drink divine nectar and become sticky.</seg>
        <seg id="82">Overnight they are covered in pollen flowing from above and then the bristles we saw above weaken and release the flies covered in pollen.</seg>
        <seg id="83">If you think it's amazing, then here's one of my favorites.</seg>
        <seg id="84">Philodendron Sello.</seg>
        <seg id="85">Those from Brazil should know about this plant.</seg>
        <seg id="86">It's the most amazing thing.</seg>
        <seg id="87">This phallic thing is about 30 centimeters long.</seg>
        <seg id="88">It does something that no other plant I know does: when it blooms - in the middle of the cob - for about two days, its metabolism is similar to that of mammals.</seg>
        <seg id="89">Instead of starch, which is food for plants, it takes something similar to brown fat and burns it at such a rate, digests it just like a small cat.</seg>
        <seg id="90">This energy return, equivalent to weight, is twice as high as that of a hummingbird - absolutely amazing.</seg>
        <seg id="91">And it also does something else, also unusual.</seg>
        <seg id="92">It not only warms itself up to 115 Fahrenheit, or 43-44 Celsius, for two days, but also keeps the temperature constant.</seg>
        <seg id="93">It has a thermoregulation mechanism that maintains a constant temperature.</seg>
        <seg id="94">You ask, "Why is he doing this?"</seg>
        <seg id="95">Well, as if you didn't know there were beetles that just love making love at this temperature.</seg>
        <seg id="96">They climb inside and that's where it starts.</seg>
        <seg id="97">(Laughter) And the plant showered them with pollen and they went to pollinate.</seg>
        <seg id="98">Surprisingly invented.</seg>
        <seg id="99">Most of the pollinators we know are insects, but in the tropics also many birds and butterflies pollinate.</seg>
        <seg id="100">Many tropical flowers are red, and it seems to us that all this is because butterflies and birds have a similar vision to ours, and that they see red very well.</seg>
        <seg id="101">But if you look at the spectrum, man and bird see red, green and blue - they see this spectrum.</seg>
        <seg id="102">Insects see green, blue and ultraviolet light, and they distinguish between different shades of ultraviolet light,</seg>
        <seg id="103">Which are at this end of the spectrum.</seg>
        <seg id="104">You probably think, "It would be great if we could see them."</seg>
        <seg id="105">Yes, we can.</seg>
        <seg id="106">So what does the insect see?</seg>
        <seg id="107">Last week I took these photos of the sun colours, the incense family, in Dorset.</seg>
        <seg id="108">These are the very small yellow flowers that we see everywhere.</seg>
        <seg id="109">This is how it looks in daylight.</seg>
        <seg id="110">But this is how it looks if you remove the red.</seg>
        <seg id="111">Most bees do not see red.</seg>
        <seg id="112">Then I put ultraviolet filters on the camera and did a very, very long exposure with certain ultraviolet frequencies, and that's what happened.</seg>
        <seg id="113">The most "bullseye" is.</seg>
        <seg id="114">Of course, we know exactly what bees see, no more than you know what I see when I call it red.</seg>
        <seg id="115">We can't say what's going on in our neighbor's mind, we're not talking about an insect anymore.</seg>
        <seg id="116">But the picture will be about as contrasting, standing out in the background.</seg>
        <seg id="117">Here is another small flower - a different ultraviolet frequency range, different filters, to match pollinators.</seg>
        <seg id="118">They will see something like this.</seg>
        <seg id="119">In case you think it applies to all the yellows - not a single flower was damaged during the shooting, this one was just attached to a tripod, not torn - when they are in ultraviolet light, then take a look at this one.</seg>
        <seg id="120">By the way, it could serve as the basis for sunscreen, because such creams work by absorbing ultraviolet light.</seg>
        <seg id="121">Maybe this compound would be useful.</seg>
        <seg id="122">Finally, here's one of the enoters that Bjorn Rorslett from Norway sent me - a fantastic hidden pattern.</seg>
        <seg id="123">I like the idea of something hidden.</seg>
        <seg id="124">These photos were taken with an ultraviolet filter, which is mainly used by astronomers to shoot Venus - actually clouds of Venus.</seg>
        <seg id="125">This is the main purpose of this filter.</seg>
        <seg id="126">Venus, of course, is the goddess of love and fertility, and this is in tune with flowers.</seg>
        <seg id="127">Flowers not only spend a lot of effort attracting pollinators, they also somehow managed to convince us to plant whole fields of flowers and give them to each other in moments of birth and death, and, in particular, to a wedding, which, if you think about it, is a moment embodying the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another.</seg>
        <seg id="128">Many thanks.</seg>

      <p>
        <seg id="1">Do you know how many types of flowering plants there are?</seg>
        <seg id="2">A quarter of a million — at least as we know it — a quarter of a million species of flowering plants.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Flowers are a real problem for plants:</seg>
        <seg id="4">they are hard to create,</seg>
        <seg id="5">they require enormous amounts of energy and resources.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Why do plants go to such difficulties?</seg>
        <seg id="7">The answer to this, like many other questions, is sex.</seg>
        <seg id="8">I know what you are thinking when you look at these pictures.</seg>
        <seg id="9">The reason sexual reproduction is so important is that there are many other ways to reproduce plants.</seg>
        <seg id="10">They can be propagated by cuttings; they can fertilize themselves or pollinate themselves.</seg>
        <seg id="11">But it is very important for them to distribute their genes in order to mix them with the genes of other plants so that they can adapt to natural niches.</seg>
        <seg id="12">This is how evolution works.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Plants transmit genetic information through pollen.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Some of you may have seen some of these images before.</seg>
        <seg id="15">As I like to say, every home should have a scanning electron microscope to look at these things.</seg>
        <seg id="16">There are as many different types of pollen as there are flowering plants.</seg>
        <seg id="17">By the way, this can be applied in forensic science and not only.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Basically, the pollen that causes allergies is pollen from plants that use the wind to spread it. This is a very inefficient process, which is why it clogs up so hard in our noses.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Plants have to throw out huge masses of pollen, in the hope that the germ cells, the male germ cells that are contained in the pollen, will somehow accidentally get to another flower, completely by accident.</seg>
        <seg id="20">The pollen of all grasses, and therefore of all crops, and the pollen of most of the trees, is carried by the wind.</seg>
        <seg id="21">However, most species use insects for this. To some extent, this is more reasonable because less pollen is required.</seg>
        <seg id="22">Insects and other species can take pollen and carry it where it is needed.</seg>
        <seg id="23">It is clear that we know the relationship between insects and plants.</seg>
        <seg id="24">This is a symbiotic relationship: be it flies, birds or bees - they all get something in return, and that something is usually nectar.</seg>
        <seg id="25">In some cases, this symbiosis has led to amazing adaptations - for example, the moth-hawk hummingbird is beautiful in its adaptation.</seg>
        <seg id="26">The plant gets its own - the hawk moth spreads pollen elsewhere.</seg>
        <seg id="27">Plants have evolved to create small landing strips in different places for the bees to keep them from getting lost.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Many plants have a coloration that makes them look like insects.</seg>
        <seg id="29">These are the anthers of a lily, cleverly designed so that when an unsuspecting insect lands on them, the anther flips over and hits him on the back, showering a large amount of pollen, with which the insect then goes to another plant.</seg>
        <seg id="30">And here's an orchid that looks like it has jaws. In a sense, she has them, which forces the insect to crawl out, covered with pollen, which it will then spread.</seg>
        <seg id="31">There are at least 20,000 orchid species - and they are all surprisingly diverse.</seg>
        <seg id="32">They go to all kinds of tricks.</seg>
        <seg id="33">They are forced to attract pollinators in order to reproduce.</seg>
        <seg id="34">This orchid is known as Darwin's orchid because it was he who studied it and made an amazing prediction when he saw it. One can see a very long tube of nectar that falls from the orchid.</seg>
        <seg id="35">You can see the middle of the flower: the insect has to stick its proboscis right in the middle and get to the very bottom of this tube to get nectar.</seg>
        <seg id="36">Darwin said, looking at this flower: "I suppose something evolved with him."</seg>
        <seg id="37">And indeed, here is the insect.</seg>
        <seg id="38">Usually its proboscis is collapsed, but in its erect form it looks like this.</seg>
        <seg id="39">You might think that if nectar - so valuable and expensive to produce - attracts so much attention from pollinators, then, as with sex in humans, deception could begin.</seg>
        <seg id="40">The flower may say, “I have some nectar.</seg>
        <seg id="41">Will you drop by? " Here is the plant.</seg>
        <seg id="42">This is the plant that insects adore in South Africa. In the process of evolution, they acquired a long proboscis in order to get nectar from the bottom.</seg>
        <seg id="43">And this is imitation.</seg>
        <seg id="44">This plant imitates the previous one.</seg>
        <seg id="45">And here is the long-probed fly, which did not get a drop of nectar from the fake. Because the mimic plant didn't give her at all. She thought she was going to get something.</seg>
        <seg id="46">But the fly not only did not receive nectar from the fake plant, but also - if you zoom in - in the area of the lower part of the head, grabbed some pollen, which it will transfer to another plant, unless some botanist appears and pin it on a blue cardboard ...</seg>
        <seg id="47">(Laughter) Deception is spreading in the plant kingdom as well.</seg>
        <seg id="48">This flower has black dots: they seem black to us, but for male insects of a certain species, they look like two females, ready for anything.</seg>
        <seg id="49">(Laughter) When an insect gets to this flower and lands on it, it dips itself into pollen, which, of course, will transfer to another plant. If you look through the same scanning electron microscope, which should be in every home, you can observe here a certain three-dimensional arrangement of the pattern.</seg>
        <seg id="50">So it probably even makes the insect feel good, besides looking attractive.</seg>
        <seg id="51">In the electron microscope picture - here is an orchid mimicking an insect - you can see that different parts of this structure have different colors and textures, but insects can perceive them in a completely different way.</seg>
        <seg id="52">This plant has adapted to imitate the shiny metal surface of the body of some beetles.</seg>
        <seg id="53">Under a scanning electron microscope, it can be seen that the surface is very different from the surfaces we were looking at.</seg>
        <seg id="54">Sometimes the whole plant mimics an insect entirely, even from our point of view.</seg>
        <seg id="55">I think it looks like some kind of flying creature.</seg>
        <seg id="56">This is an amazing, amazing flower.</seg>
        <seg id="57">And smart. It's called obsidian.</seg>
        <seg id="58">I call him chitrodian.</seg>
        <seg id="59">For a certain kind of bee, it resembles another very aggressive bee, and it flies up and hits its head many times to drive the "bee" away, and, of course, is covered with pollen.</seg>
        <seg id="60">This plant also mimics another orchid that has a wonderful store of food for insects.</seg>
        <seg id="61">And this one has nothing for them.</seg>
        <seg id="62">So she cheats on two levels - just unheard of.</seg>
        <seg id="63">(Laughter) Here is ylang-ylang, a component of many perfumery products.</seg>
        <seg id="64">I recently smelled someone who smelled it.</seg>
        <seg id="65">In principle, flowers do not need to be so fragrant.</seg>
        <seg id="66">They emit a striking spectrum of odors for any insect with a sense of smell.</seg>
        <seg id="67">This doesn't smell so good.</seg>
        <seg id="68">This is a flower that smells really, really bad, and it has evolved to look like carrion.</seg>
        <seg id="69">Flies like this very much.</seg>
        <seg id="70">They fly in and pollinate.</seg>
        <seg id="71">This one, Helicodiceros, also known as the "lily of the dead horse".</seg>
        <seg id="72">I don't know what a dead horse really smells like, but this one definitely smells very similar.</seg>
        <seg id="73">This is really awful.</seg>
        <seg id="74">And the flies just can't resist.</seg>
        <seg id="75">They fly inside and fly to the very bottom.</seg>
        <seg id="76">There they lay their eggs, thinking that this is a great piece of falling, and not realizing that there is no food for the larvae and the larvae will die, but in the meantime the plant has benefited because the bristles relax and the fly flies away to pollinate the next flower. This is amazing.</seg>
        <seg id="77">Here is arum, arum waste, or in the USA - spotted arum.</seg>
        <seg id="78">I photographed him the previous week in Dorset.</seg>
        <seg id="79">It heats up about 15 degrees above ambient temperature - amazing.</seg>
        <seg id="80">If you look into it from above, then behind the cob you can see something that looks like a dam. The flies are attracted by the heat - the volatiles evaporate - and they get stuck at the bottom of this container.</seg>
        <seg id="81">They drink divine nectar and become sticky.</seg>
        <seg id="82">During the night, they become covered with pollen flowing around them from above, and then the bristles, which we saw above, weaken and release flies covered with pollen. Awesome thing.</seg>
        <seg id="83">If you think this is amazing, then here is one of my favorites.</seg>
        <seg id="84">Philodendron Sello.</seg>

        <seg id="92">It not only warms itself up to 115 Fahrenheit, or 43-44 Celsius, for two days, but it also keeps the temperature constant.</seg>

        <seg id="105">Yes we can.</seg>
        <seg id="106">So what does the insect see?</seg>
        <seg id="107">Last week I took these photographs of the Cistus flowers in Dorset.</seg>
        <seg id="108">These are the very little yellow flowers that we see everywhere.</seg>
        <seg id="109">This is how it looks in daylight.</seg>

        <seg id="111">Most bees cannot see red.</seg>
        <seg id="112">Then I put the UV filters on the camera and took a very, very slow shutter speed with certain UV frequencies, and this is what happened.</seg>
        <seg id="113">The most that neither is the "bull's-eye".</seg>
        <seg id="114">Of course, we know exactly what the bees see, no more than you know what I see when I call this red.</seg>
        <seg id="115">We cannot say what is going on in the mind of a neighbor, we do not speak about an insect.</seg>
        <seg id="116">But the picture will be about the same contrast, strongly stand out against the background.</seg>
        <seg id="117">Here is another small flower - a different range of ultraviolet frequencies, different filters, to match the pollinators.</seg>
        <seg id="118">They will see something like this.</seg>
        <seg id="119">In case you think that this applies to all yellow flowers - not a single flower was harmed during the shooting, this one was simply attached to a tripod, not ripped off - when they are in ultraviolet light, then take a look at this one.</seg>
        <seg id="120">By the way, it could serve as the basis for sunscreen, because such creams work by absorbing ultraviolet radiation.</seg>
        <seg id="121">Maybe this connection would be useful.</seg>
        <seg id="122">Finally, here is one of the evening primrose that Bjorn Rorslett from Norway sent me - a fantastic hidden pattern.</seg>
        <seg id="123">I love the idea of something hidden.</seg>

        <seg id="21">However, most species use insects for this. To some extent, this is more reasonable because less pollen is required.</seg>
        <seg id="22">Insects and other species can take pollen and carry it to where it is needed.</seg>
        <seg id="23">It is clear that we know the relationship between insects and plants.</seg>
        <seg id="24">It's a symbiotic relationship: whether it's flies, birds, or bees, they all get something in return, and it's something usually nectar.</seg>
        <seg id="25">In some cases, this symbiosis has led to amazing adaptations – for one, the hummingbird hawk moth is beautiful in its adaptation.</seg>
        <seg id="26">The plant gets its own - hawk moth spreads pollen elsewhere.</seg>
        <seg id="27">Plants evolved so that they created small planting strips in different places for bees so that they would not get lost.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Many plants have a coloration that makes them look like insects.</seg>
        <seg id="29">These are the anthers of the lily, cleverly made so that when an unsuspecting insect sits on them, the anther turns over and hits it on the back, showering it with a large amount of pollen, with which the insect then goes to another plant.</seg>
        <seg id="30">And here's an orchid that looks like it has jaws. In a sense, it has them, which forces the insect to crawl out, covered with pollen, which it will then spread.</seg>
        <seg id="31">There are at least 20,000 species of orchids — and they're all remarkably diverse.</seg>
        <seg id="32">They go to a variety of tricks.</seg>
        <seg id="33">They are forced to attract pollinators to reproduce.</seg>
        <seg id="34">This orchid, known as Darwin's orchid, because it was he who studied it and made a startling prediction when he saw it. You can see a very long tube of nectar that falls from the orchid.</seg>
        <seg id="35">You see the middle of the flower: the insect must stick the proboscis right in the middle and get to the bottom of this tube to get nectar.</seg>
        <seg id="36">Darwin claimed, looking at this flower: "I assume something evolved with it."</seg>
        <seg id="37">And really, that's the insect.</seg>
        <seg id="38">Usually its proboscis is in a coauted state, but in its straightened form it looks like this.</seg>
        <seg id="39">One might think that if nectar – so valuable and expensive to produce – attracts so much attention from pollinators, then, as with sex in humans, deceptions can begin.</seg>
        <seg id="40">A flower might say, "I have some nectar.</seg>
        <seg id="41">Will you look?" here's a plant.</seg>
        <seg id="42">Here is a plant that insects love in South Africa. In the process of evolution, they acquired a long proboscis to get nectar from the bottom.</seg>
        <seg id="43">And that's imitation.</seg>
        <seg id="44">This plant imitates the previous one.</seg>
        <seg id="45">And here is the long-trunked fly, which did not get a drop of nectar from the fake. Because the imitating plant didn't give her anything. She thought she was going to get something.</seg>
        <seg id="46">But not only did the fly not receive nectar from the fake plant, but also, if you zoom in, in the area of the lower part of the head, grabbed some pollen, which it will transfer to another plant, unless some botanist appears and pins it to a blue cardboard.</seg>
        <seg id="47">(Laughter) Deception spreads in the plant kingdom as well.</seg>
        <seg id="48">This flower has black dots: they seem black to us, but for male insects of a certain species, they look like two females ready for anything.</seg>
        <seg id="49">(Laughter) When an insect gets to this flower and lands on it, it dips itself in pollen, which, of course, will transfer to another plant. If you look into the same scanning electron microscope that should be in every house, you can see here a certain three-dimensional arrangement of the pattern.</seg>
        <seg id="50">So it probably even brings a pleasant feeling to the insect, except that it looks attractive.</seg>
        <seg id="51">In the picture from the electron microscope - here is an orchid imitating an insect - it is clear that different parts of this structure have different colors and textures, but insects can perceive them in a completely different way.</seg>
        <seg id="52">This plant has adapted to imitate the shiny metal surface of the body of some beetles.</seg>
        <seg id="53">Under the scanning electron microscope, it is clear that the surface is very different from the surfaces we were looking at.</seg>
        <seg id="54">Sometimes the whole plant imitates the insect, even from our point of view.</seg>
        <seg id="55">I think it's like some kind of flying creature.</seg>
        <seg id="56">It's a striking, amazing flower.</seg>
        <seg id="57">And smart. It's called obsidian.</seg>
        <seg id="58">I call it cunning.</seg>
        <seg id="59">For a bee of a certain species, it resembles another very aggressive bee, and it flies up and hits its head many times to drive away the "bee", and, of course, is covered with pollen.</seg>
        <seg id="60">This plant also mimics another orchid that has a wonderful warehouse of food for insects.</seg>
        <seg id="61">And this one has nothing for them.</seg>
        <seg id="62">So she's cheating on two levels — just unheard of.</seg>
        <seg id="63">(Laughter) Here's ylang-ylang, a component of many perfumes.</seg>
        <seg id="64">I recently sniffed someone who choked on it.</seg>
        <seg id="65">Flowers in principle do not need to be so fragrant.</seg>
        <seg id="66">They emit a striking range of smells for any insects with a sense of smell.</seg>
        <seg id="67">But it doesn't smell so good.</seg>
        <seg id="68">It's a flower that smells very, very bad, and it evolved to look like carrion.</seg>
        <seg id="69">Flies really like it.</seg>
        <seg id="70">They fly in and pollinate.</seg>
        <seg id="71">Here is this one, helicodiceros, also known as the "dead horse lily".</seg>
        <seg id="72">I don't know what a dead horse really smells like, but this one definitely smells very similar.</seg>
        <seg id="73">It's really terrible.</seg>
        <seg id="74">And meat flies just can't resist.</seg>
        <seg id="75">They fly inside and fly to the bottom.</seg>
        <seg id="76">There they lay eggs, thinking that this is a great piece of carrion, and not realizing that there is no food for the larvae and the larvae will die, but in the meantime the plant has benefited because the bristles relax, and the fly flies away to pollinate the next flower. It's amazing.</seg>
        <seg id="77">Here's arum, arum maculatum, or in the U.S. – aronous spotted.</seg>
        <seg id="78">I photographed him the previous week in Dorset.</seg>
        <seg id="79">It warms up about 15 degrees above ambient temperature — amazing.</seg>
        <seg id="80">If you look into it from above, you can see something behind the cob that looks like a dam. Flies are attracted to heat — the evaporation of volatile compounds — and they get stuck at the bottom of this container.</seg>
        <seg id="81">They drink divine nectar and become sticky.</seg>
        <seg id="82">Overnight, they are covered with pollen flowing around them from above, and then the bristles we saw above weaken and release pollen-covered flies. It's an awesome thing.</seg>
        <seg id="83">If you think that's amazing, here's one of my favorites.</seg>
        <seg id="84">Philodendron Sello.</seg>
        <seg id="85">Those from Brazil should be aware of this plant.</seg>
        <seg id="86">That's the most amazing thing.</seg>
        <seg id="87">This phallic thing is about 30 centimeters long.</seg>
        <seg id="88">It does something that no other plant I know of does: when it blooms — here in the middle of the cob — for about two days, its metabolism is similar to that of mammals.</seg>
        <seg id="89">Instead of starch, which is food for plants, it takes something similar to brown fat and burns it at such a rate, digests it in the same way as a small cat.</seg>
        <seg id="90">This return of energy, in equivalent weight, is twice as high as that of hummingbirds – absolutely amazing.</seg>
        <seg id="91">And it does something else, also unusual.</seg>
        <seg id="92">Not only does it warm itself up to Fahrenheit 115, or 43-44 Celsius, for two days, but it also keeps the temperature constant.</seg>
        <seg id="93">It has a thermoregulation mechanism that maintains a constant temperature.</seg>
        <seg id="94">You'll ask, "Why is he doing this?"</seg>
        <seg id="95">Well, as if you didn't know that there are beetles that just love to make love at this temperature.</seg>
        <seg id="96">They climb inside, and that's where it starts.</seg>
        <seg id="97">(Laughter) And the plant showers them with pollen, and they go to pollinate.</seg>
        <seg id="98">Surprisingly invented.</seg>
        <seg id="99">Most of the pollinators we know are insects, but in the tropics, many birds and butterflies also pollinate.</seg>
        <seg id="100">Many tropical flowers are red, and it seems to us that this is because butterflies and birds have similar vision to ours, and that they see the red color very well.</seg>
        <seg id="101">But if you look at the spectrum, man and bird see red, green and blue - they see this spectrum.</seg>
        <seg id="102">Insects see green, blue and ultraviolet, and they distinguish different shades of ultraviolet radiation,</seg>
        <seg id="103">which are at this end of the spectrum.</seg>
        <seg id="104">You're probably thinking, "It would be great if we could see them."</seg>
        <seg id="105">Yes, we can.</seg>
        <seg id="106">So what does the insect see?</seg>
        <seg id="107">Last week I took these photos of a sunflower, a family of frankincense, in Dorset.</seg>
        <seg id="108">These are the same small yellow flowers that we see everywhere.</seg>
        <seg id="109">That's what it looks like in daylight.</seg>
        <seg id="110">And that's what it looks like if you remove the red.</seg>
        <seg id="111">Most bees don't see red.</seg>
        <seg id="112">Then I put UV filters on the camera and did a very, very long exposure with certain UV frequencies, and that's what happened.</seg>
        <seg id="113">The most that neither is an "apple".</seg>
        <seg id="114">Of course, we know what bees see, no more than you know what I see when I call it red.</seg>
        <seg id="115">We can't tell what's going on in the neighbor's mind, we can't talk about an insect.</seg>
        <seg id="116">But the picture will be about the same contrasting, strongly standing out in the background.</seg>
        <seg id="117">Here's another little flower — a different range of ultraviolet frequencies, different filters, to match the pollinators.</seg>
        <seg id="118">They're going to see something like this.</seg>
        <seg id="119">In case you think this applies to all yellow flowers – no flower was damaged during the shooting, this one was just attached to a tripod rather than ripped off – when they're in ultraviolet light, then take a look at this one.</seg>
        <seg id="120">By the way, it could serve as the basis of sunscreen, because such creams work by absorbing ultraviolet radiation.</seg>
        <seg id="121">Maybe this connection would be helpful.</seg>
        <seg id="122">Finally, here's one of the enoteres that Bjorn Roarslett from Norway sent me – a fantastic hidden pattern.</seg>
        <seg id="123">I like the idea of something hidden.</seg>
        <seg id="124">I think there's something poetic about that. These photos were taken with an ultraviolet filter that is mostly used by astronomers to photograph Venus — actually the clouds of Venus.</seg>
        <seg id="125">This is the main purpose of this filter.</seg>
        <seg id="126">Venus, of course, is the goddess of love and fertility, and this is consonant with flowers.</seg>
        <seg id="127">Not only do flowers spend a lot of effort attracting pollinators, they also somehow managed to convince us to plant entire fields of flowers and give them to each other at the moments of birth and death, and, in particular, at the wedding, which, if you think about it, is the moment that personifies the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another.</seg>
        <seg id="128">Thank you very much.</seg>

      <p>
        <seg id="1">Do you know how many species of flower plants exist?</seg>
        <seg id="2">A quarter of a million  ⁇  at least those we know  ⁇  a quarter of a million species of flower plants.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Flowers are a real problem for plants:</seg>
        <seg id="4">It's hard to create them,</seg>
        <seg id="5">They require a huge amount of energy and resources.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Why do plants go to such difficulties?</seg>
        <seg id="7">The answer to this, as to many other questions, is sex.</seg>
        <seg id="8">I know what you think when you look at these pictures.</seg>
        <seg id="9">The reason why sexual reproduction is so important is that there are many other ways to reproduce plants.</seg>
        <seg id="10">They can be propagated by cuttings; they can fertilize themselves or pollinate themselves.</seg>
        <seg id="11">But it is very important for them to spread their genes to mix them with the genes of other plants - so they can adjust to natural niches.</seg>
        <seg id="12">This is how evolution works.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Plants transmit genetic information through pollen.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Some of you may have seen some of these images before.</seg>
        <seg id="15">As I love to say, every home should have a raster electron microscope to look at these things.</seg>
        <seg id="16">There are as many different types of pollen as flowering plants.</seg>
        <seg id="17">By the way, this can be applied in forensics and not only.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Mostly, the pollen that causes allergies is pollen from plants that use wind to spread it. This is a very inefficient process, which is why it is clogged so hard into our noses.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Plants have to throw away huge amounts of pollen, in the hope that the sex cells, the male sex cells that are contained in the pollen, will somehow accidentally reach another flower, absolutely by chance.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Pollen from all herbs, and therefore all grains, and pollen from most trees, is carried by the wind.</seg>
        <seg id="21">However, most species use insects for this purpose. To some extent, this is more reasonable because less pollen is required.</seg>
        <seg id="22">Insects and other species can take pollen and transfer it to where it is needed.</seg>
        <seg id="23">It is clear that we know the relationship between insects and plants.</seg>
        <seg id="24">It's a symbiotic relationship: Whether it's flies, birds, or bees - they all get something in return, and it's something usually nectar.</seg>
        <seg id="25">In some cases, this symbiosis has led to amazing adaptations  ⁇  so, the hawk-mole hummingbird is beautiful in its adaptation.</seg>
        <seg id="26">The plant gets its own - the hawk moth spreads pollen elsewhere.</seg>
        <seg id="27">The plants evolved so they created small landing strips in different locations for the bees so they wouldn't get lost.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Many plants have a coloring that makes them look like insects.</seg>
        <seg id="29">These are lily pollens, cleverly made so that when an unsuspecting insect sits on them, the pollen flips over and hits it on the back, pummeling a large amount of pollen, with which the insect is squirming.</seg>
        <seg id="30">But an orchid that looks as if it has jaws. In a sense, it has them, which forces the insect to crawl out, covered with pollen, which it then spreads.</seg>

        <seg id="39">One might think that if nectar - so valuable and expensive in production - attracts so much attention from pollinators, then, just as with sex in humans, cheating can begin.</seg>
        <seg id="40">A flower might say, "I have a little nectar.</seg>
        <seg id="41">Look? "Here's the plant.</seg>
        <seg id="42">This is a plant that insects in South Africa love. In the process of evolution, they have acquired a long trunk to get nectar from the bottom.</seg>
        <seg id="43">And this is imitation.</seg>
        <seg id="44">This plant imitates the previous one.</seg>

        <seg id="46">But the fly not only didn't get nectar from the fake plant, but also - if you get closer - in the area of the lower part of the head, picked up a little pollen, which it will transfer to another plant, unless there is a cockatoo.</seg>
        <seg id="47">(Laughter) Cheating is also spreading in the plant kingdom.</seg>
        <seg id="48">This flower has black dots: they seem black to us, but for male insects of a certain species, they look like two females ready for everything.</seg>

        <seg id="107">Last week, I took these pictures of the sunflower, a family of palm trees, in Dorset.</seg>
        <seg id="108">These are the smallest yellow flowers we see everywhere.</seg>
        <seg id="109">This is how it looks in daylight.</seg>
        <seg id="110">But this is how it looks if you remove the red.</seg>
        <seg id="111">Most bees do not see red.</seg>
        <seg id="112">Then I put ultraviolet filters on the camera and did a very, very long exposure with certain ultraviolet frequencies, and that's what happened.</seg>
        <seg id="113">Most of all, there is no "apple."</seg>
        <seg id="114">Of course, we know what bees see, no more than you know what I see when I call it red.</seg>
        <seg id="115">We can't say what's going on in the mind of a neighbor, they don't talk about the insect anymore.</seg>
        <seg id="116">But the picture will be about the same contrast, strongly highlighted in the background.</seg>
        <seg id="117">Here is another small flower - a different ultraviolet frequency range, other filters, to coincide with pollinators.</seg>
        <seg id="118">They will see about that.</seg>
        <seg id="119">In case you think this applies to all yellow flowers  ⁇  no flower was harmed in the process of shooting, this one was simply attached to a tripod, not ripped off - when they are in ultraviolet light, that's the look.</seg>
        <seg id="120">By the way, it could serve as the basis for sunscreen, because such creams work by absorbing ultraviolet light.</seg>
        <seg id="121">Maybe this connection would be useful.</seg>
        <seg id="122">Finally, here's one of the enothers that Bjorn Rorslett from Norway sent me - a fantastic hidden pattern.</seg>
        <seg id="123">I like the idea of something hidden.</seg>
        <seg id="124">I think there's something poetic about it. These photos were shot with an ultraviolet filter, which is mostly used by astronomers to shoot Venus  ⁇  in fact, Venus clouds.</seg>
        <seg id="125">This is the main purpose of this filter.</seg>
        <seg id="126">Venus, of course, is the goddess of love and fertility, and this is in tune with flowers.</seg>
        <seg id="127">Flowers not only spend a lot of effort to attract pollinators, they also somehow managed to convince us to plant entire fields of flowers and to give them to each other at the moments of birth and death, and, in particular, at the wedding, which, if possible, is celebrated.</seg>
        <seg id="128">Thank you very much.</seg>

      <p>
        <seg id="1">Do you know how many species of flowering plants exist?</seg>
        <seg id="2">A quarter of a million - at least those we know - a quarter of a million species of flowering plants.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Flowers are a real problem for plants:</seg>
        <seg id="4">they are hard to create,</seg>
        <seg id="5">they require huge amounts of energy and resources.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Why do plants go to such difficulties?</seg>
        <seg id="7">The answer to this, as well as many other questions, is sex.</seg>
        <seg id="8">I know what you are thinking about when you look at these pictures.</seg>
        <seg id="9">The reason sexual reproduction is so important is that there are many other ways of reproducing plants.</seg>
        <seg id="10">They can be propagated by cuttings; they can fertilize themselves or pollinate themselves.</seg>
        <seg id="11">But it is very important for them to spread their genes in order to mix them with the genes of other plants - so they can adapt to natural niches.</seg>
        <seg id="12">This is how evolution works.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Plants transmit genetic information through pollen.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Some of you may have seen some of these images before.</seg>
        <seg id="15">As I like to say, every home should have a raster electron microscope to look at these things.</seg>
        <seg id="16">There are as many different types of pollen as flowering plants.</seg>
        <seg id="17">By the way, this can be applied in criminology and beyond.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Basically, the pollen that causes the allergy is pollen from plants that use the wind to spread it, which is a very inefficient process, which is why it clogs so much into our noses.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Plants have to throw out huge amounts of pollen in the hope that the germ cells, the male germ cells that are contained in the pollen, will somehow accidentally get to another flower, completely by accident.</seg>
        <seg id="20">The pollen of all grasses, and therefore of all crops, and the pollen of most trees, is carried by the wind.</seg>
        <seg id="21">However, most species use insects for this. To some extent, this is more reasonable because less pollen is required.</seg>
        <seg id="22">Insects and other species can take pollen and transport it to where it is needed.</seg>
        <seg id="23">It is clear that we know the relationship between insects and plants.</seg>
        <seg id="24">It's a symbiotic relationship: whether it's flies, birds, or bees, they all get something in return, and it's something that is usually nectar.</seg>
        <seg id="25">In some cases, this symbiosis has led to amazing adaptations - for example, the hawk-moth hummingbird is beautiful in its adaptation.</seg>
        <seg id="26">The plant gets its way - the hawk moth spreads pollen elsewhere.</seg>
        <seg id="27">Plants have evolved to create small landing strips in different places for bees to keep them from getting lost.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Many plants have colours that make them look like insects.</seg>
        <seg id="29">These are lily anthers, cleverly made so that when an unsuspecting insect sits on them, the anther turns over and hits it on the back, showering it with plenty of pollen, with which the insect then travels to another plant.</seg>
        <seg id="30">But an orchid that looks like it has jaws. In a sense, it has them, which forces the insect to crawl out, covering itself with pollen, which it then spreads.</seg>
        <seg id="31">There are at least 20,000 species of orchids - and they are all amazingly diverse.</seg>
        <seg id="32">They go for a variety of tricks.</seg>
        <seg id="33">They are forced to attract pollinators to breed.</seg>
        <seg id="34">This orchid, known as Darwin's orchid, because it was he who studied it and made a startling prediction when he saw it.</seg>
        <seg id="35">You see the middle of the flower: the insect has to put the proboscis right in the middle and get to the bottom of the tube to get the nectar.</seg>
        <seg id="36">Darwin said, looking at the flower, "I guess something has evolved with it."</seg>
        <seg id="37">And indeed, here is the insect.</seg>
        <seg id="38">Usually his proboscis is rolled up, but in his straightened form he looks like this.</seg>
        <seg id="39">One might think that if nectar - so valuable and expensive to produce - attracts so much attention from pollinators, then, as with sex in humans, deception could begin.</seg>
        <seg id="40">A flower might say: "I have some nectar.</seg>
        <seg id="41">Will you look? "Here's a plant.</seg>
        <seg id="42">This is a plant adored by insects in South Africa, which, in the process of evolution, acquired a long proboscis to extract nectar from the bottom.</seg>
        <seg id="43">And this is an imitation.</seg>
        <seg id="44">This plant imitates the previous one.</seg>
        <seg id="45">And here's the long-tailed fly, which didn't get a drop of nectar from the counterfeit. Because the imitating plant didn't give her anything.</seg>
        <seg id="46">But not only did the fly not get the nectar from the counterfeit plant, but - to put it closer - in the area of the lower part of the head, it grabbed some pollen, which it will transfer to another plant, unless some botanist appears and pins it on a blue cardboard.</seg>
        <seg id="47">(Laughter) Deception is spreading in the plant kingdom.</seg>
        <seg id="48">This flower has black dots: they seem black to us, but for male insects of a certain species, they look like two females ready for anything.</seg>
        <seg id="49">(Laughter) When an insect reaches this flower and lands on it, it dips itself in pollen, which, of course, will transfer to another plant. If you look at the same raster electron microscope that every house should have, you can see here a certain three-dimensional layout of the pattern.</seg>
        <seg id="50">So it probably even brings pleasant feelings to the insect, except that it looks attractive.</seg>
        <seg id="51">The image from the electron microscope - an orchid that imitates an insect - shows that different parts of this structure have different colors and textures, but insects can perceive them in a completely different way.</seg>
        <seg id="52">This plant has adapted to imitate the shiny metallic surface of the body of some beetles.</seg>
        <seg id="53">Under the raster electron microscope, it can be seen that the surface is very different from the surfaces we looked at.</seg>
        <seg id="54">Sometimes the whole plant imitates an insect, even from our point of view.</seg>
        <seg id="55">I think it looks like some kind of flying creature.</seg>
        <seg id="56">It is a striking, amazing flower.</seg>
        <seg id="57">And clever. It's called obsidian.</seg>
        <seg id="58">I call it chitrodian.</seg>
        <seg id="59">For a certain species of bee, it resembles another very aggressive bee, and it flies up and hits its head many times to drive away the "bee," and of course is covered with pollen.</seg>
        <seg id="60">This plant also mimics another orchid that has a wonderful store of insect food.</seg>
        <seg id="61">And this one has nothing for them.</seg>
        <seg id="62">So she is cheating on two levels - just unheard of.</seg>
        <seg id="63">(Laughter) Here is ylang-ylang, a component of many perfumes.</seg>
        <seg id="64">I recently smelled someone who strangled them.</seg>
        <seg id="65">In principle, flowers do not need to be so fragrant.</seg>
        <seg id="66">They emit a striking range of odors for any insects with a sense of smell.</seg>
        <seg id="67">But it does not smell so good.</seg>
        <seg id="68">It is a flower that smells very, very bad and has evolved to look like a carrion.</seg>
        <seg id="69">The flies really like it.</seg>
        <seg id="70">They fly in and pollinate.</seg>
        <seg id="71">Here is this one, helicodiceros, also known as the "dead horse lily."</seg>
        <seg id="72">I don't know how a dead horse really smells, but this one definitely smells very similar.</seg>
        <seg id="73">It's really awful.</seg>
        <seg id="74">And meat flies simply cannot resist.</seg>
        <seg id="75">They fly inside and reach the bottom.</seg>
        <seg id="76">There they lay eggs, thinking it's a great piece of falling and not realizing there is no food for the larvae and the larvae will die, but in the meantime the plant has benefited because the bristles relax and the fly flies away to pollinate the next flower.</seg>
        <seg id="77">Here is an arum, an arum maculatum, or in the United States, an aronnik is spotted.</seg>
        <seg id="78">I photographed him the previous week in Dorset.</seg>
        <seg id="79">It heats up about 15 degrees above ambient temperature - amazing.</seg>
        <seg id="80">If you look at it from above, you can see something that looks like a dam behind the cob. The flies are attracted by the heat - evaporation of volatile compounds - and they get stuck in the bottom of the container.</seg>
        <seg id="81">They drink divine nectar and become sticky.</seg>
        <seg id="82">Overnight, they are covered with pollen flowing around them from above, and then the bristles we saw above loosen and release the pollen-covered flies.</seg>
        <seg id="83">If you think it's amazing, then here is one of my favorites.</seg>
        <seg id="84">Philodendron Sello.</seg>
        <seg id="85">Those from Brazil should know about this plant.</seg>
        <seg id="86">This is the most striking thing.</seg>
        <seg id="87">This phallic thing is about 30 centimetres long.</seg>
        <seg id="88">It does something that no other plant I know does: when it blooms - here in the middle of the cob - for about two days, its metabolism is similar to that of mammals.</seg>
        <seg id="89">Instead of starch, which is food for plants, it takes something similar to brown fat and burns it at such a speed, digests it in the same way as a small-sized cat.</seg>
        <seg id="90">This energy return, in equivalent weight, is twice as high as that of a hummingbird - quite astounding.</seg>
        <seg id="91">And it also does something else, also unusual.</seg>
        <seg id="92">Not only does it warm itself up to 115 Fahrenheit, or 43-44 Celsius, for two days, but it also keeps the temperature constant.</seg>
        <seg id="93">It has a thermoregulation mechanism that maintains a constant temperature.</seg>
        <seg id="94">You ask, "Why does he do this?"</seg>
        <seg id="95">Well, as if you didn't know that there are beetles that just love making love at this temperature.</seg>
        <seg id="96">They get inside, and there it starts.</seg>
        <seg id="97">(Laughter) And the plant showers them with pollen, and they go to pollinate.</seg>
        <seg id="98">Surprisingly invented.</seg>
        <seg id="99">Most of the pollinators we know are insects, but in the tropics, many birds and butterflies also pollinate.</seg>
        <seg id="100">Many tropical flowers are red, and it seems to us that this is because butterflies and birds have a similar vision to ours, and that they see red very well.</seg>
        <seg id="101">But if you look at the spectrum, man and bird see red, green and blue - they see the spectrum.</seg>
        <seg id="102">Insects see green, blue and ultraviolet light, and they distinguish between different shades of ultraviolet light,</seg>
        <seg id="103">which are at this end of the spectrum.</seg>
        <seg id="104">You probably think, "It would be great if we could see them."</seg>
        <seg id="105">Yes, we can.</seg>
        <seg id="106">So what does the insect see?</seg>
        <seg id="107">Last week I took these photos of the sunflower, the frankincense family, in Dorset.</seg>
        <seg id="108">These are the very small yellow flowers that we see everywhere.</seg>
        <seg id="109">This is how it looks in daylight.</seg>
        <seg id="110">But this is how it looks, if you remove the red.</seg>
        <seg id="111">Most bees do not see red.</seg>
        <seg id="112">Then I put ultraviolet filters on the camera and did a very, very long exposure with certain ultraviolet frequencies, and that's what happened.</seg>
        <seg id="113">Most of all, there is a "bullseye."</seg>
        <seg id="114">Of course, we know exactly what the bees see, no more than you know what I see when I call it red.</seg>
        <seg id="115">We can't say what's going on in the mind of a neighbor, we don't talk about an insect.</seg>
        <seg id="116">But the picture will be about the same contrast, which stands out strongly in the background.</seg>
        <seg id="117">Here is another small flower - a different range of ultraviolet frequencies, different filters, to match pollinators.</seg>
        <seg id="118">They will see something like this.</seg>
        <seg id="119">In case you think this applies to all the yellow flowers - not a single flower was hurt during the shooting, this one was just attached to a tripod and not ripped off - when they are in ultraviolet light, then take a look at this one.</seg>
        <seg id="120">By the way, it could serve as the basis for sunscreen, because such creams work by absorbing ultraviolet light.</seg>
        <seg id="121">Maybe this compound would be useful.</seg>
        <seg id="122">Finally, here is one of the enothers that Bjorn Rorslett from Norway sent me - a fantastic hidden pattern.</seg>
        <seg id="123">I like the idea of something hidden.</seg>
        <seg id="124">These photos were taken with an ultraviolet filter, which is mostly used by astronomers to capture Venus - actually the clouds of Venus.</seg>
        <seg id="125">This is the main purpose of this filter.</seg>
        <seg id="126">Venus, of course, is the goddess of love and fertility, and this is in consonance with flowers.</seg>
        <seg id="127">Not only do flowers put a lot of effort into attracting pollinators, they also somehow managed to convince us to plant whole fields of flowers and give them to each other at the moments of birth and death, and in particular at the wedding, which, if you think, is the moment that epitomizes the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another.</seg>

        <seg id="1">Моя работа — помогать компьютерам  делать сообщения об окружающем мире.</seg>
        <seg id="2">Есть много способов сделать это, но мне нравится помогать компьютерам рассказывать о том,  что они видят и понимают.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Например, на этой картинке современный алгоритм компьютерного зрения может распознать, что это — женщина, а это — собака.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Он может сказать, что женщина улыбается.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Он даже способен сказать,  что собака необыкновенно милая.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Я работаю над этим, думая о том, как люди понимают и обрабатывают данные о мире.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Какие мысли, воспоминания и истории может пробуждать в людях такая вот картинка.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Всё, что связано с подобными ситуациями.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Возможно, вы видели похожую собаку раньше или проводили время,  так же бегая по пляжу, и это, в свою очередь, вызывает мысли и воспоминания о прошедшем отпуске, о времени, проведённом на пляже, или времени, когда вы бегали где-то с другими собаками.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Один из моих главных принципов — это помочь компьютерам понять, что значит иметь подобный опыт, понять, чем мы делимся,  во что верим и что чувствуем, потому что тогда мы будем готовы начать вовлекать компьютерные технологии в процессы, дополняющие  наш собственный опыт.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Если копнуть глубже, несколько лет назад я начала помогать компьютерам писать рассказы на основе серии изображений.</seg>
        <seg id="12">И однажды в ходе работы я спросила компьютер,  что он думает о поездке в Австралию.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Он взглянул на картинки и увидел коалу.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Он не знал, что такое коала, но сказал, что считает её любопытным созданием.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Затем я поделилась с ним серией изображений о горящих домах.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Он посмотрел на картинки и сказал: «Удивительный вид! Потрясающе!»</seg>
        <seg id="17">У меня по спине побежали мурашки.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Он смотрел на ужасное,  разрушающее жизни событие и думал, что это нечто положительное.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Я поняла, что он распознал контрасты, оттенки красного и жёлтого и подумал, что это заслуживает позитивной оценки.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Отчасти он сделал это, потому что большинство изображений,  которые я давала ему, были позитивными.</seg>
        <seg id="21">Потому что люди склонны делиться  позитивными изображениями, когда рассказывают о своём опыте.</seg>
        <seg id="22">Когда вы в последний раз  видели селфи на похоронах?</seg>
        <seg id="23">Я осознала, что, совершенствуя  искусственный интеллект, задачу за задачей, массив данных за массивом, я создала огромные бреши, дыры и пробелы в том,  что он мог понимать.</seg>
        <seg id="24">И делая это, я закодировала все  возможные виды предубеждений.</seg>
        <seg id="25">Предубеждений, отражающих  ограниченное видение, ограниченное единым набором данных. Пробелы, которые отражают человеческие предубеждения, закодированные в данных, такие как предвзятость и стереотипы.</seg>
        <seg id="26">Я подумала об эволюции технологий, которая привела меня к тому, где я оказалась тогда, — как первые цветные фотографии были откалиброваны по коже белых женщин, а значит, цветные фотографии были  не приспособлены к тёмным лицам.</seg>
        <seg id="27">И это же предубеждение, этот же пробел наблюдались и в 90-е.</seg>
        <seg id="28">И этот же пробел в информации мы имеем и сегодня в том, насколько хорошо мы можем  распознавать разнообразные человеческие лица с помощью технологии распознавания лиц.</seg>
        <seg id="29">Я думала о новейших исследованиях, где мы склонны ограничивать свое мышление  одним набором данных и одной проблемой.</seg>
        <seg id="30">И тем самым, мы создавали всё больше пробелов и предубеждений, которые ИИ мог бы развить ещё сильнее.</seg>
        <seg id="31">Я поняла, что нужно больше думать о том, как технологии, с которыми мы работаем  сегодня, будут выглядеть через 5 и 10 лет.</seg>
        <seg id="32">Человечество эволюционирует медленно, со временем исправляя проблемы во взаимодействии людей  и окружающей среды.</seg>
        <seg id="33">Искусственный интеллект, напротив, эволюционирует с невероятной скоростью.</seg>
        <seg id="34">И это означает, что это действительно важно, тщательно подумать об этом прямо сейчас - поразмышлять о наших собственных пробелах, наших собственных предубеждениях и о том, как это влияет на технологии, которые мы создаем, и обсудить, что современные технологии будут значить в будущем.</seg>
        <seg id="35">Топ-менеджеры и учёные  всего мира говорят о том, каким по их мнению будет  искусственный интеллект в будущем.</seg>
        <seg id="36">Стивен Хокинг предостерегает: «ИИ может положить конец человечеству».</seg>
        <seg id="37">Илон Маск предупреждает, что это один из величайших экзистенциальных рисков, с которым когда-либо сталкивалась наша цивилизация.</seg>
        <seg id="38">Билл Гейтс недоумевает: «Я не понимаю, почему  люди не обеспокоены».</seg>
        <seg id="39">Но эти мнения — это только часть истории.</seg>
        <seg id="40">Математика, модели, основополагающие кирпичики  искусственного интеллекта — это то, что мы называем доступом  и с чем работаем.</seg>
        <seg id="41">У нас есть инструменты с открытым кодом  для машинного обучения и интеллекта, которыми мы готовы делиться.</seg>
        <seg id="42">И помимо этого, мы можем делиться своим опытом.</seg>
        <seg id="43">Делиться своими знаниями о технологиях, и как это нас беспокоит, и как это нас волнует.</seg>
        <seg id="44">Мы можем обсуждать, что мы любим.</seg>
        <seg id="45">Мы можем предвидеть, какие аспекты технологий со временем могут стать самыми полезными, а какие — наиболее проблематичными.</seg>
        <seg id="46">Если мы все сосредоточимся на открытом диалоге об ИИ в перспективе будущего, это поможет создать атмосферу общей осведомлённости о том, что ИИ представляет собой сейчас, чем может стать, и что мы должны сделать, чтобы получить наиболее подходящий нам результат.</seg>
        <seg id="47">Мы уже видим и знаем всё это о технологиях, используемых сегодня.</seg>
        <seg id="48">Мы пользуемся смартфонами,  цифровыми помощниками и роботами-пылесосами.</seg>
        <seg id="49">Разве они — зло?</seg>
        <seg id="50">Может быть, иногда.</seg>
        <seg id="51">Они полезны?</seg>
        <seg id="52">Безусловно.</seg>
        <seg id="53">И все они разные.</seg>
        <seg id="54">И в них вы уже видите луч света,  освещающий наше будущее.</seg>
        <seg id="55">Будущее начинается в том, что  мы создаём и строим прямо сейчас.</seg>
        <seg id="56">Мы запускаем тот эффект домино, который определит путь развития ИИ.</seg>
        <seg id="57">Прямо сейчас мы формируем ИИ будущего.</seg>
        <seg id="58">Технологии, которые погружают  нас в дополненные реальности, возвращают к жизни прошлые миры.</seg>
        <seg id="59">Технологии, которые помогают  людям делиться опытом, когда они испытывают  трудности в общении.</seg>
        <seg id="60">Технологии, основанные на понимании потоковых визуальных миров, используются для беспилотных автомобилей.</seg>
        <seg id="61">Технологии, основанные на понимании изображений и генерировании языка, превращаются в технологии, которые помогают слабовидящим людям лучше получать доступ к визуальному миру.</seg>
        <seg id="62">Но мы также видим, как технологии  могут привести к проблемам.</seg>
        <seg id="63">Сегодня у нас есть технологии, которые анализируют наши  врождённые физические характеристики — такие как цвет кожи или черты лица — чтобы определить, можем ли мы  быть преступниками или террористами.</seg>
        <seg id="64">У нас есть технологии,  анализирующие данные о нас, даже такие данные как пол или раса, чтобы определить, можем  ли мы получить кредит.</seg>
        <seg id="65">Всё, что мы видим сейчас, это лишь один кадр из эволюции  искусственного интеллекта.</seg>
        <seg id="66">Потому что то, где мы сейчас, — это всего лишь момент этой эволюции.</seg>
        <seg id="67">Это означает, что всё, что мы  делаем сегодня, окажет влияние на наше будущее.</seg>
        <seg id="68">Если мы хотим, чтобы ИИ развивался для помощи человеку, мы должны определить цели и стратегии, которые зададут этот путь сейчас.</seg>
        <seg id="69">Я бы хотела видеть что-то,  что хорошо подходит людям, сочетается с нашей культурой и окружающей средой.</seg>
        <seg id="70">Технологии, которые помогают тем из нас, кто страдает неврологическими или другими заболеваниями, чтобы сделать жизнь  одинаково трудной для всех.</seg>
        <seg id="71">Технологии, работающие независимо от вашего цвета кожи  или демографических характеристик.</seg>
        <seg id="72">Сегодня я сосредоточена на технологиях,  которые будут с нами завтра и через 10 лет.</seg>
        <seg id="73">ИИ может стать чем угодно.</seg>
        <seg id="74">Но в данном случае это не самоуправляемая машина  без конечного пункта назначения.</seg>
        <seg id="75">Этой машиной управляем мы.</seg>
        <seg id="76">Мы выбираем, когда следует  ускориться, а когда замедлиться.</seg>
        <seg id="77">Мы выбираем, когда нам нужно повернуть.</seg>
        <seg id="78">Мы выбираем, каким будет ИИ будущего.</seg>
        <seg id="79">Есть бесчисленное множество вещей, которыми может стать  искусственный интеллект.</seg>
        <seg id="80">И он станет множеством вещей.</seg>
        <seg id="81">И наша задача сегодня — выяснить, что именно мы должны вложить в ИИ, чтобы полученные результаты стали самыми лучшими для всех нас.</seg>

      <p>
        <seg id="1">I work on helping computers communicate about the world around us.</seg>
        <seg id="2">There are a lot of ways to do this, and I like to focus on helping computers to talk about what they see and understand.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Given a scene like this, a modern computer-vision algorithm can tell you that there's a woman and there's a dog.</seg>
        <seg id="4">It can tell you that the woman is smiling.</seg>
        <seg id="5">It might even be able to tell you that the dog is incredibly cute.</seg>
        <seg id="6">I work on this problem thinking about how humans understand and process the world.</seg>
        <seg id="7">The thoughts, memories and stories that a scene like this might evoke for humans.</seg>
        <seg id="8">All the interconnections of related situations.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Maybe you've seen a dog like this one before, or you've spent time running on a beach like this one, and that further evokes thoughts and memories of a past vacation, past times to the beach, times spent running around with other dogs.</seg>
        <seg id="10">One of my guiding principles is that by helping computers to understand what it's like to have these experiences, to understand what we share and believe and feel, then we're in a great position to start evolving computer technology in a way that's complementary with our own experiences.</seg>
        <seg id="11">So, digging more deeply into this, a few years ago I began working on helping computers to generate human-like stories from sequences of images.</seg>
        <seg id="12">So, one day, I was working with my computer to ask it what it thought about a trip to Australia.</seg>
        <seg id="13">It took a look at the pictures, and it saw a koala.</seg>
        <seg id="14">It didn't know what the koala was, but it said it thought it was an interesting-looking creature.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Then I shared with it a sequence of images about a house burning down.</seg>
        <seg id="16">It took a look at the images and it said, "This is an amazing view! This is spectacular!"</seg>
        <seg id="17">It sent chills down my spine.</seg>
        <seg id="18">It saw a horrible, life-changing and life-destroying event and thought it was something positive.</seg>
        <seg id="19">I realized that it recognized the contrast, the reds, the yellows, and thought it was something worth remarking on positively.</seg>
        <seg id="20">And part of why it was doing this was because most of the images I had given it were positive images.</seg>
        <seg id="21">That's because people tend to share positive images when they talk about their experiences.</seg>
        <seg id="22">When was the last time you saw a selfie at a funeral?</seg>
        <seg id="23">I realized that, as I worked on improving AI task by task, dataset by dataset, that I was creating massive gaps, holes and blind spots in what it could understand.</seg>
        <seg id="24">And while doing so, I was encoding all kinds of biases.</seg>
        <seg id="25">Biases that reflect a limited viewpoint, limited to a single dataset -- biases that can reflect human biases found in the data, such as prejudice and stereotyping.</seg>
        <seg id="26">I thought back to the evolution of the technology that brought me to where I was that day -- how the first color images were calibrated against a white woman's skin, meaning that color photography was biased against black faces.</seg>
        <seg id="27">And that same bias, that same blind spot continued well into the '90s.</seg>
        <seg id="28">And the same blind spot continues even today in how well we can recognize different people's faces in facial recognition technology.</seg>
        <seg id="29">I though about the state of the art in research today, where we tend to limit our thinking to one dataset and one problem.</seg>
        <seg id="30">And that in doing so, we were creating more blind spots and biases that the AI could further amplify.</seg>
        <seg id="31">I realized then that we had to think deeply about how the technology we work on today looks in five years, in 10 years.</seg>
        <seg id="32">Humans evolve slowly, with time to correct for issues in the interaction of humans and their environment.</seg>
        <seg id="33">In contrast, artificial intelligence is evolving at an incredibly fast rate.</seg>
        <seg id="34">And that means that it really matters that we think about this carefully right now -- that we reflect on our own blind spots, our own biases, and think about how that's informing the technology we're creating and discuss what the technology of today will mean for tomorrow.</seg>
        <seg id="35">CEOs and scientists have weighed in on what they think the artificial intelligence technology of the future will be.</seg>
        <seg id="36">Stephen Hawking warns that "Artificial intelligence could end mankind."</seg>
        <seg id="37">Elon Musk warns that it's an existential risk and one of the greatest risks that we face as a civilization.</seg>
        <seg id="38">Bill Gates has made the point, "I don't understand why people aren't more concerned."</seg>
        <seg id="39">But these views -- they're part of the story.</seg>
        <seg id="40">The math, the models, the basic building blocks of artificial intelligence are something that we call access and all work with.</seg>
        <seg id="41">We have open-source tools for machine learning and intelligence that we can contribute to.</seg>
        <seg id="42">And beyond that, we can share our experience.</seg>
        <seg id="43">We can share our experiences with technology and how it concerns us and how it excites us.</seg>
        <seg id="44">We can discuss what we love.</seg>
        <seg id="45">We can communicate with foresight about the aspects of technology that could be more beneficial or could be more problematic over time.</seg>
        <seg id="46">If we all focus on opening up the discussion on AI with foresight towards the future, this will help create a general conversation and awareness about what AI is now, what it can become and all the things that we need to do in order to enable that outcome that best suits us.</seg>
        <seg id="47">We already see and know this in the technology that we use today.</seg>
        <seg id="48">We use smart phones and digital assistants and Roombas.</seg>
        <seg id="49">Are they evil?</seg>
        <seg id="50">Maybe sometimes.</seg>
        <seg id="51">Are they beneficial?</seg>
        <seg id="52">Yes, they're that, too.</seg>
        <seg id="53">And they're not all the same.</seg>
        <seg id="54">And there you already see a light shining on what the future holds.</seg>
        <seg id="55">The future continues on from what we build and create right now.</seg>
        <seg id="56">We set into motion that domino effect that carves out AI's evolutionary path.</seg>
        <seg id="57">In our time right now, we shape the AI of tomorrow.</seg>
        <seg id="58">Technology that immerses us in augmented realities bringing to life past worlds.</seg>
        <seg id="59">Technology that helps people to share their experiences when they have difficulty communicating.</seg>
        <seg id="60">Technology built on understanding the streaming visual worlds used as technology for self-driving cars.</seg>
        <seg id="61">Technology built on understanding images and generating language, evolving into technology that helps people who are visually impaired be better able to access the visual world.</seg>
        <seg id="62">And we also see how technology can lead to problems.</seg>
        <seg id="63">We have technology today that analyzes physical characteristics we're born with -- such as the color of our skin or the look of our face -- in order to determine whether or not we might be criminals or terrorists.</seg>
        <seg id="64">We have technology that crunches through our data, even data relating to our gender or our race, in order to determine whether or not we might get a loan.</seg>
        <seg id="65">All that we see now is a snapshot in the evolution of artificial intelligence.</seg>
        <seg id="66">Because where we are right now, is within a moment of that evolution.</seg>
        <seg id="67">That means that what we do now will affect what happens down the line and in the future.</seg>
        <seg id="68">If we want AI to evolve in a way that helps humans, then we need to define the goals and strategies that enable that path now.</seg>
        <seg id="69">What I'd like to see is something that fits well with humans, with our culture and with the environment.</seg>
        <seg id="70">Technology that aids and assists those of us with neurological conditions or other disabilities in order to make life equally challenging for everyone.</seg>

        <seg id="1">My job is to help computers report on the world around them.</seg>
        <seg id="2">There are many ways to do this, but I like to help computers talk about what they see and understand.</seg>
        <seg id="3">For example, in this picture, a modern computer vision algorithm can recognize that this is a woman and this is a dog.</seg>
        <seg id="4">He can tell that the woman is smiling.</seg>
        <seg id="5">He is even able to say that the dog is unusually cute.</seg>
        <seg id="6">I work on this by thinking about how people understand and process data about the world.</seg>
        <seg id="7">What thoughts, memories and stories a picture like this can evoke in people.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Everything to do with situations like this.</seg>
        <seg id="9">You may have seen a similar dog before or spent time running on the beach in the same way, and this in turn triggers thoughts and memories of a past holiday, time spent at the beach, or time spent running somewhere with other dogs.</seg>
        <seg id="10">One of my main principles is to help computers understand what it means to have these experiences, to understand what we share, what we believe and what we feel, because then we will be ready to start involving computer technology in processes that complement our own experience.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Digging deeper, a few years ago I started helping computers write stories based on a series of images.</seg>
        <seg id="12">And one day at work, I asked the computer what it thought about going to Australia.</seg>
        <seg id="13">He looked at the pictures and saw a koala.</seg>
        <seg id="14">He did not know what a koala was, but said he thought it was a curious creature.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Then I shared with him a series of images about burning houses.</seg>
        <seg id="16">He looked at the pictures and said: "Amazing view! Amazing!"</seg>
        <seg id="17">It sent shivers down my spine.</seg>
        <seg id="18">He was looking at a horrible, life-destroying event and thinking it was something positive.</seg>
        <seg id="19">I understood that he recognized the contrasts, the shades of red and yellow, and thought it deserved a positive assessment.</seg>
        <seg id="20">In part, he did this because most of the images I gave him were positive.</seg>
        <seg id="21">Because people tend to share positive images when they talk about their experiences.</seg>
        <seg id="22">When was the last time you saw a selfie at a funeral?</seg>
        <seg id="23">I realized that by perfecting artificial intelligence, task by task, dataset by dataset, I had created huge gaps, holes, and gaps in what it could understand.</seg>
        <seg id="24">And in doing so, I encoded all kinds of biases.</seg>
        <seg id="25">Biases that reflect a limited vision confined to a single data set. Gaps that reflect human biases encoded in the data, such as bias and stereotypes.</seg>
        <seg id="26">I thought about the evolution of technology that led me to where I was then - how the first color photographs were calibrated to the skin of white women, which meant that color photographs were not adapted to dark faces.</seg>
        <seg id="27">And the same prejudice, the same gap was observed in the 1990s.</seg>
        <seg id="28">And that's the same information gap we have today in how well we can recognize diverse human faces with facial recognition technology.</seg>
        <seg id="29">I was thinking about the latest research, where we tend to limit our thinking to one data set and one problem.</seg>
        <seg id="30">And by doing so, we created more and more gaps and biases that the AI could develop even more.</seg>
        <seg id="31">I realized that we need to think more about how the technologies we work with today will look in 5 and 10 years.</seg>
        <seg id="32">Humanity evolves slowly, correcting problems in the interaction of people and the environment over time.</seg>
        <seg id="33">Artificial intelligence, on the other hand, is evolving at an incredible rate.</seg>
        <seg id="34">And that means it's really important to think carefully about this right now - to reflect on our own gaps, our own biases and how that affects the technologies we create, and to discuss what today's technologies will mean in the future.</seg>
        <seg id="35">Top managers and scientists around the world talk about what they think artificial intelligence will be like in the future.</seg>
        <seg id="36">Stephen Hawking warns: 'AI could spell the end of humanity'</seg>
        <seg id="37">Elon Musk warns that this is one of the greatest existential risks our civilization has ever faced.</seg>
        <seg id="38">Bill Gates is perplexed: "I don't understand why people are not concerned."</seg>
        <seg id="39">But those opinions are only part of the story.</seg>
        <seg id="40">The mathematics, the models, the foundational building blocks of artificial intelligence are what we call access and work with.</seg>
        <seg id="41">We have open source tools for machine learning and intelligence that we are willing to share.</seg>
        <seg id="42">And beyond that, we can share our experiences.</seg>
        <seg id="43">Sharing our knowledge about technology and how it worries us and how it excites us.</seg>
        <seg id="44">We can discuss what we love.</seg>
        <seg id="45">We can anticipate which aspects of technology are likely to be most useful over time and which are likely to be most problematic.</seg>
        <seg id="46">If we all focus on an open dialogue about AI in the perspective of the future, it will help to create an atmosphere of general awareness of what AI is now, what it can become, and what we should do to get the most suitable result for us.</seg>
        <seg id="47">We already see and know all of this about the technologies in use today.</seg>
        <seg id="48">We use smartphones, digital assistants and robot vacuum cleaners.</seg>
        <seg id="49">Are they evil?</seg>
        <seg id="50">Maybe sometimes.</seg>
        <seg id="51">Are they useful?</seg>
        <seg id="52">Of course.</seg>
        <seg id="53">And they are all different.</seg>
        <seg id="54">And in them you already see a ray of light illuminating our future.</seg>
        <seg id="55">The future begins with what we create and build right now.</seg>
        <seg id="56">We are starting the domino effect that will determine the path of AI development.</seg>
        <seg id="57">Right now, we are shaping the AI of the future.</seg>
        <seg id="58">Technologies that immerse us in augmented realities bring past worlds back to life.</seg>
        <seg id="59">Technologies that help people share experiences when they have difficulty communicating.</seg>
        <seg id="60">Technologies based on the understanding of streaming visual worlds are used for self-driving cars.</seg>
        <seg id="61">Technologies based on image understanding and language generation are evolving into technologies that help visually impaired people better access the visual world.</seg>
        <seg id="62">But we also see how technology can lead to problems.</seg>
        <seg id="63">Today, we have technologies that analyze our innate physical characteristics - such as skin color or facial features - to determine whether we might be criminals or terrorists.</seg>
        <seg id="64">We have technology that analyzes data about us, even data like gender or race, to determine whether we can get a loan.</seg>
        <seg id="65">Everything we see now is just one snapshot of the evolution of artificial intelligence.</seg>
        <seg id="66">Because where we are now is just a moment in that evolution.</seg>
        <seg id="67">This means that everything we do today will have an impact on our future.</seg>
        <seg id="68">If we want AI to evolve to help humans, we need to define the goals and strategies that will set that path now.</seg>
        <seg id="69">I would like to see something that fits people well, fits with our culture and environment.</seg>
        <seg id="70">Technologies that help those of us with neurological or other conditions to make life equally difficult for all.</seg>
        <seg id="71">Technology that works regardless of your skin color or demographic.</seg>
        <seg id="72">Today I am focused on the technologies that will be with us tomorrow and in 10 years.</seg>
        <seg id="73">AI can be anything.</seg>
        <seg id="74">But in this case, it's not a self-driving car with no final destination.</seg>
        <seg id="75">We are driving this car.</seg>
        <seg id="76">We choose when to speed up and when to slow down.</seg>

        <seg id="1">My job is to help computers communicate about the world around them.</seg>
        <seg id="2">There are many ways to do this, but I love helping computers talk about what they see and understand.</seg>
        <seg id="3">For example, in this picture, a modern computer vision algorithm can recognize that this is a woman, and this is a dog.</seg>
        <seg id="4">He can say the woman is smiling.</seg>
        <seg id="5">He can even say that the dog is unusually cute.</seg>
        <seg id="6">I'm working on it, thinking about how people understand and process data about the world.</seg>
        <seg id="7">What thoughts, memories and stories can such a picture awaken in people.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Everything related to such situations.</seg>
        <seg id="9">You may have seen a similar dog before or spent time running around the beach as well, and this in turn evokes thoughts and memories of a past vacation, a time spent on the beach, or a time when you ran somewhere with other dogs.</seg>
        <seg id="10">One of my main principles is to help computers understand what it means to have this kind of experience, to understand what we share, what we believe in and what we feel, because then we will be ready to start involving computer technologies in processes that complement our own experience.</seg>
        <seg id="11">If you dig deeper, a few years ago I started helping computers write stories based on a series of images.</seg>
        <seg id="12">And one day in the course of work, I asked the computer what he thought about going to Australia.</seg>
        <seg id="13">He looked at the pictures and saw a koala.</seg>
        <seg id="14">He didn't know what a koala was, but said he found it curious.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Then I shared with him a series of images of burning houses.</seg>
        <seg id="16">He looked at the pictures and said, "Awesome look! Awesome!"</seg>
        <seg id="17">Goosebumps ran down my back.</seg>
        <seg id="18">He looked at a horrible, life-destroying event and thought it was something positive.</seg>
        <seg id="19">I realised he recognised the contrasts, the shades of red and yellow and thought it deserved a positive assessment.</seg>
        <seg id="20">In part, he did it because most of the images I gave him were positive.</seg>
        <seg id="21">Because people tend to share positive images when they talk about their experiences.</seg>
        <seg id="22">When was the last time you saw a selfie at a funeral?</seg>
        <seg id="23">I realised that by improving artificial intelligence, task by task, data by array, I had created huge gaps, holes and gaps in what he could understand.</seg>
        <seg id="24">And in doing so, I encoded all kinds of prejudices.</seg>
        <seg id="25">Prejudices that reflect a limited vision, limited to a single set of data. Gaps that reflect human prejudices encoded in the data, such as bias and stereotypes.</seg>
        <seg id="26">I thought about the evolution of technology that led me to where I was then - how the first colour photographs were calibrated to the skin of white women, meaning colour photographs were not adapted to dark faces.</seg>
        <seg id="27">And this is the same prejudice, the same gap was observed in the 90s.</seg>
        <seg id="28">And the same information gap we have today is how well we can recognise diverse human faces with facial recognition technology.</seg>
        <seg id="29">I was thinking about the latest research, where we tend to limit our thinking to one set of data and one problem.</seg>
        <seg id="30">And by doing so, we created more gaps and prejudices that AI could develop even more.</seg>
        <seg id="31">I realised that we need to think more about how the technologies we are working with today will look in 5 and 10 years.</seg>
        <seg id="32">Mankind evolves slowly, correcting problems in the interaction between people and the environment over time.</seg>
        <seg id="33">Artificial intelligence, by contrast, is evolving at an incredible rate.</seg>
        <seg id="34">And that means it's really important to think carefully about it right now - reflect on our own gaps, our own prejudices and how it affects the technologies we create, and discuss what modern technologies will mean in the future.</seg>
        <seg id="35">Top managers and scientists around the world are talking about what they think artificial intelligence will be like in the future.</seg>
        <seg id="36">Stephen Hawking warns: "AI can end humanity."</seg>

        <seg id="38">Bill Gates is perplexed: "I don't understand why people aren't concerned."</seg>
        <seg id="39">But these opinions are only part of the story.</seg>
        <seg id="40">Mathematics, models, the fundamental building blocks of artificial intelligence are what we call access and what we work with.</seg>
        <seg id="41">We have open source tools for machine learning and intelligence that we are willing to share.</seg>
        <seg id="42">And beyond that, we can share our experience.</seg>
        <seg id="43">Share your knowledge of technology, and how it concerns us, and how it concerns us.</seg>
        <seg id="44">We can discuss what we love.</seg>
        <seg id="45">We can anticipate which aspects of technology may become the most useful over time and which are the most problematic.</seg>
        <seg id="46">If we all focus on an open dialogue about AI in the future, it will help create an atmosphere of shared awareness of what AI is now, what it can become, and what we must do to get the best result for us.</seg>

        <seg id="1">My job is to help computers make messages about the world around them.</seg>
        <seg id="2">There are many ways to do this, but I love helping computers communicate what they see and understand.</seg>
        <seg id="3">For example, in this picture, a modern computer vision algorithm can recognize that this is a woman, and this is a dog.</seg>
        <seg id="4">He can tell that the woman is smiling.</seg>
        <seg id="5">He is even able to say that the dog is unusually cute.</seg>
        <seg id="6">I am working on this by thinking about how people understand and process data about the world.</seg>
        <seg id="7">What thoughts, memories and stories can this picture evoke in people.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Everything related to similar situations.</seg>
        <seg id="9">You may have seen a similar dog before, or spent time running on the beach in the same way, and this, in turn, brings up thoughts and memories of your past vacation, time on the beach, or time when you were running with others. dogs.</seg>
        <seg id="10">One of my main principles is to help computers understand what it means to have such an experience, to understand what we share, what we believe and how we feel, because then we will be ready to start involving computer technology in processes that complement our own experience.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Digging deeper, a few years ago I started helping computers write stories based on a series of images.</seg>
        <seg id="12">And one day while working, I asked the computer what it thinks about the trip to Australia.</seg>
        <seg id="13">He looked at the pictures and saw a koala.</seg>
        <seg id="14">He did not know what a koala was, but said that he considered her a curious creature.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Then I shared with him a series of images of houses on fire.</seg>
        <seg id="16">He looked at the pictures and said, “Amazing view! Awesome! "</seg>
        <seg id="17">Goose bumps ran down my spine.</seg>
        <seg id="18">He looked at a terrible, life-destroying event and thought it was something positive.</seg>
        <seg id="19">I realized that he recognized contrasts, shades of red and yellow and thought that this deserves a positive assessment.</seg>
        <seg id="20">He did it in part because most of the images I gave him were positive.</seg>
        <seg id="21">Because people tend to share positive images when they share their experiences.</seg>
        <seg id="22">When was the last time you saw a selfie at a funeral?</seg>
        <seg id="23">I realized that by improving the artificial intelligence, task by task, dataset by dataset, I had created huge gaps, holes and gaps in what it could understand.</seg>
        <seg id="24">And in doing this, I have coded all kinds of prejudices.</seg>
        <seg id="25">Biases reflecting a limited vision, limited to a single set of data. Gaps that reflect human biases encoded in the data, such as bias and stereotypes.</seg>
        <seg id="26">I thought about the evolution of technology that led me to where I ended up then - how the first color photographs were calibrated to the skin of white women, which meant that color photographs were not adapted to dark faces.</seg>

        <seg id="10">One of my main principles is to help computers understand what it means to have such an experience, to understand what we share, what we believe in and what we feel, because then we will be ready to start involving computer technologies in complementary processes.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Going deeper, a few years ago I started helping computers write stories based on a series of images.</seg>
        <seg id="12">And one day during the course of work, I asked a computer what he thought about going to Australia.</seg>
        <seg id="13">He looked at the pictures and saw the koala.</seg>
        <seg id="14">He didn't know what a koala was, but said he thought it was a curious creature.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Then I shared with him a series of images of burning houses.</seg>
        <seg id="16">He looked at the pictures and said, "Amazing view! Great!"</seg>
        <seg id="17">I ran rattles around my back.</seg>
        <seg id="18">He looked at a terrible, life-destroying event and thought it was something positive.</seg>
        <seg id="19">I realized he recognized the contrasts, the shades of red and yellow, and thought it was worth a positive assessment.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Part of the reason he did it was because most of the images I gave him were positive.</seg>
        <seg id="21">Because people tend to share positive images when they talk about their experiences.</seg>
        <seg id="22">When was the last time you saw a selfie at a funeral?</seg>
        <seg id="23">I realized that by improving artificial intelligence, task by task, array by array, I created huge gaps, holes and gaps in what he could understand.</seg>
        <seg id="24">And in doing so, I encoded all sorts of prejudices.</seg>
        <seg id="25">Preconceptions that reflect limited vision, limited to a single set of data. Gaps that reflect human biases encoded in data, such as bias and stereotypes.</seg>
        <seg id="26">I thought about the evolution of technology that led me to where I was at that time  ⁇  how the first color photos were calibrated on the skin of white women, and therefore color photos were not adapted to dark faces.</seg>
        <seg id="27">And this same bias, the same gap was observed in the 90s.</seg>
        <seg id="28">And the same information gap we have today is in how well we can recognize diverse human faces with facial recognition technology.</seg>
        <seg id="29">I thought about the latest research, where we tend to limit our thinking to one set of data and one problem.</seg>
        <seg id="30">And in doing so, we created ever more gaps and biases that AI could develop even more strongly.</seg>
        <seg id="31">I realized that we need to think more about how the technologies we work with today will look in 5 and 10 years.</seg>
        <seg id="32">Humanity is evolving slowly, over time correcting problems in the interaction between humans and the environment.</seg>
        <seg id="33">Artificial intelligence, by contrast, is evolving at an incredible rate.</seg>
        <seg id="34">And that means it's really important to think about it carefully right now - to reflect on our own gaps, our own biases, and how it affects the technologies we create and discuss those that are modern in the future.</seg>
        <seg id="35">Top executives and scientists around the world are talking about what they think artificial intelligence will look like in the future.</seg>
        <seg id="36">Stephen Hawking warns: "AI can end humanity."</seg>
        <seg id="37">Elon Musk warns that this is one of the greatest existential risks our civilization has ever faced.</seg>
        <seg id="38">Bill Gates is perplexed: "I don't understand why people aren't concerned."</seg>
        <seg id="39">But these opinions are only part of history.</seg>
        <seg id="40">Mathematics, models, and the fundamental bricks of artificial intelligence are what we call access and what we work with.</seg>
        <seg id="41">We have open-source tools for machine learning and intelligence that we are willing to share.</seg>
        <seg id="42">And beyond that, we can share our experiences.</seg>
        <seg id="43">Share your knowledge about technology and how it bothers us and how it excites us.</seg>
        <seg id="44">We can discuss what we like.</seg>
        <seg id="45">We can foresee which aspects of technology will eventually become the most useful and which the most problematic.</seg>
        <seg id="46">If we all focus on an open dialogue about AI in the future, it will help create an atmosphere of shared awareness of what AI is now, what it can become, and what we need to do to get the best deal.</seg>
        <seg id="47">We already see and know all this about the technologies used today.</seg>
        <seg id="48">We use smartphones, digital assistants and vacuum cleaner robots.</seg>
        <seg id="49">Are they evil?</seg>
        <seg id="50">Maybe sometimes.</seg>
        <seg id="51">Are they useful?</seg>
        <seg id="52">Certainly.</seg>
        <seg id="53">And they are all different.</seg>
        <seg id="54">And in them you already see a ray of light illuminating our future.</seg>
        <seg id="55">The future starts with what we create and build right now.</seg>
        <seg id="56">We are launching the domino effect that will determine the path of AI development.</seg>
        <seg id="57">Right now we are shaping the AI of the future.</seg>
        <seg id="58">Technologies that immerse us in augmented realities bring past worlds back to life.</seg>
        <seg id="59">Technologies that help people share experiences when they have difficulty communicating.</seg>
        <seg id="60">Technologies based on understanding streaming visual worlds are used for unmanned vehicles.</seg>
        <seg id="61">Technologies based on image understanding and language generation are becoming technologies that help visually impaired people better access the visual world.</seg>
        <seg id="62">But we also see how technology can lead to problems.</seg>
        <seg id="63">Today, we have technologies that analyze our innate physical characteristics  ⁇  such as skin color or facial features  ⁇  to determine whether we can be criminals or terrorists.</seg>
        <seg id="64">We have technology analyzing data about us, even data such as gender or race, to determine if we can get credit.</seg>
        <seg id="65">All we see now is just one shot from the evolution of artificial intelligence.</seg>
        <seg id="66">Because where we are now is just the moment of this evolution.</seg>
        <seg id="67">This means that everything we do today will have an impact on our future.</seg>
        <seg id="68">If we want AI to evolve to help people, we need to identify the goals and strategies that will set that path now.</seg>
        <seg id="69">I'd like to see something that suits people well, blends with our culture and environment.</seg>
        <seg id="70">Technology that helps those of us who suffer from neurological or other diseases to make life equally difficult for everyone.</seg>

        <seg id="2">There are many ways to do this, but I like to help computers talk about what they see and understand.</seg>
        <seg id="3">For example, in this picture, a modern computer vision algorithm can recognize that this is a woman and this is a dog.</seg>

        <seg id="2">В ходе рабочего совещания, которое состоялось сегодня, 24 июля, в правительстве Иркутской области обсуждались основные направления развития отдаленных аграрных территорий.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Во время рабочих поездок по районам Усть-Ордынского Бурятского округа глава региона дал ряд поручений.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Сегодня мэры отчитались об их исполнении.</seg>
        <seg id="5">В первую очередь возобновлено строительство Дома спорта в Усть-Орде.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Поручение по этому объекту было дано Президентом РФ четырнадцать лет назад.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Но только сейчас ситуацию удалось сдвинуть с мертвой точки.</seg>
        <seg id="8">На строительство будет потрачено 866 миллионов рублей.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Срок сдачи сооружения 2022 год.</seg>
        <seg id="10">А уже в нынешнем году должна быть сдана в эксплуатацию школа в селе Баяндай.</seg>
        <seg id="11">На данный момент завершена отделка помещений.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Из оставшихся работ - благоустройство территории.</seg>
        <seg id="13">В целом программа строительства объектов дошкольного и среднего образования имеет особое значение для региона.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Для вашего округа - в особенности.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Демографическая ситуация здесь - лучшая в регионе.</seg>
        <seg id="16">И мы обязаны создать все условия для обучения и досуга детей всех возрастов, - отметил врио Губернатора Иркутской области Игорь Кобзев.</seg>
        <seg id="17">На совещании глава региона дал поручение всем мэрам активно включиться в работу по разработке генпланов населенных пунктов.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Это одно из главных условий комплексного развития округа.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Все населенные пункты должны иметь установленные границы и генеральный план.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Это необходимо для развития территории, для строительства социально значимых объектов, а также объектов инфраструктуры и культурного наследия, - подчеркнул глава региона.</seg>
        <seg id="21">Также в ходе беседы был поднят проблемный вопрос с сокращением приема молока у кооперативов на 30%.</seg>
        <seg id="22">Это произошло из-за перераспределения перерабатывающим предприятием закупа молока в пользу крестьянско-фермерских хозяйств.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Из-за этого доля приема продукции у кооперативов снизилась.</seg>
        <seg id="24">Глава региона поручил исполняющему обязанности министра сельского хозяйства выехать на место, изучить структуру реализации молока, проанализировать опыт других территорий и определить варианты решения проблемы.</seg>

        <seg id="4">Today the mayors reported on their fulfilment.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Firstly, House of Sport construction has resumed in Ust-Orda.</seg>
        <seg id="6">The Russian President gave instructions regarding this facility 14 years ago.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Only now has it been possible to bring it out of a dead end.</seg>
        <seg id="8">866 million rubles will be spent on construction.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Construction is to be completed in 2022.</seg>

        <seg id="21">During the conversation, the problematic issue of the 30% reduction in milk supplies received from cooperatives was raised.</seg>
        <seg id="22">This occurred due to the processing enterprise's redistribution of milk purchases in favor of peasant farms.</seg>
        <seg id="23">As a result, cooperatives' share of production decreased.</seg>
        <seg id="24">The head of the region instructed the acting agriculture minister to go to the location, study the structure of milk supplies, analyze the experience of other territories, and come up with ways to solve the problem.</seg>

        <seg id="1">Власти Подмосковья рассказали о судьбе закрытых свалок</seg>
        <seg id="2">В Подмосковье продолжают закрывать полигоны твердых бытовых отходов.</seg>
        <seg id="3">В этом году власти обещают ликвидировать последние.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Некоторые из 39 существовавших в области свалок модернизируются в современные мусороперерабатывающие комплексы.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Но такой вариант возможен не для каждого полигона - многие из них обросли плотной жилой застройкой.</seg>
        <seg id="6">После того как полигон закрывается, он встает на рекультивацию - тело полигона пересыпается грунтами, монтируются системы дегазации и отвода инфильтрата.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Это позволяет прекратить химические процессы внутри свалки, чтобы она не воспламенялась, не источала зловоние, не отравляла почву и грунтовые воды.</seg>
        <seg id="8">А потом бывшая свалка остается возвышаться бесполезной кучей среди обступившей ее жилой застройки.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Почему бы не сделать из нее что-нибудь полезное?</seg>
        <seg id="10">Например, в Рузе, где буквально на днях завершилась рекультивация полигона "Аннино", власти рассматривают вариант сделать из кучи горнолыжный склон.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Этот полигон, эксплуатировавшийся с 1976 по 2016 год, разросся так, что вышел за границы выделенной под него земли.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Поэтому при рекультивации пришлось выкупать соседние участки, де-факто давно уже забитые мусором под завязку.</seg>
        <seg id="13">"Какое-то время пройдет, полигон "подосядет", наберется крепости, и мы будем думать, что можно сделать, чтобы он начал приносить пользу.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Прямо в глаза бросается - горнолыжный курорт", - рассказал журналистам глава Рузского округа Николай Парфенов.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Два полигона станут площадками по добыче возобновляемых источников энергии</seg>
        <seg id="16">Полигоны "Торбеево" в Люберцах и "Тимохово" в Богородском округе станут площадками по добыче возобновляемых источников энергии из свалочного и биологического газов.</seg>
        <seg id="17">На территории "Торбеева" к концу года будет запущена газопоршневая электростанция, способная в год вырабатывать до 8 миллионов киловатт-часов электроэнергии и порядка 0,95 гигакалории тепловой энергии, которая обеспечит собственные нужды полигона - теплоснабжение административных и производственных помещений.</seg>
        <seg id="18">"Тимохово" будет производить 72,5 миллиона киловатт-часов и продолжит деятельность как мусороперерабатывающий комплекс.</seg>
        <seg id="19">А на балашихинском полигоне "Кучино", который был закрыт после жалоб жителей на "Прямой линии" с президентом страны, может быть создан музей.</seg>
        <seg id="20">"Была такая идея - создать музей рекультивации полигонов Подмосковья", - сообщил зампред правительства - министр экологии и природопользования области Дмитрий Куракин.</seg>

        <seg id="2">The process of closing solid waste landfill sites continues in areas around Moscow.</seg>
        <seg id="3">The authorities promise to close the rest ones this year.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Some of the 39 existing dumps are being upgraded to modern garbage processing facilities.</seg>
        <seg id="5">But not every solid waste landfill site is suitable for this – some are within densely constructed residential areas.</seg>
        <seg id="6">After a landfill site is closed, it is subject to reclamation – it is covered with soil, and decontamination and infiltration drainage systems are monitored.</seg>
        <seg id="7">This allows chemical processes within the dump to be halted, so that it will not burn or stink, or contaminate the earth and groundwater.</seg>
        <seg id="8">The former garbage dump then remains a raised, useless heap amid residential buildings.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Why not make something useful out of it?</seg>
        <seg id="10">For example, in Ruza, where literally days ago reclamation of the Annino landfill site was completed, the authorities are considering turning the heap into a ski slope.</seg>
        <seg id="11">This landfill, used from 1976 through 2016, has grown beyond its originally set boundaries.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Reclamation demanded buying up surrounding land plots that long ago were subsumed by garbage heaps.</seg>
        <seg id="13">"After a while, the landfill will settle and harden, and we will think about what we can do to make it useful.</seg>
        <seg id="14">It hits you in the face – a ski resort," said Ruza district head Nikoloai Parfyonov.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Two landfills will become renewable energy source extraction sites</seg>
        <seg id="16">The Torbeyevo landfill in Lyubertsy and the Timokhovo landfill in Bogorod district will become sites for the extraction of renewable energy from garbage and biological gases.</seg>
        <seg id="17">On the Torbeyevo territory, by the end of the year a gas piston power plant will open, capable of producing up to 8 million kilowatt-hours of electrical energy and about 0.95 gigacalories of thermal power per year, which will provide for the landfill site's future needs – providing heating for administrative and industrial premises.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Timokhovo will produce 72.5 million kilowatt-hours and continue to function as a waste processing facility.</seg>
        <seg id="19">And at Balashikha's Kuchino landfill, which was closed after residents' complaints via the Direct Line with the country's president, a museum might be created.</seg>
        <seg id="20">"There was such an idea – create a Moscow area landfill reclamation museum," said the deputy prime minister and minister of ecology and nature management for the region, Dmitry Kurakin.</seg>

        <seg id="2">Врио губернатора Хабаровского края Михаил Дегтярев впервые после назначения вышел к участникам акций в поддержку арестованного экс-главы региона Сергея Фургала.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Трансляция встречи прошла на его странице в Instagram.</seg>
        <seg id="4">"Москва слышит всех, поэтому прислала вам врио, чтобы регион не скатился без власти... Про Фургала еще раз повторяю: он "а" - мой товарищ, "б" - однопартиец, "ц" - я очень переживаю за его судьбу, партия оказывает ему помощь, передает ему продукты, Жириновский во все кабинеты стучится", - заявил врио губернатора</seg>
        <seg id="5">По словам Дегтярева, сейчас Хабаровский край не может оставаться без руководителя, поэтому он указом президента Владимира Путина был назначен на должность главы региона, чтобы "замечательное здание (правительство края) функционировало, все работало, бюджет тратился на социальные нужды".</seg>
        <seg id="6">Врио губернатора объяснил, что не выходил к протестующим раньше, потому что не может общаться с тысячами демонстрантов.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Поэтому он проводит трансляции в соцсетях и читает все комментарии к ним.</seg>
        <seg id="8">25 июля в Хабаровске прошли две подряд акции протеста.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Митинги в поддержку бывшего губернатора проходят в регионе с 11 июля.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Накануне очередной акции Михаил Дегтярев заявил, что уедет из города в день митинга.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Его кортеж остановили протестующие и призвали высказаться о судьбе арестованного экс-губернатора Фургала.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Дегтярев ранее отказался выходить к участникам акций.</seg>
        <seg id="13">"Тут есть чем заняться на самом деле руководителю, чем выходить и общаться с теми, кто кричат под окнами", - говорил врио губернатора.</seg>

        <seg id="2">Mikhail Degtyarev, acting governor of Khabarovsky Krai, spoke with participants of protests in support of the former head of the region, Sergei Furgal, who was arrested, for the first time.</seg>
        <seg id="3">A live feed of the meeting was posted on his Instagram page.</seg>
        <seg id="4">"Moscow hears all of you. That's why they sent you a replacement — so that the region doesn't come apart without leadership... Regarding Furgal, I'll say again: he's, A, my comrade; B, in the same party as me; C, I'm very concerned about what will happen with him. The party is helping him, giving him food, and Zhirinovsky is knocking on the door of every office," the active governor announced.</seg>
        <seg id="5">According to Degtyarev, Khabarovsky Krai can't be left without a leader right now, which is why he was appointed as head of the region by the order of President Vladimir Putin — so that the "wondrous building (the regional government) operates, everything works, and the budget is spent on social needs."</seg>
        <seg id="6">The acting governor explained that he hadn't previously spoken with protesters because he couldn't have a conversation with thousands of demonstrators.</seg>
        <seg id="7">That's why he runs live steams via social media and reads all the comments written to him.</seg>
        <seg id="8">On July 25 in Khabarovsk two protests were held one after the other.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Demonstrations supporting the ex-governor have been ongoing in the region since July 11.</seg>
        <seg id="10">On the eve of one such demonstration, Mikhail Degtyarev announced that he would be leaving the city on the day of the protest.</seg>
        <seg id="11">His motorcade was stopped by protesters who called on him to share his opinion on the fate of arrested ex-governor Furgal.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Degtyarev had earlier declined to speak with demonstration participants.</seg>
        <seg id="13">"A leader has other things to do than to go out and talk with people screaming under his window," the acting governor said.</seg>

        <seg id="1">Сегодня я хотел бы вам показать как в будущем мы будем делать разные вещи.</seg>
        <seg id="2">Я верю, что скоро наши здания и машины будут самособирающимися, будут воспроизводить и чинить сами себя.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Итак, я собираюсь вам показать что я считаю текущей стадией промышленного развития, а затем сравнить это с некоторыми природными системами.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Итак, на текущей стадии промышленного развития у нас есть небоскребы - 2,5 года, от 500 000 до миллиона частей, достаточно сложные, новые потрясающие технологии в стали, бетоне и стекле.</seg>
        <seg id="5">У нас есть восхитительные машины которые могут доставить нас в космос - 5 лет, 2,5 миллиона частей.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Но с другой стороны, если посмотреть на природные системы, мы видим белки двух миллионов видов, которые могут собираться за 10 000 наносекунд, или цепочку ДНК с тремя миллиардами основных пар, которую мы можем скопировать где-то за час.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Итак, природные системы при всей их сложности чрезвычайно эффективны, куда более эффективны, чем все, что мы можем построить, куда более сложные, чем все, что мы можем построить.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Они гораздо более эффективны с точки зрения энергии.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Они почти никогда не ошибаются.</seg>
        <seg id="10">И они могут восстанавливать себя в течение долгой жизни.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Итак, в природных системах есть кое-что очень интересное.</seg>
        <seg id="12">И если мы сможем перенести это в нашу рукотворную среду, у нашего способа создавать вещи появится потрясающий потенциал.</seg>
        <seg id="13">И я думаю, что ключ - это самосборка.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Итак, если мы хотим использовать самосборку в нашей физической среде, я думаю, нужно учесть четыре ключевых фактора.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Первый: нужно расшифровать всю сложность того, что мы хотим построить - наших зданий и машин.</seg>
        <seg id="16">И нужно разложить их в простую последовательность - базовую ДНК процессов строительства.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Затем нам потребуются програмируемые части, которые смогут понять эту последовательность и использовать ее, чтобы свернуться или пересобраться.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Нам понадобится какое-то количество энергии, которое позволит все это активировать, сделает части способными собираться по программе.</seg>
        <seg id="19">И нам нужна какая-то резервная система исправления ошибок, чтобы гарантировать успешную постройку того, что мы хотим.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Я собираюсь показать вам несколько проектов, над которыми мы с коллегами из ЭмАйТи работаем, чтобы достичь этого самособирающегося будущего.</seg>
        <seg id="21">Первые два - МакроБот и ДециБот.</seg>
        <seg id="22">Это проекты - крупномасштабные реконфигурируемые роботы - 2,5 и 3,5 метровые белки.</seg>
        <seg id="23">В них встроены механические электрические устройства, сенсоры.</seg>
        <seg id="24">Ты расписываешь то, во что нужно свернуться, в последовательность углов - минус 120, минус 120, 0, 0, 120, минус 120 - что-то вроде этого; последовательность углов или поворотов, и ты посылаешь эту последовательность по шнуру.</seg>
        <seg id="25">Каждый блок получает свое сообщение - минус 120. Он поворачивается на этот угол, проверяет, все ли правильно и передает информацию соседу.</seg>
        <seg id="26">А это блестящие ученые, инженеры, дизайнеры, которые работали над этим проектом.</seg>
        <seg id="27">И я думаю, это на самом деле выявляет вопрос: возможны ли здесь другие масштабы?</seg>
        <seg id="28">Я имею ввиду, тысячи долларов, множество человеко-часов для того, чтобы сделать этого 2,5 метрового робота.</seg>
        <seg id="29">Сможем ли мы на самом деле увеличить масштаб? Сможем ли в действительности встроить робототехнику в каждую часть?</seg>
        <seg id="30">Следующий проект решает этот вопрос, рассматривает пассивный характер или пытается получить модификационную програмируемость пассивно.</seg>
        <seg id="31">Но он идет на шаг дальше и пытается получить настоящее вычисление.</seg>
        <seg id="32">В основе своей он имеет самый фундаментальный строительный блок вычислений, логический элемент цифровой интегральной схемы напрямую в каждой части.</seg>
        <seg id="33">Это элемент «И-НЕ».</seg>
        <seg id="34">У вас есть один тетраэдр - элемент, который будет делать все вычисления, и два тетраэдра для ввода.</seg>
        <seg id="35">Один для ввода информации пользователем, это так , как вы кладете кирпичи.</seg>
        <seg id="36">Другой для информации от предыдущего уложенного кирпича.</seg>
        <seg id="37">И затем он выводит информацию в трёхмерном пространстве.</seg>
        <seg id="38">Итак, это значит, что пользователь может начать запуск перемещения кирпичей в нужном направлении.</seg>
        <seg id="39">Его вычисления строятся на том, что было сделано ранее и на том, что вы ему сказали сделать.</seg>
        <seg id="40">А теперь он начинает двигаться в трехмерном пространстве - вверх или вниз.</seg>
        <seg id="41">С левой стороны, [1,1] ввод равняется 0 на выходе, перемещение вниз.</seg>
        <seg id="42">С правой стороны, [0,0] ввод это 1 на выходе, что означает движение вверх.</seg>
        <seg id="43">И что действительно важно, наши структуры теперь содержат чертежи того, что мы хотим построить.</seg>
        <seg id="44">В них встроена вся информация о том, что было построено.</seg>
        <seg id="45">Итак, это означает, что у нас есть некая форма самовоспроизводства.</seg>
        <seg id="46">В данном случае я называю это самоуправляемым воспроизводством, потому что структуры содержат четкие чертежи.</seg>
        <seg id="47">Если появляются ошибки, вы можете заменить часть.</seg>
        <seg id="48">Вся местная информация сохраняется, чтобы вы знали, как ее исправить.</seg>
        <seg id="49">Таким образом, у вас может быть что-то, что перемещается и считывает информацию и может передавать ее от одной части к другой.</seg>
        <seg id="50">Оно встроено напрямую внутрь, без внешнего управления.</seg>
        <seg id="51">Последний проект, который я вам покажу называется Смещенные Цепи, и это возможно самый захватывающий пример того, что у нас есть сейчас из пассивных самособирающихся систем.</seg>
        <seg id="52">Он сочетает в себе возможность реконфигурации и програмирования и создает полностью пассивную систему.</seg>
        <seg id="53">В основе мы имеем цепь элементов.</seg>
        <seg id="54">Все элементы полностью идентичны, и смещены.</seg>
        <seg id="55">Таким образом, каждая цепь или каждый элемент хочет повернуться направо или налево.</seg>
        <seg id="56">И когда вы собираете цепь, вы по сути програмируете ее.</seg>
        <seg id="57">Вы говорите каждому блоку куда он должен повернуться: направо или налево.</seg>
        <seg id="58">Поэтому когда вы трясете цепь, он сворачивается в ту конфигурацию, которую вы запрограммировали - в этом случае в спираль, или в этом - два куба рядом друг с другом.</seg>
        <seg id="59">Так в общем вы можете программировать любую трёхмерную форму - или одномерную, двухмерную - из этих абсолютно пассивных цепей.</seg>
        <seg id="60">Итак, что это говорит нам о будущем?</seg>
        <seg id="61">Я думаю, это говорит нам, что для самосборки, репликации, ремонта в наших физических структурах, зданиях, машинах, есть новые возможности.</seg>
        <seg id="62">В этих частях возможна новая программность.</seg>
        <seg id="63">И отсюда, у вас появляются новые возможности в вычислениях.</seg>
        <seg id="64">У нас будут пространственные компьютеры.</seg>
        <seg id="65">Представьте, что наши здания, мосты, машины, все наши кирпичи могли бы производить вычисления.</seg>
        <seg id="66">Это удивительная параллель и распределенная сила вычиления, новые возможности дизайна.</seg>
        <seg id="67">Это невероятный потенциал.</seg>
        <seg id="68">Я думаю, что проекты, которые я вам показал, лишь небольшой шаг к будущему, если мы внедрим эти новые технологии, к новому самособирающемуся будущему.</seg>
        <seg id="69">Спасибо.</seg>

    <ref lang="en" translator="A">
      <p>
        <seg id="1">Today I'd like to show you the future of the way we make things.</seg>
        <seg id="2">I believe that soon our buildings and machines will be self-assembling, replicating and repairing themselves.</seg>
        <seg id="3">So I'm going to show you what I believe is the current state of manufacturing, and then compare that to some natural systems.</seg>
        <seg id="4">So in the current state of manufacturing, we have skyscrapers -- two and a half years [of assembly time], 500,000 to a million parts, fairly complex, new, exciting technologies in steel, concrete, glass.</seg>
        <seg id="5">We have exciting machines that can take us into space -- five years [of assembly time], 2.5 million parts.</seg>
        <seg id="6">But on the other side, if you look at the natural systems, we have proteins that have two million types, can fold in 10,000 nanoseconds, or DNA with three billion base pairs we can replicate in roughly an hour.</seg>
        <seg id="7">So there's all of this complexity in our natural systems, but they're extremely efficient, far more efficient than anything we can build, far more complex than anything we can build.</seg>
        <seg id="8">They're far more efficient in terms of energy.</seg>
        <seg id="9">They hardly ever make mistakes.</seg>
        <seg id="10">And they can repair themselves for longevity.</seg>
        <seg id="11">So there's something super interesting about natural systems.</seg>
        <seg id="12">And if we can translate that into our built environment, then there's some exciting potential for the way that we build things.</seg>
        <seg id="13">And I think the key to that is self-assembly.</seg>
        <seg id="14">So if we want to utilize self-assembly in our physical environment, I think there's four key factors.</seg>
        <seg id="15">The first is that we need to decode all of the complexity of what we want to build -- so our buildings and machines.</seg>
        <seg id="16">And we need to decode that into simple sequences -- basically the DNA of how our buildings work.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Then we need programmable parts that can take that sequence and use that to fold up, or reconfigure.</seg>
        <seg id="18">We need some energy that's going to allow that to activate, allow our parts to be able to fold up from the program.</seg>
        <seg id="19">And we need some type of error correction redundancy to guarantee that we have successfully built what we want.</seg>
        <seg id="20">So I'm going to show you a number of projects that my colleagues and I at MIT are working on to achieve this self-assembling future.</seg>
        <seg id="21">The first two are the MacroBot and DeciBot.</seg>
        <seg id="22">So these projects are large-scale reconfigurable robots -- 8 ft., 12 ft. long proteins.</seg>
        <seg id="23">They're embedded with mechanical electrical devices, sensors.</seg>
        <seg id="24">You decode what you want to fold up into, into a sequence of angles -- so negative 120, negative 120, 0, 0, 120, negative 120 -- something like that; so a sequence of angles, or turns, and you send that sequence through the string.</seg>
        <seg id="25">Each unit takes its message -- so negative 120 -- it rotates to that, checks if it got there and then passes it to its neighbor.</seg>
        <seg id="26">So these are the brilliant scientists, engineers, designers that worked on this project.</seg>
        <seg id="27">And I think it really brings to light: Is this really scalable?</seg>
        <seg id="28">I mean, thousands of dollars, lots of man hours made to make this eight-foot robot.</seg>
        <seg id="29">Can we really scale this up? Can we really embed robotics into every part?</seg>
        <seg id="30">The next one questions that and looks at passive nature, or passively trying to have reconfiguration programmability.</seg>
        <seg id="31">But it goes a step further, and it tries to have actual computation.</seg>
        <seg id="32">It basically embeds the most fundamental building block of computing, the digital logic gate, directly into your parts.</seg>
        <seg id="33">So this is a NAND gate.</seg>
        <seg id="34">You have one tetrahedron which is the gate that's going to do your computing, and you have two input tetrahedrons.</seg>
        <seg id="35">One of them is the input from the user, as you're building your bricks.</seg>
        <seg id="36">The other one is from the previous brick that was placed.</seg>
        <seg id="37">And then it gives you an output in 3D space.</seg>
        <seg id="38">So what this means is that the user can start plugging in what they want the bricks to do.</seg>
        <seg id="39">It computes on what it was doing before and what you said you wanted it to do.</seg>
        <seg id="40">And now it starts moving in three-dimensional space -- so up or down.</seg>
        <seg id="41">So on the left-hand side, [1,1] input equals 0 output, which goes down.</seg>
        <seg id="42">On the right-hand side, [0,0] input is a 1 output, which goes up.</seg>
        <seg id="43">And so what that really means is that our structures now contain the blueprints of what we want to build.</seg>
        <seg id="44">So they have all of the information embedded in them of what was constructed.</seg>
        <seg id="45">So that means that we can have some form of self-replication.</seg>
        <seg id="46">In this case I call it self-guided replication, because your structure contains the exact blueprints.</seg>
        <seg id="47">If you have errors, you can replace a part.</seg>
        <seg id="48">All the local information is embedded to tell you how to fix it.</seg>
        <seg id="49">So you could have something that climbs along and reads it and can output at one to one.</seg>
        <seg id="50">It's directly embedded; there's no external instructions.</seg>
        <seg id="51">So the last project I'll show is called Biased Chains, and it's probably the most exciting example that we have right now of passive self-assembly systems.</seg>
        <seg id="52">So it takes the reconfigurability and programmability and makes it a completely passive system.</seg>
        <seg id="53">So basically you have a chain of elements.</seg>
        <seg id="54">Each element is completely identical, and they're biased.</seg>
        <seg id="55">So each chain, or each element, wants to turn right or left.</seg>
        <seg id="56">So as you assemble the chain, you're basically programming it.</seg>
        <seg id="57">You're telling each unit if it should turn right or left.</seg>
        <seg id="58">So when you shake the chain, it then folds up into any configuration that you've programmed in -- so in this case, a spiral, or in this case, two cubes next to each other.</seg>
        <seg id="59">So you can basically program any three-dimensional shape -- or one-dimensional, two-dimensional -- up into this chain completely passively.</seg>
        <seg id="60">So what does this tell us about the future?</seg>
        <seg id="61">I think that it's telling us that there's new possibilities for self-assembly, replication, repair in our physical structures, our buildings, machines.</seg>
        <seg id="62">There's new programmability in these parts.</seg>
        <seg id="63">And from that you have new possibilities for computing.</seg>
        <seg id="64">We'll have spatial computing.</seg>
        <seg id="65">Imagine if our buildings, our bridges, machines, all of our bricks could actually compute.</seg>
        <seg id="66">That's amazing parallel and distributed computing power, new design possibilities.</seg>
        <seg id="67">So it's exciting potential for this.</seg>
        <seg id="68">So I think these projects I've showed here are just a tiny step towards this future, if we implement these new technologies for a new self-assembling world.</seg>
        <seg id="69">Thank you.</seg>

        <seg id="2">I believe that soon our buildings and machines will be self-assembling, reproducing and repairing themselves.</seg>
        <seg id="3">So I'm going to show you what I think the current stage of industrial development is, and then compare it to some natural systems.</seg>

        <seg id="6">But on the other hand, if we look at natural systems, we see proteins of two million species that can assemble in 10,000 nanoseconds, or a DNA strand with three billion base pairs that we can copy in about an hour.</seg>
        <seg id="7">So natural systems, for all their complexity, are extremely efficient, far more efficient than anything we can build, far more complex than anything we can build.</seg>
        <seg id="8">They are much more energy efficient.</seg>
        <seg id="9">They are almost never wrong.</seg>
        <seg id="10">And they can repair themselves over a long lifetime.</seg>
        <seg id="11">So there is something very interesting about natural systems.</seg>
        <seg id="12">And if we can translate that into our built environment, our way of making things has tremendous potential.</seg>

        <seg id="19">And we need some kind of back-up error correction system to ensure that we can successfully build what we want.</seg>
        <seg id="20">I'm going to show you some of the projects that my colleagues and I at MIT are working on to achieve this self-assembling future.</seg>

        <seg id="23">They are embedded with mechanical electrical devices and sensors.</seg>
        <seg id="24">You draw what you need to fold into a sequence of angles - minus 120, minus 120, 0, 0, 120, minus 120 - something like that; a sequence of angles or turns, and you send that sequence down the cord.</seg>
        <seg id="25">Each block receives its message - minus 120. It turns to this corner, checks if everything is correct and transmits the information to the neighbor.</seg>
        <seg id="26">And these are the brilliant scientists, engineers and designers who worked on this project.</seg>
        <seg id="27">And I think that really brings up the question: Is there a different scale here?</seg>
        <seg id="28">I mean, thousands of dollars, a lot of man hours to make this 2.5 meter robot.</seg>
        <seg id="29">Can we really scale up? Can we really build robotics into every part?</seg>
        <seg id="30">The next project addresses this issue, considering the passive nature or trying to get the modification programmability passively.</seg>
        <seg id="31">But he goes a step further and tries to get a real calculation.</seg>
        <seg id="32">At its core, it has the most fundamental building block of computing, the logic element of a digital integrated circuit directly in every part.</seg>
        <seg id="33">This is the "AND-NOT" element.</seg>
        <seg id="34">You have one tetrahedron, the element that will do all the calculations, and two tetrahedrons for input.</seg>
        <seg id="35">One for user input, that's how you lay bricks.</seg>
        <seg id="36">Another for information from the previous brick laid.</seg>
        <seg id="37">And then it displays the information in three-dimensional space.</seg>
        <seg id="38">So, this means that the user can start moving the bricks in the right direction.</seg>
        <seg id="39">His calculations are based on what has been done before and what you have told him to do.</seg>
        <seg id="40">And now he begins to move in three-dimensional space - up or down.</seg>
        <seg id="41">On the left side, [1,1] input equals 0 output, moving down.</seg>
        <seg id="42">On the right side, [0,0] input is 1 on the output, which means upward movement.</seg>
        <seg id="43">And what is really important is that our structures now contain the blueprints of what we want to build.</seg>
        <seg id="44">They contain all the information about what has been built.</seg>
        <seg id="45">So this means that we have some form of self-replication.</seg>
        <seg id="46">In this case, I call it self-directed reproduction because the structures contain clear blueprints.</seg>
        <seg id="47">If errors occur, you can replace the part.</seg>
        <seg id="48">All local information is saved so you know how to fix it.</seg>
        <seg id="49">So you can have something that moves and reads information and can transmit it from one part to another.</seg>
        <seg id="50">It's built right in, with no external controls.</seg>
        <seg id="51">The last project I'm going to show you is called Displaced Circuits, and it's probably the most exciting example we have right now of passive self-assembling systems.</seg>
        <seg id="52">It combines the ability to reconfigure and program and creates a completely passive system.</seg>
        <seg id="53">Basically, we have a chain of elements.</seg>
        <seg id="54">All the elements are completely identical, and offset.</seg>
        <seg id="55">So every circuit or every element wants to turn right or left.</seg>
        <seg id="56">And when you assemble a circuit, you're essentially programming it.</seg>
        <seg id="57">You tell each block which way it should turn: right or left.</seg>
        <seg id="58">So when you shake the chain, it folds into whatever configuration you've programmed - in this case, a spiral, or in this case, two cubes next to each other.</seg>
        <seg id="59">So basically you can program any three-dimensional shape - or one-dimensional, two-dimensional - out of these completely passive circuits.</seg>
        <seg id="60">So what does this tell us about the future?</seg>
        <seg id="61">I think it tells us that there are new opportunities for self-assembly, replication, repair in our physical structures, buildings, machines.</seg>
        <seg id="62">New programming is possible in these parts.</seg>
        <seg id="63">And from there, you have new possibilities in computing.</seg>
        <seg id="64">We will have spatial computers.</seg>
        <seg id="65">Imagine if our buildings, our bridges, our cars, all of our bricks could compute.</seg>
        <seg id="66">It's an amazing parallel and distributed scrubbing power, new design possibilities.</seg>
        <seg id="67">This is an incredible potential.</seg>
        <seg id="68">I think that the projects that I have shown you are just a small step towards the future, if we implement these new technologies, towards a new self-assembling future.</seg>
        <seg id="69">Thank you.</seg>

        <seg id="1">Today, I would like to show you how we're going to do different things in the future.</seg>
        <seg id="2">I believe that soon our buildings and cars will be self-assembling, reproducing and mending themselves.</seg>
        <seg id="3">So, I'm going to show you what I think is the current stage of industrial development and then compare it to some natural systems.</seg>
        <seg id="4">So, in the current stage of industrial development, we have skyscrapers - 2.5 years, 500,000 to a million pieces, sophisticated enough, awesome new technologies in steel, concrete and glass.</seg>
        <seg id="5">We have amazing machines that can get us into space - 5 years, 2.5 million parts.</seg>
        <seg id="6">But on the other hand, if you look at natural systems, we see proteins of two million species that can gather in 10,000 nanoseconds, or a DNA chain with three billion major pairs that we can copy somewhere in an hour.</seg>
        <seg id="7">So, natural systems for all their complexity are extremely efficient, far more efficient than anything we can build, far more complex than anything we can build.</seg>
        <seg id="8">They are much more energy efficient.</seg>
        <seg id="9">They are almost never wrong.</seg>
        <seg id="10">And they can rebuild themselves over a long life.</seg>
        <seg id="11">So, there's something very interesting about natural systems.</seg>
        <seg id="12">And if we can carry that into our man-made environment, our way of creating things will have tremendous potential.</seg>
        <seg id="13">And I think the key is self-assembly.</seg>
        <seg id="14">So, if we want to use self-assembly in our physical environment, I think we need to consider four key factors.</seg>
        <seg id="15">One: we need to decipher the complexity of what we want to build - our buildings and machines.</seg>
        <seg id="16">And you need to decompose them into a simple sequence - the basic DNA of construction processes.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Then we'll need the spreadable pieces that can understand that sequence and use it to curl up or reassemble.</seg>
        <seg id="18">We're going to need some amount of energy that will enable all of this to activate, make the parts capable of being collected under the program.</seg>
        <seg id="19">And we need some kind of backup bug-fixing system to ensure that we can successfully build what we want.</seg>
        <seg id="20">I'm going to show you some of the projects that my colleagues at Emaiti and I are working on to achieve this self-gathering future.</seg>
        <seg id="21">The first two are Macrobot and Decibot.</seg>
        <seg id="22">These are projects - large-scale reconfigurable robots - 2.5 and 3.5 metre squirrels.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Mechanical electrical devices, sensors are built into them.</seg>
        <seg id="24">You paint what you need to curl into, into a sequence of angles - minus 120, minus 120, 0, 0, 120, minus 120 - something like that; a sequence of angles or turns, and you send this one sequence by cord.</seg>
        <seg id="25">Each unit gets its message - minus 120. He turns to that corner, checks to see if everything is right and passes the information to the neighbor.</seg>
        <seg id="26">And these are brilliant scientists, engineers, designers who worked on this project.</seg>
        <seg id="27">And I think it actually brings out the question: Are other scales possible here?</seg>
        <seg id="28">I mean, thousands of dollars, lots of man-hours to make this 2.5 meter robot.</seg>
        <seg id="29">Will we actually be able to zoom in? Can you really build robotics into every part?</seg>
        <seg id="30">The next project resolves this issue, considers a passive nature, or attempts to obtain modification program passively.</seg>
        <seg id="31">But it goes a step further and tries to get a real computation.</seg>
        <seg id="32">At its core, it has the most fundamental building block of computing, the logical element of a digital integrated circuit directly in each part.</seg>

        <seg id="39">His calculations are built on what was done earlier and on what you told him to do.</seg>
        <seg id="40">And now it's starting to move in three-dimensional space - up or down.</seg>
        <seg id="41">On the left side, [1,1] input is 0 at the exit, moving down.</seg>
        <seg id="42">On the right side, [0,0] input is 1 on the output, which means moving up.</seg>
        <seg id="43">And crucially, our structures now contain blueprints of what we want to build.</seg>
        <seg id="44">They have all the information built into them about what was built.</seg>
        <seg id="45">So, that means we have some form of self-reproduction.</seg>
        <seg id="46">In this case, I call it self-directed reproduction because the structures contain clear blueprints.</seg>
        <seg id="47">If errors appear, you can replace the part.</seg>
        <seg id="48">All local information is saved so you know how to fix it.</seg>
        <seg id="49">So you may have something that moves and reads information and can transmit it from one part to another.</seg>
        <seg id="50">It is built directly inside, without external control.</seg>
        <seg id="51">The last project I'll show you is called Offset Chains, and this may be the most exciting example of what we have now of passive self-assembling systems.</seg>
        <seg id="52">It combines the ability to reconfigure and graph and creates a fully passive system.</seg>
        <seg id="53">At the core we have a chain of elements.</seg>
        <seg id="54">All elements are completely identical, and offset.</seg>
        <seg id="55">So every chain or every element wants to turn right or left.</seg>
        <seg id="56">And when you put together a chain, you essentially program it.</seg>
        <seg id="57">You tell each block where it should turn: right or left.</seg>
        <seg id="58">So when you shake the chain, it collapses into the configuration you programmed - in which case into a spiral, or in this case - two cubes next to each other.</seg>
        <seg id="59">So in general you can program any three-dimensional form - or one-dimensional, two-dimensional - out of these absolutely passive chains.</seg>
        <seg id="60">So what does that tell us about the future?</seg>
        <seg id="61">I think it tells us that for self-assembly, replication, repair in our physical structures, buildings, machines, there are new possibilities.</seg>

        <seg id="36">Another for information from the previous brick laid.</seg>
        <seg id="37">And then it displays information in three-dimensional space.</seg>
        <seg id="38">So, this means that the user can start moving the bricks in the right direction.</seg>
        <seg id="39">His calculations are based on what was done before and what you told him to do.</seg>
        <seg id="40">And now it starts to move in three-dimensional space - up or down.</seg>
        <seg id="41">On the left side, [1.1] the input equals 0 at the output, moving down.</seg>
        <seg id="42">On the right side, [0.0] the input is 1 at the output, which means moving upwards.</seg>
        <seg id="43">And what really matters is that our structures now contain blueprints of what we want to build.</seg>
        <seg id="44">They contain all the information about what was built.</seg>
        <seg id="45">So, it means that we have some form of self-reproduction.</seg>
        <seg id="46">In this case, I call it self-directed reproduction because the structures contain clear drawings.</seg>
        <seg id="47">If there are errors, you can replace the part.</seg>
        <seg id="48">All local information is stored so you know how to fix it.</seg>
        <seg id="49">So you may have something that moves and reads information and can transfer it from one part to another.</seg>
        <seg id="50">It is built directly inside, without external control.</seg>
        <seg id="51">The last project I will show you is called Displaced Chains, and this is perhaps the most exciting example of what we now have of passive self-assembling systems.</seg>
        <seg id="52">It combines the ability to reconfigure and program and creates a completely passive system.</seg>
        <seg id="53">At the core, we have a chain of elements.</seg>
        <seg id="54">All elements are completely identical, and displaced.</seg>
        <seg id="55">So every chain or every element wants to turn right or left.</seg>
        <seg id="56">And when you assemble a chain, you essentially program it.</seg>
        <seg id="57">You tell each block where it should turn: right or left.</seg>
        <seg id="58">So when you shake the chain, it rolls into the configuration you have programmed - in this case a spiral, or in this case two cubes next to each other.</seg>
        <seg id="59">So in general, you can program any three-dimensional form - or one-dimensional, two-dimensional - of these completely passive circuits.</seg>
        <seg id="60">So, what does this tell us about the future?</seg>
        <seg id="61">I think this tells us that there are new opportunities for self-assembly, replication, and repair in our physical structures, buildings, and machines.</seg>
        <seg id="62">New software is possible in these parts.</seg>
        <seg id="63">And from here, you have new opportunities in computing.</seg>
        <seg id="64">We will have space computers.</seg>
        <seg id="65">Imagine our buildings, bridges, cars, all our bricks could do the calculations.</seg>
        <seg id="66">This is an amazing parallel and distributed cleaning force, new design possibilities.</seg>
        <seg id="67">This is an incredible potential.</seg>
        <seg id="68">I think the projects I have shown you are only a small step towards the future, if we introduce these new technologies, towards a new self-assembled future.</seg>

        <seg id="1">Today I'd like to show you how we're going to do different things in the future.</seg>
        <seg id="2">I believe that soon our buildings and cars will be self-assembling, will reproduce and repair themselves.</seg>
        <seg id="3">So, I'm going to show you what I think the current stage of industrial development is, and then compare that to some natural systems.</seg>
        <seg id="4">So, in the current stage of industrial development, we have skyscrapers - 2.5 years, 500,000 to a million parts, quite sophisticated, new amazing technologies in steel, concrete and glass.</seg>
        <seg id="5">We have amazing machines that can get us into space - 5 years, 2.5 million parts.</seg>
        <seg id="6">But on the other hand, if you look at natural systems, we see proteins of two million species that can assemble in 10,000 nanoseconds, or a DNA strand with three billion base pairs that we can replicate in about an hour.</seg>
        <seg id="7">So, natural systems, for all their complexity, are extremely efficient, far more efficient than anything we can build, far more complex than anything we can build.</seg>
        <seg id="8">They are much more energy efficient.</seg>
        <seg id="9">They almost never make mistakes.</seg>
        <seg id="10">And they can rebuild themselves over a long lifetime.</seg>
        <seg id="11">So, there's something very interesting about natural systems.</seg>
        <seg id="12">And if we can transfer that to our man-made environment, our way of creating things has amazing potential.</seg>
        <seg id="13">And I think the key is self-assembly.</seg>
        <seg id="14">So, if we want to use self-assembly in our physical environment, I think there are four key factors to consider.</seg>
        <seg id="15">One, we have to decipher the complexity of what we want to build-our buildings and machines.</seg>
        <seg id="16">And we need to break them down into a simple sequence-the basic DNA of the building processes.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Then we will need programmable parts that can understand that sequence and use it to collapse or reassemble.</seg>
        <seg id="18">We're going to need some amount of energy to activate it all, to make the parts able to assemble according to the program.</seg>
        <seg id="19">And we need some kind of back-up error correction system to guarantee the successful construction of what we want.</seg>
        <seg id="20">I'm going to show you some of the projects that my colleagues at M&amp;T and I are working on to achieve this self-assembling future.</seg>
        <seg id="21">The first two are MacroBot and DeciBot.</seg>
        <seg id="22">These projects are large-scale reconfigurable robots - 2.5 and 3.5 meter squirrels.</seg>
        <seg id="23">They have built-in mechanical electrical devices, sensors.</seg>
        <seg id="24">You write out what you need to curl into a sequence of angles - minus 120, minus 120, 0, 0, 120, minus 120 - something like that; a sequence of angles or turns, and you send that sequence over a cord.</seg>
        <seg id="25">Each unit gets its own message - minus 120. It turns that angle, checks to see if everything is correct, and sends the information to its neighbor.</seg>
        <seg id="26">And these are the brilliant scientists, engineers, designers who worked on this project.</seg>
        <seg id="27">And I think that really brings out the question: are other scales possible here?</seg>
        <seg id="28">I mean, thousands of dollars, many man-hours to make this 2.5-meter robot.</seg>
        <seg id="29">Will we actually be able to scale up? Can we actually build robotics into every part?</seg>
        <seg id="30">The next project addresses this question by looking at the passive nature or trying to get modifiable programmability passively.</seg>
        <seg id="31">But it goes one step further and tries to get real computability.</seg>
        <seg id="32">At its core it has the most fundamental building block of computation, the logic element of the digital integrated circuit directly in every part.</seg>
        <seg id="33">That's the I-NE element.</seg>
        <seg id="34">You have one tetrahedron, the element that will do all the calculations, and two tetrahedrons for input.</seg>
        <seg id="35">One for user input, which is how you lay bricks.</seg>
        <seg id="36">The other is for the information from the previous brick you put in.</seg>
        <seg id="37">And then it outputs the information in three-dimensional space.</seg>
        <seg id="38">So, that means that the user can start to start moving the bricks in the right direction.</seg>
        <seg id="39">His calculations are based on what was done before and what you told him to do.</seg>
        <seg id="40">And now he starts moving in three-dimensional space - up or down.</seg>
        <seg id="41">On the left side, [1,1] input equals 0 on output, moving down.</seg>
        <seg id="42">On the right side, [0,0] input is 1 on output, which means moving up.</seg>
        <seg id="43">And what's really important is that our structures now contain blueprints of what we want to build.</seg>
        <seg id="44">They have all the information built into them about what was built.</seg>
        <seg id="45">So, this means that we have some form of self-reproduction.</seg>
        <seg id="46">In this case, I call it self-managed reproduction because the structures contain clear blueprints.</seg>
        <seg id="47">If mistakes appear, you can replace the part.</seg>
        <seg id="48">All the local information is saved so you know how to fix it.</seg>
        <seg id="49">So you can have something that moves and reads information and can pass it from one part to another.</seg>
        <seg id="50">It's built directly inside, with no external control.</seg>
        <seg id="51">The last project I'm going to show you is called Offset Chains, and it's probably the most exciting example of what we have now of passive self-assembled systems.</seg>

        <seg id="54">All of the elements are completely identical, and offset.</seg>
        <seg id="55">So each chain or each element wants to turn right or left.</seg>
        <seg id="56">And when you assemble a circuit, you are essentially programming it.</seg>
        <seg id="57">You're telling each unit where it should turn, to the right or to the left.</seg>
        <seg id="58">So when you shake the circuit, it rolls into the configuration that you programmed - in this case a spiral, or in this case two cubes next to each other.</seg>
        <seg id="59">So in general, you can program any three-dimensional shape--or one-dimensional, two-dimensional--out of these totally passive circuits.</seg>
        <seg id="60">So, what does this tell us about the future?</seg>
        <seg id="61">I think it tells us that there are new possibilities for self-assembly, replication, repair in our physical structures, buildings, machines.</seg>

        <seg id="45">So this means that we have got some form of self-reproduction.</seg>
        <seg id="46">In this case, I call it self-directed reproduction because the structures contain clear blueprints.</seg>
        <seg id="47">If errors appear, you can replace the part.</seg>
        <seg id="48">All local information is saved so you know how to fix it.</seg>
        <seg id="49">So you can have something that moves and reads information and can transfer it from one part to another.</seg>
        <seg id="50">It is built directly inside, without external control.</seg>
        <seg id="51">The last project I'll show you is called Offset Chains, and this is perhaps the most exciting example of what we have of passive self-assembling systems right now.</seg>
        <seg id="52">It combines reconfiguration and programmability to create a completely passive system.</seg>
        <seg id="53">At the core we have a chain of elements.</seg>
        <seg id="54">All elements are completely identical and offset.</seg>
        <seg id="55">Thus, each chain or each element wants to turn right or left.</seg>
        <seg id="56">And when you build a chain, you are essentially programming it.</seg>
        <seg id="57">You tell each block where it should turn: right or left.</seg>
        <seg id="58">So when you shake the chain, it folds into the configuration you programmed - in this case, into a spiral, or in this case, two cubes next to each other.</seg>
        <seg id="59">So in general you can program any 3D shape - or 1D, 2D - of these completely passive circuits.</seg>
        <seg id="60">So what does this tell us about the future?</seg>
        <seg id="61">I think this tells us that there are new possibilities for self-assembly, replication, repair in our physical structures, buildings, machines.</seg>
        <seg id="62">New programming is possible in these parts.</seg>
        <seg id="63">And from here, you have new possibilities in computing.</seg>
        <seg id="64">We will have spatial computers.</seg>
        <seg id="65">Imagine that our buildings, bridges, cars, all our bricks could do calculations.</seg>
        <seg id="66">This is an amazing parallel and distributed subtraction power, new design possibilities.</seg>
        <seg id="67">This is incredible potential.</seg>
        <seg id="68">I think that the projects that I have shown you are only a small step towards the future, if we introduce these new technologies, towards a new self-assembling future.</seg>

        <seg id="1">Today I would like to show you how we will do different things in the future.</seg>
        <seg id="2">I believe that soon our buildings and machines will be self-assembling, reproducing and repairing themselves.</seg>
        <seg id="3">So I'm going to show you what I think is the current stage of industrial development and then compare it to some natural systems.</seg>
        <seg id="4">So, at the current stage of industrial development, we have skyscrapers - 2.5 years, from 500,000 to a million parts, quite complex, new amazing technologies in steel, concrete and glass.</seg>
        <seg id="5">We have amazing machines that can take us into space – 5 years, 2.5 million parts.</seg>
        <seg id="6">But on the other hand, if you look at natural systems, we see proteins of two million species that can assemble in 10,000 nanoseconds, or a strand of DNA with three billion major pairs that we can copy in about an hour.</seg>
        <seg id="7">So, natural systems, for all their complexity, are extremely efficient, far more efficient than anything we can build, far more complex than anything we can build.</seg>
        <seg id="8">They are much more energy efficient.</seg>
        <seg id="9">They are almost never wrong.</seg>
        <seg id="10">And they can rebuild themselves over the course of a long life.</seg>
        <seg id="11">So, there's something very interesting about natural systems.</seg>
        <seg id="12">And if we can bring that into our man-made environment, our way of creating things will have tremendous potential.</seg>
        <seg id="13">And I think the key is self-in-collection.</seg>
        <seg id="14">So, if we want to use self-concassion in our physical environment, I think there are four key factors to consider.</seg>
        <seg id="15">First, we need to decipher the complexity of what we want to build – our buildings and cars.</seg>
        <seg id="16">And you need to decompose them into a simple sequence - the basic DNA of the construction processes.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Then we'll need programmable parts that can understand that sequence and use it to curl up or reassemble.</seg>
        <seg id="18">We will need some amount of energy that will allow all this to activate, make the parts able to gather according to the program.</seg>
        <seg id="19">And we need some kind of backup bug fix system to ensure that what we want is successfully built.</seg>
        <seg id="20">I'm going to show you a few projects that my colleagues at I.I.T. and I are working on to achieve this self-assembling future.</seg>
        <seg id="21">The first two are MacroBot and DeciBot.</seg>
        <seg id="22">These projects are large-scale reconfigurable robots - 2.5 and 3.5 meter proteins.</seg>
        <seg id="23">They are built-in mechanical electrical devices, sensors.</seg>
        <seg id="24">You paint what you need to curl up into, in a sequence of angles - minus 120, minus 120, 0, 0, 120, minus 120 - something like that; a sequence of angles or turns, and you send that sequence over the cord.</seg>
        <seg id="25">Each block receives its own message - minus 120. He turns to this corner, checks if everything is correct and transmits the information to the neighbor.</seg>
        <seg id="26">And these are brilliant scientists, engineers, designers who worked on this project.</seg>
        <seg id="27">And I think that actually brings out the question: Are there other scales possible here?</seg>
        <seg id="28">I mean, thousands of dollars, a lot of man-hours to make this 2.5 meter robot.</seg>
        <seg id="29">Can we actually zoom in? Can we actually build robotics into every part?</seg>
        <seg id="30">The next project solves this issue, considers a passive character or tries to obtain modifiable programmability passively.</seg>
        <seg id="31">But he goes a step further and tries to get a real calculation.</seg>
        <seg id="32">At its core, it has the most fundamental building block of computing, the logical element of a digital integrated circuit directly in each part.</seg>
        <seg id="33">It's an "AND-NOT" element.</seg>
        <seg id="34">You have one tetrahedron, an element that will do all the calculations, and two tetrahedra for input.</seg>
        <seg id="35">One for user input is how you lay bricks.</seg>
        <seg id="36">Other for information from the previous brick laid.</seg>
        <seg id="37">And then it outputs information in three-dimensional space.</seg>
        <seg id="38">So, this means that the user can start starting the movement of bricks in the right direction.</seg>
        <seg id="39">His calculations are based on what was done earlier and what you told him to do.</seg>
        <seg id="40">And now it begins to move in three-dimensional space - up or down.</seg>
        <seg id="41">On the left side, [1,1] input is equal to 0 at the output, moving down.</seg>
        <seg id="42">On the right side, [0.0] input is 1 at the output, which means upward movement.</seg>
        <seg id="43">And what's really important is that our structures now contain blueprints of what we want to build.</seg>
        <seg id="44">They have all the information about what was built.</seg>
        <seg id="45">So that means we have some form of self-replication.</seg>

        <seg id="50">It is built directly inside, without external control.</seg>
        <seg id="51">The last project I'll show you is called Shifted Chains, and it's probably the most exciting example of what we have now from passive self-assembling systems.</seg>
        <seg id="52">It combines the possibility of reconfiguration and software and creates a completely passive system.</seg>
        <seg id="53">At the heart of it we have a chain of elements.</seg>
        <seg id="54">All elements are completely identical, and displaced.</seg>
        <seg id="55">Thus, each chain or every element wants to turn right or left.</seg>
        <seg id="56">And when you assemble a chain, you're essentially softwareing it.</seg>
        <seg id="57">You tell each block where it should turn: right or left.</seg>
        <seg id="58">So when you shake the chain, it folds into the configuration that you programmed – in this case, a spiral, or in this case , two cubes next to each other.</seg>
        <seg id="59">So in general, you can program any three-dimensional form – or one-dimensional, two-dimensional – from these absolutely passive circuits.</seg>
        <seg id="60">So, what does this tell us about the future?</seg>
        <seg id="61">I think it tells us that there are new opportunities for self-building, replication, repair in our physical structures, buildings, machines.</seg>

        <seg id="54">All elements are completely identical and biased.</seg>
        <seg id="55">So every chain or every element wants to turn right or left.</seg>
        <seg id="56">And when you build a chain, you essentially program it.</seg>
        <seg id="57">You tell each block where it should turn: right or left.</seg>
        <seg id="58">So when you shake the chain, it folds into the configuration you have programmed - in this case, into a spiral, or in this case, two cubes next to each other.</seg>
        <seg id="59">So, in general, you can program any three-dimensional form - or one-dimensional, two-dimensional - from these absolutely passive circuits.</seg>
        <seg id="60">So what does this tell us about the future?</seg>
        <seg id="61">I think it tells us that there are new possibilities for self-assembly, replication, repair in our physical structures, buildings, machines.</seg>
        <seg id="62">New programming is possible in these parts.</seg>
        <seg id="63">And from here, you have new possibilities in computing.</seg>
        <seg id="64">We will have spatial computers.</seg>
        <seg id="65">Imagine that our buildings, bridges, cars, all our bricks could make calculations.</seg>
        <seg id="66">This is an amazing parallel and distributed computing power, new design possibilities.</seg>
        <seg id="67">This is an incredible potential.</seg>
        <seg id="68">I think the projects that I have shown you are only a small step towards the future, if we introduce these new technologies, towards a new self-assembling future.</seg>
        <seg id="69">Thank you.</seg>

        <seg id="5">Во-вторых, мусульмане так же честно завоевали эту землю, как православные завоевали Волго-Окское междуречье, мусульманский Кавказ (и поставили церковь в Грозном) и высадили яблони на Марсе.</seg>

        <seg id="13">Они улучшили все - от Кремля до Ангары, так что это все их по праву прогрессоров.</seg>

        <seg id="3">Firstly, entry there became free – hooray!</seg>
        <seg id="4">I have not been to Istanbul, but in the House of God free entry is better than paid.</seg>

        <seg id="15">It was a stupid inkstand, it became a stupid inkstand with beautiful minarets.</seg>

        <seg id="2">Выходец из Руанды, работавший в соборе Святых Петра и Павла во французском городе Нант на добровольных началах, признался в его поджоге спустя неделю после пожара.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Об этом сообщает в воскресенье телеканал "Франс-3".</seg>
        <seg id="4">По его данным, мужчина, которого уже задерживали 19 июля, на следующий день после пожара, был задержан вновь накануне.</seg>
        <seg id="5">В субботу вечером он предстал перед следственным судьей.</seg>
        <seg id="6">После предъявления обвинений в умышленном повреждении имущества мужчина признался в том, что организовал поджоги в трех местах - под большим органом, под малым органом и у электрощита.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Теперь ему грозит до 10 лет тюрьмы и 150 тыс. евро штрафа.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Мотивы действий 39-летнего выходца из Руанды пока не сообщаются.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Известно лишь, что он добровольно помогал в соборе и в день пожара должен был закрыть его двери.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Однако, согласно записям с камер видеонаблюдения, он покинул религиозное учреждение спустя 15 минут после поступления звонков о пожаре в здании.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Возгорание в соборе Святых Петра и Павла произошло 18 июля.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Более 200 пожарных несколько часов боролись за памятник готической архитектуры.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Тем не менее им не удалось спасти витражи времен Людовика XII и уникальный орган эпохи барокко.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Взять ситуацию под контроль удалось только спустя три часа после начала пожара.</seg>
        <seg id="15">В результате происшествия никто не пострадал.</seg>

        <seg id="17">В 1972 году огонь уничтожил его крышу.</seg>
        <seg id="18">На ликвидацию последствий того возгорания ушло 13 лет.</seg>

        <seg id="1">Считается, что за рулем автомобиля могут быть только зрячие люди.</seg>
        <seg id="2">Еще недавно полагали, что для слепого безопасное и самостоятельное вождение - невыполнимая задача.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Здравствуйте, я Дэнис Хонг, и мы даем слепым свободу и независимость, разрабатывая авто для инвалидов по зрению.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Прежде чем говорить об этом автомобиле для слепых, я вкратце расскажу о другом проекте, над которым я работал, под названием DARPA Urban Challenge.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Проект заключался в создании самоуправляемого автомобиля-робота.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Водитель нажимает "старт", и без его участия автомобиль достигает пункта назначения.</seg>
        <seg id="7">В 2007 году наша команда выиграла полмиллиона долларов, заняв третье место в этом конкурсе.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Примерно в то же время Национальная федерация слепых, или НФС, поставила перед исследовательским комитетом задачу разработать автомобиль, которым может независимо и безопасно управлять слепой.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Мы решили попробовать свои силы, потому что подумали: «Эй, а что тут сложного-то?</seg>
        <seg id="10">У нас уже есть автономное авто.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Посадим в него слепого человека - и делу конец, правда?»</seg>
        <seg id="12">(Смех) Но мы глубоко заблуждались.</seg>
        <seg id="13">НФС хотела получить не просто автомобиль, который бы перевозил слепых, а машину, которой незрячий мог бы самостоятельно управлять.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Поэтому нам пришлось все забраковать и начать с нуля.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Итак, чтобы испытать эту сумасшедшую идею, мы разработали небольшой прототип багги автомобиля для проверки осуществимости проекта.</seg>
        <seg id="16">А летом 2009 года мы пригласили незрячую молодежь со всех уголков страны и предоставили им возможность испытать этот автомобиль.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Это был удивительный опыт.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Но загвоздка в том, что этот автомобиль был разработан для управления в строго контролируемой среде, а именно на ровной закрытой автостоянке, где даже полосы движения ограничены красными сигнальными конусами.</seg>
        <seg id="19">В связи с таким успехом, мы решили сделать следующий большой шаг и разработать реальный автомобиль, которым можно было бы управлять на реальных дорогах.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Итак, как же это работает?</seg>
        <seg id="21">Ну, это довольно сложная система, но позвольте мне разъяснить, возможно, даже упростить ее.</seg>
        <seg id="22">Итак, она включает три составляющих.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Это тактильное восприятие, вычисление и невизуальные интерфейсы.</seg>
        <seg id="24">Так как водитель ничего не видит, система должна воспринимать окружающую среду и собирать информацию для водителя.</seg>
        <seg id="25">Для этого используется первоначальный измеритель параметров.</seg>
        <seg id="26">Он измеряет ускорение, угловое ускорение, подобно внутреннему уху человека.</seg>
        <seg id="27">Затем эта информация передается в GPS-устройство для оценки местоположения автомобиля.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Для обнаружения полосы движения на дороге используются две камеры</seg>
        <seg id="29">и три лазерных дальномера.</seg>
        <seg id="30">Лазеры сканируют пространство вокруг автомобиля для обнаружения различных объектов: приближающегося встречного или обгоняющего автомобиля, любых препятствий, встречающихся на дороге или вокруг автомобиля.</seg>
        <seg id="31">Затем все это огромное количество информации подается в компьютер, а компьютер выполняет два этапа.</seg>
        <seg id="32">Прежде всего, это обработка этой информации для получения представления о пространстве: определение полос движения на дороге, выявление препятствий, а затем доведение этой информации до водителя.</seg>
        <seg id="33">Система также достаточно умна, чтобы вычислять самый безопасный способ управления автомобилем.</seg>
        <seg id="34">Так, мы также можем давать рекомендации о том, как управлять машиной.</seg>
        <seg id="35">Но проблема в том, как донести эту информацию и инструкции до незрячего человека, не обладающего быстрой и точной реакцией, необходимой для вождения?</seg>
        <seg id="36">Для этой цели мы разработали целый ряд технологий интерфейса для незрячих:</seg>
        <seg id="37">Трехмерная звуковая система пинг, вибрирующий жилет, руль со звуковыми сигналами, специальная нога-протез, и даже обувь, оказывающая давление на ногу.</seg>
        <seg id="38">Но сегодня мы поговорим лишь о трех видах этих специальных интерфейсов.</seg>
        <seg id="39">Первый интерфейс называется DriveGrip.</seg>
        <seg id="40">Это пара перчаток с моторчиками на суставах пальцев, инструктирующие водителя, как рулить: направление и угол поворота.</seg>
        <seg id="41">Другое устройство - SpeedStrip.</seg>
        <seg id="42">Изначально это массажное кресло.</seg>
        <seg id="43">Его разобрали и переставили в нем вибрирующие элементы. Вибрация используется для передачи водителю информации о скорости, а также для руководства по использованию педалей газа и тормоза.</seg>
        <seg id="44">Так, здесь можно увидеть, как компьютер воспринимает пространство вокруг автомобиля. И т.к. вибрацию нельзя увидеть, на водителя установлены красные светодиоды для демонстрации процесса.</seg>
        <seg id="45">Это сенсорные данные, они передаются на устройства посредством компьютера.</seg>
        <seg id="46">Устройства DriveGrip и SpeedStrip очень эффективны.</seg>
        <seg id="47">Но проблема в том, что это учебные подсказывающие устройства.</seg>
        <seg id="48">Они фактически не дают свободы управления, не так ли?</seg>
        <seg id="49">Бортовой компьютер отдает водителю команды: «налево», «направо», «прибавить скорость», «стоп».</seg>
        <seg id="50">Мы называем его "назойливый пассажир с заднего сиденья".</seg>
        <seg id="51">Поэтому мы отходим от учебных подсказывающих устройств и концентрируем свое внимание на информирующих устройствах.</seg>
        <seg id="52">Отличным примером такого интерфейса является AirPix.</seg>
        <seg id="53">Это своеобразный монитор для слепых.</seg>
        <seg id="54">Небольшая панель со множеством отверстий, через которые выходит сжатый воздух, тем самым создавая изображения.</seg>
        <seg id="55">Незрячий человек может поднести ладонь к этой панели и «увидеть» полосы движения на проезжей части и препятствия.</seg>
        <seg id="56">Также водитель может изменить частоту, с которой выходит воздух и, возможно, температуру воздуха.</seg>
        <seg id="57">Т.е. это интерфейс для отображения многомерных данных.</seg>
        <seg id="58">Итак, здесь вы видите левую и правую камеру автомобиля, и как компьютер обрабатывает и отправляет эту информацию на панель AirPix.</seg>
        <seg id="59">Здесь мы демонстрируем тренажер, слепой человек управляет автомобилем с помощью AirPix.</seg>
        <seg id="60">Этот тренажер оказался очень полезным для обучения слепых водителей, а также для быстрой проверки идей по использованию разных видов специальных интерфейсов.</seg>
        <seg id="61">Вот так вкратце работает эта система.</seg>
        <seg id="62">Ведь это прототип автомобиля для незрячих. И его не выпустят на проезжую часть, пока не убедятся в его абсолютной безопасности.</seg>
        <seg id="63">И я искренне верю, что это вполне вероятно.</seg>
        <seg id="64">А все-таки, примет ли общество такую радикальную идею?</seg>
        <seg id="65">Насколько изменятся правила автострахования?</seg>
        <seg id="66">На каких условиях будут выдаваться водительские права?</seg>
        <seg id="67">Помимо технологических задач, существует столько подводных камней, которые необходимо преодолеть, прежде чем это станет реальностью.</seg>
        <seg id="68">Конечно, главная цель этого проекта заключается в разработке автомобиля для слепых.</seg>
        <seg id="69">Однако возможно, что побочные технологии, разработанные в ходе этого проекта, окажутся неоценимом вкладом в нашу жизнь.</seg>
        <seg id="70">Наши датчики работают независимо от времени суток, тумана и дождя.</seg>
        <seg id="71">Мы можем использовать эти технологии вместе с новыми специальными интерфейсами для усовершенствования безопасности автомобилей для зрячих.</seg>
        <seg id="72">Или для незрячих. Найти им применение в повседневной бытовой технике, в учебных заведениях, в офисах.</seg>
        <seg id="73">Только представьте себе: учитель в классе пишет на доске, и слепой студент может увидеть и прочитать, что написано с помощью этих специальных интерфейсов.</seg>
        <seg id="74">Это бесценно.</seg>
        <seg id="75">Поэтому то, что я показал вам сегодня - это только начало.</seg>
        <seg id="76">Большое спасибо.</seg>

      <p>
        <seg id="1">Many believe driving is an activity solely reserved for those who can see.</seg>
        <seg id="2">A blind person driving a vehicle safely and independently was thought to be an impossible task, until now.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Hello, my name is Dennis Hong, and we're bringing freedom and independence to the blind by building a vehicle for the visually impaired.</seg>
        <seg id="4">So before I talk about this car for the blind, let me briefly tell you about another project that I worked on called the DARPA Urban Challenge.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Now this was about building a robotic car that can drive itself.</seg>
        <seg id="6">You press start, nobody touches anything, and it can reach its destination fully autonomously.</seg>
        <seg id="7">So in 2007, our team won half a million dollars by placing third place in this competition.</seg>
        <seg id="8">So about that time, the National Federation of the Blind, or NFB, challenged the research committee about who can develop a car that lets a blind person drive safely and independently.</seg>
        <seg id="9">We decided to give it a try, because we thought, "Hey, how hard could it be?"</seg>
        <seg id="10">We have already an autonomous vehicle.</seg>
        <seg id="11">We just put a blind person in it and we're done, right?</seg>
        <seg id="12">(Laughter) We couldn't have been more wrong.</seg>
        <seg id="13">What NFB wanted was not a vehicle that can drive a blind person around, but a vehicle where a blind person can make active decisions and drive.</seg>
        <seg id="14">So we had to throw everything out the window and start from scratch.</seg>
        <seg id="15">So to test this crazy idea, we developed a small dune buggy prototype vehicle to test the feasibility.</seg>
        <seg id="16">And in the summer of 2009, we invited dozens of blind youth from all over the country and gave them a chance to take it for a spin.</seg>
        <seg id="17">It was an absolutely amazing experience.</seg>
        <seg id="18">But the problem with this car was it was designed to only be driven in a very controlled environment, in a flat, closed-off parking lot -- even the lanes defined by red traffic cones.</seg>
        <seg id="19">So with this success, we decided to take the next big step, to develop a real car that can be driven on real roads.</seg>
        <seg id="20">So how does it work?</seg>
        <seg id="21">Well, it's a rather complex system, but let me try to explain it, maybe simplify it.</seg>
        <seg id="22">So we have three steps.</seg>
        <seg id="23">We have perception, computation and non-visual interfaces.</seg>
        <seg id="24">Now obviously the driver cannot see, so the system needs to perceive the environment and gather information for the driver.</seg>
        <seg id="25">For that, we use an initial measurement unit.</seg>
        <seg id="26">So it measures acceleration, angular acceleration -- like a human ear, inner ear.</seg>
        <seg id="27">We fuse that information with a GPS unit to get an estimate of the location of the car.</seg>
        <seg id="28">We also use two cameras to detect the lanes of the road.</seg>
        <seg id="29">And we also use three laser range finders.</seg>
        <seg id="30">The lasers scan the environment to detect obstacles -- a car approaching from the front, the back and also any obstacles that run into the roads, any obstacles around the vehicle.</seg>
        <seg id="31">So all this vast amount of information is then fed into the computer, and the computer can do two things.</seg>
        <seg id="32">One is, first of all, process this information to have an understanding of the environment -- these are the lanes of the road, there's the obstacles -- and convey this information to the driver.</seg>
        <seg id="33">The system is also smart enough to figure out the safest way to operate the car.</seg>
        <seg id="34">So we can also generate instructions on how to operate the controls of the vehicle.</seg>
        <seg id="35">But the problem is this: How do we convey this information and instructions to a person who cannot see fast enough and accurate enough so he can drive?</seg>
        <seg id="36">So for this, we developed many different types of non-visual user interface technology.</seg>
        <seg id="37">So starting from a three-dimensional ping sound system, a vibrating vest, a click wheel with voice commands, a leg strip, even a shoe that applies pressure to the foot.</seg>
        <seg id="38">But today we're going to talk about three of these non-visual user interfaces.</seg>
        <seg id="39">Now the first interface is called a DriveGrip.</seg>
        <seg id="40">So these are a pair of gloves, and it has vibrating elements on the knuckle part so you can convey instructions about how to steer -- the direction and the intensity.</seg>
        <seg id="41">Another device is called SpeedStrip.</seg>
        <seg id="42">So this is a chair -- as a matter of fact, it's actually a massage chair.</seg>
        <seg id="43">We gut it out, and we rearrange the vibrating elements in different patterns, and we actuate them to convey information about the speed, and also instructions how to use the gas and the brake pedal.</seg>
        <seg id="44">So over here, you can see how the computer understands the environment, and because you cannot see the vibration, we actually put red LED's on the driver so that you can see what's happening.</seg>
        <seg id="45">This is the sensory data, and that data is transferred to the devices through the computer.</seg>
        <seg id="46">So these two devices, DriveGrip and SpeedStrip, are very effective.</seg>
        <seg id="47">But the problem is these are instructional cue devices.</seg>
        <seg id="48">So this is not really freedom, right?</seg>
        <seg id="49">The computer tells you how to drive -- turn left, turn right, speed up, stop.</seg>
        <seg id="50">We call this the "backseat-driver problem."</seg>
        <seg id="51">So we're moving away from the instructional cue devices, and we're now focusing more on the informational devices.</seg>
        <seg id="52">A good example for this informational non-visual user interface is called AirPix.</seg>
        <seg id="53">So think of it as a monitor for the blind.</seg>
        <seg id="54">So it's a small tablet, has many holes in it, and compressed air comes out, so it can actually draw images.</seg>
        <seg id="55">So even though you are blind, you can put your hand over it, you can see the lanes of the road and obstacles.</seg>
        <seg id="56">Actually, you can also change the frequency of the air coming out and possibly the temperature.</seg>
        <seg id="57">So it's actually a multi-dimensional user interface.</seg>
        <seg id="58">So here you can see the left camera, the right camera from the vehicle and how the computer interprets that and sends that information to the AirPix.</seg>
        <seg id="59">For this, we're showing a simulator, a blind person driving using the AirPix.</seg>
        <seg id="60">This simulator was also very useful for training the blind drivers and also quickly testing different types of ideas for different types of non-visual user interfaces.</seg>
        <seg id="61">So basically that's how it works.</seg>
        <seg id="62">But this vehicle is a prototype vehicle, and it's not going to be on the road until it's proven as safe as, or safer than, today's vehicle.</seg>
        <seg id="63">And I truly believe that this can happen.</seg>
        <seg id="64">But still, will the society, would they accept such a radical idea?</seg>
        <seg id="65">How are we going to handle insurance?</seg>
        <seg id="66">How are we going to issue driver's licenses?</seg>
        <seg id="67">There's many of these different kinds of hurdles besides technology challenges that we need to address before this becomes a reality.</seg>
        <seg id="68">Of course, the main goal of this project is to develop a car for the blind.</seg>
        <seg id="69">But potentially more important than this is the tremendous value of the spin-off technology that can come from this project.</seg>
        <seg id="70">The sensors that are used can see through the dark, the fog and rain.</seg>
        <seg id="71">And together with this new type of interfaces, we can use these technologies and apply them to safer cars for sighted people.</seg>
        <seg id="72">Or for the blind, everyday home appliances -- in the educational setting, in the office setting.</seg>
        <seg id="73">Just imagine, in a classroom a teacher writes on the blackboard and a blind student can see what's written and read using these non-visual interfaces.</seg>
        <seg id="74">This is priceless.</seg>
        <seg id="75">So today, the things I've showed you today, is just the beginning.</seg>
        <seg id="76">Thank you very much.</seg>

        <seg id="12">(Laughter) But we were dead wrong.</seg>
        <seg id="13">The NSF wanted not just a car that would transport the blind, but a car that the blind could drive themselves.</seg>

        <seg id="28">Two cameras are used to detect lanes on the road</seg>
        <seg id="29">and three laser rangefinders.</seg>
        <seg id="30">Lasers scan the space around the car to detect various objects: an approaching oncoming or overtaking car, any obstacles encountered on the road or around the car.</seg>
        <seg id="31">Then all this huge amount of information is fed into a computer, and the computer performs two steps.</seg>
        <seg id="32">First of all, it is the processing of this information to get an idea of space: determining the lanes on the road, identifying obstacles, and then communicating this information to the driver.</seg>
        <seg id="33">The system is also smart enough to calculate the safest way to drive.</seg>
        <seg id="34">So, we can also make recommendations on how to operate the machine.</seg>
        <seg id="35">But the problem is how to convey this information and instructions to a blind person who does not have the quick and accurate reactions necessary for driving?</seg>
        <seg id="36">For this purpose, we have developed a number of interface technologies for the blind:</seg>
        <seg id="37">A three-dimensional ping sound system, a vibrating vest, a steering wheel with audible signals, a special prosthetic leg, and even shoes that put pressure on the foot.</seg>
        <seg id="38">But today we will talk only about three types of these special interfaces.</seg>
        <seg id="39">The first interface is called DriveGrip.</seg>
        <seg id="40">It's a pair of gloves with motors on the knuckles that instruct the driver how to steer: the direction and angle of the turn.</seg>
        <seg id="41">Another device is the SpeedStrip.</seg>
        <seg id="42">Initially, it is a massage chair.</seg>
        <seg id="43">Vibration is used to transmit speed information to the driver, as well as to guide the use of the accelerator and brake pedals.</seg>
        <seg id="44">So, here you can see how the computer perceives the space around the car. And since the vibration can not be seen, the driver is equipped with red LEDs to demonstrate the process.</seg>
        <seg id="45">This is sensory data, it is transmitted to devices via a computer.</seg>
        <seg id="46">DriveGrip and SpeedStrip are very effective.</seg>
        <seg id="47">But the problem is that these are educational prompting devices.</seg>
        <seg id="48">They don't really give free reign, do they?</seg>
        <seg id="49">The on-board computer gives the driver commands: "left," "right," "speed up," "stop."</seg>
        <seg id="50">We call him "the annoying passenger in the back seat."</seg>
        <seg id="51">Therefore, we are moving away from educational prompting devices and focusing on informing devices.</seg>
        <seg id="52">A great example of such an interface is AirPix.</seg>
        <seg id="53">This is a kind of monitor for the blind.</seg>
        <seg id="54">A small panel with many holes through which compressed air comes out, thereby creating images.</seg>
        <seg id="55">A blind person can hold their hand up to this panel and "see" lanes on the roadway and obstacles.</seg>
        <seg id="56">Also, the driver can change the frequency at which the air comes out and, possibly, the air temperature.</seg>
        <seg id="57">In other words, it is an interface for displaying multidimensional data.</seg>
        <seg id="58">So here you can see the left and right camera of the car, and how the computer processes and sends this information to the AirPix panel.</seg>
        <seg id="59">Here we demonstrate the simulator, a blind man drives a car using AirPix.</seg>
        <seg id="60">This simulator turned out to be very useful for training blind drivers, as well as for quickly testing ideas for using different types of special interfaces.</seg>
        <seg id="61">This is how the system works in a nutshell.</seg>
        <seg id="62">After all, this is a prototype of a car for the blind. And it will not be allowed on the road until it is convinced of its absolute safety.</seg>
        <seg id="63">And I sincerely believe that this is quite likely.</seg>
        <seg id="64">But will society accept such a radical idea?</seg>
        <seg id="65">How much will the car insurance rules change?</seg>
        <seg id="66">Under what conditions will driver's licenses be issued?</seg>
        <seg id="67">Beyond the technological challenges, there are so many pitfalls that need to be overcome before this becomes a reality.</seg>
        <seg id="68">Of course, the main goal of this project is to develop a vehicle for the blind.</seg>
        <seg id="69">However, it is possible that the spin-off technologies developed during this project will prove to be an invaluable contribution to our lives.</seg>
        <seg id="70">Our sensors work regardless of the time of day, fog and rain.</seg>
        <seg id="71">We can use these technologies together with new special interfaces to improve car safety for the visually impaired.</seg>
        <seg id="72">Or for the blind. Find their use in everyday household appliances, in educational institutions, in offices.</seg>
        <seg id="73">Just imagine: a teacher in a classroom writes on a blackboard, and a blind student can see and read what is written using these special interfaces.</seg>
        <seg id="74">This is priceless.</seg>
        <seg id="75">So what I've shown you today is just the beginning.</seg>

        <seg id="1">It is thought only sighted people may be driving the car.</seg>
        <seg id="2">Still recently, it was believed that safe and self-driving was an impossible task for the blind.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Hello, I'm Danis Hong, and we give the blind freedom and independence by designing cars for the visually disabled.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Before talking about this car for the blind, I'll briefly talk about another project I've been working on, called DARPA Urban Challenge.</seg>
        <seg id="5">The project was to create a self-driving robot car.</seg>
        <seg id="6">The driver presses “start” and without his involvement, the car reaches its destination.</seg>
        <seg id="7">In 2007, our team won half a million dollars, finishing third in this competition.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Around the same time, the National Federation of the Blind, or NFS, set a task for the research committee to develop a vehicle that can independently and safely drive a blind man.</seg>
        <seg id="9">We decided to try our hand because we thought, “Hey, what's tough here?</seg>
        <seg id="10">We already have an autonomous car.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Let's put a blind man in it - and the end of it, really?”</seg>
        <seg id="12">(Laughter) But we were deeply misguided.</seg>
        <seg id="13">The NFS wanted not just a car to carry the blind, but a car that the unsighted could drive on his own.</seg>
        <seg id="14">So we had to pick everything up and start from scratch.</seg>
        <seg id="15">So, to experience this crazy idea, we developed a small prototype buggy car to test the feasibility of the project.</seg>
        <seg id="16">And in the summer of 2009, we invited unsighted youth from all parts of the country and gave them the chance to experience this vehicle.</seg>
        <seg id="17">It was an amazing experience.</seg>
        <seg id="18">But the hitch is that this car was designed to be controlled in a tightly controlled environment, namely in a flat enclosed car park where even lanes are restricted to red signal by cones.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Due to this success, we decided to take the next big step and develop a real car that could be driven on real roads.</seg>
        <seg id="20">So, how does it work?</seg>
        <seg id="21">Well, it's a pretty complex system, but let me clarify maybe even simplify it.</seg>
        <seg id="22">So, it includes three components.</seg>
        <seg id="23">These are tactile perception, computation, and non-visual interfaces.</seg>
        <seg id="24">Since the driver can't see anything, the system must perceive the environment and collect information for the driver.</seg>
        <seg id="25">The initial parameter meter is used for this.</seg>
        <seg id="26">It measures acceleration, angular acceleration, similar to a person's inner ear.</seg>
        <seg id="27">This information is then transferred to a GPS device to assess the vehicle's location.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Two cameras are used to detect lane on road</seg>
        <seg id="29">and three laser rangefinders.</seg>
        <seg id="30">Lasers scan the space around the vehicle to detect various objects: an approaching oncoming or overtaking vehicle, any obstacles encountered on or around the car.</seg>
        <seg id="31">Then all this huge amount of information is fed into the computer and the computer performs two steps.</seg>
        <seg id="32">First of all, it's processing that information to get an idea of space: identifying lanes on the road, identifying obstacles, and then bringing that information to the driver.</seg>
        <seg id="33">The system is also smart enough to calculate the safest way to operate a car.</seg>
        <seg id="34">So, we can also make recommendations on how to operate the car.</seg>
        <seg id="35">But the problem is, how do we convey that information and instructions to an unsighted person lacking the fast and accurate response needed to drive?</seg>
        <seg id="36">For this purpose, we have developed a range of interface technologies for the unsighted:</seg>
        <seg id="37">A 3-D ping sound system, vibrating vest, handlebars with beeps, a special prosthetic leg, and even shoes that put pressure on the foot.</seg>
        <seg id="38">But today we're only going to talk about three kinds of these special interfaces.</seg>
        <seg id="39">The first interface is called DriveGrip.</seg>
        <seg id="40">It's a pair of gloves with motors on the joints of his fingers instructing the driver how to steer: direction and angle of turning.</seg>
        <seg id="41">Another device is SpeedStrip.</seg>
        <seg id="42">It is originally a massage chair.</seg>
        <seg id="43">It was disassembled and rearranged vibrating elements in it. Vibration is used to communicate speed information to the driver, and to guide the use of gas and brake pedals.</seg>
        <seg id="44">So, you can see how the computer perceives the space around the car. Because the vibration cannot be seen, red LEDs are installed on the driver to demonstrate the process.</seg>
        <seg id="45">This is touch data and is transmitted to devices by computer.</seg>
        <seg id="46">DriveGrip and SpeedStrip devices are very efficient.</seg>
        <seg id="47">But the problem is that these are instructional prompting devices.</seg>
        <seg id="48">They don't actually give freedom to govern, do they?</seg>
        <seg id="49">The on-board computer gives the driver commands: left, right, add speed, stop.</seg>
        <seg id="50">We call it “the annoying backseat passenger.”</seg>
        <seg id="51">So we move away from learning prompts and focus our attention on informing devices.</seg>
        <seg id="52">AirPix is a great example of such an interface.</seg>
        <seg id="53">It's a kind of monitor for the blind.</seg>
        <seg id="54">A small panel with many holes through which compressed air exits, thus creating images.</seg>
        <seg id="55">An unsighted person can take a palm to this panel and “see” lanes on the roadway and obstacles.</seg>
        <seg id="56">Also the driver can change the frequency at which the air exits and possibly the temperature of the air.</seg>
        <seg id="57">I.e., it is an interface for displaying multidimensional data.</seg>
        <seg id="58">So here you see the left and right camera of the car, and how the computer processes and sends that information to the AirPix panel.</seg>
        <seg id="59">Here we demonstrate an exercise machine, a blind man driving a car using AirPix.</seg>
        <seg id="60">This simulator proved to be very useful for training blind drivers as well as to quickly test ideas for using different kinds of special interfaces.</seg>

        <seg id="24">Since the driver sees nothing, the system must perceive the environment and collect information for the driver.</seg>
        <seg id="25">For this purpose, an initial parameter meter is used.</seg>
        <seg id="26">It measures acceleration, angular acceleration, like a person's inner ear.</seg>
        <seg id="27">This information is then transmitted to a GPS device to assess the location of the vehicle.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Two cameras are used to detect lanes on the road</seg>
        <seg id="29">and three laser rangefinders.</seg>
        <seg id="30">Lasers scan the space around the car to detect various objects: an approaching oncoming or overtaking car, any obstacles encountered on the road or around the car.</seg>
        <seg id="31">Then all this huge amount of information is fed into the computer, and the computer performs two stages.</seg>
        <seg id="32">First of all, it is processing this information to get an idea of space: determining lanes on the road, identifying obstacles, and then bringing this information to the driver.</seg>
        <seg id="33">The system is also smart enough to figure out the safest way to drive a car.</seg>
        <seg id="34">So, we can also give advice on how to operate the machine.</seg>
        <seg id="35">But the problem is how to convey this information and instructions to a blind person who does not have the fast and accurate reaction necessary to drive?</seg>
        <seg id="36">For this purpose, we have developed a number of interface technologies for the blind:</seg>
        <seg id="37">A three-dimensional ping sound system, a vibrating vest, a rudder with sound signals, a special prosthetic leg, and even shoes that put pressure on the leg.</seg>
        <seg id="38">But today we will only talk about three types of these special interfaces.</seg>
        <seg id="39">The first interface is called DriveGrip.</seg>
        <seg id="40">This is a pair of gloves with motors on the joints of the fingers, instructing the driver how to steer: direction and angle of turn.</seg>
        <seg id="41">Another device is the SpeedStrip.</seg>
        <seg id="42">It was originally a massage chair.</seg>
        <seg id="43">The vibration is used to transmit speed information to the driver, as well as to guide the use of gas and brake pedals.</seg>
        <seg id="44">So, here you can see how the computer perceives the space around the car. And since the vibration cannot be seen, red LEDs are installed on the driver to demonstrate the process.</seg>
        <seg id="45">This is sensory data, it is transmitted to devices via a computer.</seg>
        <seg id="46">The DriveGrip and SpeedStrip devices are very effective.</seg>
        <seg id="47">But the problem is that these are teaching aids.</seg>
        <seg id="48">They don't actually give freedom to govern, do they?</seg>
        <seg id="49">The on-board computer gives the driver commands: "left," "right," "speed up," "stop."</seg>
        <seg id="50">We call him an "annoying passenger from the back seat."</seg>
        <seg id="51">Therefore, we are moving away from educational prompting devices and focusing on informative devices.</seg>
        <seg id="52">An excellent example of such an interface is AirPix.</seg>
        <seg id="53">This is a kind of monitor for the blind.</seg>
        <seg id="54">A small panel with many holes through which compressed air exits, thereby creating images.</seg>
        <seg id="55">A blind person can bring his palm to this panel and "see" lanes on the roadway and obstacles.</seg>
        <seg id="56">The driver can also change the frequency at which the air is released and possibly the temperature of the air.</seg>
        <seg id="57">That is, it is an interface for displaying multidimensional data.</seg>
        <seg id="58">So, here you see the left and right camera of the car, and how the computer processes and sends this information to the AirPix panel.</seg>
        <seg id="59">Here we demonstrate a simulator, a blind person drives a car using AirPix.</seg>
        <seg id="60">This simulator proved to be very useful for training blind drivers, as well as for quickly testing ideas for using different types of special interfaces.</seg>
        <seg id="61">That's how this system works in a nutshell.</seg>
        <seg id="62">After all, this is a prototype car for the blind. And it will not be released on the roadway until they are convinced of its absolute safety.</seg>
        <seg id="63">And I sincerely believe that this is quite likely.</seg>
        <seg id="64">Still, will society accept such a radical idea?</seg>
        <seg id="65">How much will the rules of auto insurance change?</seg>
        <seg id="66">On what conditions will a driver's license be issued?</seg>
        <seg id="67">Beyond the technological challenges, there are so many pitfalls that need to be overcome before this becomes a reality.</seg>
        <seg id="68">Of course, the main goal of this project is to develop a car for the blind.</seg>
        <seg id="69">However, it is possible that the spin-off technologies developed during this project will prove to be an invaluable contribution to our lives.</seg>
        <seg id="70">Our sensors work regardless of the time of day, fog and rain.</seg>
        <seg id="71">We can use these technologies together with new special interfaces to improve the safety of visually impaired vehicles.</seg>
        <seg id="72">Or for the blind. Find their use in everyday household appliances, in educational institutions, in offices.</seg>
        <seg id="73">Just imagine: a teacher in the classroom writes on a blackboard, and a blind student can see and read what is written using these special interfaces.</seg>
        <seg id="74">It's priceless.</seg>
        <seg id="75">So what I showed you today is just the beginning.</seg>

        <seg id="1">It is believed that only sighted people can drive a car.</seg>
        <seg id="2">Until recently, it was believed that for a blind person to drive safely and independently was an impossible task.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Hello, I am Denis Hong, and we are giving the blind freedom and independence by developing a car for the visually impaired.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Before I talk about this car for the blind, I'll talk briefly about another project I worked on called the DARPA Urban Challenge.</seg>
        <seg id="5">The project was to create a self-driving robot car.</seg>
        <seg id="6">The driver presses "start" and the car reaches its destination without the driver's input.</seg>
        <seg id="7">In 2007, our team won half a million dollars, taking third place in that competition.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Around the same time, the National Federation of the Blind, or NFF, set a research committee the task of developing a car that could be driven independently and safely by a blind person.</seg>
        <seg id="9">We decided to try our hand at it because we thought, "Hey, what's the big deal?</seg>
        <seg id="10">We already have an autonomous car.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Let's put a blind person in it, and we're done, right?"</seg>
        <seg id="12">(Laughter) But we were deeply mistaken.</seg>
        <seg id="13">The NSF wanted not just a car that would transport the blind, but a car that a blind person could drive himself.</seg>
        <seg id="14">So we had to scrap everything and start from scratch.</seg>
        <seg id="15">So, to test this crazy idea, we developed a small prototype buggy car to test the feasibility of the project.</seg>
        <seg id="16">And in the summer of 2009, we invited blind youth from all over the country and gave them the opportunity to test the vehicle.</seg>
        <seg id="17">It was an amazing experience.</seg>
        <seg id="18">But the catch is that this car was designed to be driven in a strictly controlled environment, namely a level, enclosed parking lot where even the lanes are restricted by red signal cones.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Because of this success, we decided to take the next big step and develop a real car that could be driven on real roads.</seg>
        <seg id="20">So, how does it work?</seg>
        <seg id="21">Well, it's a pretty complicated system, but let me explain, maybe even simplify it.</seg>
        <seg id="22">So, it has three components.</seg>
        <seg id="23">It's haptic perception, computation, and non-visual interfaces.</seg>

        <seg id="38">But today we're going to talk about just three types of these special interfaces.</seg>

        <seg id="44">So, here you can see how the computer perceives the space around the car. And since you can't see the vibration, there are red LEDs on the driver to show the process.</seg>

        <seg id="18">But the catch is that this car was designed to be driven in a tightly controlled environment, namely a flat, enclosed parking lot, where even lanes are delimited by red signal cones.</seg>
        <seg id="19">With this success, we decided to take the next big step and develop a real car that could be driven on real roads.</seg>
        <seg id="20">So how does it work?</seg>
        <seg id="21">Well, this is a rather complex system, but let me clarify, perhaps even simplify it.</seg>
        <seg id="22">So, it includes three components.</seg>
        <seg id="23">These are tactile perception, computation and non-visual interfaces.</seg>
        <seg id="24">Since the driver cannot see anything, the system must perceive the environment and collect information for the driver.</seg>
        <seg id="25">For this, the original parameter meter is used.</seg>
        <seg id="26">It measures acceleration, angular acceleration, like a person's inner ear.</seg>
        <seg id="27">This information is then transmitted to the GPS device to estimate the vehicle's location.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Two cameras are used to detect lane on the road</seg>
        <seg id="29">and three laser rangefinders.</seg>
        <seg id="30">Lasers scan the area around the car to detect various objects: an approaching oncoming or overtaking car, any obstacles encountered on the road or around the car.</seg>
        <seg id="31">Then all this huge amount of information is fed into the computer, and the computer goes through two stages.</seg>
        <seg id="32">First of all, this is the processing of this information to get an idea of the space: determining the lanes on the road, identifying obstacles, and then bringing this information to the driver.</seg>
        <seg id="33">The system is also smart enough to figure out the safest way to drive.</seg>
        <seg id="34">So, we can also give advice on how to operate the machine.</seg>
        <seg id="35">But the problem is how to get this information and instructions to a blind person who does not have the quick and accurate response needed to drive?</seg>
        <seg id="36">For this purpose, we have developed a number of interface technologies for the blind:</seg>
        <seg id="37">3D ping sound system, vibrating vest, steering wheel with beeps, special prosthetic leg, and even shoes that put pressure on the leg.</seg>
        <seg id="38">But today we will only talk about three kinds of these special interfaces.</seg>
        <seg id="39">The first interface is called DriveGrip.</seg>
        <seg id="40">This is a pair of gloves with motorized knuckles, instructing the driver how to steer: direction and steering angle.</seg>
        <seg id="41">Another device is the SpeedStrip.</seg>
        <seg id="42">It is originally a massage chair.</seg>
        <seg id="43">It was dismantled and the vibrating elements were rearranged in it. Vibration is used to provide speed information to the driver and to guide the use of the accelerator and brake pedals.</seg>
        <seg id="44">So, here you can see how the computer perceives the space around the car. And since vibration cannot be seen, red LEDs are installed on the driver to demonstrate the process.</seg>
        <seg id="45">This is sensory data, it is transmitted to devices by means of a computer.</seg>
        <seg id="46">DriveGrip and SpeedStrip are very efficient.</seg>
        <seg id="47">But the problem is that these are educational prompting devices.</seg>
        <seg id="48">They don't actually give freedom of control, do they?</seg>
        <seg id="49">The on-board computer gives the driver commands: "left", "right", "speed up", "stop".</seg>
        <seg id="50">We call him the "annoying backseat passenger".</seg>
        <seg id="51">Therefore, we are moving away from educational prompting devices and focusing our attention on informing devices.</seg>
        <seg id="52">AirPix is a great example of such an interface.</seg>
        <seg id="53">This is a kind of monitor for the blind.</seg>
        <seg id="54">A small panel with many openings through which compressed air exits, thereby creating images.</seg>
        <seg id="55">A blind person can bring a palm to this panel and "see" traffic lanes and obstacles on the roadway.</seg>
        <seg id="56">Also, the driver can change the frequency with which the air comes out and, possibly, the air temperature.</seg>
        <seg id="57">Those. it is an interface for displaying multidimensional data.</seg>
        <seg id="58">So, here you see the left and right cameras of the car, and how the computer processes and sends this information to the AirPix panel.</seg>
        <seg id="59">Here we demonstrate a simulator where a blind person drives a car using AirPix.</seg>
        <seg id="60">This simulator has proven to be very useful for training blind drivers as well as for quickly testing ideas for using different kinds of special interfaces.</seg>
        <seg id="61">This is, in a nutshell, how this system works.</seg>
        <seg id="62">After all, this is a prototype of a car for the blind. And he will not be released onto the roadway until they are convinced of his absolute safety.</seg>
        <seg id="63">And I sincerely believe that this is very likely.</seg>
        <seg id="64">Still, will society accept such a radical idea?</seg>
        <seg id="65">How much will the auto insurance rules change?</seg>
        <seg id="66">Under what conditions will a driver's license be issued?</seg>
        <seg id="67">Beyond the technological challenges, there are so many pitfalls that must be overcome before this becomes a reality.</seg>
        <seg id="68">Of course, the main goal of this project is to develop a vehicle for the blind.</seg>
        <seg id="69">However, it is possible that the spin-off technologies developed during this project will prove to be an invaluable contribution to our lives.</seg>
        <seg id="70">Our sensors work regardless of the time of day, fog and rain.</seg>
        <seg id="71">We can use these technologies together with new custom interfaces to improve vehicle safety for the sighted.</seg>
        <seg id="72">Or for the blind. Find their use in everyday household appliances, in educational institutions, in offices.</seg>
        <seg id="73">Just imagine: a teacher in a class is writing on a blackboard and a blind student can see and read what is written using these special interfaces.</seg>
        <seg id="74">It's priceless.</seg>
        <seg id="75">Therefore, what I have shown you today is just the beginning.</seg>

        <seg id="1">It is believed that only sighted people can be behind the wheel of a car.</seg>
        <seg id="2">Until recently, it was believed that for a blind person, safe and independent driving is an impossible task.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Hello, I'm Denis Hong, and we give the blind freedom and independence by developing cars for the visually impaired.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Before I talk about this car for the blind, I'll briefly talk about another project I've been working on called the DARPA Urban Challenge.</seg>
        <seg id="5">The project was to create a self-driving robot car.</seg>
        <seg id="6">The driver presses "start", and without his participation the car reaches its destination.</seg>
        <seg id="7">In 2007, our team won half a million dollars, taking third place in this competition.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Around the same time, the National Federation of the Blind, or NFS, set a research committee the task of developing a car that could be independently and safely driven by a blind person.</seg>
        <seg id="9">We decided to try our hand because we thought, "Hey, what's the big part?</seg>
        <seg id="10">We already have an autonomous car.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Put a blind man in it and it's over, right?"</seg>
        <seg id="12">(Laughter) But we were deeply mistaken.</seg>
        <seg id="13">The NSF wanted to get not just a car that would transport the blind, but a car that a blind person could drive on his own.</seg>
        <seg id="14">So we had to reject everything and start from scratch.</seg>
        <seg id="15">So, to test this crazy idea, we developed a small prototype of a buggy car to test the feasibility of the project.</seg>

        <seg id="12">(Laughter) But we were deeply mistaken.</seg>
        <seg id="13">The NFS wanted not just a car that would transport the blind, but a car that the blind could drive on their own.</seg>
        <seg id="14">So we had to scrap everything and start from scratch.</seg>
        <seg id="15">So, to test this crazy idea, we developed a small prototype of a buggy car to test the feasibility of the project.</seg>
        <seg id="16">And in the summer of 2009, we invited blind young people from all over the country and gave them the opportunity to test this car.</seg>
        <seg id="17">It was an amazing experience.</seg>
        <seg id="18">But the catch is that the car was designed to operate in a strictly controlled environment, namely in a flat, enclosed car park, where even traffic lanes are restricted by red signal cones.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Due to this success, we decided to take the next big step and develop a real car that could be driven on real roads.</seg>
        <seg id="20">So, how does it work?</seg>
        <seg id="21">Well, it's a pretty complicated system, but let me explain, maybe even simplify it.</seg>
        <seg id="22">So, it has three components.</seg>
        <seg id="23">This is tactile perception, calculation and non-visual interfaces.</seg>
        <seg id="24">Since the driver does not see anything, the system must perceive the environment and collect information for the driver.</seg>
        <seg id="25">For this purpose, an initial parameter meter is used.</seg>
        <seg id="26">It measures acceleration, angular acceleration, like the inner ear of a person.</seg>
        <seg id="27">This information is then transmitted to a GPS device to assess the location of the vehicle.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Two cameras are used to detect lanes on the road</seg>
        <seg id="29">and three laser rangefinders.</seg>
        <seg id="30">Lasers scan the space around the vehicle to detect various objects: an approaching oncoming or overtaking vehicle, any obstacles encountered on the road or around the vehicle.</seg>
        <seg id="31">Then all this huge amount of information is fed into the computer, and the computer performs two stages.</seg>
        <seg id="32">First of all, it is processing this information in order to get an idea of the space: identifying traffic lanes on the road, identifying obstacles, and then communicating this information to the driver.</seg>
        <seg id="33">The system is also smart enough to calculate the safest way to drive.</seg>
        <seg id="34">So, we can also give advice on how to operate the machine.</seg>
        <seg id="35">But the problem is how to get this information and instructions across to a blind person who does not have the quick and accurate response needed to drive?</seg>
        <seg id="36">For this purpose, we have developed a range of interface technologies for the blind:</seg>
        <seg id="37">A three-dimensional ping sound system, a vibrating vest, a steering wheel with sound signals, a special prosthetic leg, and even shoes that put pressure on the leg.</seg>
        <seg id="38">But today we will only talk about three types of these special interfaces.</seg>
        <seg id="39">The first interface is called DriveGrip.</seg>
        <seg id="40">This is a pair of gloves with motorized finger joints, instructing the driver how to steer: direction and angle of turn.</seg>
        <seg id="41">Another device is SpeedStrip.</seg>
        <seg id="42">Initially, this is a massage chair.</seg>
        <seg id="43">The vibration is used to provide the driver with speed information as well as guidance on the use of gas and brake pedals.</seg>
        <seg id="44">So, here you can see how the computer perceives the space around the car. And since the vibration cannot be seen, red LEDs are installed on the driver to demonstrate the process.</seg>
        <seg id="45">This is sensory data, it is transmitted to devices via a computer.</seg>
        <seg id="46">DriveGrip and SpeedStrip devices are very effective.</seg>
        <seg id="47">But the problem is that these are instructional prompting devices.</seg>
        <seg id="48">They don't actually give you the freedom to govern, don't they?</seg>
        <seg id="49">The on-board computer gives the driver commands: "left," "right," "speed up," "stop."</seg>
        <seg id="50">We call him "an annoying backseat passenger."</seg>
        <seg id="51">That's why we're moving away from teaching prompts and concentrating our attention on informative devices.</seg>
        <seg id="52">An excellent example of such an interface is AirPix.</seg>
        <seg id="53">This is a kind of monitor for the blind.</seg>
        <seg id="54">A small panel with many holes through which compressed air escapes, thereby creating images.</seg>
        <seg id="55">A blind person can bring a palm to this panel and "see" traffic lanes on the roadway and obstacles.</seg>
        <seg id="56">The driver can also change the frequency at which the air is released and possibly the air temperature.</seg>
        <seg id="57">That is, it is an interface for displaying multidimensional data.</seg>
        <seg id="58">So here you see the left and right camera of the car and how the computer processes and sends this information to the AirPix panel.</seg>
        <seg id="59">Here we showcase a simulator, a blind person driving a car using AirPix.</seg>
        <seg id="60">This simulator has proven to be very useful for training blind drivers, as well as for quickly testing ideas for using different types of special interfaces.</seg>
        <seg id="61">This is how the system works briefly.</seg>
        <seg id="62">After all, this is a prototype car for the blind, and it will not be released on the roadway until they are convinced of its absolute safety.</seg>
        <seg id="63">And I sincerely believe that it is quite possible.</seg>
        <seg id="64">Still, will society accept such a radical idea?</seg>
        <seg id="65">How much will auto insurance rules change?</seg>
        <seg id="66">What are the conditions under which a driver's license will be issued?</seg>
        <seg id="67">Beyond the technological challenges, there are so many pitfalls to overcome before this becomes a reality.</seg>
        <seg id="68">Of course, the main goal of this project is to develop a car for the blind.</seg>
        <seg id="69">However, it is possible that the spin-off technologies developed during this project will prove to be an invaluable contribution to our lives.</seg>
        <seg id="70">Our sensors work regardless of time of day, fog and rain.</seg>
        <seg id="71">We can use these technologies together with new special interfaces to improve vehicle safety for the sighted.</seg>
        <seg id="72">Or for the blind. Find their use in everyday household appliances, in educational institutions, in offices.</seg>
        <seg id="73">Just imagine: a teacher in the classroom writes on a blackboard, and a blind student can see and read what is written using these special interfaces.</seg>
        <seg id="74">This is priceless.</seg>
        <seg id="75">So what I showed you today is just the beginning.</seg>
        <seg id="76">Many thanks.</seg>
        <seg id="77">(Applause)</seg>

      <p>
        <seg id="1">Я хочу, чтобы вы задумались на секунду о том, что почти все наши знания о Вселенной получены благодаря свету.</seg>
        <seg id="2">Мы стоим на Земле и невооруженным глазом видим в ночном небе звезды.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Яркое Солнце может обжечь сетчатку глаза,</seg>
        <seg id="4">но этот же свет мы видим в отражении Луны.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Со времен Галилея, наблюдавшего небесные тела в свой примитивный телескоп, мы созерцаем вселенную благодаря свету, проходящему через безбрежные века космической истории.</seg>
        <seg id="6">С помощью современных телескопов мы смогли собрать потрясающий немой фильм о Вселенной, охватывающий всю нашу историю вплоть до Большого взрыва.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Однако кино это вовсе не лишено звука, потому как Вселенная не беззвучна.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Я хочу доказать вам, что у Вселенной есть своя звуковая дорожка, и она «воспроизводится» самим космосом, ведь космическое пространство вибрирует как барабан.</seg>
        <seg id="9">В нем разносятся своеобразные звуки, сопровождающие самые яркие события по мере того, как они происходят.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Сегодня мы хотели бы дополнить роскошный визуальный образ вселенной, имеющийся у нас, еще и саундтреком.</seg>
        <seg id="11">До сих пор мы никогда не слышали звуков из космоса, но в ближайшее время нам стоит внимательно прислушаться к тому, что там происходит.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Итак, с целью записать «песню» Вселенной, мы сосредоточились на черных дырах как самых многообещающих объектах, ведь они «бьют» в пространство-время как в колокол, и дают характерный звук. Сейчас вы услышите как, по нашему мнению, будет звучать эта песня.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Может быть, однажды мы увидим тень, которую черная дыра отбрасывает, оказываясь на ярком фоне, но пока такого мы не наблюдали.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Тем не менее, черную дыру, пусть и невидимую, можно услышать, поскольку она «бьет» в пространство-время как в барабан.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Предположение о том, что космос подобен мембране барабана принадлежит Альберту Эйнштейну, которому мы столь многим обязаны.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Эйнштейн заключил, что если бы пространство было пустым, если бы вселенная была пуста, она выглядела бы как на этом рисунке, за исключением, конечно, такой наглядной сетки.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Если бы мы свободно падали через космос, даже без удобной координатной сетки, мысленно мы сами могли бы ее изобразить, так как заметили бы, что движемся по прямой, строго по прямой через вселенную.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Эйнштейн так же понял — и в этом самая суть — что если поместить во вселенную энергию или массу, это приведет к искривлению пространства, и свободно падающий объект будет огибать, к примеру, Солнце, отклоняясь вдоль естественных кривых в космосе.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Это была великая общая теория относительности Эйнштейна.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Даже свет искривляется по такой траектории.</seg>
        <seg id="21">Отклонение может быть настолько сильным, что объект просто попадет на орбиту, и будет вращаться вокруг Солнца как Земля, или как Луна — вокруг Земли.</seg>
        <seg id="22">Это естественные искривления в пространстве.</seg>
        <seg id="23">А вот этого Эйнштейн не понял — если взять наше Солнце и сжать его до 6 километров в диаметре, то есть массу в 1 млн раз тяжелее Земли уместить в объекте диаметром в 6 км, то получится черная дыра, настолько плотная, что прошедший слишком близко от нее свет никогда уже не вырвется. Мрачная тень во вселенной.</seg>
        <seg id="24">Однако он всегда считал черные дыры просто математическим курьезом.</seg>
        <seg id="25">Эйнштейн не верил, что они существуют в реальности.</seg>
        <seg id="26">Он считал, что природа должна сама защитить нас от их появления.</seg>
        <seg id="27">Прошли десятилетия, прежде чем был изобретен термин «черная дыра», и люди осознали, что они являются реальными астрофизическими объектами — фактически, это очень массивные звезды в посмертном состоянии, катастрофическим образом разрушившиеся в конце своего жизненного цикла.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Наше Солнце не превратится в черную дыру.</seg>
        <seg id="29">Его массы недостаточно для этого.</seg>
        <seg id="30">Но мы проведем небольшой мысленный эксперимент, — Энштейн их очень любил — и представим себе, как Солнце сжимается до 6 километров в диаметре, а вокруг него вращается крошечная Земля, примерно в 30 км от черной дыры солнца.</seg>
        <seg id="31">Эта Земля — светится, Солнца ведь больше нет, как и другого источника света, поэтому сделаем нашу маленькую Землю самосветящейся.</seg>
        <seg id="32">Оказывается, мы можем поместить Землю на очень близкую орбиту, всего в 30 км от этой черной дыры.</seg>
        <seg id="33">По размеру она не сильно превышает Манхэттен.</seg>
        <seg id="34">Возможно, она зацепила бы немного и Гудзон, прежде чем разрушить Землю.</seg>
        <seg id="35">Но масштаб примерно таков.</seg>
        <seg id="36">Мы говорим об объекте, который занял бы примерно 1/2 площади Манхэттена.</seg>
        <seg id="37">Итак, поместив эту Землю совсем близко — всего в 30 км — мы заметим, что она прекрасно вращается вокруг черной дыры.</seg>
        <seg id="38">Это своего рода миф, что черные дыры поглощают все без разбора — чтобы в нее попасть, надо подойти очень близко.</seg>
        <seg id="39">Но что поразительно — с нашей точки обзора мы будем все время видеть Землю.</seg>
        <seg id="40">Она не может скрыться за черной дырой.</seg>
        <seg id="41">Часть света, который излучает Земля, поглощается дырой, но часть его как бы огибает ее и возвращается обратно к нам.</seg>
        <seg id="42">Так, что за черной дырой ничего невозможно спрятать.</seg>
        <seg id="43">Если вы вдруг попадете в сериал «Звездный Крейсер "Галактика"», и будете сражаться с Сайлонами — не прячьтесь за черной дырой.</seg>
        <seg id="44">Они увидят вас!</seg>
        <seg id="45">Наше Солнце не превратится в черную дыру — для этого оно не достаточно массивное. Но в нашей галактике существуют десятки тысяч черных дыр.</seg>
        <seg id="46">И если бы одна из них заслонила Млечный Путь, вот как это выглядело бы.</seg>
        <seg id="47">Мы бы увидели тень черной дыры на фоне сотен миллиардов звезд и светящейся пыли.</seg>
        <seg id="48">Если бы мы были на грани падения в эту черную дыру, то увидели бы весь этот свет, огибающий ее, и даже уже входя в эту тень, не замечали бы близкой катастрофы.</seg>
        <seg id="49">Уже бесполезно было бы запускать двигатели и пытаться выбраться, потому что ничто, включая свет, не может из нее сбежать.</seg>
        <seg id="50">Хотя черная дыра и выглядит таковой снаружи, внутри она не темная, так как весь свет проваливается в нее вместе с нами.</seg>
        <seg id="51">Согласно релятивистскому эффекту, известному как растяжение времени, наши часы как будто замедлили бы свой ход относительно общегалактического времени, но мы, напротив, увидели бы эволюцию галактики в ускоренном режиме за миг до гибели внутри черной дыры.</seg>
        <seg id="52">Это было бы похоже на околосмертный опыт, где вы видите свет в конце туннеля, но только не «около», а абсолютно смертный.</seg>
        <seg id="53">(Смех) И уже никому не расскажешь о свете в конце туннеля.</seg>
        <seg id="54">Ученые не смогли пока увидеть тень черной дыры, зато мы можем ее услышать, пусть и невидимую.</seg>
        <seg id="55">Представим реальную астрофизическую ситуацию — две черные дыры, что прожили вместе долгую жизнь.</seg>
        <seg id="56">Возможно, сначала они были звездами, а затем превратились в черные дыры. Каждая из них тяжелее Солнца в 10 раз.</seg>
        <seg id="57">Сожмем их до 60 км в диаметре.</seg>
        <seg id="58">Они могут быстро вращаться: сотни оборотов в секунду.</seg>
        <seg id="59">В конце их жизненного цикла, они вращаются друг вокруг друга практически со скоростью света.</seg>
        <seg id="60">Они покрывают тысячи км в долю секунды, и не только искривляют тем самым пространство, но и оставляют за собой след: вызывают колебания, волновой след в пространстве-времени.</seg>
        <seg id="61">Пространство сжимается и растягивается, освобождаясь из этих черных дыр, колеблющихся во вселенной.</seg>
        <seg id="62">И они путешествуют сквозь космос со скоростью света.</seg>
        <seg id="63">Эта компьютерная симуляция сделана группой Годдарда в НАСА, изучающей теорию относительности.</seg>
        <seg id="64">Почти 30 лет ученые мира бились над этой проблемой.</seg>
        <seg id="65">Это была одна из групп.</seg>
        <seg id="66">Вы видите две черные дыры, вращающиеся друг вокруг друга — и снова здесь наглядно изображены кривые.</seg>
        <seg id="67">Если вы видите — немножко бледно получилось — они испускают красные волны, гравитационные волны.</seg>
        <seg id="68">Это и есть звуки вибрирующего пространства, и они будут исходить из этих черных дыр со скоростью света, пока они затихают и сливаются в одну вращающуюся, тихую черную дыру — таков исход.</seg>
        <seg id="69">Если бы вы стояли достаточно близко, ваше ухо резонировало бы, по мере сжатия и растяжения пространства.</seg>
        <seg id="70">Вы бы на самом деле услышали звук.</seg>
        <seg id="71">Конечно, и ваша голова сжималась бы и растягивалась, поэтому вам было бы трудно понять, что происходит.</seg>
        <seg id="72">Но я хотела бы проиграть вам этот звук, как мы его предсказываем.</seg>
        <seg id="73">Это работа моей группы, так что графика здесь поскромнее.</seg>
        <seg id="74">Представьте легкую черную дыру, проваливающуюся в очень тяжелую.</seg>
        <seg id="75">Звук, который вы слышите, издает легкая дыра, выгибая пространство, приближаясь шаг за шагом к концу.</seg>
        <seg id="76">Если она удаляется, звук становится тише.</seg>
        <seg id="77">Но она подобна молоточку, «ударяющему» в пространство, которое вибрирует, как мембрана.</seg>
        <seg id="78">И мы можем предсказать, каким будет этот звук.</seg>
        <seg id="79">Мы знаем, что по мере поглощения дыры, он становится все быстрее и громче.</seg>
        <seg id="80">В конце мы услышим, как маленькая дыра просто проваливается в большую.</seg>
        <seg id="81">Я еще не слышала запись так громко — действительно, весьма впечатляет.</seg>
        <seg id="82">Дома получается гораздо скромнее.</seg>
        <seg id="83">Просто тихие щелчки.</seg>
        <seg id="84">Это другой звук, созданный моей группой.</seg>
        <seg id="85">Здесь я не показываю вам картинку, так как черные дыры не оставляют за собой наглядных следов, в космосе нет видимых кривых.</seg>
        <seg id="86">Если бы вы отправились в космический круиз, и услышали бы такой звук, я бы рекомендовала поскорее улетать.</seg>
        <seg id="87">(Смех) Подальше от этого звука.</seg>
        <seg id="88">Обе черные дыры двигаются.</seg>
        <seg id="89">Они приближаются друг к другу.</seg>
        <seg id="90">В данном случае, они обе сильно колеблются.</seg>
        <seg id="91">И сейчас произойдет слияние.</seg>
        <seg id="92">Это «стрекотание» очень характерно для сливающихся черных дыр, это вот ускорение в конце.</seg>
        <seg id="93">Мы предполагаем, что это звучало бы именно так.</seg>
        <seg id="94">К счастью, мы сейчас на безопасном расстоянии, в Лонг-Бич в Калифорнии.</seg>
        <seg id="95">Несомненно, где-то во вселенной сливаются две черных дыры.</seg>
        <seg id="96">И без сомнений, пространство вокруг нас вибрирует, и эти колебания, возможно, прошли миллионы световых лет, то есть миллион лет двигались к нам со скоростью света.</seg>
        <seg id="97">Но звук слишком тихий, мы не можем его услышать.</seg>
        <seg id="98">Есть сегодня очень сложный проект: ЛИГО (Лазерно-интерферометрическая гравитационно-волновая обсерватория) — она отслеживает отклонения в колебаниях пространства, мельчайшие — на величину ядра атома на 4 километра.</seg>
        <seg id="99">Это крайне амбициозный эксперимент, и в ближайшие несколько лет он будет посвящен улавливанию таких волн.</seg>
        <seg id="100">Планируется также одна космическая программа, которая, надеюсь, будет запущена в ближайшие 10 лет: ЛИКА (Лазерная интерферометрическая космическая антенна).</seg>
        <seg id="101">Она сможет увидеть супертяжелые черные дыры, в миллионы и миллиарды раз более массивные, чем Солнце.</seg>
        <seg id="102">На этом снимке с телескопа «Хаббл» мы видим две галактики.</seg>
        <seg id="103">Они выглядят так, будто замерли в некоем «объятии»,</seg>
        <seg id="104">и каждая из них, вероятно, содержит в своем ядре супертяжелую черную дыру.</seg>
        <seg id="105">Но они не замерли. На самом деле, они сливаются.</seg>
        <seg id="106">Эти две черные дыры сталкиваются, и продлится это более миллиарда лет.</seg>
        <seg id="107">Это за гранью нашего восприятия — услышать песню такой длительности.</seg>
        <seg id="108">Но ЛИКА может увидеть финал слияния двух супертяжелых черных дыр, начавшегося уже очень давно: последние 15 минут этого действия.</seg>
        <seg id="109">Мы говорим не только о черных дырах, но и о любых серьезных передрягах во вселенной, и самая главная из них — Большой взрыв.</seg>
        <seg id="110">Когда это выражение придумали, оно было ироничным — «мол, кто же поверит в Большой взрыв?»</seg>
        <seg id="111">Это анимация от моего друга из Proton Studios показывает Большой Взрыв извне.</seg>
        <seg id="112">Любой наблюдатель хотел бы находиться в этот момент внутри, ведь быть за пределами вселенной невозможно.</seg>
        <seg id="113">Представьте, что вы внутри Большого взрыва.</seg>
        <seg id="114">Он повсюду, вокруг вас, и пространство хаотически вибрирует.</seg>
        <seg id="115">Прошло уже 14 миллиардов лет, а эта песня до сих пор звучит вокруг нас.</seg>
        <seg id="116">Рождаются галактики, а в них — поколения звездных форм. И вокруг одной звезды, как минимум одной, есть обитаемая планета.</seg>
        <seg id="117">И здесь мы упорно проводим эти эксперименты, делаем расчеты, пишем программы.</seg>
        <seg id="118">Представьте — миллиард лет назад столкнулись две черных дыры.</seg>
        <seg id="119">Все это время, их песня звучит в космосе.</seg>
        <seg id="120">Мы еще даже не появились на свет.</seg>
        <seg id="121">Звук приближается, ближе и ближе — 40 тыс. лет назад, мы все еще делаем наскальные рисунки.</seg>
        <seg id="122">Если бы мы собирались «услышать» Большой взрыв, он бы прозвучал вот так.</seg>
        <seg id="123">Шум в чистом виде.</seg>
        <seg id="124">Это белый шум, просто хаотичные звуки.</seg>
        <seg id="125">Но он, вероятно, повсюду окружает нас, если его не заглушили какие-то другие процессы во вселенной.</seg>
        <seg id="126">И если мы уловим его, он будет для нас самой приятной музыкой, ведь это тихое эхо момента нашего сотворения, рождения наблюдаемой Вселенной.</seg>
        <seg id="127">В течение следующих нескольких лет мы сможем немного прибавить громкости, и услышим вселенную в звуке.</seg>
        <seg id="128">Но если мы уловим эхо тех ранних событий, это приведет нас намного ближе к пониманию Большого взрыва, а это уже позволит нам задать некоторые из самых сложных, неуловимых вопросов.</seg>
        <seg id="129">Прокрутив фильм о нашей вселенной задом наперед, мы узнаем, что в прошлом там был Большой Взрыв, и возможно мы даже услышим его какофонию, но был ли этот взрыв единственным?</seg>
        <seg id="130">Я имею в виду — не происходил ли он и до этого?</seg>
        <seg id="131">Не повторится ли он?</seg>
        <seg id="132">В духе TED, призывающего нас вернуть себе веру в чудеса, мы можем сейчас задать вопросы, которые всегда ускользали от нас.</seg>
        <seg id="133">Но мы должны спросить: возможно ли, что наша Вселенная это всего лишь след какой-то более значимой истории?</seg>
        <seg id="134">Или — не являемся ли мы лишь одной из ветвей мультивселенной — у каждой из которых был свой Большой взрыв в прошлом? Может, с черными дырами и их «песнями», или без них, может с разумной жизнью, а возможно и без — они не в нашем прошлом, не в нашем будущем, но каким-то образом связаны с нами?</seg>
        <seg id="135">Мы спросим — в такой мультивселенной, в других ее ответвлениях, есть ли там жизнь?</seg>
        <seg id="136">Вот мои собратья по мультивселенной.</seg>
        <seg id="137">Но есть ли там другие создания, которые задумываются о нас, и о своем происхождении?</seg>
        <seg id="138">И, если они есть, я могу представить их, ведущих расчеты, как и мы, строящих инструменты, пытающихся обнаружить тот слабый звук момента их творения, и думающих — кто еще есть там, кроме нас?</seg>
        <seg id="139">Спасибо. Спасибо.</seg>

      <p>
        <seg id="1">I want to ask you all to consider for a second the very simple fact that, by far, most of what we know about the universe comes to us from light.</seg>
        <seg id="2">We can stand on the Earth and look up at the night sky and see stars with our bare eyes.</seg>
        <seg id="3">The Sun burns our peripheral vision.</seg>
        <seg id="4">We see light reflected off the Moon.</seg>
        <seg id="5">And in the time since Galileo pointed that rudimentary telescope at the celestial bodies, the known universe has come to us through light, across vast eras in cosmic history.</seg>
        <seg id="6">And with all of our modern telescopes, we've been able to collect this stunning silent movie of the universe -- these series of snapshots that go all the way back to the Big Bang.</seg>
        <seg id="7">And yet, the universe is not a silent movie because the universe isn't silent.</seg>
        <seg id="8">I'd like to convince you that the universe has a soundtrack and that soundtrack is played on space itself, because space can wobble like a drum.</seg>
        <seg id="9">It can ring out a kind of recording throughout the universe of some of the most dramatic events as they unfold.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Now we'd like to be able to add to a kind of glorious visual composition that we have of the universe -- a sonic composition.</seg>
        <seg id="11">And while we've never heard the sounds from space, we really should, in the next few years, start to turn up the volume on what's going on out there.</seg>
        <seg id="12">So in this ambition to capture songs from the universe, we turn our focus to black holes and the promise they have, because black holes can bang on space-time like mallets on a drum and have a very characteristic song, which I'd like to play for you -- some of our predictions for what that song will be like.</seg>
        <seg id="13">We might one day see a shadow a black hole can cast on a very bright background, but we haven't yet.</seg>
        <seg id="14">And yet black holes may be heard even if they're not seen, and that's because they bang on space-time like a drum.</seg>
        <seg id="15">Now we owe the idea that space can ring like a drum to Albert Einstein -- to whom we owe so much.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Einstein realized that if space were empty, if the universe were empty, it would be like this picture, except for maybe without the helpful grid drawn on it.</seg>
        <seg id="17">But if we were freely falling through the space, even without this helpful grid, we might be able to paint it ourselves, because we would notice that we traveled along straight lines, undeflected straight paths through the universe.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Einstein also realized -- and this is the real meat of the matter -- that if you put energy or mass in the universe, it would curve space, and a freely falling object would pass by, let's say, the Sun and it would be deflected along the natural curves in the space.</seg>
        <seg id="19">It was Einstein's great general theory of relativity.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Now even light will be bent by those paths.</seg>
        <seg id="21">And you can be bent so much that you're caught in orbit around the Sun, as the Earth is, or the Moon around the Earth.</seg>
        <seg id="22">These are the natural curves in space.</seg>
        <seg id="23">What Einstein did not realize was that, if you took our Sun and you crushed it down to six kilometers -- so you took a million times the mass of the Earth and you crushed it to six kilometers across, you would make a black hole, an object so dense that if light veered too close, it would never escape -- a dark shadow against the universe.</seg>
        <seg id="24">But Einstein always thought black holes were a mathematical oddity.</seg>
        <seg id="25">He did not believe they existed in nature.</seg>
        <seg id="26">He thought nature would protect us from their formation.</seg>
        <seg id="27">It was decades before the term "black hole" was coined and people realized that black holes are real astrophysical objects -- in fact they're the death state of very massive stars that collapse catastrophically at the end of their lifetime.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Now our Sun will not collapse to a black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="29">It's actually not massive enough.</seg>
        <seg id="30">But if we did a little thought experiment -- as Einstein was very fond of doing -- we could imagine putting the Sun crushed down to six kilometers, and putting a tiny little Earth around it in orbit, maybe 30 kilometers outside of the black-hole sun.</seg>
        <seg id="31">And it would be self-illuminated, because now the Sun's gone, we have no other source of light -- so let's make our little Earth self-illuminated.</seg>
        <seg id="32">And you would realize you could put the Earth in a happy orbit even 30 km outside of this crushed black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="33">This crushed black hole actually would fit inside Manhattan, more or less.</seg>
        <seg id="34">It might spill off into the Hudson a little bit before it destroyed the Earth.</seg>
        <seg id="35">But basically that's what we're talking about.</seg>
        <seg id="36">We're talking about an object that you could crush down to half the square area of Manhattan.</seg>
        <seg id="37">So we move this Earth very close -- 30 kilometers outside -- and we notice it's perfectly fine orbiting around the black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="38">There's a sort of myth that black holes devour everything in the universe, but you actually have to get very close to fall in.</seg>
        <seg id="39">But what's very impressive is that, from our vantage point, we can always see the Earth.</seg>
        <seg id="40">It cannot hide behind the black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="41">The light from the Earth, some of it falls in, but some of it gets lensed around and brought back to us.</seg>
        <seg id="42">So you can't hide anything behind a black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="43">If this were Battlestar Galactica and you're fighting the Cylons, don't hide behind the black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="44">They can see you.</seg>
        <seg id="45">Now, our Sun will not collapse to a black hole -- it's not massive enough -- but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.</seg>
        <seg id="46">And if one were to eclipse the Milky Way, this is what it would look like.</seg>
        <seg id="47">We would see a shadow of that black hole against the hundred billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy and its luminous dust lanes.</seg>
        <seg id="48">And if we were to fall towards this black hole, we would see all of that light lensed around it, and we could even start to cross into that shadow and really not notice that anything dramatic had happened.</seg>
        <seg id="49">It would be bad if we tried to fire our rockets and get out of there because we couldn't, anymore than light can escape.</seg>
        <seg id="50">But even though the black hole is dark from the outside, it's not dark on the inside, because all of the light from the galaxy can fall in behind us.</seg>
        <seg id="51">And even though, due to a relativistic effect known as time dilation, our clocks would seem to slow down relative to galactic time, it would look as though the evolution of the galaxy had been sped up and shot at us, right before we were crushed to death by the black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="52">It would be like a near-death experience where you see the light at the end of the tunnel, but it's a total death experience.</seg>
        <seg id="53">(Laughter) And there's no way of telling anybody about the light at the end of the tunnel.</seg>
        <seg id="54">Now we've never seen a shadow like this of a black hole, but black holes can be heard, even if they're not seen.</seg>
        <seg id="55">Imagine now taking an astrophysically realistic situation -- imagine two black holes that have lived a long life together.</seg>
        <seg id="56">Maybe they started as stars and collapsed to two black holes -- each one 10 times the mass of the Sun.</seg>
        <seg id="57">So now we're going to crush them down to 60 kilometers across.</seg>
        <seg id="58">They can be spinning hundreds of times a second.</seg>
        <seg id="59">At the end of their lives, they're going around each other very near the speed of light.</seg>
        <seg id="60">So they're crossing thousands of kilometers in a fraction of a second, and as they do so, they not only curve space, but they leave behind in their wake a ringing of space, an actual wave on space-time.</seg>
        <seg id="61">Space squeezes and stretches as it emanates out from these black holes banging on the universe.</seg>
        <seg id="62">And they travel out into the cosmos at the speed of light.</seg>
        <seg id="63">This computer simulation is due to a relativity group at NASA Goddard.</seg>
        <seg id="64">It took almost 30 years for anyone in the world to crack this problem.</seg>
        <seg id="65">This was one of the groups.</seg>
        <seg id="66">It shows two black holes in orbit around each other, again, with these helpfully painted curves.</seg>
        <seg id="67">And if you can see -- it's kind of faint -- but if you can see the red waves emanating out, those are the gravitational waves.</seg>
        <seg id="68">They're literally the sounds of space ringing, and they will travel out from these black holes at the speed of light as they ring down and coalesce to one spinning, quiet black hole at the end of the day.</seg>
        <seg id="69">If you were standing near enough, your ear would resonate with the squeezing and stretching of space.</seg>
        <seg id="70">You would literally hear the sound.</seg>
        <seg id="71">Now of course, your head would be squeezed and stretched unhelpfully, so you might have trouble understanding what's going on.</seg>
        <seg id="72">But I'd like to play for you the sound that we predict.</seg>
        <seg id="73">This is from my group -- a slightly less glamorous computer modeling.</seg>
        <seg id="74">Imagine a lighter black hole falling into a very heavy black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="75">The sound you're hearing is the light black hole banging on space each time it gets close.</seg>
        <seg id="76">If it gets far away, it's a little too quiet.</seg>
        <seg id="77">But it comes in like a mallet, and it literally cracks space, wobbling it like a drum.</seg>
        <seg id="78">And we can predict what the sound will be.</seg>
        <seg id="79">We know that, as it falls in, it gets faster and it gets louder.</seg>
        <seg id="80">And eventually, we're going to hear the little guy just fall into the bigger guy.</seg>
        <seg id="81">Now I've never heard it that loud -- it's actually more dramatic.</seg>
        <seg id="82">At home it sounds kind of anticlimactic.</seg>
        <seg id="83">It's sort of like ding, ding, ding.</seg>
        <seg id="84">This is another sound from my group.</seg>
        <seg id="85">No, I'm not showing you any images, because black holes don't leave behind helpful trails of ink, and space is not painted, showing you the curves.</seg>
        <seg id="86">But if you were to float by in space on a space holiday and you heard this, you want to get moving.</seg>
        <seg id="87">(Laughter) Want to get away from the sound.</seg>
        <seg id="88">Both black holes are moving.</seg>
        <seg id="89">Both black holes are getting closer together.</seg>
        <seg id="90">In this case, they're both wobbling quite a lot.</seg>
        <seg id="91">And then they're going to merge.</seg>
        <seg id="92">Now that chirp is very characteristic of black holes merging -- that it chirps up at the end.</seg>
        <seg id="93">Now that's our prediction for what we'll see.</seg>
        <seg id="94">Luckily we're at this safe distance in Long Beach, California.</seg>
        <seg id="95">And surely, somewhere in the universe two black holes have merged.</seg>
        <seg id="96">And surely, the space around us is ringing after traveling maybe a million light years, or a million years, at the speed of light to get to us.</seg>
        <seg id="97">But the sound is too quiet for any of us to ever hear.</seg>
        <seg id="98">There are very industrious experiments being built on Earth -- one called LIGO -- which will detect deviations in the squeezing and stretching of space at less than the fraction of a nucleus of an atom over four kilometers.</seg>
        <seg id="99">It's a remarkably ambitious experiment, and it's going to be at advanced sensitivity within the next few years -- to pick this up.</seg>
        <seg id="100">There's also a mission proposed for space, which hopefully will launch in the next ten years, called LISA.</seg>
        <seg id="101">And LISA will be able to see super-massive black holes -- black holes millions or billions of times the mass of the Sun.</seg>
        <seg id="102">In this Hubble image, we see two galaxies.</seg>
        <seg id="103">They look like they're frozen in some embrace.</seg>
        <seg id="104">And each one probably harbors a super-massive black hole at its core.</seg>
        <seg id="105">But they're not frozen; they're actually merging.</seg>
        <seg id="106">These two black holes are colliding, and they will merge over a billion-year time scale.</seg>
        <seg id="107">It's beyond our human perception to pick up a song of that duration.</seg>
        <seg id="108">But LISA could see the final stages of two super-massive black holes earlier in the universe's history, the last 15 minutes before they fall together.</seg>
        <seg id="109">And it's not just black holes, but it's also any big disturbance in the universe -- and the biggest of them all is the Big Bang.</seg>
        <seg id="110">When that expression was coined, it was derisive -- like, "Oh, who would believe in a Big Bang?"</seg>
        <seg id="111">This animation from my friends at Proton Studios shows looking at the Big Bang from the outside.</seg>
        <seg id="112">We don't ever want to do that actually. We want to be inside the universe because there's no such thing as standing outside the universe.</seg>
        <seg id="113">So imagine you're inside the Big Bang.</seg>
        <seg id="114">It's everywhere, it's all around you, and the space is wobbling chaotically.</seg>
        <seg id="115">Fourteen billion years pass and this song is still ringing all around us.</seg>
        <seg id="116">Galaxies form, and generations of stars form in those galaxies, and around one star, at least one star, is a habitable planet.</seg>
        <seg id="117">And here we are frantically building these experiments, doing these calculations, writing these computer codes.</seg>
        <seg id="118">Imagine a billion years ago, two black holes collided.</seg>
        <seg id="119">That song has been ringing through space for all that time.</seg>
        <seg id="120">We weren't even here.</seg>
        <seg id="121">It gets closer and closer -- 40,000 years ago, we're still doing cave paintings.</seg>
        <seg id="122">If it was the Big Bang we were going to pick up, it would sound like this.</seg>
        <seg id="123">It's literally the definition of noise.</seg>
        <seg id="124">It's white noise; it's such a chaotic ringing.</seg>
        <seg id="125">But it's around us everywhere, presumably, if it hasn't been wiped out by some other process in the universe.</seg>
        <seg id="126">And if we pick it up, it will be music to our ears because it will be the quiet echo of that moment of our creation, of our observable universe.</seg>
        <seg id="127">So within the next few years, we'll be able to turn up the soundtrack a little bit, render the universe in audio.</seg>
        <seg id="128">But if we detect those earliest moments, it'll bring us that much closer to an understanding of the Big Bang, which brings us that much closer to asking some of the hardest, most elusive, questions.</seg>
        <seg id="129">If we run the movie of our universe backwards, we know that there was a Big Bang in our past, and we might even hear the cacophonous sound of it, but was our Big Bang the only Big Bang?</seg>
        <seg id="130">I mean we have to ask, has it happened before?</seg>
        <seg id="131">Will it happen again?</seg>
        <seg id="132">I mean, in the spirit of rising to TED's challenge to reignite wonder, we can ask questions, at least for this last minute, that honestly might evade us forever.</seg>
        <seg id="133">But we have to ask: Is it possible that our universe is just a plume off of some greater history?</seg>
        <seg id="134">Or, is it possible that we're just a branch off of a multiverse -- each branch with its own Big Bang in its past -- maybe some of them with black holes playing drums, maybe some without -- maybe some with sentient life, and maybe some without -- not in our past, not in our future, but somehow fundamentally connected to us?</seg>
        <seg id="135">So we have to wonder, if there is a multiverse, in some other patch of that multiverse, are there creatures?</seg>
        <seg id="136">Here's my multiverse creatures.</seg>
        <seg id="137">Are there other creatures in the multiverse, wondering about us and wondering about their own origins?</seg>
        <seg id="138">And if they are, I can imagine them as we are, calculating, writing computer code, building instruments, trying to detect that faintest sound of their origins and wondering who else is out there.</seg>
        <seg id="139">Thank you. Thank you.</seg>

  <hyp system="Facebook-AI" lang="en">
      <p>
        <seg id="1">I want you to think for a second about the fact that almost all of our knowledge about the universe comes from light.</seg>
        <seg id="2">We stand on Earth and see stars in the night sky with the naked eye.</seg>
        <seg id="3">The bright Sun can burn the retina of the eye,</seg>
        <seg id="4">but we see the same light in the reflection of the moon.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Since the time of Galileo, who observed the heavenly bodies with his primitive telescope, we have been contemplating the universe thanks to the light that passes through the vast ages of cosmic history.</seg>
        <seg id="6">With the help of modern telescopes, we have been able to assemble a stunning silent movie of the universe, spanning our entire history up to the Big Bang.</seg>
        <seg id="7">However, the movie is not devoid of sound, because the universe is not silent.</seg>
        <seg id="8">I want to prove to you that the universe has its own sound track, and it is "reproduced" by the cosmos itself, because outer space vibrates like a drum.</seg>
        <seg id="9">It carries distinctive sounds that accompany the most striking events as they happen.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Today we would like to complement the luxurious visual image of the universe we have with a soundtrack.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Until now, we have never heard sounds from space, but in the near future we should listen carefully to what is happening there.</seg>
        <seg id="12">So, in order to record the "song" of the universe, we focused on black holes as the most promising objects, because they "beat" space-time like a bell, and give a characteristic sound.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Maybe one day we'll see a shadow cast by a black hole against a bright background, but we haven't seen that yet.</seg>
        <seg id="14">However, a black hole, although invisible, can be heard because it "beats" space-time like a drum.</seg>
        <seg id="15">The assumption that the cosmos is like the membrane of a drum belongs to Albert Einstein, to whom we owe so much.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Einstein concluded that if space were empty, if the universe were empty, it would look like this picture, except, of course, for the grid.</seg>
        <seg id="17">If we were free-falling through space, even without a convenient coordinate grid, we could mentally picture it ourselves, because we would notice that we are moving in a straight line, in a straight line through the universe.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Einstein also realized - and this is the crux of the matter - that if you put energy or mass into the universe, it will cause space to curve, and a free-falling object will curve around, for example, the sun, deviating along natural curves in space.</seg>
        <seg id="19">It was Einstein's great general theory of relativity.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Even light bends in this way.</seg>
        <seg id="21">The deflection can be so strong that the object will simply fall into orbit, and will revolve around the Sun like the Earth, or like the Moon around the Earth.</seg>
        <seg id="22">These are natural curves in space.</seg>
        <seg id="23">But Einstein did not understand this - if you take our Sun and compress it to 6 kilometers in diameter, that is, a mass 1 million times heavier than the Earth can fit in an object with a diameter of 6 km, you will get a black hole so dense that light that passes too close to it will never escape.</seg>
        <seg id="24">However, he always considered black holes to be just a mathematical curiosity.</seg>
        <seg id="25">Einstein did not believe they existed in reality.</seg>
        <seg id="26">He believed that nature itself should protect us from their appearance.</seg>
        <seg id="27">It took decades before the term "black hole" was invented and people realized that they are real astrophysical objects - in fact, they are very massive stars in a posthumous state, catastrophically collapsed at the end of their life cycle.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Our sun will not turn into a black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="29">Its mass is not enough for that.</seg>
        <seg id="30">But we'll do a little thought experiment - Einstein loved them - and imagine the sun shrinking to 6 kilometers in diameter, with a tiny Earth orbiting it, about 30 kilometers from the sun's black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="31">This Earth is luminous, the Sun is no more, and there is no other source of light, so let us make our little Earth self-luminous.</seg>
        <seg id="32">It turns out that we can put the Earth in a very close orbit, only 30 km from this black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="33">It's not much bigger than Manhattan.</seg>
        <seg id="34">Maybe it would have caught a bit of the Hudson before it destroyed the Earth.</seg>
        <seg id="35">But that is about the size of it.</seg>
        <seg id="36">We're talking about an object that would take up about 1/2 the area of Manhattan.</seg>
        <seg id="37">So, if we put this Earth very close - just 30 km away - we will notice that it perfectly orbits the black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="38">It's kind of a myth that black holes swallow everything indiscriminately - you have to get really close to get in.</seg>
        <seg id="39">But what's amazing is that from our vantage point, we'll see Earth all the time.</seg>
        <seg id="40">She can't hide behind a black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="41">Some of the light that the Earth emits is absorbed by the hole, but some of it goes around it and comes back to us.</seg>
        <seg id="42">So you can't hide anything behind a black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="43">If you ever find yourself on Battlestar Galactica, fighting the Cylons, don't hide behind a black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="44">They will see you!</seg>
        <seg id="45">Our sun will not turn into a black hole - it is not massive enough for that. But there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.</seg>
        <seg id="46">And if one of them eclipsed the Milky Way, this is what it would look like.</seg>
        <seg id="47">We would see the shadow of a black hole against a background of hundreds of billions of stars and glowing dust.</seg>
        <seg id="48">If we were on the verge of falling into this black hole, we would see all this light bending around it, and even already entering this shadow, we would not notice the near catastrophe.</seg>
        <seg id="49">It would be useless to start the engines and try to get out, because nothing, including light, can escape from it.</seg>
        <seg id="50">Although a black hole looks like one from the outside, it is not dark inside, since all light falls into it with us.</seg>
        <seg id="51">According to a relativistic effect known as time dilation, our clocks would appear to slow down relative to galactic time, but we would instead see the evolution of the galaxy speed up in the moments before death inside the black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="52">It would be like a near-death experience where you see the light at the end of the tunnel, only not "near" but absolutely mortal.</seg>
        <seg id="53">(Laughter) And you can't tell anybody about the light at the end of the tunnel.</seg>
        <seg id="54">Scientists have not yet been able to see the shadow of a black hole, but we can hear it, albeit invisible.</seg>
        <seg id="55">Let's imagine a real astrophysical situation - two black holes that have lived a long life together.</seg>
        <seg id="56">They may have started out as stars before turning into black holes, each 10 times more massive than the sun.</seg>
        <seg id="57">Let's compress them to 60 km in diameter.</seg>
        <seg id="58">They can spin rapidly: hundreds of revolutions per second.</seg>
        <seg id="59">At the end of their life cycle, they orbit each other at nearly the speed of light.</seg>
        <seg id="60">They cover thousands of kilometers in a fraction of a second, and not only do they warp space, but they also leave a trace: they cause oscillations, a wave trail in space-time.</seg>
        <seg id="61">Space shrinks and stretches, freeing itself from these black holes rippling through the universe.</seg>
        <seg id="62">And they travel through space at the speed of light.</seg>
        <seg id="63">This computer simulation is from Goddard's relativity group at NASA.</seg>
        <seg id="64">For almost 30 years, scientists around the world have struggled with this problem.</seg>
        <seg id="65">It was one of the groups.</seg>
        <seg id="66">You see two black holes orbiting each other - and again, the curves are clearly shown here.</seg>
        <seg id="67">If you see - it turned out a bit pale - they emit red waves, gravitational waves.</seg>
        <seg id="68">These are the sounds of vibrating space, and they will emanate from these black holes at the speed of light as they fall silent and merge into one spinning, silent black hole - this is the outcome.</seg>
        <seg id="69">If you were standing close enough, your ear would resonate as the space was compressed and stretched.</seg>
        <seg id="70">You would actually hear the sound.</seg>
        <seg id="71">Of course, your head would also shrink and stretch, so it would be hard for you to understand what was going on.</seg>
        <seg id="72">But I would like to play you this sound as we predict it.</seg>
        <seg id="73">This is the work of my group, so the graphics here are more modest.</seg>
        <seg id="74">Imagine a light black hole falling into a very heavy one.</seg>
        <seg id="75">The sound you hear is a slight hole, bending the space, approaching step by step to the end.</seg>
        <seg id="76">If it is removed, the sound becomes quieter.</seg>
        <seg id="77">But it is like a hammer that "hits" a space that vibrates like a membrane.</seg>
        <seg id="78">And we can predict what that sound will be.</seg>
        <seg id="79">We know that as the hole gets swallowed up, it gets faster and louder.</seg>
        <seg id="80">In the end, we will hear how a small hole just falls into a big one.</seg>
        <seg id="81">I've never heard a recording so loud - it's really quite impressive.</seg>
        <seg id="82">At home it is much more modest.</seg>
        <seg id="83">Just quiet clicks.</seg>
        <seg id="84">It's a different sound created by my band.</seg>
        <seg id="85">I'm not showing you a picture here, because black holes don't leave visual traces, there are no visible curves in space.</seg>
        <seg id="86">If you were going on a space cruise and you heard a sound like that, I would recommend leaving as soon as possible.</seg>
        <seg id="87">(Laughter) Away from that sound.</seg>
        <seg id="88">Both black holes are moving.</seg>
        <seg id="89">They approach each other.</seg>
        <seg id="90">In this case, they both fluctuate wildly.</seg>
        <seg id="91">And now there will be a merger.</seg>
        <seg id="92">This "chirp" is very characteristic of merging black holes, this is the acceleration at the end.</seg>
        <seg id="93">We guess that's what it would sound like.</seg>
        <seg id="94">Fortunately, we are now at a safe distance, in Long Beach, California.</seg>
        <seg id="95">Undoubtedly, somewhere in the universe, two black holes are merging.</seg>
        <seg id="96">And without a doubt, the space around us vibrates, and these vibrations may have traveled millions of light years, that is, a million years moving towards us at the speed of light.</seg>
        <seg id="97">But the sound is too quiet, we can't hear it.</seg>
        <seg id="98">Today there is a very complex project: LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) - it monitors deviations in the oscillations of space, the smallest - by the size of the nucleus of an atom by 4 kilometers.</seg>
        <seg id="99">This is an extremely ambitious experiment, and the next few years will be devoted to capturing such waves.</seg>
        <seg id="100">One space program is also planned, which will hopefully be launched in the next 10 years: LICA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna).</seg>
        <seg id="101">It will be able to see supermassive black holes that are millions and billions of times more massive than the Sun.</seg>
        <seg id="102">In this picture from the Hubble telescope we see two galaxies.</seg>
        <seg id="103">They look like they are frozen in a kind of "hug,"</seg>
        <seg id="104">and each is likely to have a supermassive black hole at its core.</seg>
        <seg id="105">But they are not frozen. In fact, they are merging.</seg>
        <seg id="106">These two black holes are colliding, and it will last for more than a billion years.</seg>
        <seg id="107">It is beyond our comprehension to hear a song of this length.</seg>
        <seg id="108">But LIKA can see the finale of the merger of two supermassive black holes that began a long time ago: the last 15 minutes of this action.</seg>
        <seg id="109">We are not only talking about black holes, but also about any serious trouble in the universe, and the most important of them is the Big Bang.</seg>
        <seg id="110">When the expression was coined, it was ironic - "who would believe in the Big Bang?"</seg>
        <seg id="111">This animation from my friend at Proton Studios shows the Big Bang from the outside.</seg>
        <seg id="112">Any observer would like to be inside at this moment, because it is impossible to be outside the universe.</seg>
        <seg id="113">Imagine you are inside the Big Bang.</seg>
        <seg id="114">It's all around you and the space is vibrating chaotically.</seg>
        <seg id="115">It's been 14 billion years, and that song is still around.</seg>
        <seg id="116">Galaxies are born, and in them are generations of star forms. And around one star, at least one, there is a habitable planet.</seg>
        <seg id="117">And here we persist in conducting these experiments, making calculations, writing programs.</seg>
        <seg id="118">Imagine - a billion years ago, two black holes collided.</seg>
        <seg id="119">All the while, their song is playing in space.</seg>
        <seg id="120">We're not even born yet.</seg>
        <seg id="121">The sound is getting closer and closer - 40,000 years ago, we're still making cave paintings.</seg>
        <seg id="122">If we were going to "hear" the Big Bang, it would sound like this.</seg>
        <seg id="123">Noise in its purest form.</seg>
        <seg id="124">It's white noise, just random sounds.</seg>
        <seg id="125">But it is probably all around us, unless it has been drowned out by some other process in the universe.</seg>
        <seg id="126">And if we catch it, it will be the most pleasant music for us, because it is a quiet echo of the moment of our creation, the birth of the observable universe.</seg>
        <seg id="127">Over the next few years, we'll be able to turn up the volume a bit and hear the universe in sound.</seg>
        <seg id="128">But if we catch an echo of those early events, it will bring us much closer to understanding the Big Bang, and that will allow us to ask some of the most difficult, elusive questions.</seg>
        <seg id="129">If we play the movie of our universe backwards, we will know that in the past there was a Big Bang, and perhaps we will even hear its cacophony, but was this explosion the only one?</seg>
        <seg id="130">I mean, hasn't it happened before?</seg>
        <seg id="131">Will it happen again?</seg>
        <seg id="132">In the spirit of TED urging us to reclaim our faith in miracles, we can now ask the questions that have always eluded us.</seg>
        <seg id="133">But we have to ask: Is it possible that our universe is just a trace of some bigger story?</seg>
        <seg id="134">Or - are we just one of the branches of the multiverse - each of which had its own Big Bang in the past? Maybe with black holes and their "songs," or without them, maybe with intelligent life, and maybe without - they are not in our past, not in our future, but somehow connected to us?</seg>
        <seg id="135">We will ask, in such a multiverse, in its other branches, is there life there?</seg>
        <seg id="136">Here are my fellow multiverses.</seg>
        <seg id="137">But are there other creatures out there who wonder about us, and about their origins?</seg>
        <seg id="138">And if they are, I can imagine them calculating like us, building instruments, trying to detect that faint sound of the moment of their creation, and thinking - who else is there but us?</seg>

      <p>
        <seg id="1">I want you to think for a second that almost all our knowledge of the universe is derived from light.</seg>
        <seg id="2">We stand on Earth and with the naked eye see stars in the night sky.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Bright Sun can burn the retina of the eye,</seg>
        <seg id="4">but this same light we see in the reflection of the moon.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Since Galileo, who observed celestial bodies into his primitive telescope, we have been contemplating the universe thanks to light passing through the heedless ages of cosmic history.</seg>
        <seg id="6">With state-of-the-art telescopes, we were able to put together a stunning silent film about the universe, spanning our entire history right up to the Big Bang.</seg>
        <seg id="7">However, cinema is not without sound at all, because the universe is not voiceless.</seg>
        <seg id="8">I want to prove to you that the universe has its own sound track, and it is “played” by the cosmos itself, because outer space vibrates like a drum.</seg>
        <seg id="9">It features peculiar sounds that accompany the most vivid events as they occur.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Today, we would like to complement the luxurious visual image of the universe we have with a soundtrack.</seg>
        <seg id="11">So far, we've never heard sounds from space, but we should listen carefully to what's going on there any time soon.</seg>
        <seg id="12">So, in order to record the “song” of the universe, we focused on black holes as the most promising objects, because they “beat” in space-time as a bell, and give a characteristic sound. Now you'll hear what we think this song will sound like.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Maybe one day we'll see the shadow that the black hole casts away in a bright background, but we haven't seen such a thing yet.</seg>
        <seg id="14">However, the black hole, however invisible, can be heard as it “beats” in space-time as a drum.</seg>
        <seg id="15">The assumption that space is like a drum membrane belongs to Albert Einstein, to whom we owe so much.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Einstein concluded that if space were empty, if the universe were empty, it would look like in this pic, except, of course, for such a visual grid.</seg>
        <seg id="17">If we were to fall freely through space, even without a convenient coordinate grid, mentally we could image it ourselves, as we would notice that we were moving in a straight straight straight way through the universe.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Einstein also understood — and that's the very essence — that if you put energy or mass into the universe, it would cause space to warp, and a free-falling object would envelope, for example, the Sun, veering along natural curves in space.</seg>
        <seg id="19">It was Einstein's great general theory of relativity.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Even light curves along such a trajectory.</seg>
        <seg id="21">The deflection can be so severe that an object will simply get into orbit, and will orbit the Sun as Earth, or as the Moon — around Earth.</seg>
        <seg id="22">These are natural contortions in space.</seg>
        <seg id="23">And then Einstein didn't understand — if you take our Sun and compress it to 6 kilometers in diameter, a mass 1 million times heavier than Earth in an object 6 km in diameter, it would turn out to be a black hole, so dense that the light that passed too close to it will never break out. A dark shadow in the universe.</seg>
        <seg id="24">However, he always considered black holes to be merely a mathematical curiosities.</seg>
        <seg id="25">Einstein didn't believe they existed in reality.</seg>
        <seg id="26">He believed that nature should protect us itself from their appearance.</seg>
        <seg id="27">Decades passed before the term “black hole” was invented, and people realized that they were real astrophysical objects — in fact, they are very massive stars in a posthumous state, catastrophically destroyed at the end of their life cycle.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Our Sun will not turn into a black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="29">Its mass isn't enough for that.</seg>
        <seg id="30">But we'll do a little thought experiment — Enstein loved them very much — and imagine how the Sun shrinks to 6 kilometers in diameter, and around it the tiny Earth revolves around it, about 30 km away black hole of the sun.</seg>
        <seg id="31">This Earth is glowing, the Sun is no longer there, and there is no other light source, so we will make our little Earth self-luminous.</seg>
        <seg id="32">Turns out we can put Earth in a very close orbit, just 30km from that black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="33">It is not much larger than Manhattan in size.</seg>
        <seg id="34">Perhaps she would have hooked a little bit and Hudson before destroying Earth.</seg>
        <seg id="35">But the scale is roughly so.</seg>
        <seg id="36">We're talking about a facility that would occupy roughly 1/2 of Manhattan's area.</seg>
        <seg id="37">So, putting this Earth very close — just 30 km away — we'll notice that it orbits perfectly around a black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="38">It's kind of a myth that black holes absorb everything indiscriminately — you have to get very close to it.</seg>
        <seg id="39">But what's striking — from our perspective, we're going to see Earth all the time.</seg>
        <seg id="40">She can't hide behind a black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="41">Some of the light the Earth emits is absorbed by the hole, but part of it kind of envelops it and returns back to us.</seg>
        <seg id="42">So nothing can be hidden behind a black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="43">If you suddenly get into the Star Cruiser Galaxy series and fight Cylons, don't hide behind a black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="44">They'll see you!</seg>
        <seg id="45">Our Sun will not turn into a black hole — it's not massive enough for that. But there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.</seg>
        <seg id="46">And if one of them had obscured the Milky Way, that's what it would look like.</seg>
        <seg id="47">We would see the shadow of a black hole amid hundreds of billions of stars and glowing dust.</seg>
        <seg id="48">If we were on the verge of falling into this black hole, we would have seen all that light enveloping it, and even already entering that shadow, would not notice a near disaster.</seg>
        <seg id="49">It would already be useless to start the engines and try to get out because nothing, including the light, can escape from it.</seg>
        <seg id="50">Although the black hole looks so on the outside, it is not dark inside, as all the light falls into it with us.</seg>
        <seg id="51">According to the relativistic effect known as time stretching, our clocks as if it would slow down its course relative to the galactic time, but we would, by contrast, see the evolution of the galaxy in accelerated by a blink to death inside the black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="52">It would be like a near-death experience where you see light at the end of the tunnel, but only not “about” but absolutely mortal.</seg>
        <seg id="53">(Laughter) And you won't tell anyone about the light at the end of the tunnel.</seg>
        <seg id="54">Scientists haven't been able to see the shadow of the black hole yet, but we can hear it, however unseen.</seg>
        <seg id="55">Let's imagine the real astrophysical situation — two black holes that have lived together a long life.</seg>
        <seg id="56">Perhaps they were stars first and then turned into black holes. Each is 10 times heavier than the Sun.</seg>
        <seg id="57">Squeeze them up to 60 km in diameter.</seg>
        <seg id="58">They can spin quickly: hundreds of revolutions per second.</seg>
        <seg id="59">At the end of their life cycle, they rotate around each other at virtually the speed of light.</seg>
        <seg id="60">They cover thousands of km in a fraction of a second, and not only curve space, but also leave behind them a trail: cause oscillations, a wave trail in space-time.</seg>
        <seg id="61">Space shrinks and stretches, liberating themselves from these black holes fluctuating in the universe.</seg>
        <seg id="62">And they travel through space at the speed of light.</seg>
        <seg id="63">This computer simulation is done by Goddard's team at NASA studying the theory of relativity.</seg>
        <seg id="64">For almost 30 years the world's scientists have been bashing over the problem</seg>
        <seg id="65">It was one of the groups.</seg>
        <seg id="66">You see two black holes spinning around each other — and again here clearly depicts curves.</seg>
        <seg id="67">If you see — a little pale turned out — they emit red waves, gravitational waves.</seg>
        <seg id="68">That is the sounds of vibrating space, and they will come from these black holes at the speed of light while they quieten and merge into one rotating, quiet black hole — that is the outcome.</seg>
        <seg id="69">If you stood close enough, your ear would resonate, as space squeezed and stretched.</seg>
        <seg id="70">You would actually hear the sound.</seg>
        <seg id="71">Sure, and your head would shrink and stretch, so you would have a hard time understanding what was going on.</seg>
        <seg id="72">But I'd like to play you that sound like we predict it.</seg>
        <seg id="73">It's my band's work, so the graphics here are more ambling.</seg>
        <seg id="74">Imagine a light black hole falling into a very heavy one.</seg>
        <seg id="75">The sound you hear produces a light hole, bending out space, coming step by step to the end.</seg>
        <seg id="76">If it is removed, the sound becomes quieter.</seg>
        <seg id="77">But it is like a hammer “bumping” into a space that vibrates like a membrane.</seg>
        <seg id="78">And we can predict what that sound will be.</seg>
        <seg id="79">We know that as the hole absorbs, it gets faster and louder.</seg>
        <seg id="80">At the end we'll hear the little hole just fall into the big one.</seg>
        <seg id="81">I haven't heard the record so loud yet — really, quite impressive.</seg>
        <seg id="82">It turns out much more modest at home.</seg>
        <seg id="83">Just quiet clicks.</seg>
        <seg id="84">It's a different sound made by my band.</seg>
        <seg id="85">I'm not showing you the picture here, as black holes leave no visual marks behind them, there are no visible curves in space.</seg>
        <seg id="86">If you went on a space cruise and heard that sound, I'd recommend flying off soon.</seg>
        <seg id="87">(Laughter) Away from that sound.</seg>
        <seg id="88">Both black holes move.</seg>
        <seg id="89">They approach each other.</seg>
        <seg id="90">In this case, they both fluctuate greatly.</seg>
        <seg id="91">And now there will be a merger.</seg>
        <seg id="92">This “dragonfly” is very characteristic of fusing black holes, this is the acceleration at the end.</seg>
        <seg id="93">We assume it would have sounded exactly like that.</seg>
        <seg id="94">Thankfully, we're a safe distance right now, in Long Beach in California.</seg>
        <seg id="95">Undoubtedly, somewhere in the universe, two black holes merge.</seg>
        <seg id="96">And without question, the space around us is vibrating, and these oscillations may have passed millions of light years, meaning a million years moved towards us at the speed of light.</seg>

        <seg id="108">But LIKA could see the finale of the fusion of two superheavy black holes that began a long time ago: the last 15 minutes of this action.</seg>
        <seg id="109">We're not just talking about black holes, but any serious overshits in the universe, and the most important one is the Big Bang.</seg>

        <seg id="5">Since the time of Galileo, who observed the heavenly bodies through his primitive telescope, we have been observing the universe through the light that passes through the vast ages of cosmic history.</seg>
        <seg id="6">With the help of modern telescopes, we were able to put together a stunning silent film about the Universe, covering our entire history up to the Big Bang.</seg>
        <seg id="7">However, this movie is not at all devoid of sound, because the Universe is not silent.</seg>
        <seg id="8">I want to prove to you that the Universe has its own sound track, and it is" played " by the cosmos itself, because outer space vibrates like a drum.</seg>
        <seg id="9">It carries peculiar sounds that accompany the most vivid events as they occur.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Today, we would like to complement the luxurious visual image of the universe that we have with a soundtrack.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Until now, we have never heard sounds from outer space, but in the near future, we should listen carefully to what is happening there.</seg>
        <seg id="12">So, in order to record the" song "of the Universe, we focused on black holes as the most promising objects, because they "beat" space-time like a bell, and give a characteristic sound. Now you will hear how, in our opinion, this song will sound.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Maybe one day we will see the shadow that a black hole casts when it appears on a bright background, but so far we have not observed this.</seg>
        <seg id="14">However, a black hole, even if invisible, can be heard because it" beats " space-time like a drum.</seg>
        <seg id="15">The suggestion that the cosmos is like the membrane of a drum belongs to Albert Einstein, to whom we owe so much.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Einstein concluded that if space were empty, if the universe were empty, it would look like this picture, except, of course, for such a visual grid.</seg>
        <seg id="17">If we were free-falling through space, even without a convenient coordinate grid, we could mentally draw it ourselves, since we would notice that we were moving in a straight line, strictly in a straight line through the universe.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Einstein also realized — and this is the point — that if you put energy or mass into the universe, it will cause space to bend, and a free-falling object will bend around, for example, the Sun, deviating along the natural curves in space.</seg>
        <seg id="19">This was Einstein's great general theory of relativity.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Even light bends along this path.</seg>
        <seg id="21">The deviation can be so strong that the object will simply fall into orbit, and will rotate around the Sun like the Earth, or like the Moon-around the Earth.</seg>
        <seg id="22">These are natural curvatures in space.</seg>
        <seg id="23">But Einstein did not understand this — if you take our Sun and compress it to 6 kilometers in diameter, that is, a mass 1 million times heavier than the Earth to fit in an object with a diameter of 6 km, you will get a black hole so dense that the light that passed too close to it will never escape. A dark shadow in the universe.</seg>
        <seg id="24">However, he always considered black holes to be just a mathematical curiosity.</seg>
        <seg id="25">Einstein did not believe that they existed in reality.</seg>
        <seg id="26">He believed that nature itself should protect us from their appearance.</seg>
        <seg id="27">It took decades before the term "black hole" was coined, and people realized that they were real astrophysical objects — in fact, they are very massive stars in a postmortem state, catastrophically destroyed at the end of their life cycle.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Our Sun will not turn into a black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="29">Its mass is not enough for this.</seg>
        <seg id="30">But we'll do a little thought experiment — Einstein was very fond of them — and imagine the Sun shrinking to 6 kilometers in diameter, and a tiny Earth orbiting around it, about 30 km from the sun's black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="31">This Earth is glowing, because the Sun is no longer there, as well as any other source of light, so let's make our little Earth self-luminous.</seg>
        <seg id="32">It turns out that we can put the Earth in a very close orbit, just 30 km away from this black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="33">It is not much larger than Manhattan in size.</seg>
        <seg id="34">Perhaps it would have snagged the Hudson a little before destroying the Land.</seg>
        <seg id="35">But the scale is something like this.</seg>
        <seg id="36">We're talking about a facility that would take up about 1/2 the area of Manhattan.</seg>
        <seg id="37">So, putting this Earth very close — just 30 km away — we will notice that it rotates perfectly around the black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="38">It is a kind of myth that black holes consume everything indiscriminately — to get into it, you need to get very close.</seg>
        <seg id="39">But what is striking is that from our vantage point, we will see the Earth all the time.</seg>
        <seg id="40">It can't hide behind a black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="41">Some of the light that the Earth emits is absorbed by the hole, but some of it seems to go around it and come back to us.</seg>
        <seg id="42">So that nothing can be hidden behind a black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="43">If you suddenly find yourself in the TV series "Battlestar Galactica", and you will fight with the Cylons-do not hide behind a black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="44">They'll see you!</seg>
        <seg id="45">Our Sun won't turn into a black hole — it's not massive enough for that. But there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.</seg>
        <seg id="46">And if one of them obscured the Milky Way, this is what it would look like.</seg>
        <seg id="47">We would see the shadow of a black hole against hundreds of billions of stars and glowing dust.</seg>
        <seg id="48">If we were on the verge of falling into this black hole, we would see all this light going around it, and even as we enter this shadow, we would not notice the near catastrophe.</seg>
        <seg id="49">It would be useless to start the engines and try to get out, because nothing, including the light, can escape from it.</seg>
        <seg id="50">Although the black hole looks like this from the outside, it is not dark inside, as all the light falls into it with us.</seg>
        <seg id="51">According to the relativistic effect known as time dilation, our clocks would appear to slow down relative to galactic time, but we would instead see the evolution of the galaxy in accelerated mode a moment before dying inside a black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="52">It would be like a near-death experience, where you see a light at the end of a tunnel, but not" near", but absolutely mortal.</seg>
        <seg id="53">(Laughter) And you can't tell anyone about the light at the end of the tunnel.</seg>
        <seg id="54">Scientists have not yet been able to see the shadow of the black hole, but we can hear it, even if it is invisible.</seg>
        <seg id="55">Imagine a real astrophysical situation — two black holes that have lived together for a long time.</seg>
        <seg id="56">Perhaps they were stars at first, and then turned into black holes. Each of them is 10 times heavier than the Sun.</seg>
        <seg id="57">We will compress them to 60 km in diameter.</seg>
        <seg id="58">They can rotate rapidly: hundreds of revolutions per second.</seg>
        <seg id="59">At the end of their life cycle, they orbit each other at almost the speed of light.</seg>
        <seg id="60">They cover thousands of kilometers in a fraction of a second, and not only do they bend space, but they also leave a trail behind them: they cause vibrations, a wave trail in space-time.</seg>
        <seg id="61">Space is shrinking and stretching, being released from these black holes oscillating in the universe.</seg>
        <seg id="62">And they travel through space at the speed of light.</seg>
        <seg id="63">This computer simulation is made by NASA's Goddard group studying relativity.</seg>
        <seg id="64">For almost 30 years, scientists around the world have struggled with this problem.</seg>
        <seg id="65">It was one of the groups.</seg>
        <seg id="66">You see two black holes rotating around each other — and again, the curves are clearly shown here.</seg>
        <seg id="67">If you see — a little pale-they emit red waves, gravitational waves.</seg>
        <seg id="68">These are the sounds of vibrating space, and they will come out of these black holes at the speed of light as they subside and merge into one spinning, silent black hole — such is the outcome.</seg>
        <seg id="69">If you were standing close enough, your ear would resonate as the space shrinks and stretches.</seg>
        <seg id="70">You would actually hear the sound.</seg>
        <seg id="71">Of course, your head would also shrink and stretch, so it would be difficult for you to understand what is going on.</seg>
        <seg id="72">But I would like to play you this sound, as we predict it.</seg>
        <seg id="73">This is the work of my group, so the graphics here are more modest.</seg>
        <seg id="74">Imagine a light black hole falling into a very heavy one.</seg>
        <seg id="75">The sound you hear is made by a light hole, arching the space, approaching the end step by step.</seg>
        <seg id="76">If it is removed, the sound becomes quieter.</seg>
        <seg id="77">But it is like a hammer "hitting" a space that vibrates like a membrane.</seg>
        <seg id="78">And we can predict what that sound will be like.</seg>
        <seg id="79">We know that as the hole is absorbed, it gets faster and louder.</seg>
        <seg id="80">At the end, we'll hear how a small hole just falls into a large one.</seg>
        <seg id="81">I've never heard a record so loud before — it's really quite impressive.</seg>
        <seg id="82">At home, it turns out much more modest.</seg>
        <seg id="83">Just quiet clicks.</seg>
        <seg id="84">This is a different sound created by my band.</seg>
        <seg id="85">I'm not showing you a picture here, because black holes leave no visible traces behind them, and there are no visible curves in space.</seg>
        <seg id="86">If you were going on a space cruise and you heard a sound like that, I would recommend leaving as soon as possible.</seg>
        <seg id="87">(Laughter) Get away from that sound.</seg>
        <seg id="88">Both black holes are moving.</seg>
        <seg id="89">They approach each other.</seg>
        <seg id="90">In this case, they both fluctuate greatly.</seg>
        <seg id="91">And now there will be a merger.</seg>
        <seg id="92">This "chirping" is very characteristic of merging black holes, this is the acceleration at the end.</seg>
        <seg id="93">We assume it would sound like that.</seg>
        <seg id="94">Fortunately, we are now at a safe distance, in Long Beach, California.</seg>
        <seg id="95">There is no doubt that two black holes are merging somewhere in the universe.</seg>
        <seg id="96">And without a doubt, the space around us is vibrating, and these vibrations may have traveled millions of light-years, that is, a million years moving towards us at the speed of light.</seg>
        <seg id="97">But the sound is too quiet, we can't hear it.</seg>
        <seg id="98">There is a very complex project today: LIGO (Laser-Interferometric Gravitational-wave Observatory) — it tracks deviations in the vibrations of space, the smallest ones-by the size of the atomic nucleus per 4 kilometers.</seg>
        <seg id="99">This is an extremely ambitious experiment, and in the next few years it will be dedicated to capturing such waves.</seg>
        <seg id="100">There is also one space program planned, which I hope will be launched in the next 10 years: LIKA (Laser Interferometric Space Antenna).</seg>
        <seg id="101">It will be able to see super-heavy black holes, millions and billions of times more massive than the Sun.</seg>
        <seg id="102">In this image from the Hubble Telescope, we see two galaxies.</seg>
        <seg id="103">They look as if they are frozen in a kind of " embrace»,</seg>
        <seg id="104">and each of them probably contains a super-heavy black hole in its core.</seg>
        <seg id="105">But they didn't freeze. In fact, they merge.</seg>
        <seg id="106">These two black holes collide, and it will last for more than a billion years.</seg>
        <seg id="107">It is beyond our comprehension to hear a song of such duration.</seg>
        <seg id="108">But LIKA can see the finale of the merger of two heavyweight black holes that began a long time ago: the last 15 minutes of this action.</seg>
        <seg id="109">We're not just talking about black holes, we're talking about every major problem in the universe, and the biggest one is the Big Bang.</seg>
        <seg id="110">When this expression was coined, it was ironic — " they say, who will believe in the Big Bang?»</seg>
        <seg id="111">This animation from my friend at Proton Studios shows a Big Bang from the outside.</seg>
        <seg id="112">Any observer would like to be inside at this moment, because it is impossible to be outside the universe.</seg>
        <seg id="113">Imagine that you are inside the Big Bang.</seg>
        <seg id="114">It is everywhere, all around you, and the space vibrates chaotically.</seg>
        <seg id="115">It's been 14 billion years, and this song is still playing around us.</seg>
        <seg id="116">Galaxies are born, and in them — generations of star forms. And around one star, at least one, there is a habitable planet.</seg>
        <seg id="117">And here we persistently conduct these experiments, make calculations, and write programs.</seg>
        <seg id="118">Imagine-a billion years ago, two black holes collided.</seg>
        <seg id="119">All the while, their song is playing in space.</seg>
        <seg id="120">We haven't even been born yet.</seg>
        <seg id="121">The sound is getting closer, closer and closer-40 thousand years ago, we are still making rock paintings.</seg>
        <seg id="122">If we were going to "hear" the Big Bang, it would sound like this.</seg>
        <seg id="123">Noise in its purest form.</seg>
        <seg id="124">It's white noise, just chaotic sounds.</seg>
        <seg id="125">But it probably surrounds us everywhere, unless it has been drowned out by some other process in the universe.</seg>
        <seg id="126">And if we catch it, it will be the most pleasant music for us, because it is a quiet echo of the moment of our creation, the birth of the observable universe.</seg>
        <seg id="127">Over the next few years, we'll be able to turn up the volume a little bit, and hear the universe in sound.</seg>
        <seg id="128">But if we catch an echo of those early events, it will bring us much closer to understanding the Big Bang, and it will allow us to ask some of the most difficult, elusive questions.</seg>
        <seg id="129">If we play a movie about our universe backwards, we will know that there was a Big Bang in the past, and maybe we will even hear its cacophony, but was this the only explosion?</seg>
        <seg id="130">I mean — did it happen before that?</seg>
        <seg id="131">Will it happen again?</seg>
        <seg id="132">In the spirit of TED encouraging us to regain our faith in miracles, we can now ask questions that have always eluded us.</seg>
        <seg id="133">But we have to ask: is it possible that our universe is just a trace of some more significant history?</seg>
        <seg id="134">Or — aren't we just one branch of the multiverse-each of which has had its own Big Bang in the past? Maybe with or without black holes and their "songs", maybe with or without intelligent life — they are not in our past, not in our future, but somehow connected to us?</seg>
        <seg id="135">We will ask — in such a multiverse, in its other branches, is there life there?</seg>
        <seg id="136">Here are my brothers in the multiverse.</seg>
        <seg id="137">But are there other creatures out there who think about us, and about their origins?</seg>
        <seg id="138">And if they are, I can imagine them doing calculations like we do, building instruments, trying to detect that faint sound of the moment of their creation, and thinking-who else is there but us?</seg>
        <seg id="139">Thanks. Thanks.</seg>
        <seg id="140">(Applause)</seg>

        <seg id="3">A bright sun can burn the retina of the eye -</seg>

        <seg id="67">If you see - a little pale turned out - they emit red waves, gravitational waves.</seg>
        <seg id="68">These are the sounds of vibrating space, and they will come from these black holes at the speed of light as they subside and merge into one rotating, quiet black hole - that is the outcome.</seg>
        <seg id="69">If you stood close enough, your ear would resonate as space shrinks and stretches.</seg>
        <seg id="70">You would actually hear the sound.</seg>
        <seg id="71">Of course, your head would also shrink and stretch, so it would be difficult for you to understand what was going on.</seg>
        <seg id="72">But I would like to lose you this sound, as we predict it.</seg>
        <seg id="73">This is the work of my group, so the schedule here is more modest.</seg>
        <seg id="74">Imagine a light black hole falling into a very heavy one.</seg>
        <seg id="75">The sound you hear emits a light hole, flexing space as you approach the end step by step.</seg>
        <seg id="76">If it is removed, the sound becomes quieter.</seg>
        <seg id="77">But it is like a hammer "hitting" a space that vibrates like a membrane.</seg>
        <seg id="78">And we can predict what that sound will be like.</seg>
        <seg id="79">We know that as the hole is absorbed, it gets faster and louder.</seg>
        <seg id="80">At the end, we will hear how a small hole just falls into a large one.</seg>
        <seg id="81">I haven't heard the recording so loud yet - it's really quite impressive.</seg>
        <seg id="82">At home it turns out to be much more modest.</seg>
        <seg id="83">Just quiet clicks.</seg>
        <seg id="84">It's a different sound created by my band.</seg>
        <seg id="85">Here I do not show you a picture, since black holes leave no visible traces, there are no visible curves in space.</seg>
        <seg id="86">If you went on a space cruise and heard such a sound, I would recommend flying away as soon as possible.</seg>
        <seg id="87">(Laughter) Away from that sound.</seg>
        <seg id="88">Both black holes are moving.</seg>
        <seg id="89">They approach each other.</seg>
        <seg id="90">In this case, they both fluctuate a lot.</seg>
        <seg id="91">And now there will be a merger.</seg>
        <seg id="92">This "dragging" is very characteristic of merging black holes, this is the acceleration at the end.</seg>
        <seg id="93">We assume that this would be the case.</seg>
        <seg id="94">Fortunately, we are now at a safe distance, in Long Beach, California.</seg>
        <seg id="95">There is no doubt that two black holes merge somewhere in the universe.</seg>
        <seg id="96">And without a doubt, the space around us is vibrating, and these oscillations may have passed millions of light years, that is, a million years have moved towards us at the speed of light.</seg>
        <seg id="97">But the sound is too quiet, we can't hear it.</seg>
        <seg id="98">Today there is a very complex project: LIGO (Laser-Interferometric Gravitational-Wave Observatory) - it tracks deviations in space fluctuations, the smallest - by the size of the nucleus of the atom by 4 kilometers.</seg>
        <seg id="99">This is an extremely ambitious experiment, and in the next few years it will be dedicated to capturing such waves.</seg>
        <seg id="100">One space programme is also planned, which I hope will be launched in the next 10 years: LIKA (Laser Interferometric Space Antenna).</seg>
        <seg id="101">It will be able to see super-heavy black holes, millions and billions of times more massive than the Sun.</seg>
        <seg id="102">In this image from the Hubble telescope, we see two galaxies.</seg>
        <seg id="103">They look like they're frozen in a kind of "hug,"</seg>
        <seg id="104">and each of them probably contains a super-heavy black hole in its core.</seg>
        <seg id="105">But they didn't freeze. In fact, they merge.</seg>
        <seg id="106">These two black holes collide, and it will last more than a billion years.</seg>
        <seg id="107">It's beyond our comprehension to hear a song of this length.</seg>
        <seg id="108">But LIKA can see the finale of the merger of two super-heavy black holes, which began a long time ago: the last 15 minutes of this action.</seg>
        <seg id="109">We are talking not only about black holes, but also about any serious disturbances in the universe, and the most important of them is the Big Bang.</seg>
        <seg id="110">When this expression was coined, it was ironic - "they say, who will believe in the Big Bang?"</seg>
        <seg id="111">This animation from my friend from Proton Studios shows the Big Bang from the outside.</seg>
        <seg id="112">Any observer would like to be inside at this moment, because it is impossible to be outside the universe.</seg>
        <seg id="113">Imagine you're inside the Big Bang.</seg>
        <seg id="114">It's everywhere around you and the space vibrates chaotically.</seg>
        <seg id="115">14 billion years have passed, and this song still sounds around us.</seg>
        <seg id="116">Galaxies are born, and there are generations of stellar forms in them. And around one star, at least one, there is an inhabited planet.</seg>
        <seg id="117">And here we stubbornly conduct these experiments, make calculations, write programs.</seg>
        <seg id="118">Imagine two black holes colliding a billion years ago.</seg>
        <seg id="119">All the while, their song sounds in space.</seg>
        <seg id="120">We haven't even been born yet.</seg>
        <seg id="121">The sound is coming closer, closer and closer - 40,000 years ago, we are still making rock carvings.</seg>
        <seg id="122">If we were going to "hear" the Big Bang, it would sound like this.</seg>
        <seg id="123">Noise in its purest form.</seg>
        <seg id="124">It's white noise, just chaotic sounds.</seg>
        <seg id="125">But he probably surrounds us everywhere, unless he has been silenced by some other process in the universe.</seg>
        <seg id="126">And if we catch it, it will be the most pleasant music for us, because it is a quiet echo of the moment of our creation, the birth of the observed universe.</seg>
        <seg id="127">Over the next few years, we will be able to add a bit of volume, and hear the universe in sound.</seg>
        <seg id="128">But if we catch the echo of those early events, it will bring us much closer to understanding the Big Bang, and it will already allow us to ask some of the most difficult, elusive questions.</seg>
        <seg id="129">Scrolling through a film about our universe backwards, we learn that there was a Big Bang in the past, and we may even hear its cacophony, but was it the only explosion?</seg>
        <seg id="130">I mean, hasn't it happened before?</seg>
        <seg id="131">Won't it happen again?</seg>
        <seg id="132">In the spirit of TED urging us to regain faith in miracles, we can now ask questions that have always eluded us.</seg>
        <seg id="133">But we have to ask: is it possible that our universe is just a trace of some more significant history?</seg>
        <seg id="134">Or - are we just one of the branches of the multiverse - each of which has had its Big Bang in the past? Maybe with black holes and their "songs," or without them, maybe with intelligent life, and perhaps without - they are not in our past, not in our future, but somehow connected to us?</seg>
        <seg id="135">We will ask - in such a multiverse, in its other branches, is there life there?</seg>
        <seg id="136">Here are my multiverse brethren.</seg>
        <seg id="137">But are there other creatures out there who think about us and their origins?</seg>
        <seg id="138">And, if they are, I can imagine them doing calculations, like us, building tools, trying to detect that faint sound of the moment of their creation, and thinking - who else is there but us?</seg>
        <seg id="139">Thank you. Thank you.</seg>

  <hyp system="Online-W" lang="en">
      <p>
        <seg id="1">I want you to think for a second that almost all of our knowledge about the universe is derived from light.</seg>
        <seg id="2">We stand on Earth and see stars in the night sky with the naked eye.</seg>
        <seg id="3">The bright sun can burn the retina,</seg>
        <seg id="4">...but it's the same light we see in the reflection of the moon.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Since the time of Galileo, who observed celestial bodies through his primitive telescope, we have contemplated the universe through the light passing through boundless centuries of cosmic history.</seg>
        <seg id="6">With modern telescopes, we have been able to assemble a stunning silent film of the universe, covering our entire history up to the Big Bang.</seg>
        <seg id="7">However, this movie is not soundless at all, because the Universe is not silent.</seg>
        <seg id="8">I want to prove to you that the Universe has its own sound track, and it is "played" by the cosmos itself, because outer space vibrates like a drum.</seg>
        <seg id="9">It carries peculiar sounds that accompany the brightest events as they happen.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Today, we would like to complement the magnificent visual image of the universe we have with a soundtrack as well.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Until now, we've never heard sounds from outer space, but soon we should be listening closely to what's going on out there.</seg>
        <seg id="12">So, in order to record the "song" of the universe, we focused on black holes as the most promising objects, because they "beat" space-time like a bell, and produce a distinctive sound. Now you will hear what we think this song will sound like.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Maybe one day we will see the shadow that a black hole casts as it appears against a bright background, but so far we have not observed such a thing.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Nevertheless, a black hole, albeit invisible, can be heard as it "beats" space-time like a drum.</seg>
        <seg id="15">The assumption that space is like a drum membrane belongs to Albert Einstein, to whom we owe so much.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Einstein concluded that if space were empty, if the universe were empty, it would look like this picture, except, of course, for such a visual grid.</seg>
        <seg id="17">If we were free to fall through space, even without a convenient coordinate grid, mentally we could picture it ourselves, as we would notice that we were moving in a straight line, strictly in a straight line through the universe.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Einstein also realized - and this is the point - that if you put energy or mass into the universe, it would cause space to curve, and a free-falling object would circle, for example, the Sun, deflecting along the natural curves in space.</seg>
        <seg id="19">This was Einstein's great general theory of relativity.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Even light curves along such a trajectory.</seg>
        <seg id="21">The deflection can be so strong that an object will simply fall into orbit and orbit around the Sun like the Earth, or like the Moon does around the Earth.</seg>
        <seg id="22">These are natural distortions in space.</seg>
        <seg id="23">Einstein failed to understand this - if we take our Sun and compress it to 6 kilometers in diameter, i.e. a mass 1 million times heavier than the Earth, in an object 6 kilometers in diameter, we get a black hole, so dense that light, if it gets too close to it, will never escape. A dark shadow in the universe.</seg>
        <seg id="24">However, he always thought black holes were just a mathematical curiosity.</seg>
        <seg id="25">Einstein did not believe they existed in reality.</seg>
        <seg id="26">He believed that nature itself should protect us from their appearance.</seg>
        <seg id="27">It took decades before the term "black hole" was invented and people realized that they are real astrophysical objects - in fact, they are very massive stars in a postmortem state, catastrophically collapsed at the end of their life cycle.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Our Sun will not turn into a black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="29">Its mass is not enough to do that.</seg>
        <seg id="30">But we'll do a little mental experiment - Einstein was very fond of them - and imagine the Sun shrinking to 6 kilometers in diameter, and a tiny Earth revolving around it, about 30 kilometers from the black hole of the Sun.</seg>
        <seg id="31">This Earth is luminous, because the Sun is no longer there, nor is there any other source of light, so let's make our little Earth self-luminous.</seg>
        <seg id="32">It turns out that we can place the Earth in a very close orbit, just 30 km from this black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="33">It's not much bigger than Manhattan.</seg>
        <seg id="34">Perhaps it would catch a little bit of the Hudson before destroying the Earth.</seg>
        <seg id="35">But that's about the scale.</seg>
        <seg id="36">We're talking about an object that would take up about 1/2 the area of Manhattan.</seg>
        <seg id="37">So, putting this Earth very close -- only 30 km away -- we notice that it orbits the black hole perfectly.</seg>
        <seg id="38">It's kind of a myth that black holes absorb everything indiscriminately - you have to get very close to get into it.</seg>
        <seg id="39">But what's amazing is that from our vantage point we will see the Earth all the time.</seg>
        <seg id="40">It can't hide behind a black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="41">Part of the light that the Earth emits is absorbed by the hole, but some of it sort of circles around it and comes back to us.</seg>
        <seg id="42">So, it's impossible to hide anything behind a black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="43">If you suddenly find yourself in the TV series "Battlestar Galactica" and you're fighting the Cylons, don't hide behind the black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="44">They'll see you!</seg>
        <seg id="45">Our Sun won't turn into a black hole -- it's not massive enough for that. But there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.</seg>
        <seg id="46">And if one of them obscured the Milky Way, this is what it would look like.</seg>
        <seg id="47">We would see the shadow of a black hole against a background of hundreds of billions of stars and glowing dust.</seg>
        <seg id="48">If we were on the verge of falling into that black hole, we would see all that light circling around it, and even already entering that shadow, we would not notice the near catastrophe.</seg>
        <seg id="49">It would already be useless to start the engines and try to get out, because nothing, including the light, can escape from it.</seg>
        <seg id="50">Although a black hole looks like that on the outside, it is not dark inside, because all light falls into it with us.</seg>
        <seg id="51">According to the relativistic effect known as time dilation, it would be as if our clocks would slow down relative to galactic time, but we would, in contrast, see the evolution of the galaxy in accelerated mode a moment before it died inside the black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="52">It would be like a near-death experience where you see the light at the end of the tunnel, only not "near," but absolutely mortal.</seg>
        <seg id="53">(Laughter) And you can't tell anyone about the light at the end of the tunnel anymore.</seg>
        <seg id="54">Scientists have not yet been able to see the shadow of a black hole, but we can hear it, albeit invisible.</seg>
        <seg id="55">Let's imagine a real astrophysical situation - two black holes that have lived together for a long life.</seg>
        <seg id="56">Perhaps first they were stars, and then they turned into black holes. Each of them is 10 times heavier than the Sun.</seg>
        <seg id="57">Squeeze them to 60 km in diameter.</seg>
        <seg id="58">They can rotate rapidly: hundreds of revolutions per second.</seg>
        <seg id="59">At the end of their life cycle, they revolve around each other almost at the speed of light.</seg>
        <seg id="60">They cover thousands of km in a fraction of a second, and not only do they curve space, but they also leave a trace behind them: they cause vibrations, a wave trace in space-time.</seg>
        <seg id="61">Space shrinks and stretches, released from these black holes oscillating in the universe.</seg>
        <seg id="62">And they travel through space at the speed of light.</seg>
        <seg id="63">This computer simulation was made by the Goddard team at NASA studying the theory of relativity.</seg>
        <seg id="64">For almost 30 years, the world's scientists have been battling this problem.</seg>
        <seg id="65">This was one of the groups.</seg>
        <seg id="66">You see two black holes rotating around each other -- and again, the curves are clearly shown here.</seg>
        <seg id="67">If you see -- it's a little faint -- they're emitting red waves, gravitational waves.</seg>
        <seg id="68">These are the sounds of vibrating space, and they will come out of these black holes at the speed of light as they subside and merge into one spinning, silent black hole -- that's the outcome.</seg>
        <seg id="69">If you were standing close enough, your ear would resonate as space compressed and stretched.</seg>
        <seg id="70">You would actually hear the sound.</seg>
        <seg id="71">Of course, your head would also be compressed and stretched, so it would be hard for you to understand what was going on.</seg>
        <seg id="72">But I would like to play you that sound as we predict it.</seg>
        <seg id="73">This is the work of my group, so the graphics here are more modest.</seg>
        <seg id="74">Imagine a light black hole falling into a very heavy black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="75">The sound you hear is the light hole making, curving out of space, approaching step by step toward the end.</seg>
        <seg id="76">If it moves away, the sound becomes quieter.</seg>
        <seg id="77">But it is like a hammer "hitting" space, which vibrates like a membrane.</seg>
        <seg id="78">And we can predict what that sound will be.</seg>
        <seg id="79">We know that as the hole is absorbed, it gets faster and louder.</seg>
        <seg id="80">At the end, we'll hear the little hole just fall into the big one.</seg>
        <seg id="81">I haven't heard the recording that loud yet - very impressive indeed.</seg>
        <seg id="82">It's much more modest at home.</seg>
        <seg id="83">It's just quiet clicks.</seg>
        <seg id="84">This is a different sound created by my band.</seg>

        <seg id="135">We ask - in such a multiverse, in its other offshoots, is there life there?</seg>
        <seg id="136">Here are my fellow multiverse creatures.</seg>

        <seg id="1">I want you to think for a second that almost all of our knowledge about the Universe is gained through light.</seg>
        <seg id="2">We stand on Earth and see stars in the night sky with the naked eye.</seg>
        <seg id="3">A bright Sun can burn the retina,</seg>
        <seg id="4">But we see the same light in the reflection of the Moon.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Since the time of Galileo, who observed celestial bodies through his primitive telescope, we have been contemplating the universe thanks to light passing through the boundless ages of cosmic history.</seg>
        <seg id="6">With the help of modern telescopes, we were able to collect a stunning silent film about the Universe, covering all our history up to the Big Bang.</seg>
        <seg id="7">However, this movie is not without sound, because the Universe is not silent.</seg>
        <seg id="8">I want to prove to you that the Universe has its own soundtrack, and it is "reproduced" by the cosmos itself, because outer space vibrates like a drum.</seg>
        <seg id="9">It carries peculiar sounds that accompany the most striking events as they take place.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Today we would like to complement the luxurious visual image of the universe that we have with a soundtrack.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Until now, we have never heard sounds from space, but in the near future we should listen carefully to what is happening there.</seg>
        <seg id="12">So, in order to record the "song" of the Universe, we focused on black holes as the most promising objects, because they "beat" in space-time like a bell, and give a characteristic sound.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Maybe one day we will see a shadow that the black hole casts, appearing against a bright background, but so far we have not seen this.</seg>
        <seg id="14">However, the black hole, albeit invisible, can be heard as it "beats" in space-time like a drum.</seg>
        <seg id="15">The assumption that space is like a drum membrane belongs to Albert Einstein, to whom we owe so much.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Einstein concluded that if space were empty, if the universe was empty, it would look like this picture, except, of course, for such a visual grid.</seg>
        <seg id="17">If we fell freely through space, even without a convenient coordinate grid, mentally we could portray it ourselves, since we would notice that we are moving in a straight line, strictly in a straight line through the universe.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Einstein also understood - and this is the very essence - that if you put energy or mass into the universe, it will lead to a curvature of space, and a free-falling object will bypass, for example, the Sun, deviating along natural curves in space.</seg>
        <seg id="19">It was Einstein's great general theory of relativity.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Even light warps along this trajectory.</seg>
        <seg id="21">The deviation can be so strong that the object will simply enter orbit and will spin around the Sun like the Earth, or like the Moon - around the Earth.</seg>
        <seg id="22">These are natural curvature in space.</seg>
        <seg id="23">But Einstein didn't understand this: if you take our Sun and compress it to 6 kilometers in diameter, that is, a mass 1 million times heavier than the Earth to fit in an object with a diameter of 6 km, you will get a black hole, so dense that the light that passed too close from it will never escape.</seg>
        <seg id="24">However, he always considered black holes to be just a mathematical curiosity.</seg>
        <seg id="25">Einstein did not believe that they exist in reality.</seg>
        <seg id="26">He believed that nature should protect us from their appearance.</seg>
        <seg id="27">Decades passed before the term "black hole" was invented and people realized that they are real astrophysical objects - in fact, they are very massive stars in a posthumous state, catastrophically destroyed at the end of their life cycle.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Our Sun will not turn into a black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="29">Its mass is insufficient for this.</seg>
        <seg id="30">But we will conduct a small thought experiment - Enstein loved them very much - and imagine how the Sun shrinks to 6 kilometers in diameter, and around it rotates a tiny Earth, about 30 km from the sun's black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="31">This Earth is shining, because there is no more Sun, as well as another light source, so we will make our little Earth self-luminous.</seg>
        <seg id="32">It turns out that we can place the Earth in a very close orbit, just 30 km from this black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="33">It does not exceed Manhattan in size.</seg>
        <seg id="34">Perhaps it would have caught Hudson a little before destroying the Earth.</seg>
        <seg id="35">But the scale is roughly that.</seg>
        <seg id="36">We are talking about an object that would occupy about 1 / 2 of Manhattan's area.</seg>
        <seg id="37">So, by placing this Earth very close - only 30 km away - we will notice that it rotates perfectly around the black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="38">It's a kind of myth that black holes absorb everything indiscriminately - to get into it, you have to come very close.</seg>
        <seg id="39">But what is striking is that from our point of view we will always see the Earth.</seg>
        <seg id="40">She can't hide behind a black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="41">Some of the light that the Earth emits is absorbed by the hole, but some of it seems to circle it and return back to us.</seg>
        <seg id="42">So, nothing can be hidden behind the black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="43">If you suddenly get into the series "Star Cruiser" Galaxy ," and fight the Cylons - do not hide behind the black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="44">They will see you!</seg>
        <seg id="45">Our Sun won't turn into a black hole - it's not massive enough for this. But there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.</seg>
        <seg id="46">And if one of them obscured the Milky Way, that's what it would look like.</seg>
        <seg id="47">We would see the shadow of a black hole against the background of hundreds of billions of stars and luminous dust.</seg>
        <seg id="48">If we were on the verge of falling into this black hole, we would see all this light circling it, and even entering this shadow, we would not notice a near catastrophe.</seg>
        <seg id="49">It would be useless to start the engines and try to get out, because nothing, including light, can escape from it.</seg>
        <seg id="50">Although the black hole looks like this from the outside, it is not dark inside, since all the light falls into it with us.</seg>
        <seg id="51">According to the relativistic effect known as time stretching, our clock seemed to slow down relative to galactic time, but we, on the contrary, would see the evolution of the galaxy in an accelerated mode a moment before death inside the black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="52">It would be like a near-death experience where you see light at the end of a tunnel, but not "near," but absolutely mortal.</seg>
        <seg id="53">(Laughter) And you can't tell anyone about the light at the end of the tunnel.</seg>
        <seg id="54">Scientists have not yet been able to see the shadow of the black hole, but we can hear it, albeit invisible.</seg>
        <seg id="55">Imagine a real astrophysical situation - two black holes that lived a long life together.</seg>
        <seg id="56">They may have been stars first and then turned into black holes, each 10 times heavier than the Sun.</seg>
        <seg id="57">Let's squeeze them up to 60 km in diameter.</seg>
        <seg id="58">They can spin quickly: hundreds of revolutions per second.</seg>
        <seg id="59">At the end of their life cycle, they spin around each other at almost the speed of light.</seg>
        <seg id="60">They cover thousands of km in a split second, and not only warp space, but also leave a mark: they cause fluctuations, a wave trail in space-time.</seg>
        <seg id="61">Space shrinks and stretches, freeing itself from these black holes oscillating in the universe.</seg>
        <seg id="62">And they travel through space at the speed of light.</seg>
        <seg id="63">This computer simulation was made by Goddard's group at NASA studying the theory of relativity.</seg>
        <seg id="64">For almost 30 years, scientists around the world have been fighting over this problem.</seg>
        <seg id="65">It was one of the groups.</seg>
        <seg id="66">You see two black holes orbiting each other - and again, curves are clearly depicted here.</seg>
        <seg id="67">If you see - it turned out a little pale - they emit red waves, gravitational waves.</seg>
        <seg id="68">These are the sounds of vibrating space, and they will come from these black holes at the speed of light, while they subside and merge into one rotating, quiet black hole - this is the outcome.</seg>
        <seg id="69">If you stood close enough, your ear would resonate as space shrinks and stretches.</seg>
        <seg id="70">You would actually hear the sound.</seg>
        <seg id="71">Of course, your head would also shrink and stretch, so it would be difficult for you to understand what is going on.</seg>
        <seg id="72">But I would like to lose this sound to you, as we predict it.</seg>
        <seg id="73">This is the work of my group, so the schedule here is more modest.</seg>
        <seg id="74">Imagine a light black hole falling into a very heavy one.</seg>
        <seg id="75">The sound you hear makes a light hole, bending space, coming step by step to the end.</seg>
        <seg id="76">If it is removed, the sound becomes quieter.</seg>
        <seg id="77">But it is like a hammer "hitting" a space that vibrates like a membrane.</seg>
        <seg id="78">And we can predict what that sound will be like.</seg>
        <seg id="79">We know that as a hole is absorbed, it gets faster and louder.</seg>
        <seg id="80">At the end we will hear a small hole just fall into a big one.</seg>
        <seg id="81">I haven't heard the recording so loudly yet - really, quite impressive.</seg>
        <seg id="82">At home it turns out to be much more modest.</seg>
        <seg id="83">Just quiet clicks.</seg>
        <seg id="84">It's a different sound created by my band.</seg>
        <seg id="85">Here I am not showing you the picture, since black holes do not leave behind visual traces, there are no visible curves in space.</seg>
        <seg id="86">If you went on a space cruise and heard such a sound, I would recommend flying away as soon as possible.</seg>
        <seg id="87">(Laughter) Further from that sound.</seg>
        <seg id="88">Both black holes are moving.</seg>
        <seg id="89">They are approaching each other.</seg>
        <seg id="90">In this case, they both hesitate a lot.</seg>
        <seg id="91">And now there will be a merger.</seg>
        <seg id="92">This "rumbling" is very characteristic of merging black holes, it is an acceleration at the end.</seg>
        <seg id="93">We assume that this would sound like this.</seg>
        <seg id="94">Fortunately, we are now at a safe distance, in Long Beach in California.</seg>
        <seg id="95">Undoubtedly, two black holes merge somewhere in the universe.</seg>
        <seg id="96">And without a doubt, the space around us is vibrating, and these fluctuations may have passed millions of light-years, that is, a million years were moving towards us at the speed of light.</seg>
        <seg id="97">But the sound is too quiet, we can't hear it.</seg>
        <seg id="98">There is a very complex project today: LIGO (Laser Interferometric Gravitational-Wave Observatory) - it tracks deviations in fluctuations in space, the smallest - by the size of the nucleus of an atom by 4 kilometers.</seg>
        <seg id="99">This is an extremely ambitious experiment, and in the next few years it will be devoted to catching such waves.</seg>
        <seg id="100">One space program is also planned, which I hope will be launched in the next 10 years: LIKA (Laser Interferometric Space Antenna).</seg>
        <seg id="101">It will be able to see super-heavy black holes, millions and billions of times more massive than the Sun.</seg>
        <seg id="102">In this image from the Hubble telescope we see two galaxies.</seg>
        <seg id="103">They look like they have frozen in a kind of "embrace,"</seg>
        <seg id="104">And each of them probably contains a super-heavy black hole in its core.</seg>
        <seg id="105">But they haven't frozen. In fact, they are merging.</seg>
        <seg id="106">These two black holes collide and it will last more than a billion years.</seg>
        <seg id="107">It is beyond our perception to hear a song of such duration.</seg>
        <seg id="108">But the LIC may see the final merger of two super-heavy black holes, which began a long time ago: the last 15 minutes of this action.</seg>
        <seg id="109">We are talking not only about black holes, but also about any serious troubles in the universe, and the most important of them is the Big Bang.</seg>
        <seg id="110">When this expression was invented, it was ironic - "they say, who will believe in the Big Bang?"</seg>
        <seg id="111">This animation from my friend from Proton Studios shows the Big Bang from the outside.</seg>
        <seg id="112">Any observer would like to be inside at this moment, because it is impossible to be outside the universe.</seg>
        <seg id="113">Imagine being inside the Big Bang.</seg>
        <seg id="114">It is everywhere, around you, and the space vibrates chaotically.</seg>
        <seg id="115">14 billion years have passed, and this song still sounds around us.</seg>
        <seg id="116">Galaxies are born, and generations of stellar forms are born in them. And there is a habitable planet around one star, at least one.</seg>
        <seg id="117">And here we persistently conduct these experiments, make calculations, write programs.</seg>
        <seg id="118">Imagine that two black holes collided a billion years ago.</seg>
        <seg id="119">All the while, their song sounds in space.</seg>
        <seg id="120">We haven't even been born yet.</seg>
        <seg id="121">The sound is approaching, closer and closer - 40,000 years ago, we are still making rock paintings.</seg>
        <seg id="122">If we were going to "hear" the Big Bang, it would sound like this.</seg>
        <seg id="123">The noise is pure.</seg>
        <seg id="124">It's white noise, just chaotic sounds.</seg>
        <seg id="125">But it probably surrounds us everywhere, if it wasn't drowned out by some other processes in the universe.</seg>
        <seg id="126">And if we catch it, it will be the most pleasant music for us, because it is a quiet echo of the moment of our creation, the birth of the observed Universe.</seg>
        <seg id="127">Over the next few years, we can add a little volume and hear the universe in sound.</seg>
        <seg id="128">But if we catch an echo of those early events, it will bring us much closer to understanding the Big Bang, and it will already allow us to ask some of the most difficult, elusive questions.</seg>
        <seg id="129">By spinning a film about our universe backwards, we learn that there was a Big Bang in the past, and perhaps we will even hear its cacophony, but was this the only one?</seg>
        <seg id="130">I mean, has it not happened before?</seg>
        <seg id="131">Will it happen again?</seg>
        <seg id="132">In the spirit of TED calling on us to regain faith in miracles, we can now ask questions that have always eluded us.</seg>
        <seg id="133">But we must ask: is it possible that our Universe is just a trace of some more significant history?</seg>
        <seg id="134">Or - are we just one of the branches of the multiuniverse - each of which had its own Big Bang in the past? Maybe with black holes and their "songs," or without them, maybe with intelligent life, and possibly without - they are not in our past, not in our future, but somehow connected to us?</seg>
        <seg id="135">We will ask: in such a multiuniverse, in its other branches, is there life?</seg>
        <seg id="136">Here are my fellow multiuniverses.</seg>
        <seg id="137">But are there any other creatures out there that think about us and their origin?</seg>
        <seg id="138">And, if they are, I can imagine them making calculations like us, building instruments, trying to detect that weak sound of the moment of their creation, and thinking - who else is there but us?</seg>
        <seg id="139">Thanks. Thank you.</seg>

        <seg id="56">They may have been stars at first and then turned into black holes. Each of them is 10 times heavier than the Sun.</seg>
        <seg id="57">Let's compress them up to 60 km in diameter.</seg>
        <seg id="58">They can rotate rapidly: hundreds of revolutions per second.</seg>
        <seg id="59">At the end of their life cycle, they revolve around each other at almost the speed of light.</seg>
        <seg id="60">They cover thousands of kilometers in a split second, and not only thus bend space, but also leave a trail behind them: they cause fluctuations, a wave trail in space-time.</seg>
        <seg id="61">Space contracts and stretches, freeing itself from these black holes that oscillate in the universe.</seg>
        <seg id="62">And they travel through space at the speed of light.</seg>
        <seg id="63">This computer simulation was done by Goddard's group at NASA, which studies the theory of relativity.</seg>
        <seg id="64">For almost 30 years, scientists around the world have been struggling with this problem.</seg>
        <seg id="65">It was one of the groups.</seg>
        <seg id="66">You see two black holes orbiting each other - and again the curves are graphically depicted here.</seg>
        <seg id="67">If you see - it turned out a little pale - they emit red waves, gravitational waves.</seg>
        <seg id="68">These are the sounds of vibrating space, and they will emanate from these black holes at the speed of light as they calm down and merge into one spinning, silent black hole - such is the outcome.</seg>
        <seg id="69">If you were close enough, your ear would resonate as the space contracts and stretches.</seg>
        <seg id="70">You would actually hear the sound.</seg>
        <seg id="71">Of course, your head would also contract and stretch, so it would be difficult for you to understand what is going on.</seg>
        <seg id="72">But I would like to play this sound to you as we predict it.</seg>
        <seg id="73">This is the work of my group, so the graphics are more modest here.</seg>
        <seg id="74">Imagine a light black hole falling into a very heavy one.</seg>
        <seg id="75">The sound you hear makes a slight hole, arching the space, approaching the end step by step.</seg>
        <seg id="76">If it is removed, the sound becomes quieter.</seg>
        <seg id="77">But it is like a hammer striking a space that vibrates like a membrane.</seg>
        <seg id="78">And we can predict what that sound will be.</seg>
        <seg id="79">We know that as the hole is absorbed, it gets faster and louder.</seg>
        <seg id="80">At the end, we will hear a small hole just fall into a large one.</seg>
        <seg id="81">I have never heard the recording so loudly - really, quite impressive.</seg>
        <seg id="82">At home it turns out much more modest.</seg>
        <seg id="83">Just quiet clicks.</seg>
        <seg id="84">This is a different sound created by my group.</seg>
        <seg id="85">I am not showing you a picture here, since black holes leave no obvious traces behind them, there are no visible curves in space.</seg>
        <seg id="86">If you went on a space cruise and heard such a sound, I would recommend leaving as soon as possible.</seg>
        <seg id="87">(Laughter) Get away from that sound.</seg>
        <seg id="88">Both black holes are moving.</seg>
        <seg id="89">They are getting closer to each other.</seg>
        <seg id="90">In this case, they both fluctuate greatly.</seg>
        <seg id="91">And now there will be a merger.</seg>
        <seg id="92">This "chirping" is very characteristic of merging black holes, this is the acceleration at the end.</seg>
        <seg id="93">We assume that it would sound like that.</seg>
        <seg id="94">Fortunately, we are now at a safe distance in Long Beach, California.</seg>
        <seg id="95">Surely, somewhere in the universe, two black holes are merging.</seg>
        <seg id="96">And without a doubt, the space around us vibrates, and these vibrations may have passed millions of light years, that is, a million years moved towards us at the speed of light.</seg>
        <seg id="97">But the sound is too quiet, we cannot hear it.</seg>
        <seg id="98">There is a very complex project today: LIGO (Laser-interferometric gravitational-wave observatory) - it tracks deviations in space oscillations, the smallest ones - by the size of an atomic nucleus at 4 kilometers.</seg>
        <seg id="99">This is an extremely ambitious experiment, and in the next few years it will be devoted to capturing such waves.</seg>
        <seg id="100">One space program is also planned and will hopefully be launched in the next 10 years: LIKA (Laser Interferometric Space Antenna).</seg>
        <seg id="101">She will be able to see super-heavy black holes, millions and billions of times more massive than the Sun.</seg>
        <seg id="102">In this image from the Hubble telescope, we see two galaxies.</seg>
        <seg id="103">They look like they are frozen in some kind of "embrace"</seg>
        <seg id="104">and each of them probably contains a superheavy black hole in its core.</seg>
        <seg id="105">But they didn't freeze. In fact, they merge.</seg>
        <seg id="106">These two black holes collide, and it will last for over a billion years.</seg>
        <seg id="107">It is beyond our perception to hear a song of such length.</seg>
        <seg id="108">But LIKA can see the end of the merger of two super-heavy black holes, which began a long time ago: the last 15 minutes of this action.</seg>
        <seg id="109">We are not only talking about black holes, but also about any serious troubles in the universe, and the most important of them is the Big Bang.</seg>
        <seg id="110">When this expression was invented, it was ironic - "they say, who will believe in the Big Bang?"</seg>
        <seg id="111">This animation from a friend of mine at Proton Studios shows the Big Bang from the outside.</seg>
        <seg id="112">Any observer would like to be inside at this moment, because it is impossible to be outside the universe.</seg>
        <seg id="113">Imagine that you are inside the Big Bang.</seg>
        <seg id="114">It is everywhere, around you, and space vibrates chaotically.</seg>
        <seg id="115">Already 14 billion years have passed, and this song still sounds around us.</seg>
        <seg id="116">Galaxies are born, and in them - generations of stellar forms. And around one star, at least one, there is an inhabited planet.</seg>
        <seg id="117">And here we are persistently carrying out these experiments, making calculations, writing programs.</seg>
        <seg id="118">Imagine - a billion years ago, two black holes collided.</seg>
        <seg id="119">All this time, their song sounds in space.</seg>
        <seg id="120">We haven't even been born yet.</seg>
        <seg id="121">The sound is getting closer, closer and closer - 40 thousand years ago, we are still making rock paintings.</seg>
        <seg id="122">If we were going to “hear” the Big Bang, it would sound like this.</seg>
        <seg id="123">Noise in its purest form.</seg>
        <seg id="124">This is white noise, just chaotic sounds.</seg>
        <seg id="125">But he probably surrounds us everywhere, if he was not drowned out by some other processes in the universe.</seg>
        <seg id="126">And if we catch it, it will be the most pleasant music for us, because it is a quiet echo of the moment of our creation, the birth of the observable Universe.</seg>
        <seg id="127">Over the next few years, we will be able to turn up the volume a little, and we will hear the universe in sound.</seg>
        <seg id="128">But if we catch the echo of those early events, it will take us much closer to understanding the Big Bang, and this will already allow us to ask some of the most difficult, elusive questions.</seg>
        <seg id="129">Scrolling the film about our universe backwards, we learn that there was a Big Bang in the past, and maybe we even hear its cacophony, but was this explosion the only one?</seg>
        <seg id="130">I mean, hasn't it happened before?</seg>
        <seg id="131">Will it happen again?</seg>
        <seg id="132">In the spirit of TED calling us to regain our faith in miracles, we can now ask questions that have always eluded us.</seg>
        <seg id="133">But we must ask: is it possible that our universe is just a trace of some more significant history?</seg>
        <seg id="134">Or - aren't we just one branch of the multiverse - each with its own Big Bang in the past? Maybe with black holes and their "songs", or without them, maybe with intelligent life, and perhaps without - they are not in our past, not in our future, but are somehow connected with us?</seg>
        <seg id="135">We ask - in such a multiverse, in its other branches, is there life there?</seg>
        <seg id="136">Here are my brethren in the multiverse.</seg>
        <seg id="137">But are there other creatures out there who think about us, and about their origin?</seg>
        <seg id="138">And, if they exist, I can imagine them doing calculations, like us, building instruments, trying to detect that faint sound of the moment of their creation, and thinking - who else is there besides us?</seg>
        <seg id="139">Thank you. Thank you.</seg>

  <hyp system="Online-A" lang="en">
      <p>
        <seg id="1">I want you to think for a second about the fact that almost all of our knowledge of the universe comes from light.</seg>
        <seg id="2">We stand on Earth and see stars in the night sky with the naked eye.</seg>
        <seg id="3">The bright Sun can burn the retina of the eye,</seg>
        <seg id="4">but we see the same light in the reflection of the moon.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Since the time of Galileo observing celestial bodies through his primitive telescope, we have contemplated the universe through the light passing through the boundless ages of cosmic history.</seg>
        <seg id="6">With the help of modern telescopes, we were able to assemble a stunning silent film about the Universe, covering our entire history up to the Big Bang.</seg>
        <seg id="7">However, cinema is not at all devoid of sound, because the universe is not silent.</seg>
        <seg id="8">I want to prove to you that the universe has its own soundtrack, and it is "reproduced" by the cosmos itself, because outer space vibrates like a drum.</seg>
        <seg id="9">It carries peculiar sounds that accompany the brightest events as they occur.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Today we would like to complement the luxurious visual image of the universe that we have, also with a soundtrack.</seg>
        <seg id="11">So far, we've never heard sounds from space, but in the near future we should listen carefully to what is happening there.</seg>
        <seg id="12">So, in order to record the "song" of the Universe, we focused on black holes as the most promising objects, because they "beat" into space-time like a bell, and give a characteristic sound. Now you're going to hear how we think this song will sound.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Maybe one day we will see the shadow that the black hole casts, being on a bright background, but so far we have not seen this.</seg>
        <seg id="14">However, a black hole, albeit invisible, can be heard because it "beats" into space-time like a drum.</seg>
        <seg id="15">The assumption that the cosmos is like a drum membrane belongs to Albert Einstein, to whom we owe so much.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Einstein concluded that if space were empty, if the universe were empty, it would look like this picture, except, of course, such a visual grid.</seg>
        <seg id="17">If we were to fall freely through space, even without a convenient coordinate grid, mentally we could depict it ourselves, since we would notice that we are moving in a straight line, strictly in a straight line through the universe.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Einstein also understood — and this is the very essence — that if you put energy or mass into the universe, it will lead to the curvature of space, and a freely falling object will bend around, for example, the Sun, deviating along natural curves in space.</seg>
        <seg id="19">This was Einstein's great general theory of relativity.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Even light curves along this trajectory.</seg>
        <seg id="21">The deviation can be so strong that the object will simply fall into orbit, and will revolve around the Sun as the Earth, or as the Moon - around the Earth.</seg>
        <seg id="22">These are natural curvatures in space.</seg>
        <seg id="23">But Einstein did not understand this - if you take our Sun and compress it to 6 kilometers in diameter, that is, a mass 1 million times heavier than the Earth to fit in an object with a diameter of 6 km, you will get a black hole so dense that the light that has passed too close to it will never break out. A dark shadow in the universe.</seg>
        <seg id="24">However, he always considered black holes just a mathematical curiosity.</seg>
        <seg id="25">Einstein did not believe that they existed in reality.</seg>
        <seg id="26">He believed that nature itself should protect us from their appearance.</seg>
        <seg id="27">It took decades before the term "black hole" was invented, and people realized that they were real astrophysical objects — in fact, they are very massive stars in a posthumous state, catastrophically collapsed at the end of their life cycle.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Our Sun will not turn into a black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="29">Its mass is not enough for that.</seg>
        <seg id="30">But we'll do a little thought experiment — Einstein loved them very much — and imagine the Sun shrinking to 6 kilometers in diameter, and around it revolves a tiny Earth, about 30 km from the black hole of the Sun.</seg>
        <seg id="31">This Earth is glowing, the Sun is no more, as well as another source of light, so let's make our small Earth self-luminous.</seg>
        <seg id="32">It turns out that we can put the Earth in a very close orbit, just 30 km from this black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="33">In size, it does not exceed Manhattan much.</seg>
        <seg id="34">Perhaps it would have hooked a little hudson before destroying the Earth.</seg>
        <seg id="35">But the scale is something like this.</seg>
        <seg id="36">We're talking about an object that would occupy about 1/2 of manhattan's area.</seg>
        <seg id="37">So, placing this Earth very close - only 30 km - we will notice that it perfectly revolves around a black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="38">This is a kind of myth that black holes absorb everything indiscriminately - to get into it, you need to get very close.</seg>
        <seg id="39">But what is striking is that from our point of view we will see the Earth all the time.</seg>
        <seg id="40">It can't hide behind a black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="41">Part of the light that the Earth emits is absorbed by the hole, but part of it seems to go around it and return back to us.</seg>
        <seg id="42">So, behind a black hole, nothing can be hidden.</seg>
        <seg id="43">If you suddenly get into the series "Battlestar Galactica", and will fight with the Cylons - do not hide behind a black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="44">They'll see you!</seg>
        <seg id="45">Our Sun will not turn into a black hole - for this it is not massive enough. But there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.</seg>
        <seg id="46">And if one of them obscured the Milky Way, here's what it would look like.</seg>
        <seg id="47">We would see the shadow of a black hole against the backdrop of hundreds of billions of stars and glowing dust.</seg>
        <seg id="48">If we were on the verge of falling into this black hole, we would see all this light around it, and even already entering this shadow, we would not notice the imminent catastrophe.</seg>
        <seg id="49">It would be useless to start the engines and try to get out, because nothing, including the light, can escape from it.</seg>
        <seg id="50">Although the black hole looks like it from the outside, inside it is not dark, as all the light falls into it with us.</seg>
        <seg id="51">According to a relativistic effect known as time stretching, our clocks seemed to slow down relative to general galactic time, but we would, on the contrary, see the evolution of the galaxy in an accelerated mode a moment before the death inside the black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="52">It would be like a near-death experience where you see a light at the end of a tunnel, but not "about" but absolutely mortal.</seg>
        <seg id="53">(Laughter) And you can't tell anyone about the light at the end of the tunnel.</seg>
        <seg id="54">Scientists have not yet been able to see the shadow of a black hole, but we can hear it, albeit invisible.</seg>
        <seg id="55">Imagine a real astrophysical situation – two black holes that have lived together for a long life.</seg>
        <seg id="56">Perhaps they were stars at first and then turned into black holes. Each of them is 10 times heavier than the Sun.</seg>
        <seg id="57">Squeeze them to 60 km in diameter.</seg>
        <seg id="58">They can rotate quickly: hundreds of revolutions per second.</seg>
        <seg id="59">At the end of their life cycle, they orbit each other at almost the speed of light.</seg>
        <seg id="60">They cover thousands of km in a fraction of a second, and not only bend space, but also leave behind a trace: they cause oscillations, a wave trail in space-time.</seg>
        <seg id="61">Space shrinks and stretches, freeing itself from these black holes oscillating in the universe.</seg>
        <seg id="62">And they travel through space at the speed of light.</seg>
        <seg id="63">This computer simulation was made by nasa's Goddard group studying relativity.</seg>
        <seg id="64">For almost 30 years, the world's scientists have been fighting over this problem.</seg>

        <seg id="128">But if we catch the echo of those early events, it will bring us much closer to understanding the Big Bang, and this will already allow us to ask some of the most difficult, elusive questions.</seg>
        <seg id="129">Scrolling through a movie about our universe backwards, we learn that there was the Big Bang in the past, and maybe we'll even hear its cacophony, but was that explosion the only one?</seg>
        <seg id="130">I mean, didn't it happen before?</seg>
        <seg id="131">Will it happen again?</seg>
        <seg id="132">In the spirit of TED, which calls us to regain our faith in miracles, we can now ask questions that have always eluded us.</seg>
        <seg id="133">But we must ask: Is it possible that our universe is just a trace of some more significant history?</seg>
        <seg id="134">Or aren't we just one branch of the multiverse — each of which had its own Big Bang in the past? Maybe with or without black holes and their "songs", maybe with intelligent life, and perhaps without – they are not in our past, not in our future, but somehow connected with us?</seg>
        <seg id="135">We will ask – in such a multiverse, in its other branches, is there life there?</seg>
        <seg id="136">Here are my fellow multiverses.</seg>
        <seg id="137">But are there other creatures out there that think about us and their origins?</seg>
        <seg id="138">And, if they are, I can imagine them doing calculations like us, building instruments, trying to detect that faint sound of the moment of their creation, and thinking, who else is there but us?</seg>

      <p>
        <seg id="1">I want you to think for a second that almost all of our knowledge of the universe is derived from light.</seg>
        <seg id="2">We stand on Earth and see stars in the night sky with the naked eye.</seg>
        <seg id="3">The bright Sun can burn the retina of the eye,</seg>
        <seg id="4">but we see the same light in the reflection of the Moon.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Since the time of Galileo observing celestial bodies in his primitive telescope, we have been contemplating the universe through light passing through the endless ages of cosmic history.</seg>
        <seg id="6">With the help of modern telescopes, we were able to collect a stunning silent film about the universe, covering our entire history up to the Big Bang.</seg>
        <seg id="7">However, cinema is not without sound, because the universe is not soundless.</seg>
        <seg id="8">I want to prove to you that the Universe has its own soundtrack, and it is  ⁇ played ⁇  by the cosmos itself, because outer space vibrates like a drum.</seg>
        <seg id="9">It carries distinctive sounds that accompany the brightest events as they occur.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Today, we would like to complement the luxurious visual image of the universe we have with a soundtrack.</seg>
        <seg id="11">So far, we have never heard sounds from space, but in the near future we should listen carefully to what is happening there.</seg>
        <seg id="12">So, in order to record the "song" of the universe, we focused on black holes as the most promising objects, because they "beat" in space-time like a bell, and give a characteristic sound.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Maybe one day we'll see the shadow that a black hole casts out against a bright background, but we haven't seen that yet.</seg>
        <seg id="14">However, a black hole, even if invisible, can be heard as it "beats" in space-time like a drum.</seg>
        <seg id="15">The assumption that space is like a drum membrane belongs to Albert Einstein, to whom we owe so much.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Einstein concluded that if space were empty, if the universe were empty, it would look like this drawing, except, of course, such a visual grid.</seg>
        <seg id="17">If we were to fall freely through space, even without a convenient coordinate grid, we could mentally picture it ourselves, since we would notice that we are moving in a straight line, strictly in a straight line through the universe.</seg>
        <seg id="18">Einstein also realized  ⁇  and this is the bottom line  ⁇  that if you put energy or mass into the universe, it will lead to a warp of space, and a free-falling object will bend around, for example, the Sun, slanting along the curiosities.</seg>
        <seg id="19">This was Einstein's great general theory of relativity.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Even light curves along such a trajectory.</seg>
        <seg id="21">The deflection can be so strong that the object will simply get into orbit, and spin around the sun like the Earth, or like the Moon around the Earth.</seg>
        <seg id="22">These are natural curvature in space.</seg>
        <seg id="23">But Einstein didn't understand it - if we take our Sun and compress it to 6 kilometers in diameter, that is, a mass 1 million times heavier than the Earth to fit in an object not with a diameter of 6 km, then you will have a black hole with a black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="24">However, he always regarded black holes as mere mathematical curiosity.</seg>
        <seg id="25">Einstein did not believe they existed in reality.</seg>
        <seg id="26">He believed that nature itself should protect us from their appearance.</seg>
        <seg id="27">Decades passed before the term "black hole" was invented, and people realized that they were real astrophysical objects  ⁇  in fact, they were very massive stars in a post-mortem state, catastrophically collapsing.</seg>
        <seg id="28">Our Sun will not turn into a black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="29">Its mass is not enough for this.</seg>
        <seg id="30">But we'll do a little thought experiment,  ⁇  Einstein loved them very much  ⁇  and imagine how the Sun shrinks to 6 kilometers in diameter, and a tiny Earth revolves around it, roughly 30 to 30 miles across.</seg>
        <seg id="31">This Earth is shining, the Sun is no longer there, as is another light source, so let's make our little Earth self-luminous.</seg>
        <seg id="32">It turns out we can place Earth in a very close orbit, just 30 km from this black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="33">It is not much larger than Manhattan.</seg>
        <seg id="34">Perhaps it would have hooked up a little bit to Hudson before destroying Earth.</seg>
        <seg id="35">But the scale is about that.</seg>
        <seg id="36">We are talking about an object that would occupy approximately 1/2 of the area of Manhattan.</seg>
        <seg id="37">So, by placing this Earth very close  ⁇  just 30 km away  ⁇  we will notice that it perfectly revolves around a black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="38">This is a kind of myth that black holes absorb everything indiscriminately - to get into it, you need to come very close.</seg>
        <seg id="39">But what is striking is that from our point of view we will see the Earth all the time.</seg>
        <seg id="40">It cannot hide behind a black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="41">Some of the light that the Earth emits is absorbed by the hole, but some of it seems to be around it and coming back to us.</seg>
        <seg id="42">So that nothing can be hidden behind a black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="43">If you suddenly get into the Star Cruiser series "The Galaxy" and fight the Cylons, don't hide behind a black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="44">They will see you!</seg>
        <seg id="45">Our Sun will not turn into a black hole  ⁇  for this it is not massive enough. But there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.</seg>
        <seg id="46">And if one of them blocked the Milky Way, that's how it would look.</seg>
        <seg id="47">We would see the shadow of a black hole amid hundreds of billions of stars and glowing dust.</seg>
        <seg id="48">If we were on the verge of falling into this black hole, we would see all this light around it, and even entering this shadow, would not notice the near catastrophe.</seg>
        <seg id="49">It would be useless to start the engines and try to get out, because nothing, including light, can escape from it.</seg>
        <seg id="50">Although the black hole looks like it from the outside, it is not dark inside, as all the light falls into it with us.</seg>
        <seg id="51">According to the relativistic effect known as time stretching, our clock would seem to slow down relative to all-galactic time, but we would instead see the evolution of the galaxy in an accelerated mode a moment before the death of the hole inside.</seg>
        <seg id="52">It would be like a near-death experience where you see the light at the end of the tunnel, but not 'near' but absolutely mortal.</seg>
        <seg id="53">(Laughter) And you won't tell anyone about the light at the end of the tunnel.</seg>
        <seg id="54">Scientists have not yet been able to see the shadow of a black hole, but we can hear it, even if it is invisible.</seg>
        <seg id="55">Let's imagine a real astrophysical situation - two black holes that have lived together a long life.</seg>
        <seg id="56">They may have been stars at first and then turned into black holes, each 10 times heavier than the Sun.</seg>
        <seg id="57">We will burn them up to 60 km in diameter.</seg>
        <seg id="58">They can rotate quickly: hundreds of revolutions per second.</seg>
        <seg id="59">At the end of their life cycle, they revolve around each other at almost the speed of light.</seg>
        <seg id="60">They cover thousands of kilometres in a fraction of a second, and not only curve space in this way, but also leave behind a trail: they cause oscillations, a wave trace in space-time.</seg>
        <seg id="61">Space shrinks and stretches, freeing itself from these black holes oscillating in the universe.</seg>
        <seg id="62">And they travel through space at the speed of light.</seg>
        <seg id="63">This computer simulation was done by Goddard's group at NASA studying relativity.</seg>
        <seg id="64">For almost 30 years, scientists around the world have fought over this problem.</seg>
        <seg id="65">It was one of the groups.</seg>
        <seg id="66">You see two black holes spinning around each other  ⁇  and again here the curves are clearly depicted.</seg>
        <seg id="67">If you see - a little pale turned out - they emit red waves, gravitational waves.</seg>
        <seg id="68">These are the sounds of vibrating space, and they will come from these black holes at the speed of light, as long as they subside and merge into one rotating, silent black hole  ⁇  that is the outcome.</seg>
        <seg id="69">If you were standing close enough, your ear would resonate as you squeeze and stretch space.</seg>
        <seg id="70">You would actually hear the sound.</seg>
        <seg id="71">Of course, and your head would shrink and stretch, so you would be hard pressed to understand what is going on.</seg>
        <seg id="72">But I would like to lose you that sound, as we predict it.</seg>
        <seg id="73">This is the work of my group, so the schedule here is more modest.</seg>
        <seg id="74">Imagine a light black hole falling into a very heavy one.</seg>
        <seg id="75">The sound you hear is emitted by a light hole, bending the space, approaching step by step towards the end.</seg>
        <seg id="76">If it is removed, the sound becomes quieter.</seg>
        <seg id="77">But it is like a hammer  ⁇ hitting ⁇  into space that vibrates like a membrane.</seg>
        <seg id="78">And we can predict what that sound will be like.</seg>
        <seg id="79">We know that as the hole sinks, it gets faster and louder.</seg>
        <seg id="80">In the end we will hear how a small hole just falls into a big one.</seg>
        <seg id="81">I haven't heard the record so loud yet - really, quite impressive.</seg>
        <seg id="82">At home it turns out to be much more modest.</seg>
        <seg id="83">Just quiet clicks.</seg>
        <seg id="84">It's a different sound created by my band.</seg>
        <seg id="85">Here I don't show you a picture, as black holes leave no visible marks, there are no visible curves in space.</seg>
        <seg id="86">If you went on a space cruise and heard that sound, I would recommend flying away as soon as possible.</seg>
        <seg id="87">(Laughter) Away from that sound.</seg>
        <seg id="88">Both black holes move.</seg>
        <seg id="89">They approach each other.</seg>
        <seg id="90">In this case, they are both very hesitant.</seg>
        <seg id="91">And now there will be a merger.</seg>
        <seg id="92">This "scratching" is very typical of merging black holes, this is the acceleration at the end.</seg>
        <seg id="93">We assume that would sound like that.</seg>
        <seg id="94">Fortunately, we are now at a safe distance, in Long Beach in California.</seg>
        <seg id="95">Undoubtedly, somewhere in the universe two black holes merge.</seg>
        <seg id="96">And no doubt the space around us is vibrating, and these oscillations may have passed millions of light years, that is, a million years moving towards us at the speed of light.</seg>
        <seg id="97">But the sound is too quiet, we can't hear it.</seg>
        <seg id="98">There is today a very complex project: LIGO (Laser-Interferometric Gravitational-wave Observatory) - it tracks deviations in the oscillations of space, the smallest - by the size of the nucleus of an atom by 4 kilometers.</seg>
        <seg id="99">This is an extremely ambitious experiment, and over the next few years it will focus on capturing such waves.</seg>
        <seg id="100">There is also a space programme planned, which I hope will be launched in the next 10 years: LIKA (Laser Interferometric Space Antenna).</seg>
        <seg id="101">It will be able to see super-heavy black holes, millions and billions of times more massive than the Sun.</seg>
        <seg id="102">In this Hubble Space Telescope image, we see two galaxies.</seg>
        <seg id="103">They look as if they were frozen in some kind of  ⁇ embrace, ⁇</seg>
        <seg id="104">and each probably contains a super-heavy black hole in its core.</seg>
        <seg id="105">But they have not frozen. In fact, they are merging.</seg>
        <seg id="106">These two black holes collide, and it will last for more than a billion years.</seg>
        <seg id="107">It is beyond our perception to hear a song of such duration.</seg>
        <seg id="108">But the lick may see the finale of a merger of two super-heavy black holes that began very long ago: the last 15 minutes of this action.</seg>
        <seg id="109">We are not only talking about black holes, but also about any serious mess in the universe, and the most important of them is the Big Bang.</seg>
        <seg id="110">When this expression was coined, it was ironic - "say, who will believe in the Big Bang?"</seg>
        <seg id="111">This animation from my friend from Proton Studios shows the Big Bang from the outside.</seg>
        <seg id="112">Any observer would like to be inside at this moment, because it is impossible to be outside the universe.</seg>
        <seg id="113">Imagine you're inside the Big Bang.</seg>
        <seg id="114">It is everywhere around you, and space vibrates chaotically.</seg>
        <seg id="115">14 billion years have passed, and this song still sounds around us.</seg>
        <seg id="116">Galaxies are born, and generations of stellar forms are born in them. And around one star, at least one, there is an inhabited planet.</seg>
        <seg id="117">And here we are persistently conducting these experiments, doing calculations, writing programs.</seg>
        <seg id="118">Imagine a billion years ago two black holes collided.</seg>
        <seg id="119">All the while, their song sounds in space.</seg>
        <seg id="120">We haven't even come to light yet.</seg>
        <seg id="121">The sound is getting closer and closer  ⁇  40,000 years ago, we are still making rock drawings.</seg>
        <seg id="122">If we were going to "hear" the Big Bang, it would sound like this.</seg>
        <seg id="123">Noise in its purest form.</seg>
        <seg id="124">It's white noise, just chaotic sounds.</seg>
        <seg id="125">But it probably surrounds us everywhere, unless it has been silenced by some other process in the universe.</seg>
        <seg id="126">And if we catch it, it will be the most pleasant music for us, because it is a quiet echo of the moment of our creation, the birth of the observable universe.</seg>
        <seg id="127">Over the next few years, we'll be able to add a bit of volume, and hear the universe in sound.</seg>
        <seg id="128">But if we catch echoes of those early events, it will bring us much closer to understanding the Big Bang, and it will already allow us to ask some of the most difficult, elusive questions.</seg>
        <seg id="129">Scrolling back and forth through the film about our universe, we learn that there was a Big Bang in the past, and maybe we'll even hear its cacophony, but was this explosion the only one?</seg>
        <seg id="130">I mean, hasn't it happened before?</seg>
        <seg id="131">Will it not happen again?</seg>
        <seg id="132">In the spirit of TED calling us to give back our faith in miracles, we can now ask questions that have always eluded us.</seg>
        <seg id="133">But we have to ask: is it possible that our universe is just a trace of some more significant history?</seg>

        <seg id="19">It was Einstein's great general theory of relativity.</seg>
        <seg id="20">Even light is bent along such a path.</seg>

        <seg id="49">It would be useless to start the engines and try to get out, because nothing, including light, can escape it.</seg>
        <seg id="50">Although the black hole looks like it is on the outside, it is not dark inside as all the light falls into it with us.</seg>
        <seg id="51">According to the relativistic effect known as the stretching of time, our clock would seem to have slowed down relative to general galactic time, but we would instead have seen the evolution of the galaxy in accelerated mode a moment before its death inside the black hole.</seg>
        <seg id="52">It would be like a near-death experience, where you see the light at the end of the tunnel, but not "about," but absolutely mortal.</seg>
        <seg id="53">(Laughter) And you won't tell anyone about the light at the end of the tunnel.</seg>
        <seg id="54">Scientists have not yet been able to see the shadow of the black hole, but we can hear it, albeit invisible.</seg>
        <seg id="55">Imagine a real astrophysical situation - two black holes that lived together for a long time.</seg>
        <seg id="56">They may have been stars at first and then turned into black holes, each 10 times heavier than the Sun.</seg>
        <seg id="57">We will compress them to 60 km in diameter.</seg>
        <seg id="58">They can spin fast: hundreds of revolutions per second.</seg>
        <seg id="59">At the end of their life cycle, they spin around each other almost at the speed of light.</seg>
        <seg id="60">They cover thousands of kilometers in a fraction of a second, and not only distort space in this way, but also leave behind a trace: they cause vibrations, a wave trace in spacetime.</seg>
        <seg id="61">Space shrinks and stretches, freeing itself from these black holes swaying in the universe.</seg>
        <seg id="62">And they travel through space at the speed of light.</seg>
        <seg id="63">This computer simulation was done by the Goddard group at NASA studying the theory of relativity.</seg>
        <seg id="64">For almost 30 years, scientists around the world have struggled with this problem.</seg>
        <seg id="65">It was one of the groups.</seg>
        <seg id="66">You see two black holes spinning around each other - and again, the curves are clearly depicted here.</seg>
        <seg id="67">If you see - a little pale - they emit red waves, gravitational waves.</seg>
        <seg id="68">These are the sounds of vibrating space, and they will come from these black holes at the speed of light as they subside and merge into one rotating, quiet black hole - that's the outcome.</seg>
        <seg id="69">If you stood close enough, your ear would resonate as space shrinks and stretches.</seg>
        <seg id="70">You would actually hear the sound.</seg>
        <seg id="71">Of course, your head would also shrink and stretch, so it would be difficult for you to understand what was going on.</seg>
        <seg id="72">But I would like to play that sound to you as we predict it.</seg>
        <seg id="73">This is the work of my group, so the schedule here is more modest.</seg>
        <seg id="74">Imagine a light black hole falling into a very heavy one.</seg>
        <seg id="75">The sound you hear emits a light hole, bending the space, approaching the end step by step.</seg>
        <seg id="76">If it is removed, the sound becomes quieter.</seg>
        <seg id="77">But it is like a hammer "hitting" a space that vibrates like a membrane.</seg>
        <seg id="78">And we can predict what that sound will be like.</seg>
        <seg id="79">We know that as the hole absorbs, it gets faster and louder.</seg>
        <seg id="80">At the end, we will hear a small hole just falling into a big one.</seg>
        <seg id="81">I haven't heard the record so loud yet - really, quite impressive.</seg>
        <seg id="82">At home, it turns out much more modest.</seg>
        <seg id="83">Just quiet clicks.</seg>
        <seg id="84">It's a different sound created by my band.</seg>
        <seg id="85">Here I am not showing you a picture, since the black holes leave no visible traces behind them, there are no visible curves in space.</seg>
        <seg id="86">If you went on a space cruise and heard such a sound, I would recommend flying away quickly.</seg>
        <seg id="87">(Laughter) Away from that sound.</seg>
        <seg id="88">Both black holes are moving.</seg>
        <seg id="89">They are getting closer to each other.</seg>
        <seg id="90">In this case, they are both very hesitant.</seg>
        <seg id="91">And now there will be a merger.</seg>
        <seg id="92">This "chirping" is very characteristic of merging black holes, this is the acceleration at the end.</seg>
        <seg id="93">We assume that it would sound like that.</seg>
        <seg id="94">Fortunately, we are now at a safe distance, in Long Beach, California.</seg>
        <seg id="95">Undoubtedly, somewhere in the universe, two black holes are merging.</seg>
        <seg id="96">And without a doubt, the space around us is vibrating, and these vibrations may have passed millions of light years, that is, a million years have moved towards us at the speed of light.</seg>
        <seg id="97">But the sound is too quiet, we cannot hear it.</seg>
        <seg id="98">Today, there is a very complex project: LIGO (Laser Interferometric Gravitational-Wave Observatory) - it tracks deviations in space fluctuations, the smallest - by the size of the atomic nucleus at 4 kilometers.</seg>
        <seg id="99">This is an extremely ambitious experiment, and over the next few years it will be dedicated to capturing such waves.</seg>
        <seg id="100">There is also a planned space programme, which I hope will be launched in the next 10 years: LIKA (Laser Interferometric Space Antenna).</seg>
        <seg id="101">It will be able to see super heavy black holes, millions and billions of times more massive than the Sun.</seg>
        <seg id="102">In this image from the Hubble telescope, we see two galaxies.</seg>
        <seg id="103">They look as if they are frozen in a kind of "hug,"</seg>
        <seg id="104">and each of them probably contains a super heavy black hole in its core.</seg>
        <seg id="105">But they are not frozen. In fact, they are merging.</seg>
        <seg id="106">These two black holes collide, and it will last more than a billion years.</seg>
        <seg id="107">It is beyond our perception to hear a song of such length.</seg>
        <seg id="108">But LIKA can see the final merger of two super-heavy black holes, which began a long time ago: the last 15 minutes of this action.</seg>
        <seg id="109">We are talking not only about black holes, but also about any serious trouble in the universe, and the most important of them is the Big Bang.</seg>
        <seg id="110">When the phrase was invented, it was ironic - "who would believe in the Big Bang?"</seg>
        <seg id="111">This animation from my friend at Proton Studios shows the Big Bang from the outside.</seg>
        <seg id="112">Any observer would like to be inside at this moment, because it is impossible to be outside the universe.</seg>
        <seg id="113">Imagine you are inside the Big Bang.</seg>
        <seg id="114">It's all around you, and the space is chaotically vibrating.</seg>
        <seg id="115">Fourteen billion years have passed, and this song still sounds around us.</seg>
        <seg id="116">Galaxies are born, and there are generations of star forms in them, and there is an inhabited planet around one star, at least one.</seg>
        <seg id="117">And here we persistently carry out these experiments, make calculations, write programs.</seg>
        <seg id="118">Imagine - a billion years ago, two black holes collided.</seg>
        <seg id="119">All the while, their song sounds in space.</seg>
        <seg id="120">We have not even been born yet.</seg>
        <seg id="121">The sound is approaching, closer and closer - 40,000 years ago, we are still making rock paintings.</seg>
        <seg id="122">If we were going to "hear" the Big Bang, it would sound like this.</seg>
        <seg id="123">Noise in its purest form.</seg>
        <seg id="124">This is white noise, just chaotic sounds.</seg>
        <seg id="125">But it probably surrounds us everywhere, unless it has been drowned out by other processes in the universe.</seg>
        <seg id="126">And if we catch it, it will be the most pleasant music for us, because it is a quiet echo of the moment of our creation, the birth of the observable universe.</seg>
        <seg id="127">Over the next few years, we will be able to add a bit of volume and hear the universe in sound.</seg>
        <seg id="128">But if we catch the echoes of those early events, it will bring us much closer to understanding the Big Bang, and it will already allow us to ask some of the most difficult, elusive questions.</seg>
        <seg id="129">Scrolling backwards on a movie about our universe, we learn that there was a Big Bang in the past, and maybe we will even hear its cacophony, but was this the only explosion?</seg>
        <seg id="130">I mean - did it happen before that?</seg>
        <seg id="131">Will it not happen again?</seg>
        <seg id="132">In the spirit of TED urging us to regain faith in miracles, we can now ask questions that have always eluded us.</seg>
        <seg id="133">But we have to ask: is it possible that our universe is just a trace of some more significant history?</seg>
        <seg id="134">Or - aren't we just one of the branches of the multiverse - each of which has had its own Big Bang in the past? Maybe, with black holes and their "songs," or without them, maybe with intelligent life, or perhaps without - they are not in our past, not in our future, but in some way connected to us?</seg>
        <seg id="135">We will ask - in such a multiverse, in its other branches, is there life there?</seg>
        <seg id="136">Here are my brethren in the multiverse.</seg>
        <seg id="137">But are there other creatures out there who think about us and their origins?</seg>
        <seg id="138">And, if they are, I can imagine them, making calculations like us, building instruments, trying to detect that faint sound of the moment of their creation, and thinking - who else is there but us?</seg>
        <seg id="139">Thank you. Thank you.</seg>
        <seg id="140">(Applause)</seg>

        <seg id="2">Глава Российской федерации баскетбола (РФБ) Андрей Кириленко поделился воспоминаниями о своих играх против легендарных Коби Брайанта и Майкла Джордана в матчах Национальной баскетбольной ассоциации (НБА).</seg>
        <seg id="3">Я знал, что самолюбие Брайанта нельзя задевать каким-нибудь треш-током, чтобы не стимулировать его спортивную злость.</seg>
        <seg id="4">У Коби был инстинкт убийцы, поэтому на площадке я старался его заговорить так, чтобы он не воспринимал игру в агрессивном ключе.</seg>
        <seg id="5">На площадке я дарил ему комплименты: "О!</seg>
        <seg id="6">Коби, хорошо забил, отличный проход!</seg>
        <seg id="7">Слушая мои восторженные отклики, он чуть-чуть забывал о том, что надо лишний раз взять в руки мяч и набрать еще 3 - 4 очка.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Мы хорошо общались с Коби", - приводит слова Кириленко "Вечерняя Москва".</seg>
        <seg id="9">Он также рассказал о своей первой игре против Джордана.</seg>
        <seg id="10">"Я опекал его.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Первые три минуты матча я бегал в полном восхищении от того, что рядом со мной легенда, которую видел только по телевизору.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Пока у меня от радости в зобу дыханье сперло, Майкл набрал много очков.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Вскоре я отошел от восторгов, пару раз накрыл его броски...</seg>
        <seg id="14">В той игре моя команда победила, а Джордан все равно набрал 44 очка", - добавил глава РФБ.</seg>
        <seg id="15">В НБА Кириленко провел 12 сезонов.</seg>
        <seg id="16">Он был выбран клубом "Юта Джаз" на драфте 1999 года под общим 24-м номером.</seg>
        <seg id="17">Помимо "Юты", за которую он провел десять сезонов, российский форвард выступал за "Миннесота Тимбервулвз" и "Бруклин Нетс".</seg>
        <seg id="18">В общей сложности на его счету 797 матчей, в которых он в среднем набирал 11,8 очка, выполнял 5,5 подбора, 2,7 ассиста и 1,8 блок-шота.</seg>
        <seg id="19">Ранее сообщалось, что Кириленко выдвинет свою кандидатуру на выборы главы РФБ.</seg>

        <seg id="2">Временно исполняющий обязанности губернатора Хабаровского края Михаил Дегтярев в воскресенье, 26 июля, в ходе встречи с жителями Советской Гавани удивился тому, что регион закупает сахалинский газ, добывающийся американской компанией Exxon Neftegas, за доллары.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Американский газ законтрактован в долларах до 2025 года.</seg>
        <seg id="4">"Честно скажу, я этого не знал, и я нахожусь в таком нокдауне из-за этой информации.</seg>
        <seg id="5">У меня не было даже представления, что такое еще возможно в 2020 году в России", ― цитирует его "РИА Новости".</seg>
        <seg id="6">Дегтярев отметил, что этот вопрос обсуждался с главой Минэнерго России Александром Новаком в ходе его визита в Хабаровск 24 июля.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Также врио губернатора подчеркнул, что к 2025 году "Газпром" переходит на снабжение российских ТЭЦ и мощностей, что означает, что будет использоваться российский газ, закупаемый в рублях "по нормальным ценам".</seg>
        <seg id="8">Проект "Сахалин-1" реализуется посредством соглашения о разделе продукции, где оператором проекта с долей 30% выступает Exxon Neftegas Ltd, еще 20% у "Роснефти", у японской Sodeco ― 30% и у индийской ONGC ― 20%.</seg>

        <seg id="2">Актер российского сериала "Чики", создателей которого обвинили в "пропаганде ЛГБТ и феминизма", ответил на претензии к фильму.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Авторы "понимали остроту поднимаемых тем и не хотели никого оскорбить", заявил американец Стивен Томас Окснер в беседе с изданием "Подъем".</seg>
        <seg id="4">"Мне кажется, что это история про силу и общие аспекты человеческой жизни.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Это никак не связано с ЛГБТ и феминизмом", - сказал актер, сыгравший отца мальчика, который переодевался в женскую одежду.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Он подчеркнул, что "гордится работой" и не считает ее пропагандой.</seg>
        <seg id="7">В то же время, добавил американец, его пугает реакция некоторых людей на сюжетную линию сериала: к примеру, был случай, когда "человек в глубоком запое расстрелял съемочную площадку и сказал, что все это неправда".</seg>
        <seg id="8">"Потом пара случаев была, когда мы встречали недовольных местных, которые не понимали, чем мы занимаемся.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Но мы были открыты, поэтому люди, которые сначала приходили с претензиями, начинали помогать нам", - подытожил он.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Случай с расстрелом, поясняет издание, произошел в сентябре 2019 года в Кабардино-Балкарии: пьяный мужчина напал на автомобиль съемочной группы с оружием, после чего его задержали сотрудники полиции.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Ранее сообщалось, что общественный уполномоченный по защите семьи Ольга Баранец направила жалобу в МВД и Роскомнадзор на сервис more.tv, разместивший российский сериал "Чики".</seg>
        <seg id="12">Баранец обвинила создателей сериала в "пропаганде нетрадиционных сексуальных отношений и феминизма", обратив внимание на то, что главные героини фильма работают проститутками, а сам сериал содержит "сцены физического и психологического насилия".</seg>
        <seg id="13">Также омбудсмена возмутило то, что "в сериале уделено много внимания гомосексуальной половой ориентации" несовершеннолетнего персонажа.</seg>

        <seg id="9">But we were open, so the people who initially came with complaints started helping us”, he concluded.</seg>

        <seg id="2">Российская певица Полина Гагарина назвала пять продуктов, которые помогли ей скорректировать фигуру и впоследствии не набирать вес снова.</seg>
        <seg id="3">Первой в списке оказалась вода.</seg>
        <seg id="4">Певица предпочитает пить чистую негазированную воду перед каждым пищи, чтобы притупить чувство голода и меньше съесть.</seg>
        <seg id="5">Также для поддержания стройности идеально подойдут овощной салат, бурый рис и морепродукты.</seg>
        <seg id="6">Благодаря им можно составить сбалансированный рацион питания: в овощах содержится клетчатка, в рисе есть сложные углеводы, а морепродукты являются источником белка, полезных витаминов и аминокислот.</seg>
        <seg id="7">Для разгрузочных дней певица выбирает яблоки.</seg>
        <seg id="8">Благодаря этим продуктам Гагарина смогла избавиться от 30 лишних килограммов.</seg>
        <seg id="9">Кроме того, певица перешла на дробное питание - ест часто и понемногу и исключила из рациона жирное, сладкое и калорийное.</seg>
        <seg id="10">Гагарина не ест жареную пищу, выпечку, колбасные изделия и другие мясные полуфабрикаты, пишет kp.ru 26 июля.</seg>
        <seg id="11">Также она заменила рыбой и морепродуктами красное мясо.</seg>
        <seg id="12">Предпочитает овощи (кроме картошки), цельнозерновые злаки и много зелени.</seg>
        <seg id="13">Также Гагарина активно занимается в тренажерном зале, йогой и бегом.</seg>
        <seg id="14">Ранее российский певец Сергей Лазарев рассказал, как смог сбросить набранный за период самоизоляции лишний вес.</seg>
